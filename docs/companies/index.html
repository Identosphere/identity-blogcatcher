   Discover how the T-Mobile team creates a more seamless work management system for its content supply chain with Adobe and IBM Consulting.

<p>With 109 million customers and counting, “uncarrier” T-Mobile is one of the top mobile communications providers in the U.S. The company always puts the customer first, which it achieves by delivering the right experiences and content to the right customers at the right time. But with different sub-brands and business units, T-Mobile’s marketing and content workflows were complex—and often inefficient and disconnected.</p>



 Executive visibility is key for T-Mobile 



<p>To ensure the best customer experience, T-Mobile’s C-suite participates in all overarching marketing strategy and marketing campaign decisions. However, when critical decisions were pending, manual workflows and disjointed tools made it nearly impossible for senior leadership to see everything in one system or retrieve information efficiently.</p>



<p>The marketing operations team knew they needed to create a more seamless work management system to support its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/content-supply-chain">content supply chain</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
“We realized leadership didn’t have the right information at their fingertips to make decisions in the moment. We knew we needed to pull together a leadership dashboard to show all of the given campaigns in real-time.” 
Ilona Yeremova, Head of Marketing Tools, Operations and Analytics Team, T-Mobile</blockquote>



<p>Like many other large companies with complex marketing organizations, T-Mobile turned to <a href="https://business.adobe.com/products/workfront/main.html">Adobe Workfront</a> to streamline its content supply chain, help connect teams, plan and prioritize content creation, ensure compliance, and manage assets and customer data.</p>



 Scaling Adobe Workfront activation throughout the organization 



<p>T-Mobile started implementing Adobe Workfront on the creative side of the house. One of its 25 groups, T-Studios, was using Workfront, but it was siloed from the other 24 groups. “We quickly realized that work management has to happen centrally within the organization. Data has to connect, people need to connect and collaborate, and we need to start talking in the same language,” Yeremova said.</p>



<p>T-Mobile did an inventory of the things they really wanted to accomplish with customer-focused content marketing efforts, and evaluated how they could orchestrate a seamless customer journey across the platform in a way that would aid in that delivery. They started with the customer in mind and then walked it back to the technology, applications, and processes. The key questions they asked themselves were:</p>



 
 What are those journeys we’re trying to orchestrate? 



 How are we trying to talk to those customers? 



 What are the trigger points? 



 How does that all come to life in a connected way in Adobe Workfront? 
 



<p>When T-Mobile first started using Adobe Workfront five years ago, it was a basic project management system for 60 employees. Today, it is regarded internally as a transformational business technology used by 6000+ employees as part of a content marketing strategy to achieve business objectives. Overall, T-Mobile has realized a <a href="https://business.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/tmobile-workfront-case-study.html">47% increase</a> in its productivity on the marketing side since optimizing Adobe Workfront, without adding any additional headcount.</p>



 IBM helps unlock more value from Adobe Workfront 



<p>Once T-Mobile achieved a more mature state with Adobe Workfront, they wanted to better understand the ROI realized with Adobe Workfront and how to connect with other platforms. That’s when T-Mobile turned to IBM.</p>



<p>“IBM, a primary partner for content supply chain strategy and enablement, helped augment the T-Mobile team in a very seamless way,” said Yeremova. “[They are helping us] accelerate the onboarding of teams and connecting platforms.”</p>



<p>IBM drove <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/change-management">change management</a> for several departments, including the Technology Customer Experience (TCX) and Career Development teams, two of the largest groups at T-Mobile, both of whom were previously operating in Smartsheets.</p>



<p>“[We brought in IBM as an] outside party for change management because internally there’s just so much passion and inertia and you’ve got to take the passion out of it,” Yeremova said.</p>



<p>In addition to change management, IBM conducted a <a href="https://business.adobe.com/summit/2024/sessions/tmobile-making-the-call-with-intelligent-content-s-s736.html">Value Realization</a> assessment of Workfront for the two groups and found that the career development team realized a 90% decrease in time spent manually setting up and managing projects and 93% decrease in time creating or managing reports. The TCX team saved 11 hours a week by eliminating unnecessary meetings and improving automated workflows. T-Mobile now has all 25 marketing groups operating in Workfront, an effort for which IBM has onboarded and assisted with configurations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yeremova says, “It’s all iterative. Tomorrow is going to be different than today. T-Mobile now has a fairly robust environment that is Adobe-centric, and everything is integrated within the platform.”</p>



 Looking forward to an AI-powered future 



<p>T-Mobile strongly believes that creating the right guardrails and building a strong foundation with Adobe Workfront has helped them prepare for the innovation that is happening today, as well as the AI-powered future of tomorrow.</p>



<blockquote>
“We are very diligent about governing the platform we have. And it’s critical for us to have clean data in the system.”
Ilona Yeremova, Head of Marketing Tools, Operations and Analytics Team, T-Mobile.</blockquote>



<p>As her team ingests data, they are constantly studying it and verifying it – because if your data is stale, nothing else will be accurate.</p>



<p>T-Mobile is currently focused onunifying taxonomies across the enterprise. Yeremova says, “The team did a lot of work and [the creative taxonomies] are like an A plus now – but next up, we’re focused on unifying taxonomies in the whole marketing organization and then even looking upwards to the enterprise.”</p>



<p>The combination of a mature work management strategy and a focus on change management, governance, and clean data sets T-Mobile up nicely to supercharge Workfront with new features and generative AI capabilities. “If you’re not onboard with AI, you’ll be left behind,” Yeremova says. IBM is currently helping T-Mobile evaluate different use cases where they can leverage generative AI, like enabling sales reps to make recommendations more quickly to customers in its more than 6,000+ retail stores.</p>



<p>“We’re going to be much quicker at doing things and it’s exciting to envision that future where folks are happy doing more of the purposeful work and less of the manual busy work,” Yeremova said. “I watch how much administrative stuff that my team does, and I know that there’s a better way to do it. If we can have GenAI technologies like IBM® <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx™</a> do some of those repetitive, mundane tasks for us, I bet we’ll incrementally gain that benefit of more meaningful work. My team is small but mighty and we are incredibly lucky to have partnership from our Adobe and IBM teams.”</p>

<p>In today’s fast-evolving financial landscape where customer expectations and technological advancements are constantly shifting, financial institutions must stay ahead of the curve to remain competitive. One crucial step in this pursuit is a comprehensive review of your current technology setup while exploring what’s currently available in the market.</p>
 The Importance of Reviewing Your Technology Setup 
<p>For financial institutions using inferior instant issuance solutions, as highlighted in the new Juniper Research report, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.juniperresearch.com%2Fresearch%2Ffintech-payments%2Fbanking%2Fmodern-card-issuing-platforms-market-research%2F%3Futm_campaign%3Dpr1_moderncard_financial_fintech_jun24%26utm_source%3Dbusinesswire%26utm_medium%3Dpr&amp;esheet=54023271&amp;newsitemid=20240602845962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Global+Modern+Card+Issuing+Platforms+Market+2024-2029&amp;index=2&amp;md5=046553e5a086e9363699a2357b6e55c6">Global Modern Card Issuing Platforms Market 2024-2029</a>, card issuers are predicted to face rising competition to remain top-of-wallet with customers and members. This emphasizes the need to reevaluate your financial institution technology setup, particularly concerning instant issuance.</p>
 Why Instant Issuance Matters 
<p>Among the advancements to consider is your instant issuance portfolio, which empowers you to provide your customers with immediate access to banking services by issuing cards directly at your branches or other locations. Let’s explore why it’s critical to reevaluate your technology setup, especially with regard to instant issuance.</p>
 For Financial Institutions Not Yet Using Instant Issuance 
<p>In the February 2024 PaymentsJournal podcast episode, “<a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/adopting-instant-issuance-programs-give-fis-a-competitive-edge/">Adopting Instant Issuance Programs Give FIs a Competitive Edge</a>,” Brian Riley, Director of Credit and Co-Head of Payments at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, pointed out how instant financial card issuance helps build customer relationships.</p>
<p>“That card really reinforces the brand,” Riley said. “Getting into instant issuance is important because you’re really at the height of the relationship.”</p>
<p>If your financial institution hasn’t implemented instant issuance yet, you’re missing a significant opportunity to elevate your offerings. Here’s what you’re leaving on the table:</p>
 
 Enhanced Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty: With instant issuance, customers receive fully functional, ready-to-use cards in minutes, drastically reducing their waiting time and immediately addressing their banking needs. 
 Competitive Differentiation: Offering instant issuance helps differentiate your institution from competitors, providing an innovative, value-added service that attracts new customers and retains existing ones. 
 Operational Efficiency: Issuing cards instantly simplifies workflows, reduces operational costs, and increases productivity across branches. 
 
 Challenges With Substandard Instant Issuance Solutions 
<p>If you’re already leveraging instant issuance but rely on a solution that leaves your team struggling with substandard machines, disappointing card quality, or lackluster customer service, it’s time to reconsider your options.</p>
 What to Look for in a New Solution and How Entrust Can Help 
<p>A proactive approach to reviewing your current financial institution technology setup and exploring new market options can support your institution’s long-term success.

<p>Last week, SpruceID attended the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) in Berlin, an event that brings together industry leaders, innovators, and experts to discuss and explore the latest advancements in digital identity and cloud security.</p><p>This year, SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang was among the panelists contributing to three in-depth discussions on the evolving landscape of decentralized identity. These panels provided a comprehensive overview of how decentralized identity can help mitigate modern threats and enhance trust in digital ecosystems in today’s world.</p> Panel: Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>One of our most anticipated sessions was the panel "Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity." This session focused on the pressing issues posed by AI technologies and brought together Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and Linda Jeng, founder of Digital Self Labs.</p><p>In this talk, Wayne highlighted the increasing risks of traditional identification methods in the face of sophisticated AI technologies. He pointed out, “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech, you can fool these systems — this is already showing up at the edges. ” He emphasized the rise in phishing attacks utilizing AI-generated voices that can convincingly mimic trusted individuals, making it easier for scammers to deceive victims.</p><p>The panelists discussed how decentralized identity could offer solutions to these emerging challenges. Wayne explained, “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed decentralized identity into comms channels to prove I’m real.” Decentralized identity is not only about identity but also about establishing data governance and creating chains of trust to mitigate risks from synthetic data. This approach empowers individuals with greater control over their data.</p><p>They touched on the promising developments in automated compliance with data regulations and the potential for expanding trust to content authenticity. They emphasized the need for ongoing education and the role of user demand in driving the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. In Linda Jeng’s words, “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end, it comes down to end-user demand for solutions.”</p><p>Read more about the discussions that took place during this panel in the blog post published by the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/building-trust-in-ai-through-decentralized-identity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p> Panel: Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>In the Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A session, Anil John, Technical Director of the DHS S&amp;T Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, introduced the newest cohort members of SVIP, including SpruceID. Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, engaged in a Q&amp;A with digital wallet solution providers and industry experts from other SVIP cohort members, including Hushmesh, Procivis AG, Ubiqu, Netis, and Credence ID. The discussion focused on the practical aspects of integrating digital identity into digital wallets and verifiable credential systems. It covered a range of topics, including the challenges and opportunities in implementing decentralized identity, the role of verifiers in ensuring trust and security, and the potential for digital wallets to enhance user privacy and data control.&nbsp;</p><p>Panelists emphasized the importance of interoperability and user-centered design in developing digital wallet solutions, which are crucial for securely and conveniently managing digital identities and credentials.</p> Panel: Decentralized Identity in Production <p>Our final panel, "Decentralized Identity in Production," explored the practical applications of verifiable credentials and the integration of decentralized identity into production environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne, along with panelists from Condatis, Adobe, Spherity, and Accenture, shared valuable insights and experiences on the business case for decentralized identity, highlighting key success factors and lessons learned from recent projects and discussing how verifiable credentials have been effectively integrated into workforce certifications, supply chain documentation, and educational qualifications, demonstrating enhanced trust achieved through decentralized identity. </p><p>The panelists emphasized key success factors in project learnings, product roadmaps, and the future direction of decentralized identity, and they encouraged attendees to explore practical applications for decentralized identity technologies within their organizations.</p> Continuing the Conversations on Decentralized Identity <p>We're grateful to have been invited to speak on several panels alongside other experts in the field at this year's event. </p><p>SpruceID is excited to be at the forefront of these important discussions and committed to advancing the development and adoption of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to continuing these discussions and working with partners and stakeholders from EIC!</p><p>Check out our website to learn more about how SpruceID uses decentralized identity to build a more secure and trustworthy digital future.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unified Identity and Access Management (IAM) has emerged as a critical solution to these issues. A unified IAM strategy integrates various identity and access management functions, such as identity verification, identity governance and administration (IGA), identity management (IDM), access management (AM), identity orchestration, and fraud and risk solutions into a single platform. As a result, unified IAM streamlines identity processes across multiple healthcare IT systems, applications, and environments. </p>

				  When it comes to phishing, financial institutions and their customers are targeted <a href="https://www.stationx.net/phishing-statistics/">more often than others</a>. Digital credentials solve this problem and provide customers with a better user experience when logging into their bank accounts.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Phishing is where someone pretends to be from an organization you know and requests information from you that allows them to steal your login data. This might be in the form of an email requesting that you reset your password, a text message, or even a phone call.</p>
<p>Phishing is on the rise because it works: <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/the-history-of-phishing/">22% of data breaches</a> can be attributed to phishing.</p>
<p>Phishing in finance</p>
<p>In finance, phishing often involves someone pretending to be a customer trying to retrieve their account details by contacting their bank. Bank call centers receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">thousands of deepfake calls per year</a>, wasting time and resources, and requiring vigilance on the part of the employee to spot the scams and stop the call. As deepfake technology becomes more dynamic this will be much harder for a human to do.</p>
<p>The other common vector for phishing attacks is that of a scammer pretending to be a bank. Financial institutions are the <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/list/4-things-bankers-need-to-know-about-phishing">most impersonated organizations</a> by scammers. These attacks often come via an email, text, or even a call from the bank saying that there is something wrong with the customer’s account and they need to log in immediately. Unfortunately, the link provided by the scammer will steal the personal account information of the customer when they try to use it.</p>
<p>Stop phishing with verifiable credentials and decentralized identity</p>
<p>The reason phishing works is because there is currently not a good way for identifying who people claim to be online. Passwords and logins are prone to being lost, stolen, or copied, and even assuming they are secure, they are only effective in one direction — when the customer is trying to reach out to the bank. If a bank, or someone pretending to be the bank, tries to reach out to the customer, due diligence is required on the customer’s part to make sure the message is authentic.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity solves this problem. A bank can be absolutely certain that an account holder really is an account holder, and an account holder can be absolutely certain that they are interacting with their bank —&nbsp;and this mutually assured authentication is proven instantaneously by cryptography, and occurs before any information is shared.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>A bank customer’s digital wallet software is able to create a secure communications channel directly with their bank. The customer’s wallet creates a decentralized identifier (a DID) and uses this DID to connect to their bank’s DID. DIDs enable public key cryptography.</p>
<p>Each party uses the other party’s cryptographic keys to send encrypted messages to each other. Only the bank can decrypt the message sent by the customer because the customer has encrypted a message with the bank’s key; only the customer can decrypt the bank’s message because the bank has used the customer’s key to encrypt its message.</p>
<p>In reality, this is instantaneous. But it means that when a customer uses a DID to connect to their bank and then presents a verifiable credential for their bank account, the bank knows its their customer. It is more effective than adding multi factor authentication because it doesn’t require customers to jump through hoops, allows both parties to verify who they are interacting with, and even enables <a href="https://indicio.tech/passwordless-login-will-soon-be-the-norm-for-bank-accounts-financial-institutions/">passwordless login</a> by default.</p>
<p>To learn more about how this all works you can <a href="https://youtu.be/DE2gFx-msuE">see demonstrations of the technology in action</a>.</p>

<blockquote>“We appreciate the patience of the community and look forward to a combined $ASI token that is supported by all partners, exchanges and token holders.”</blockquote><p>Zug and Singapore — June 11, 2024 — The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is dedicated to the successful and seamless integration of our anticipated token merger. SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol have today announced a revised date for the ASI token merger, moving from June 13, 2024, to July 15,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>This schedule adjustment is necessary to accommodate the logistical requirements and technical dependencies of exchanges, validators, and broader ecosystem collaborators. The preparation phase for the token merger involves managing complex integrations, careful coordination, and attention to numerous moving parts. These third-party dependencies are critical to the smooth execution of the token merger process and ensuring that all stakeholders’ needs are adequately met is paramount. While this delay is unfortunate, it is a strategic decision to ensure the token merger is carried out with the highest standards of accuracy and efficiency.</p><p>Token Merger Schedule:</p>  Originally, the plan was for FET to be renamed to ASI today, June 11, followed by the token merger on June&nbsp;13.  On July 15th, FET, AGIX and OCEAN will merge into the new ASI&nbsp;token.  <p>Token Merger&nbsp;Steps:</p>  Current Status: The existing FET, AGIX and OCEAN tokens will continue to trade on exchanges independently.  Future Steps: Once third-party integrations are finalized, the ASI token will be launched and FET, AGIX and OCEAN will cease to trade independently and merge to the ASI&nbsp;token.  <p>Support and Guidance:</p>  Support will be provided on the official FET, AGIX and Ocean channels as well as the ASI&nbsp;channel.  Token contracts, migration contracts and all possible audits will be shared this&nbsp;week.  <blockquote>“While the finalization of the ASI token merger is now scheduled for July due to necessary adjustments by our partners, the commitment and vision driving this alliance remain stronger than ever,” said Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai and chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. “This temporary delay does not impact the substantial progress we have made towards creating a decentralized superintelligence network. Our teams are actively working with centralized exchanges to finalize the remaining steps. We appreciate the continued support and patience of our community and stakeholders as we work through these final logistical steps.”</blockquote><blockquote>“While working through the complexities of executing this unprecedented tokenomic merger,” noted Ben Goertzel, founder and CEO of SingularityNET Foundation and CEO of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, “we have at the same time been advancing toward integration of our respective AI and blockchain technologies. The finalization of the 3-way tokenomic merger on July 15 will be a major milestone, and we anticipate a series of progressively more exciting milestones after that as we leverage our $ASI token based network to move toward increasingly capable AI systems and in time actual superintelligence.”</blockquote><blockquote>“We appreciate the patience of the community and look forward to a combined $ASI token that is supported by all partners, exchanges and token holders.” Added Bruce Pon, founder and CEO of Ocean Protocol and board director in the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;Council.</blockquote><p>Token holders are assured that no action is required on their part at this time. The ASI token merger remains firmly on track and no further delays are anticipated.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/artificial-superintelligence-alliance-announces-revised-timeline-for-token-merger-42d8bea9885e">Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Announces Revised Timeline for Token Merger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>One type of cloud architecture is not necessarily better than another. When deciding between single-tenant vs. multi-tenant architecture, your organization's specific needs should determine the deployment type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To demonstrate how these two architectures work, let’s consider the familiar experience of looking for a place to live. Specifically, let’s pretend you’re trying to decide whether to buy a home or rent a house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you like the layouts of apartment buildings you’ve toured, don’t mind sharing common walls, and think your life would be easier if things like maintenance, pest control, and landscaping were done for you, then having your own dedicated space as a tenant within a multi-tenant complex might be the right choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to customize your space, knock down walls, put in a new kitchen, fill your yard with apple trees, and enjoy the safety, security, and responsibility that come with maintaining and protecting your own domain, then a single-family home, where you’re the dedicated tenant, may be a better choice for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like someone searching for a place to call home, deciding between single-tenant and multi-tenant architecture requires considering what you want to do with the space once you move in. As you’ll learn below, the choice to go either way depends on a variety of factors.&nbsp;</p>

The level of assurance is an important aspect of trust frameworks, determining the trustworthiness of digital identities. The conversation highlights the economic value of digital identity, particularly in terms of cross-border transactions. The goal is to create independent wallets that allow users to have choice and control over their credentials.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-digital-identity-mothershaw"></a>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> is the computer’s brain, assigning and processing tasks and managing essential operational functions.</p>



<p>Computers have been so seamlessly integrated with modern life that sometimes we’re not even aware of how many CPUs are in use around the world. It’s a staggering amount—so many CPUs that a conclusive figure can only be approximated.</p>



 How many CPUs are now in use? 



<p>It’s been estimated that there may be as many as 200 billion CPU cores (or more) now running. As an example of what such a monumental number means from a different perspective, chip manufacturer <a href="https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-partners-are-shipping-more-than-900-arm-based-chips-per-second-based-on-latest-results">Ar</a>m claimed to have shipped 7.3 billion chips within a single quarter of 2020, or roughly 900 CPUs for each second of that entire quarter. (There are approximately 7.8 million seconds in 3 months.)</p>



<p>That leads to a stunning comparison. Projections by the US Census Bureau list the 2024 global population at around 8 billion people. If those 200 billion CPUs currently in existence were all distributed equitably by persons—and none were devoted to business, government or scientific applications—there would be exactly 25 CPUs serving as the brain of the computer for each human brain on the planet.</p>



<p>This prompts a key question: With so many CPUs in operation, how are they all being used?</p>



 Seven top CPU use cases 



<p>With CPUs, we’re talking about a very small processor chip, and yet there’s very little that this very little thing cannot do. A brief survey shows which industries depend the most heavily on CPUs:</p>



 Consumer electronics 



<p>Many of the world’s most profitable companies—such as Apple—make devices for the consumer electronics industry. The rampant demand for personal computing platforms (like smartphones, laptops and gaming consoles) has driven a massive and ongoing expansion of CPU use. Beyond that, household devices blessed with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> technology means that CPUs are now being incorporated into refrigerators, thermostats, security systems and more.</p>



 Data analytics 



<p>The goal of data analytics is to take raw data and refine it into an understandable narrative that addresses business goals. The first part of that process is assembling and cleaning the data. CPUs are instrumental to these activities, serving as the primary computer processing units. In addition, the high clock speeds achieved by CPUs make them perfectly suited to handle the type of rapid-fire scanning and retrieval of information that data analytics requires.</p>



 Defense and space 



<p>The CPU is the true backbone of modern defense systems. Any country that desires to be a global power must have modern computers as part of its security arsenal. Likewise, humankind’s achievements in space exploration could never have occurred without the CPU to handle the awesome computational challenges of calculating the distance and routes of space flights. Space poses a unique challenge for computers, which must be radiation-hardened to withstand powerful solar rays.</p>



 Financial services 



<p>Like data analytics, fintech companies depend on CPUs to enable the fast and efficient processing of huge amounts of financial-based information. By running advanced analyses on such data and then applying a range of different scenarios to that data, risk management systems that CPUs enable can help financial institutions reduce losses. CPUs also assist that effort in another key way—by helping flag oddities and detecting cases of fraud.</p>



 Healthcare 



<p>Nearly every type of industry benefits because of the fast speeds CPUs achieve, but none as importantly as healthcare, where lives literally hang in the balance and timing is a critical concern. Beyond the ability to quickly shuttle vital patient information between providers, CPUs can be used to help automate the ordering and tracking of prescriptions and other supplies. Computers can also both create pre-surgical 3D models of organs and help pathologists study illnesses.</p>



 Manufacturing 



<p>The use of semiconductors has radically changed manufacturing, synching the input of materials and improving quality control. Manufacturing is also being revolutionized by computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), where CPU-driven computer systems help run industrial production operations. CAM uses direct or indirect connections that exist between the CPU and production operations to schedule, control and manage manufacturing activity.</p>



 Telecom 



<p>The telecom industry offers its own bread-and-butter products—communication technology devices—but also assists other industries in important ways. Those use cases include enabling digital transactions (for the financial services industry) and assisting healthcare by supporting robotic surgeries with precision capabilities and data updates. In addition, CPUs are essential to operating autonomous vehicles, which rely on telecom signals for navigational guidance.</p>



 Key parts of the CPU 



<p>Modern CPUs typically contain the following components:</p>



 
 Arithmetic/logic unit (ALU): Executes arithmetic and logical operations, including math equations and logic-based comparisons. 



 Buses: Manages proper data transfer and data flow between components within a computer system. 



 Control unit: Uses intensive circuitry that controls the computer system by issuing a system of electrical pulses and instructs the system to execute high-level computer instructions. 



 Instruction registers and pointer: Shows location of next instruction set to be executed by the CPU. 



 Memory unit: Manages memory usage and data flow between RAM and the CPU. The main memory unit supervises the handling of the cache memory. 



 Registers: Provides built-in permanent memory for constant, repeated data needs that must be administered regularly, without exception. 
 



 Important CPU concepts 



<p>To be fully conversant in CPU terminology, it’s helpful to understand the following concepts:</p>



<p>Cache: Storage areas whose location allows users to quickly access data that’s been in recent use. Cache memory stores data in areas that are built into a CPU’s processor chip to reach data retrieval speeds even faster than random access memory (RAM).</p>



<p>Clock speed: The rate of activity per computer clock cycle. The internal clock built into computers regulates the speed and frequency of computer operations. The clock manages the CPU’s circuitry through the transmittal of electrical pulses. The delivery rate of pulses is called “clock speed.”</p>



<p>Core: The processor within the processor. Cores are processing units that read and execute various program instructions. Processors are classified according to how many cores are embedded into them; single-core, dual-core and quad-core processors are some of the examples. (The term “Intel Core” is used commercially to market Intel’s product line of multi-core CPUs.)</p>



<p><a>Threads:</a> The shortest sequences of programmable instructions that an operating system’s scheduler can manage and send to a CPU for processing. Through multithreading, the use of multiple threads running simultaneously, various computer processes can be run concurrently, supporting multitasking. (“Hyper-threading” is Intel’s proprietary term for its form of multithreading.)</p>



 Top CPU manufacturers and products 



<p>The two major companies battling for control of this ultra-lucrative marketplace are Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):</p>



 Intel 



<p>Markets processors and microprocessors through four product lines: Intel® Core® (high-end premium line), Intel® Xeon® (office and business use), Intel® Pentium® (personal computers and laptops), and Intel®Celeron® (low-end, low-cost personal computing use).</p>



<p>Obviously, different chips are best suited to certain applications. The Intel® Core i5-13400F is a good desktop processor that features 10 cores. But when it comes to a processing-intensive application like video editing, many users opt for the Intel® Core i7 14700KF 20-Core, 28-thread CPU.</p>



 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 



<p>Sells two types of processors and microprocessors: CPUs and APUs (which stands for accelerated processing units). APUs are CPUs that are equipped with proprietary Radeon® graphics. AMD® makes high-speed, high-performance Ryzen® processors for the video-game market. The AMD® Ryzen® 7 5800X3D, for example, features a 3D V-Cache technology that helps it push game graphics to new heights.</p>



<p>Athlon® processors used to be considered AMD’s high-end line, but AMD now uses it as a basic computing alternative.</p>



 Arm 



<p>Arm® doesn’t manufacture equipment, but instead leases out its valued processor designs and/or other proprietary technologies to other companies who do make equipment.</p>



<p>For general-purpose computing, such as running an operating system like Windows and using multimedia programs, most AMD Ryzen® or Intel® Core® processors can handle the workloads involved.</p>



 Ongoing CPU trends 



<p>Several tangential issues will continue to influence CPU development and the use cases for which they are utilized in coming years:</p>



<p>Increased use of GPUs: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/gpu">Graphics processing units (GPUs)</a> are an electronic circuit first developed for use in smartphone and video game consoles. Their use is about driving processing speeds, so in addition to accelerating graphics cards, GPUs are being used in processing-intensive pursuits like cryptocurrency mining and the training of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a>.</p>



<p>The drive to miniaturize: The history of computer hardware has been a quest to make computer processors smaller. Early computers required vast floor space and vacuum tubes. Then, CPUs became smaller and more efficient with the introduction of transistors. Later, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/computer-science#:">computer scientists</a> created a CPU called the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/microprocessors">microprocessor</a> that could be held within a small integrated circuit chip. The drive to make processors smaller will continue unabated as long as there are consumers and businesses who want more processing power and faster speed.</p>



<p>Peripheral proliferation: Peripheral devices help optimize and increase the functionality of computing. Peripherals can be attached to the outside of a computer and include devices like keyboards, mice, scanners and printers. Expect to see more peripherals created in response to ongoing customer demand.</p>



<p>Sustainability issues: Moving forward, matters of power consumption will become increasingly important. Companies will become more focused on energy-efficient solutions as energy costs rise. When CPU use increases on a grand scale—like in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperscale">hyperscale data centers</a>, with thousands of linked computers working around the clock, the energy used is often measured in gigahertz (GHz)—which is comparable to the entire energy consumption of villages or small towns.</p>



 Forecasting future CPU growth 



<p>In its <a href="https://www.yolegroup.com/product/report/status-of-the-processor-industry-2023/">2022–2028 processor revenue forecast</a>, analyst group Yole Intelligence calculated that the total processor market in 2022 was worth $154 billion. That total figure included the following processor segments and their respective worths:</p>



 
 Central processing units (CPUs): USD 65 billion 



 Application processing units (APUs): USD 61 billion 



 Graphics processing units (GPUs): USD 22 billion 



 SoC FPGA: USD 2.6 billion (SoC FPGA stands for “system-on-chip <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/field-programmable-gate-arrays">field programmable gate array</a>,” which are semiconductor-based devices that incorporate programmable logic into processor cores.) 



 AI ASICs: USD 1.5 billion (AI ASICs stands for “application-specific integrated circuits,” specifically those related to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.) 



 Data processing units (DPUs): USD 0.6 billion 
 



<p>In its 2028 projections, you can see how Yole’s experts expect certain segments to grow, namely AI and DPUs. Yole anticipates an 8% total yearly growth, leading to an expected 2028 total value of USD 242 billion, based on these figures:</p>



 
 CPUs: USD 97 billion 



 APUs: USD 65 billion 



 GPUs: USD 55 billion 



 AI ASICs: USD 11 billion 



 DPUs: USD 8.1 billion 



 SoC FPGAs: USD 5.2 billion 
 



<p>In addition to substantial market growth in AI ASICs and DPUs, Yole Intelligence’s forecast shows nearly identical growth for CPUs and GPUs during the same period, with growth predictions of USD 32 billion and USD 33 billion respectively. These projections also demonstrate the ongoing centrality of CPUs, since this category leads all others now and will continue to do so in the future, according to Yole Intelligence.</p>



 Take the next step 



<p>With over 200 billion CPUs in current operation, it’s reasonable to conclude that CPUs are here to stay—very probably a permanent part of the human condition moving forward. But it’s also a safe bet that the CPU will continue to be further developed and refined, to keep maxing out its utility for high-performance systems and the new, graphics-rich computer programs they run.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s smart to invest wisely when purchasing the associated equipment needed to execute computing objectives. It’s important to have hardware that can keep pace with modern CPUs. IBM servers offer flexibility in addition to strength, so you can get the processing power you need now, along with room to grow in the future.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that guidance for SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers planning to migrate their identity management scenarios to Microsoft Entra is now available. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-and-sap-collaborate-to-modernize-identity-for-sap/ba-p/4056600">previous post</a>, we discussed SAP ending maintenance for their identity management solution (SAP IDM) by 2030.&nbsp;We've since begun jointly developing documentation to help customers plan a seamless migration to the recommended alternative—Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;For many customers, it may be possible to get started immediately, leveraging the subscriptions that they already own with Microsoft 365 suites. Microsoft 365 enterprise suite licenses include Entra ID P1 features that will be the focus of this first round of guidance.&nbsp;In this post, we’ll also outline additional benefits of Microsoft Entra ID and list some key partners who can help you get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Continuing collaboration for enterprise security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP have a long history of collaborating to keep our customers’ organizations productive and secure—an effort especially important now as more companies have adopted hybrid work arrangements, making it possible to work from office and from home. For example, last year we announced how Microsoft Sentinel is helping organizations bring&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/revolutionize-your-sap-security-with-microsoft-sentinel-s-soar/ba-p/3823857">SOAR threat monitoring capabilities to their SAP environments</a>. We continue to deepen our relationship, and now we’re extending support for SAP customers’ digital transformation and cloud adoption goals with a seamless and secure identity management solution in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing the first set of&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/MigrateFromSAPIDM">guidance to migrate from SAP IDM to Entra ID</a>. SAP customers who are using SAP IDM for cloud and on-premises applications like SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Identity Services, or Windows Server Active Directory can begin to use Microsoft Entra features such as Conditional Access to enforce Zero Trust access policies, and automatic provisioning that ensures users have the accounts they need for their job role. For SAP IDM customers who want more guidance on advanced IAM integrations, such as with Micosoft Entra ID Governance or external IDs, for example, we’re developing additional in-depth guidance on each of those areas that will be published later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modernizing your security strategy and moving toward a Zero Trust framework is not an overnight process, so we recommend customers start their journey to adopt cloud services and gain productivity and security benefits.&nbsp;Therefore, we’ve included guidance for migration of the most common scenarios, including:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP will continue to enhance Microsoft Entra ID and deliver deeper integrations with SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance.&nbsp; As new scenarios become available, we’ll provide ongoing updates to this&nbsp;guidance, incorporating customer and partner feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern identity management is a strategic investment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progressive organizations are switching to cloud-based identity solutions. Older systems, designed for on-site environments, fail to satisfy the demands of the modern cloud-first, mobile, decentralized workforce. Additionally, they can be expensive, complicated, and susceptible to security risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that multifactor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on methods&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW166lD?culture=en-us&amp;country=us">can reduce password breaches by 99.9%</a>, but the benefits of a cloud-based solution in Microsoft Entra ID extend beyond just a stronger security posture. Optimized operational efficiency allows identity teams to do more impactful work and an improved user experience makes the entire organization less frustrated. By moving to Microsoft Entra ID, the benefits of your strategic investment continue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for SAP and non-SAP apps and systems—both on-premises and cloud&nbsp; 
 Rich set of APIs, SDKs,&nbsp;and connectors for customization&nbsp; 
 Minimized vendor footprint&nbsp; 
 Reduced costs and complexity&nbsp; 
 Help meeting identity-related requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>Modernizing identity management is key to boosting organizational security and shielding users and assets from the most common security threats. It’s more than just a cybersecurity measure; it also enhances user experience and operational efficiency. Generative AI, Zero Trust security, decentralized identity, and the flexibility to tailor access policies to exactly match your unique needs and demands offer compelling opportunities to better protect&nbsp;your apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Partner network ready to help 
<p>&nbsp;<br>We’ve also been working with a set of key partners to help organizations begin their migrations, including some with long-term experience in Microsoft/SAP environments. </p>

<p>In response to a recent FDS incident, we have deployed a hotfix to our blockchain explorer, Aergo Scan, enhancing its security and transparency. Looking ahead, we are preparing for a comprehensive hard fork scheduled for next month, aimed at introducing broader systemic improvements and new functionalities. This article will outline the recent updates and preview what to expect from the upcoming&nbsp;changes.</p> Updates on Aergo&nbsp;Scan <p>In anticipation of the Aergo V4 hard fork, we have introduced a new feature to Aergo Scan, the Internal Transaction UI (Beta version). This enhancement, inspired by similar features in the Ethereum Explorer, enables users and network participants to track detailed histories related to addresses and transactions effortlessly.</p><p>This is just a glimpse of what the Aergo V4 hard fork will bring, including the full implementation of internal transaction logging to increase transparency across all transactional histories. Additionally, contract sources will be stored and compiled directly on-chain, facilitating easy access and reference.</p> Upcoming Hard Fork to Aergo&nbsp;V4 <p>The Aergo V4 hard fork is focused on several key objectives:</p>  Enhancing Transparency: <br>- We are committed to increasing the Aergo mainnet’s transparency for both developers and users, fostering a more trustful environment.  Adopting a “White-Box” Model: <br>- This new model will enhance the transparency and readability of contracts and transactions, benefiting both current and future applications.<br>- The new data model will prep Aergo for applications on Machine Learning and Small and Large Language Model integration”  <p>The new features for Aergo V4 include the following:</p>  Internal transaction logging:<br>- Provides increased transparency for complex contracts that interact with each other.<br>- Essential for future developments like DAOs and enabling machine learning on the Aergo&nbsp;mainnet.  C<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/149">omposable Transactions</a>:<br>- Explicit atomic transactions without relying on internal transactions<br>- Enhancing transparency and trustless transactions without the need for turing complete contract implementation (“White-box transactions”)  Text-based Contracts:<br>- All Lua contracts on Aergo will be stored as source code (in lieu of bytecode) to make it more human-readable and deterministic<br>- The basis for text-based language model applications as well (same as text-based transactions)  T<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/252">ext-based Transactions (WIP)</a>:<br>- A transaction format that is both human-readable and machine-interpretable, embodying the principles of the <a href="https://webisoft.com/articles/ricardian-contract/">Ricardian Contract</a> <br>- Aims to fully realize Ricardian Contract capabilities<br>- Also serves as a foundation for text-based language model applications<br>- Enables the use of text-based transactions for prompt engineering and data&nbsp;storage  <p>The technical specifications for the new features introduced in the Aergo V4 hard fork are available on <a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/discussions/256">GitHub</a>.

<p>Recent healthcare cyberattacks have highlighted the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in the healthcare industry. In February 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, was hit by a ransomware attack when hackers exploited a server that was missing a fundamental security measure: multi-factor authentication (MFA). The incident not only paralyzed healthcare services but also led to the payment of a $22 million ransom and is expected to cost the company over $1.6 billion in recovery efforts. Moreover, according to Axios, health care providers are losing up to $1 billion a day from cyberattack.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As healthcare providers and payers continue to digitize their operations and patient records, they also continue to be the prime target for cybercriminals. According to the 2023 ForgeRock Breach Report2 of all industries healthcare is the number one targeted industry by cybercriminals. The stakes are high: a breach not only compromises member and patient data but also disrupts essential healthcare services. To mitigate these risks, healthcare organizations must adopt comprehensive security measures, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the organization being paramount.</p>

<p>In business and beyond, communication is king. Successful service level agreements (SLAs) operate on this principle, laying the foundation for successful provider-customer relationships.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/service-level-agreement">service level agreement (SLA)</a> is a key component of technology vendor contracts that describes the terms of service between a service provider and a customer. SLAs describe the level of performance to be expected, how performance will be measured and repercussions if levels are not met. SLAs make sure that all stakeholders understand the service agreement and help forge a more seamless working relationship.</p>



 Types of SLAs 



<p>There are three main types of SLAs:</p>



 Customer-level SLAs 



<p>Customer-level SLAs define the terms of service between a service provider and a customer. A customer can be external, such as a business purchasing cloud storage from a vendor, or internal, as is the case with an SLA between business and IT teams regarding the development of a product.</p>



 Service-level SLAs 



<p>Service providers who offer the same service to multiple customers often use service-level SLAs. Service-level SLAs do not change based on the customer, instead outlining a general level of service provided to all customers.</p>



 Multilevel SLAs 



<p>When a service provider offers a multitiered pricing plan for the same product, they often offer multilevel SLAs to clearly communicate the service offered each level. Multilevel SLAs are also used when creating agreements between more than two more parties.</p>



 SLA components 



<p>SLAs include an overview of the parties involved, services to be provided, stakeholder role breakdowns, performance monitoring and reporting requirements. Other SLA components include security protocols, redressing agreements, review procedures, termination clauses and more. Crucially, they define how performance will be measured.</p>



<p>SLAs should precisely define the key metrics—service-level agreement metrics—that will be used to measure service performance. These metrics are often related to organizational <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SLOs+ibm&amp;sca_esv=4b73ca8f0ec787dd&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1046US1046&amp;ei=AYhPZrqeB-Cpxc8Pn9WQuAY&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6oozosKSGAxXgVPEDHZ8qBGcQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=SLOs+ibm&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCFNMT3MgaWJtMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg4QABiwAxjkAhjWBNgBATIOEAAYsAMY5AIY1gTYAQEyDhAAGLADGOQCGNYE2AEBMhMQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGIoF2AECMhMQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGIoF2AECMhMQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGIoF2AECSL8IUJMBWNAGcAF4AZABAJgBAKABAKoBALgBA8gBAPgBAZgCAaACB5gDAIgGAZAGEroGBggBEAEYCboGBggCEAEYCJIHATGgBwA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">service level objectives (SLOs</a>). While SLAs define the agreement between organization and customer, SLOs set internal performance targets. Fulfilling SLAs requires monitoring important metrics related to business operations and service provider performance. The key is monitoring the right metrics.</p>



 What is a KPI in an SLA? 



<p>Metrics are specific measures of an aspect of service performance, such as availability or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a>. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are linked to business goals and are used to judge a team’s progress toward those goals. KPIs don’t exist without business targets; they are “indicators” of progress toward a stated goal.</p>



<p>Let’s use annual sales growth as an example, with an organizational goal of 30% growth year-over-year. KPIs such as subscription renewals to date or leads generated provide a real-time snapshot of business progress toward the annual sales growth goal.</p>



<p>Metrics such as application availability and latency help provide context. For example, if the organization is losing customers and not on track to meet the annual goal, an examination of metrics related to customer satisfaction (that is, application availability and latency) might provide some answers as to why customers are leaving.</p>



 What SLA metrics to monitor 



<p>SLAs contain different terms depending on the vendor, type of service provided, client requirements, compliance standards and more and metrics vary by industry and use case. However, certain SLA performance metrics such as availability, mean time to recovery, response time, error rates and security and compliance measurements are commonly used across services and industries. These metrics set a baseline for operations and the quality of services provided.</p>



<p>Clearly defining which metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) will be used to measure performance and how this information will be communicated helps <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-service-management">IT service management (ITSM)</a> teams identify what data to collect and monitor. With the right data, teams can better maintain SLAs and make sure that customers know exactly what to expect.<br><br>Ideally, ITSM teams provide input when SLAs are drafted, in addition to monitoring the metrics related to their fulfillment. Involving ITSM teams early in the process helps make sure that business teams don’t make agreements with customers that are not attainable by IT teams.</p>



<p>SLA metrics that are important for IT and ITSM leaders to monitor include:</p>



 1. Availability 



<p>Service disruptions, or downtime, are costly, can damage enterprise credibility and can lead to compliance issues. The SLA between an organization and a customer dictates the expected level of service availability or uptime and is an indicator of system functionality.</p>



<p>Availability is often measured in “nines on the way to 100%”: 90%, 99%, 99.9% and so on. Many cloud and SaaS providers aim for an industry standard of “five 9s” or 99.999% uptime.</p>



<p>For certain businesses, even an hour of downtime can mean significant losses. If an e-commerce website experiences an outage during a high traffic time such as Black Friday, or during a large sale, it can damage the company’s reputation and annual revenue. Service disruptions also negatively impact the customer experience. Services that are not consistently available often lead users to search for alternatives. Business needs vary, but the need to provide users with quick and efficient products and services is universal.</p>



<p>Generally, maximum uptime is preferred. However, providers in some industries might find it more cost effective to offer a slightly lower availability rate if it still meets client needs.</p>



 2. Mean time to recovery 



<p>Mean time to recovery measures the average amount of time that it takes to recover a product during an outage or failure. No system or service is immune from an occasional issue or failure, but enterprises that can quickly recover are more likely to maintain business profitability, meet customer needs and uphold SLAs.</p>



 3. Response time and resolution time 



<p>SLAs often state the amount of time in which a service provider must respond after an issue is flagged or logged. When an issue is logged or a service request is made, the response time indicates how long it takes for a provider to respond to and address the issue. Resolution time refers to how long it takes for the issue to be resolved. Minimizing these times is key to maintaining service performance.<br><br>Organizations should seek to address issues before they become system-wide failures and cause security or compliance issues. Software solutions that offer full-stack observability into business functions can play an important role in maintaining optimized systems and service performance. Many of these platforms use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) tools to automate the process of remediation or identify issues before they arise.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>-powered intrusion detection systems (IDS) constantly monitor <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking">network</a> traffic for malicious activity, violations of security protocols or anomalous data. These systems deploy machine learning algorithms to monitor large data sets and use them to identify anomalous data. Anomalies and intrusions trigger alerts that notify IT teams. Without AI and machine learning, manually monitoring these large data sets would not be possible. &nbsp;</p>



 4. Error rates 



<p>Error rates measure service failures and the number of times service performance dips below defined standards. Depending on your enterprise, error rates can relate to any number of issues connected to business functions.</p>



<p>For example, in manufacturing, error rates correlate to the number of defects or quality issues on a specific product line, or the total number of errors found during a set time interval. These error rates, or defect rates, help organizations identify the root cause of an error and whether it’s related to the materials used or a broader issue.<br><br>There is a subset of customer-based metrics that monitor customer service interactions, which also relate to error rates.</p>



 
 First call resolution rate: In the realm of customer service, issues related to help desk interactions can factor into error rates. The success of customer services interactions can be difficult to gauge. Not every customer fills out a survey or files a complaint if an issue is not resolved—some will just look for another service. One metric that can help measure customer service interactions is the first call resolution rate. This rate reflects whether a user’s issue was resolved during the first interaction with a help desk, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbot</a> or representative. Every escalation of a customer service query beyond the initial contact means spending on extra resources. It can also impact the customer experience. 



 Abandonment rate: This rate reflects the frequency in which a customer abandons their inquiry before finding a resolution. Abandonment rate can also add to the overall error rate and helps measure the efficacy of a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/service-desk">service desk</a>, chatbot or human workforce. 
 



 5. Security and compliance 



<p>Large volumes of data and the use of on-premises servers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud</a> servers and a growing number of applications creates a greater risk of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach">data breaches</a> and security threats. If not monitored appropriately, security breaches and vulnerabilities can expose service providers to legal and financial repercussions.</p>



<p>For example, the healthcare industry has specific requirements around how to store, transfer and dispose of a patient’s medical data. Failure to meet these compliance standards can result in fines and indemnification for losses incurred by customers.</p>



<p>While there are countless industry-specific metrics defined by the different services provided, many of them fall under larger umbrella categories. To be successful, it is important for business teams and IT service management teams to work together to improve service delivery and meet customer expectations.</p>



 Benefits of monitoring SLA metrics 



<p>Monitoring SLA metrics is the most efficient way for enterprises to gauge whether IT services are meeting customer expectations and to pinpoint areas for improvement. By monitoring metrics and KPIs in real time, IT teams can identify system weaknesses and optimize service delivery.<br><br>The main benefits of monitoring SLA metrics include:</p>



 Greater observability 



<p>A clear end-to-end understanding of business operations helps ITSM teams find ways to improve performance. Greater <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> enables organizations to gain insights into the operation of systems and workflows, identify errors, balance <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workloads</a> more efficiently and improve performance standards.</p>



 Optimized performance 



<p>By monitoring the right metrics and using the insights gleaned from them, organizations can provide better services and applications, exceed customer expectations and drive business growth.</p>



 Increased customer satisfaction 



<p>Similarly, monitoring SLA metrics and KPIs is one of the best ways to make sure services are meeting customer needs. In a crowded business field, customer satisfaction is a key factor in driving customer retention and building a positive &nbsp;reputation.</p>



 Greater transparency 



<p>By clearly outlining the terms of service, SLAs help eliminate confusion and protect all parties. Well-crafted SLAs make it clear what all stakeholders can expect, offer a well-defined timeline of when services will be provided and which stakeholders are responsible for specific actions. When done right, SLAs help set the tone for a smooth partnership.</p>

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.<br>
This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.<br>
Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.<br>
Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

Technically, yes. However, there is more to it than meets the eye and as much as we like simplicity, we want to make sure your business is covering all its bases. &nbsp;One crucial aspect that is not talked about&nbsp;enough&nbsp;is understanding what are the risks associated with declaring in excess. </p>

<p>Today’s fraudsters are both creative and adaptive. Whether their goal is to monetize an account with a stored payment method or transfer funds from a financial institution, identity is the key for unlocking access to online services. If one method of fraud no longer works, cybercriminals change and advance their techniques in pursuit of achieving their goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it's important to have awareness of identity-related cybercrimes like <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/prevent-online-fraud/account-takeover-fraud.html">account takeover (ATO)</a> and <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/prevent-online-fraud/account-creation-fraud.html">new account fraud (NAF)</a>, you also need to develop a holistic threat prevention strategy to detect and stop attacks. To help you do that, Ping has developed an identity threat taxonomy – a powerful tool used to visualize a logical sequence of related parts in a threat prevention strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity solution providers like Ping are required to keep track of the ever changing threat landscape to provide secure and seamless user experiences. By studying this identity threat taxonomy, you can better understand and prioritize threat protection in your own organization.</p>

  <p>In the next three years, the twenty seven states of the European Union (EU) will have to finalize the implementing acts for the eIDAS2 regulation and issue digital identity wallets to their citizens. Although the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) defined by the EU expert group has clearly identified mandatory standards for several parts of the wallet, such as the credentials formats, or the verification or presentation protocols, it has not mandated standards on how to secure of the wallet credentials, sensitive data and key materials.<br>The ARF has identified use cases requiring a high level of assurance (LoA) in terms of security, such as the provisioning of the Personal Identification Data (PID) or the use of qualified signature, as well as possible means to ensure this high LoA: with secure elements embedded into the mobile device, with external electronic identity documents accessed by communication channels such as Near Field Communication (NFC), or with the use of remote Hardware Security Modules.<br>Today, the vast majority of mobile devices are embedding secure elements and trusted execution environments that already provide certified high level of security for several use cases such as secure connectivity, payment, ticketing, or digital keys. These secure elements are deployed on billions of mobile devices, and are based on recognized standards such GlobalPlatform Secure Element or Trusted Execution Environment specifications.<br>This presentation will give an overview of the different security standards and technologies available in mobile devices, and how they can be applied for securing digital identity wallets. Besides the secure storage and secure execution environment aspects, this presentation will also address secure provisioning of wallet applications, credentials and sensitive data, as well as their security certification. It will bridge the gap between the high level requirements of security and the possible deployment scenarios that will enable digital identity wallet to enjoy the same level of security as existing proven and largely deployed solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/an-overview-of-deployment-solutions-eic24"></a>

  <p>30% of people online around the world are under 18 and societies are judged by how they look after their kids. Germany is quite unique in the fact that its regulatory body, the KJM, has reviewed and approved over 100 methods for age assurance. Many other countries around the world are grappling with this issue. This session will look at the development of this industry - from KYC, AML for the gaming industry, through the range of document based and non document based approaches to assess age - and the balance in terms of offering inclusive approaches for people who do not own or choose to use an identity document based approach. It will address interoperability, the incoming international standards, benchmarking and anti-spoofing.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-age-assurance-eic24"></a>

  <p>Providing a product or service across markets internationally can come with significant technical and regulatory overhead. The challenge of such overhead might seem to reduce itself in the current market development in Europe with the soon to be standardized eIDAS architecture and unified wallet interaction protocols that seem to streamline identity integration requirements across 27 countries. In practice though, moving beyond the EU context will still require significant adaptation and often parallel implementation of identity standards and protocols, this is true for the Swiss market as much as it is true for the US or even Japanese market. While all these markets move towards the digital identity wallet paradigm as a new identity model, their technical approach differs significantly.</p>
<p>Abstracting this complexity for companies that simply want to provide their product or service across markets is a tough challenge. Solution providers need to consistently monitor changing specifications, requirements, and regulation, while making sure that their own technological platform is ready to support the variety at hand. Many incumbent solutions and platforms do not handle such diversity well since they were developed for a concrete market environment and then updated on a sub optimal path of evolution towards ever more complexity.</p>
<p>As a Swiss provider of digital identity core technologies, Procivis had to naturally tackle the challenge of a future proof technology solution that is capable of handling complexity since day one. Our home market is too small to justify a solution built for only that environment, so we had to get creative and build a product that can naturally handle complexity and interoperability without compromise.</p>
<p>This presentation will tell the story of our journey to rethink product development in times of uncertainty. It will describe how we learned to radically build for adaptability and extensibility. After the initial instinct to resist uncertainty, we learned to embrace it and I will talk about our company's journey to this new state of consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/embracing-diverse-specifications-eic24"></a>

   Digital wallets are applications used to receive, store, and share identity attributes in a standards-based [preferably], secure, privacy enhancing fashion.

  <p>Digital wallets are applications used to receive, store, and share identity attributes in a standards-based [preferably], secure, privacy enhancing fashion. To prove that the legitimate, natural person is receiving, in possession of, or sharing these identity attributes a means to bind them to the natural person is needed.<br> In 1995, for example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) clearly recognized the desirability of pursuing the use of biometrics in travel documents as the single best way to link the document and its rightful “owner.”<br> In this example the issuing authority binds the identity attributes to the authorized holder by including biometric data in the cryptographically signed logical data structure. When the holder makes an identity claim the relying party (verifier) can determine the authenticity and integrity of the identity attributes and, through biometric recognition, determine if the authorized holder is presenting the information. This works well for the intended use case: in-person identity verification by government authorities for cross border travel.<br> The EU, for another example, specifies three assurance levels for electronic identification (low, superior, and high) which involve different levels of rigor in the identity proofing process and in the binding process itself, from: <br> The binding has been established on the basis of nationally recognised procedures.<br> to<br> The binding has been verified on the basis of a unique identifier representing the legal person used in the national context; and on the basis of information uniquely representing the natural person from an authoritative source.<br> Here the EU defines authoritative source as:<br> any source irrespective of its form that can be relied upon to provide accurate data, information and/or evidence that can be used to prove identity; <br> The goal of digital wallets in general, and the EU digital wallet in particular, is to be able to prove identity claims to a certain level of assurance both in-person (like an ICAO ePassport or ISO 18013-5 mDL) and on-line (like an ISO 18013-7 mDL). <br> <br> This session will discuss how authentication may rely on the digital wallet to bind the holder to identity claims and what the associated challenges as influenced by varying levels of assurance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-wallet-holder-binding-eic24"></a>

  <p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and traditional security paradigms are proving inadequate in the face of modern threats. As organizations strive to embrace Zero Trust principles, the role of Privileged Access Management (PAM) is pivotal. This talk explores the transformative concept of "Micro Authorizations" and its potential to shape the optimal direction for PAM implementations in support of Zero Trust initiatives.</p>
<p>The Authorization Fabric decides whether a specific principal is authorized to perform a precise operation on a particular resource and whether the resource permits this access.</p>
<p>The granularity of this approach is vital in today’s threat landscape, requiring organizations to shift their focus to a comprehensive, system-wide authorization framework. This shift, parallels the principles of microservices but applies them to the realm of access control.</p>
<p>Rather than depending on a single point of control, there is a need for a network proxy that acts as a bridge between trust and authorization.</p>
<p>Join us on a journey towards a future powered by micro authorizations, where precision, adaptability, and contextual awareness define access control. Explore how micro authorizations can address contemporary security challenges and facilitate the adoption of the Zero Trust model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-privileged-access-management-eic24"></a>

It is tempting to think of externalising authorization as a technology problem. Technology like policy languages, authorization engines and workflow systems is necessary to enable the externalisation of authorization, but it is not sufficient. Externalising authorization requires three foundational building blocks to be in place, namely value for all stakeholders from engineers to customers, supporting business processes and technology. In this session we explore each of these building blocks should be internalised in terms of mapping value for all stakeholders, the process and culture needed to make authorization policies explicit and finally the need to drive authorization infrastructure, from policy language to enforcement engines, into the compute and network fabric to address greenfield and brownfield deployments in order to remove barriers to externalising authorization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-before-we-externalise-it-eic24"></a>

  <p>The proliferation of micro-services along with the changing threat landscape means it is no longer possible to rely on network segmentation to establish a secure permitter while allowing broad access between services inside the perimeter. As a result, we have to assume that the attackers are inside the perimeter and apply fine grained authorization at the microservice level to ensure least privilege access based on the context of each transaction. This context includes details of the transaction, the user, other services, or workloads in the call chain as well as the trust domains in which the services operate.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are two new complimentary standards being developed in the IETF OAuth working group that provide a standardised mechanism for preserving transaction context. The Transaction Tokens draft provides a mechanism for preserving context for fine grained authorization decisions within a trust domain, while Identity Chaining across Trust Domains provides a mechanism for preserving that context even when crossing trust boundaries. In this session we will provide an overview of these two emerging standards and describe how they are used to enable fine grained authorization in microservices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enabling-fine-grained-authoirization-eic24"></a>

<p>Modern cloud deployments employ secrets management systems such as KMS to protect key materials at rest and avoid leaking keys or credentials in source code or other build artifacts. However, secrets are unprotected at runtime, so any vulnerability or compromise of a service could lead to credential theft.</p>
<p>This talk will propose an architecture that, in conjunction with a secret manager, tokenizes secrets and rewrites requests at runtime. Through this approach, application code never directly interacts with key material. Additionally, it enforces stringent access control rules based on Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for accessing secrets, significantly reducing the blast radius in the event of a security breach.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-workload-identities-eic24"></a>

<p>This wallet can be implemented as a web wallet running in a browser. This means a smartphone is not required to use the wallet – making it inclusive and independent of app stores and phone vendors. Instead of using native APIs to protect cryptographic keys, this web wallet can use FIDO security keys to secure the wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO is a natural fit to secure digital wallets as users are becoming more and more familiar with its associated registration and sign in flows now many websites have adopted passkeys as a means to access their services.</p>

  <p>In the realm of modern authentication, FIDO and passkeys have launched a new paradigm that is both practical and transformative. Passkey providers have seamlessly integrated the capability to synchronize passkeys across various devices, extending their reach even to different device families. Users enjoy default implementations of passkey providers with each new device, empowering relying parties to leverage passkeys across the multitude of devices.<br> In contrast, relying parties cannot assume the universal presence of identity wallet functionality on the typical devices used by their customers.<br> Given the three-year device switch cycle and the concurrent use of multiple devices, cloud storage services have efficiently addressed the migration of standard data between devices. While these services generally have access to data in the clear, they implement safeguards to prevent inadvertent disclosure.<br> Passkey providers not only synchronize passkeys but also implement robust recovery methods, crucial for scenarios involving the loss or theft of all devices. Similarly, identity wallets, tasked with managing verifiable identity attributes and associated secrets, necessitate safeguards akin to those implemented by passkey providers. <br> This webinar explores the similarities and differences between passkey providers and identity wallets, offering valuable insights into what identity wallets can glean from the proven methodologies of passkeys.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/convergence-of-passkeys-and-identity-wallets-eic24"></a>

  <p>For decentralised identity to reach its full potential we need high levels of trust and high levels of inclusion. <br>As a community we have developed some great standards and practices for identity verification, but they mostly rely on having strong documentation issued by a government if you want to gain the higher levels of trust. <br>The reality is not everyone has strong documentation and not everyone has access to digital technology to verify that documentation remotely. For example, in the UK around 11 million people have neither a passport nor a driving licence, the 2 primary documents used for identity verification. In many countries this number is far higher. <br>And, while we drive forward with more and more technological means of proving who we are online, some people will always struggle to use these technologies or simply not be able to. <br>Vouching for someone as part of the identity verification process has been around for a while but is only now crystalising in the minds of identity experts. It is also one of the most decentralised ways of proving who you are. <br>The process of Vouching is intended to increase inclusivity of population scale identity systems by enabling people with insufficient documentation (identity evidence), or those unable to complete a conventional identity registration to gain a digital identity.<br>In this session Adam Cooper seeks to outline the issues we should be addressing and the approaches we can take to create better inclusivity in digital identity ecosystems based on over a decade of working with governments, citizens, and the private sector to deliver better outcomes for all of us.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-is-already-decentralized-eic24"></a>

  <p>eIDAS version 2 has set in motion and energized identity professionals to think about and work on sharing attributes related to identity data. eIDAS version 2 provides a possible framework and set of technologies to do so. However, that framework does not match with a lot of technical and business practices already in use. In Belgium an ecosystem is forming to perform data sharing in a way which is adapted to the needs of the different existing stakeholders: data subjects, sources, attribute attestation service providers, vaults, IdP and relying parties. It reuses a lot of existing initiatives and infrastructure for a low threshold implementation with the high trust level of the existing initiatives. Nevertheless, it allows to implement important features like privacy, selective disclosure, etc.<br> During this presentation, we will see how this alternative ecosystem works, how it ensures trust and ease of use for the different stakeholders (including data subjects) and why it will lead to a low threshold for adoption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-sharing-ecosystem-and-trust-eic24"></a>

  <p>The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), which just had its fourth birthday, has long held the conviction that technical trust alone is insufficient for enabling human trust in digital interactions. Thus, ToIP has been developing a dual stack that pairs technical architecture with governance architecture. <br> <br>To maximize technical interoperability, ToIP believes there must be a minimum viable “trust spanning” protocol that enables ubiquitous secure, private data exchange. Then every digital trust ecosystem can choose which higher-layer “trust task” protocols—such as exchanging digital credentials between digital wallets, or verifying ecosystem participants using trust registries—they need to meet their specific authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy requirements.<br> <br> With regards to the harder problem of human trust, in the real world this is built through relationships, agreements and other intangible elements within a context. By contrast, in the digital world trust has to be engineered. This means each ecosystem needs to be able to define their governance architecture, policies, credentials, and trust lists/registries that can be communicated both within and across ecosystems using interoperable protocols to maximize the potential for cross-ecosystem trust relationships.<br> <br> This interactive panel, moderated by ToIP’s Executive Director, will convene a set of ToIP leaders to explain why they have been investing in this new approach to decentralized digital trust infrastructure, where it fits with eIDAS 2.0, how it builds upon (not replaces) X.509 PKI and OpenID, and what to expect over the coming year.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/emerging-trust-layer-for-the-internet-eic24"></a>

  <p>With cybercrime on the rise, ransomware attacks that target Active Directory (AD), the primary identity store for most businesses worldwide, are as common as having a cup of coffee. Many cyber incidents involve AD in one way or another. Given that an attack on AD, these days, is more of a "when" rather than an "if" scenario, organizations must have a tested AD DR plan and purpose-built solutions for securing AD before a cyberattack and recovering and securing AD after that cyberattack. In addition, if like many organizations today, you have a hybrid identity environment that connects AD with Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD), do you know what needs to happen to reconnect? Recovering as fast as possible is one thing, assessing the security of your AD and mitigating any (critical) risks is another. But what about reconnecting AD back with Entra ID? Knowing which precautionary measures to take to minimize damage (i.e., the impact on user experience and data loss) within Entra ID is of utmost importance!</p>
<p>This presentation discusses the risk to today’s enterprise organizations and explains why prioritizing hybrid identity (Active Directory and Entra ID) security is so important. Examples of various identity threat detection and response (ITDR) tools to evaluate AD security (pre- and post-attack) and discover vulnerabilities that could attract attackers are also discussed.</p>
<p>Attendees will also learn why an AD Recovery Plan is a vital resource for ongoing operational resilience, including the different ways to execute parts of that DR plan and what the impact is of such an execution. Finally, we will discuss what the problem is with reconnecting AD back with Entra ID and what you can do about it to mitigate any impact.</p>
<p>In summary, during this session, attendees will learn the following:</p>
 
 Learn how to evaluate the security of an AD 
 Learn how to prepare for a disaster scenario 
 Learn which backup to choose and why 
 Learn how to remediate risk (due to security) right after recovery 
 Learn how to remediate impact when reconnecting AD with Entra ID&nbsp; 
 
<p>If time allows, the highlights of a real-life AD recovery scenario will be discussed, to put all the pieces together.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ransomware-attack-against-your-ad-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the&nbsp;Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer introduce a critical view of the process of civilization, economy and enlightenment as such, a critical view of the seemingly self-evident notion of pure reason, science, and technology. What Horkheimer and Adorno are trying to capture and reflect is the very process of rationality backlashing into irrationality. The long history of enlightenment is thus the demystification of nature and the development of pure calculative rationality. According to Horkheimer and Adorno, we have tried to free ourselves of the dangers and brute force of nature, but in the process of developing technology and production we have ended up narrowing our rational capacities, dominating ourselves, and tying ourselves to a petrified system now even endangering our own planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We seem to have reached the era of modern technology and exact calculation, but this leaves us with no sense of control or meaningfulness in the face of a global environmental crisis. Humanity's technological orientation to the world makes clear the responsibility of human beings to the well-being of the world. This taking of responsibility will become vital in the future since it has become perfectly clear that the Earth will not be able in the long term to support the exploitative and care-less ways in which ever growing parts of humanity have been inhabiting her since at least the Industrial Revolution. However, the need to ask about modern technology is presumably dying out to the same extent that technology more definitely characterizes and regulates the appearance of the totality of the world and the position of man in it. Thus, it is important to ask: how does modern technology affect our actuality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will explore how technology is not merely a means to an end but also a lens through which we understand ourselves and the world. It will highlight the increasing responsibility that humanity bears for the well-being of the planet, especially in the face of a global environmental crisis. The session will demonstrate how this transformation represents a radical change in our technological relationship with the planet and with ourselves.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/philosophical-perspective-identity-cybersecurity-professionals-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the fast-evolving landscape of digital connectivity, one of the biggest challenges service providers in highly regulated industries face today is ensuring that authentication and API authorization mechanisms are implemented correctly. At the same time, they are required to meet high expectations of customers for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Traditionally, authentication and API authorization functions have been combined into one system architecture, often through a managed service provided by a vendor. However, this restricts how service providers can customize their identity and access management systems to deliver a consistent brand experience.<br>To thrive in the competitive environment, service providers are increasingly opting to build their own authorization servers in-house. They are taking control of their identity and access management systems to deliver a frictionless and differentiated experience.<br>Discover examples of how well-respected brands have built their fully compliant and secure authorization servers by offloading the protocol processing and management, accelerating the growth of their digital services.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/liberate-yourself-from-vendor-limitations-eic24"></a>

It is essential therefore that we expand our identity-focused wallet thinking into some of those other areas.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallets-digital-euro-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the rapidly evolving agricultural sector, the importance of data management and sharing has never been more critical. Traditional methods are no longer sufficient; they create compliance burdens, inefficiencies and face a lack of trust. New Zealand is undertaking a transformative approach with the Digital Farm Wallet pilot, conceived by the Trust Alliance New Zealand (TANZ), a non-profit industry consortium recognising that trusted data sharing is essential for the growth of New Zealand’s primary sector.</p>
<p>The TANZ Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project exemplifies the commitment to empowering stakeholders to share and verify information in a trusted and permissioned manner, fostering trust and transparency throughout the value chain. This initiative aims to offer tangible proof of brand promises, while alleviating farms from the repetitive tasks of data management.</p>
<p>To ensure international market and financial access demand of digital proofs, such as environmental claims are increasing. The Digital Farm Wallet addresses this by facilitating the sharing of key data points like greenhouse gas and Scope 3 emissions, underscoring good management practices. Exploring various applications, this initiative aims to deliver real value for farmers and food processors.</p>
<p>Klaeri Schelhowe was contracted through Scheddebrock Ltd. to act as the Executive Director for TANZ. In this role she established an industry consortium to focus on trusted data sharing within the primary sector. A significant challenge was posed in bringing together the many and varied stakeholders, many of whom competed with each other, to cooperate in the development of a functioning ecosystem. Developing stakeholder understanding and willingness to engage in a co opetition model in order to build critical mass is a more complex and demanding undertaking than the adoption and deployment of the technology itself.</p>

  <p>Choosing the right platform to secure identity access to privileged resources is more challenging. This is partly because of the escalating risk of under protected identities in the cloud and the tendency of bad actors to target those with privileged access. It’s also because the choice of tools has widened. The protection of privileged identities has traditionally fallen to PAM vendors such as CyberArk or BeyondTrust, but in the last few years, the space has widened to include CIEM and ITDR providers who focus on securing identities in the cloud, for development environments and at the edge.</p>
<p>In this session Paul will explain why these newer technologies emerged, why they are important, and the difference between them and traditional PAM. He will share his analysis of how these technologies can be orchestrated to work together and how some are being deployed in a decentralised fashion for specific identity management and protection tasks.</p>
<p>You will learn the fundamental design elements of each of these technologies, how they can protect your identities and which may offer a solution for managing privileged identities in your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-ciem-itdr-difference-eic24"></a>

The problem of finding and matching John Doe versus J.Doe is attempted in an end-to-end procurement process to detect internal fraud, based on data from ERP systems. We present an explainable AI (XAI) approach that attempts to explain to business users how certain features of data affect high-risk indicators in a procurement process. Various state-of-the-art XAI methods and novel contributions are empirically evaluated to provide an explainable AI-driven output that can be trusted by business users for actions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/threat-detection-in-a-mixed-identity-landscape-eic24"></a>

  <p>This is an implementation and enterprise change management story about how we moved Okta from a baseline of traditional MFA gating app/resources access to a far more dynamic &amp; secure app/resource access policy position using ZTA principles, passwordless, &amp; eventually, phishing resistance. It’s about cross-departmental partnership, iterative improvement, and performance benchmarking to deliver a data-driven transformation in our security posture in a short, yet realistic, time frame.</p>
<p>This session will show WHY and HOW we managed both the technical and cultural enterprise changes needed to make this a success, and provide attendees within all industries with ideas and examples they can take back to undertake iterative security improvement in their own organizations.</p>
<p>We will start by introducing Okta on Okta. OoO are the identity practitioners within Okta, and just like other EIC attendees, we have to deliver solutions to business identity challenges. Though we may wear “team colors,” we talk shop with the credibility that comes from having to actually implement, own, and iterate it - without the marketing mission to distract us.</p>
<p>We will highlight the status quo and the drivers for this change. We will then move on to the foundational work needed to overhaul our security signals and access policies based on said signals, including how we kept the enterprise from experiencing change &amp; security fatigue, how passwordless was a QoL feature to start, but evolved as the program did to emphasize phishing resistance as the real value. As the program went on, we began layering security feature after feature at sign-on time, including user behavior analysis, managed and BYOD device profiling and security signals, CrowdStrike signals, and more until organically we got to a place were we authenticate every user, every device, and constantly review and adjust our policies based on new security threats.</p>
<p>We will share the metrics on how we tracked our objectives, including auth metrics we tracked to know we were making an impact. We will share the business value impact as well in terms of UX, security hygiene, and worker hours saved - and emphasize this is how we kept exec attention on this program so it wouldn’t peter out. We will end by highlighting that our phishing-resistant journey is not “complete” until all aspects of the user’s identity lifecycle are secured with PR credentials, including onboarding, desktop sign-on, and credential recovery.</p>
<p>This is an implementation &amp; ent. change management story. It IS set w/in Okta &amp; executed by Okta employees, but this is not about the product- it is about the doers getting this done. This is a universally applicable story on passwordless as the first step toward the real goal of phishing resistance, and the iterative process toward ZTA using diverse identity &amp; security tooling signals.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/passwordless-phishing-resistance-eic24"></a>

This means following the principles of human-centered design, inclusion, privacy-by-design, and ethics while building easy-to-use systems that seamlessly enable access to services while combating fraud and theft. But what happens when these principles end up in conflict with each other? How do we, as identity practitioners, navigate the challenge of building for the world that people actually live in, not the one we wished they lived in - and the dilemmas that creates for us? In this talk, the presenter will lay out some of the trends and drivers he is seeing in global projects that surface these quandaries for which no blueprint currently exists. He will also describe some of the design debates that take place as a result between stakeholders, and detail possible approaches to tackle these issues when they inevitably land on your desk.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/human-centered-design-eic24"></a>

  <p>Maurice Ravel's Boléro is one of the world’s most well-known classical pieces, in part due to its simplicity: eighteen minutes of repeated rhythms and melodies make it easy to grasp.<br> <br> But in the midst of that clarity, Boléro holds demanding questions for the listener. Written in the aftermath of the First World War, it sees the dangers of automation and technology—and inquires if humanity can avoid being assimilated into the march of the machine. Ultimately, Boléro asks the hearer two questions: “What is authentic humanity?” and “Can authentic humanity survive the modern world?”<br> <br> These questions still resonate almost one hundred years later. The recent rise of automation in the form of generative AI shows great promise, but also presents similar challenges to 1928. The rush to adopt this new technology is eroding authenticity not just in biometric authentication and identity, but in writing, in art, and in other activities long thought to be the prerogative of humanity. In response, we must reexamine what it means to remain "authentically human" amidst the drumbeat of innovation.<br> <br> Through one person's experience in losing and recovering Boléro, we'll explore the questions that Ravel's masterpiece presents and propose ways in which identity can safeguard authentic humanity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/recovering-bolero-and-the-death-of-authenticity-eic24"></a>

  <p>This keynote session will focus on the fact Financial Inclusion is not possible without Identity inclusion. The speaker(s) will deliver the key findings from Phase 3 of Women in Identity’s International ID Code of Conduct, the Economic Impact of ID Exclusion.</p>
<p>The report delivers a methodology to calculate:</p>
 
 The GDP of any country or state 
 Potential income of a company (impact to your bottom line) 
 An individual in that country. 
 
<p>It will offer examples of how the impact of ID Inclusion for business like those in the audience. The findings also aim to demonstrate the economic impact on individuals whose inability to prove their claimed ID can be improved by their new financial and social status as a result of being Identity Included.</p>
<p>The session will demonstrate how these findings can be implemented through the delivery of the next phase of the ID Code of Conduct work. And how the audience can work together to make ID Inclusion and Financial Inclusion a reality. As well as the impact to the bottomline of small, medium and large businesses if their services were more inclusive.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/is-your-company-losing-from-not-being-id-inclusive-eic24"></a>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software as a service</a> (SaaS) applications have become a boon for enterprises looking to maximize network agility while minimizing costs. They offer app developers on-demand scalability and faster time-to-benefit for new features and software updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SaaS takes advantage of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> infrastructure and economies of scale to provide clients a more streamlined approach to adopting, using and paying for software.</p>



<p>However, SaaS architectures can easily overwhelm DevOps teams with data aggregation, sorting and analysis tasks. Given the <a href="https://ascendixtech.com/number-saas-companies-statistics/">volume of SaaS apps on the market</a> (more than 30,000 SaaS developers were operating in 2023) and the <a href="https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/saas-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20(53%25),use%20a%20staggering%20473%20apps.">volume of data a single app can generate</a> (with each enterprise businesses using roughly 470 SaaS apps), SaaS leaves businesses with loads of structured and unstructured data to parse.</p>



<p>That’s why today’s application analytics platforms rely on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) technology to sift through big data, provide valuable business insights and deliver superior data observability.</p>



 What is application analytics? 



<p>Broadly speaking, application analytics refers to the process of collecting application data and performing real-time analysis of SaaS, mobile, desktop and web application performance and usage data.</p>



<p>App analytics include:</p>



 
 App usage analytics, which show app usage patterns (such as daily and monthly active users, most- and least-used features and geographical distribution of downloads). 
 



 
 App performance analytics, which show how apps are performing across the network (with metrics such as response times and failure rates) and identify the cause and location of app, server or network problems. 
 



 
 App cost and revenue analytics, which track app revenue—such as annual recurring revenue and customer lifetime value (the total profit a business can expect to make from a single customer for the duration the business relationship)—and expenditures such as customer acquisition cost (the costs associated with acquiring a new customer). 
 



<p>Using sophisticated data visualization tools, many of which are powered by AI, app analytics services empower businesses to better understand <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-operations">IT operations</a>, helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.</p>



 AI in SaaS analytics 



<p>Most industries have had to reckon with AI proliferation and AI-driven business practices to some extent.</p>



<p>Roughly 42% of enterprise-scale organizations (more than 1,000 employees) have used AI for business purposes, with nearly 60% of enterprises already using AI to <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">accelerate tech investment</a>. And by 2026, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-11-gartner-says-more-than-80-percent-of-enterprises-will-have-used-generative-ai-apis-or-deployed-generative-ai-enabled-applications-by-2026">more than 80% of companies</a> will have deployed <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai"></a>AI) <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">)</a>AI-enabled apps in their IT environments (up from only 5% in 2023).</p>



<p>SaaS app development and management is no different.</p>



<p>SaaS offers businesses cloud-native app capabilities, but AI and ML turn the data generated by SaaS apps into actionable insights. Modern SaaS analytics solutions can seamlessly integrate with AI models to predict user behavior and automate data sorting and analysis; and ML algorithms enable SaaS apps to learn and improve over time.</p>



<p>Using comprehensive, AI-driven SaaS analytics, businesses can make data-driven decisions about feature enhancements, UI/UX improvements and marketing strategies to maximize user engagement and meet—or exceed—business goals.&nbsp;</p>



 SaaS app analytics use cases 



<p>While effective for some organizations, traditional SaaS data analysis methods (such as relying solely on human data analysts to aggregate data points) sometimes fall short in handling the massive quantities of data SaaS apps produce. They may also struggle to fully leverage the predictive capabilities of app analytics.</p>



<p>The introduction of AI and ML technologies, however, can provide more nuanced observability and more effective decision automation. AI- and ML-generated SaaS analytics enhance:</p>



 1. Data insights and reporting 



 
 
  



<p>Application analytics help businesses monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)—such as error rates, response time, resource utilization, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention">user retention</a> and dependency rates, among other key metrics—to identify performance issues and bottlenecks and create a smoother user experience. AI and ML algorithms enhance these features by processing unique app data more efficiently.</p>



<p>AI technologies can also reveal and visualize data patterns to help with feature development.</p>



<p>If, for instance, a development team wants to understand which app features most significantly impact retention, it might use AI-driven <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) to analyze unstructured data. NLP protocols will auto-categorize user-generated content (such as customer reviews and support tickets), summarize the data and offer insights into the features that keep customers returning to the app. AI can even use NLP to suggest new tests, algorithms, lines of code or entirely new app functions to increase retention.</p>



<p>With AI and ML algorithms, SaaS developers also get granular <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> into app analytics. AI-powered analytics programs can create real-time, fully customizable dashboards that provide up-to-the-minute insights into KPIs. And most machine learning tools will automatically generate summaries of complex data, making it easier for executives and other decision-makers to understand reports without needing to review the raw data themselves.</p>



 2. Predictive analytics. 



<p><a></a><a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-analytics">Predictive analytics</a> forecast future events based on historical data; AI and ML models—such as <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/linear-regression">regression analysis</a>, <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> and <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees">decision trees</a>—enhance the accuracy of these predictions. An e-commerce app, for example, can predict which products will be popular during the holidays by analyzing historical purchase data from previous holiday seasons.</p>



<p>Most SaaS analytics tools—including Google Analytics, Microsoft Azure and IBM® Instana®—offer predictive analytics features that enable developers to anticipate both market and user behavior trends &nbsp;and shift their business strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predictive analytics are equally valuable for user insights.</p>



<p>AI and ML features enable SaaS analytics software to run complex analyses of user interactions within the app (click patterns, navigation paths, feature usage and session duration, among other metrics), which ultimately helps teams anticipate user behavior.</p>



<p>For instance, if a company wants to implement churn prediction protocols to identify at-risk users, they can use AI functions to analyze activity reduction and negative feedback patterns, two user engagement metrics that often precede churn. After the program identifies at-risk users, machine learning algorithms can suggest personalized interventions to re-engage them (a subscription service might offer discounted or exclusive content to users showing signs of disengagement).</p>



<p>Diving deeper into user behavior data also helps businesses proactively identify app usability issues. And during unexpected disruptions (such as those caused by a natural disaster), AI and SaaS analytics provide real-time data visibility that keeps businesses running—or even improving—in challenging times.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Personalization and user experience optimization. 



<p>Machine learning technologies are often integral to providing a personalized customer experience in SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Using customer preferences (preferred themes, layouts and functions), historical trends and user interaction data, ML models in SaaS can dynamically tailor the content that users see based on real-time data. In other words, AI-powered SaaS apps can automatically implement adaptive interface design to keep users engaged with personalized recommendations and content experiences.</p>



<p>News apps, for instance, can highlight articles similar to the ones a user has previously read and liked. An online learning platform can recommend courses or onboarding steps based on a user’s learning history and preferences. And notification systems can send targeted messages to each user at the time they’re likeliest to engage, making the overall experience more relevant and enjoyable.</p>



<p>At the application level, AI can analyze user journey data to understand the typical navigation paths users take through the app and streamline navigation for the entire user base.</p>



 4. Conversion rate optimization and marketing. 



<p>AI analytics tools offer businesses the opportunity to optimize conversion rates, whether through form submissions, purchases, sign-ups or subscriptions.</p>



<p>AI-based analytics programs can automate funnel analyses (which identify where in the conversion funnel users drop off), A/B tests (where developers test multiple design elements, features or conversion paths to see which performs better) and call-to-action button optimization to increase conversions.</p>



<p>Data insights from AI and ML also help improve product marketing and increase overall app profitability, both vital components to maintaining SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Companies can use AI to automate tedious marketing tasks (such as lead generation and ad targeting), maximizing both advertising ROI and conversation rates. And with ML features, developers can track user activity to more accurately segment and sell products to the user base (with conversion incentives, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



 5. Pricing optimization. 



<p>Managing IT infrastructure can be an expensive undertaking, especially for an enterprise running a large network of cloud-native applications. AI and ML features help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-cost-management">minimize cloud expenditures (and cloud waste)</a> by automating SaaS process responsibilities and streamlining workflows.</p>



<p>Using AI-generated predictive analytics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-spend-management/">real-time financial observability tools</a>, teams can anticipate resource usage fluctuations and allocate network resources accordingly. SaaS analytics also enable decision-makers to identify underutilized or problematic assets, preventing over- and under-spending and freeing up capital for app innovations and improvements.</p>

				  Add additional features to existing credential systems while preserving their original functionality with Indicio Proven.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The emerging age of digital credentials will transform how we interact digitally, prove identity, and share data. The benefits will be reduced fraud and friction, increased data privacy and security, and the ability to create seamless processes based on data that can be instantly verified and acted on.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of credentials for different needs: some offer only basic authorization; others can manage the kind of data sharing and verification that are essential for business. The key is to be able to interoperate between the two, where a credential with limited features can be given a wrapper that preserves its original function while providing the advanced features of other credential types.</p>
<p>Enter Indicio Proven’s newest feature: a credential bridge. It’s a simple way to bridge the gap between limited and more advanced credential features and allow participation in multiple credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>For example, the Microsoft Entra Verified Identity Platform has basic features but is widely available. It only supports one credential type (JSON Web Token VC), and one DID method (DID: web); it doesn’t support OpenID4VCI (essential to interoperate with European Union’s preferred digital identity protocol), has limited digital wallet support (Microsoft Authenticator), limited governance capability, and doesn’t contain the privacy-preserving features of other verifiable credential types.</p>
<p>These features may not matter to some users, but, increasingly, we see enterprise and public sector organizations around the world opting for more expansive features to meet business, customer, and citizen needs. Why shut yourself out of these ecosystems?</p>
<p>Using Indicio Proven as your credential bridge, you don’t have to limit your options because it’s not a case of one or the other. Now, you can wrap an Entra identity in different credential formats, preserve the underlying capacity to verify it as an Entra identity, and take advantage of Indicio’s:</p>
 
 Support for additional DID methods 
 Selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, and predicate proofs to share data in privacy-preserving ways. 
 Support for additional OIDC specs for interoperability with the EU. 
 Support for additional communication protocols such as DIDComm, which opens up the capacity of direct, secure communication between DID holders. 
 Enable use of peer DIDs for subjects, which improves security 
 Convert to additional credential types such AnonCreds, SD-JWT, BBS+, mDoc/mDL. 
 
<p>The point is — don’t get locked into a single path when the technology is advancing rapidly. It is highly unlikely that there will ever be a single credential format or protocol that does everything. So why not be able to use them all?</p>

<p>An explosion in new financial services experiences, powered by fintech apps for consumers and small businesses, has propelled the rise of open banking technology in the U.S. and around the world. Every player in the consumer finance arena must now rethink what is possible when consumers and small businesses have full control of their financial lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) is embracing this moment of innovation with the long-awaited Dodd-Frank Section 1033 open banking rule, which will accelerate the adoption of open banking technologies and protect consumer interests as we move further into the digital future. This proposed rule is set to be finalized in the second half of 2024. With decades of leadership in data responsibility, Mastercard’s principles align with the tenets of CFPB rulemaking and our role is to protect this data.</p>



<p>Mastercard has created this primer to outline the provisions of CFPB Section 1033 and explain how banks, fintechs and other holders of consumer financial data will be affected by the proposed rule. Read on to discover what CFPB rulemaking means for you — and how Mastercard equips customers to thrive in this new landscape.&nbsp;</p>

 What is the CFPB?&nbsp; 



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the United States federal government, established in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis to protect consumers’ interests in financial markets and promote long-term stability in the broader economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, better known as Dodd-Frank, to provide a single point of accountability for protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive financial practices and to taking action against companies that break the law.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What does the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1033 say about consumers’ rights to access financial data?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes consumers’ right to access financial data associated with the financial products and services they use, such as credit cards, deposits and savings accounts.&nbsp; This data includes account details, transactions, balances and more (see “<a>What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?</a>” below), and is subject to rules put forward by the CFPB.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What is the CFPB’s role in Section 1033 rulemaking?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 gives the CFPB authority to issue rules governing personal financial data rights.&nbsp; The CFPB has been working toward implementing this rulemaking since 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some key milestones include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 publishing a set of consumer protection principles (2017)&nbsp; 



 holding a symposium on consumer access to financial records (2020)&nbsp; 



 releasing detailed documentation of rulemaking proposals and alternatives under consideration (2022)&nbsp; 



 convening a Small Business Review Panel and issuing a report of its findings (2023)&nbsp; 
 



<p>In October 2023, the bureau released its proposed rule and opened a period of public comment through December 29, 2023. Since then, the CFPB has been working to finalize the written regulations. Once it takes effect, the proposed rule will serve as implementation of Dodd-Frank Section 1033.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What parties are impacted by the CFPB Section 1033?&nbsp; 



 
 Data providers – financial institutions and&nbsp;some payment facilitators 



 Third-party data recipients – fintechs and financial institutions acting on consumers’ behalf as data recipients and data aggregators acting on their behalf 



 Qualified industry standard-setting bodies – CFPB-recognized issuers of fair, open, and inclusive industry standards<br> 
 



 How does the proposed rulemaking impact personal financial data rights?&nbsp; 



<p>Broadly speaking, the CFPB open banking rule is a framework of regulations and industry standards that provides consumers with ownership and rights to control their financial data; enhanced consumer protections; and consistency in how data can be accessed and used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposal will require financial institutions and some payment facilitators to make financial data available to consumers and authorized third-party data recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed rule also:&nbsp;</p>



 
 outlines obligations and limitations for how companies must collect, use and store consumer data&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 requires banks to share data in a standardized format via safe and secure application programming interfaces (APIs)&nbsp; 



 seeks to empower consumers with their financial data&nbsp; 



 enables better access to financial products&nbsp; 



 and jump-starts competition between banks of all sizes, fintechs and other digital players&nbsp;<br> 
 



 What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?&nbsp; 



 
 Transaction information, including amounts, dates, payees, historical data, and fees.&nbsp; 



 Account balances&nbsp; 



 Account and routing numbers, both tokenized and non-tokenized&nbsp; 



 Terms and conditions, including fee schedules, rates, rewards terms and overdraft coverage&nbsp; 



 Information on upcoming bills, such as minimum payment amounts 



 Basic account verification information, including names, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.&nbsp;<br> 
 



 When does the open banking regulation take effect?&nbsp; 



<p>While the CFPB hasn’t given an exact date, it has indicated that it will finalize the proposed rule toward the end of 2024, with a tiered compliance timeline to follow, which makes it even more important that financial service providers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>



 
 First, the CFPB must finalize the rulemaking.&nbsp;
 
 While the bureau hasn’t given an exact date, CFPB Section 1033 is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2024, most likely in the fall.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Third parties must comply within 60 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 For consumer-authorized third parties, the CFPB proposed rule becomes effective 60 days from the date of the final rulemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 The proposed timeline for complying with the CFPB rule varies based on the size of the financial institution. Banks and other institutions that hold deposits will have between six months and four years to comply, based on their assets. Non-deposit institutions will have six or 12 months, depending on annual revenue. The CFPB has detailed this tiered approach as follows:&nbsp;

 <br>How can Mastercard help?&nbsp; 



<p>At Mastercard, we believe that consumers own their financial data; they should be in control of how and by whom it is used and should benefit from its use. Mastercard’s role is to protect this data and help data providers do the same. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposed rule calls for secure permissioned data-sharing across developer interfaces, or APIs. Navigating this compliance is going to be complex, as financial institutions must decide to build APIs on their legacy infrastructure or outsource, as well as addressing other areas, including but not limited to consent management, info security, and third-party risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Bug bounty programs are sometimes viewed with a negative connotation for a variety of reasons. This post aims to overcome implementation obstacles by debunking those misconceptions, and providing recommendations for organizations as they embark on the bug bounty journey.</p> 
 What Is a Bug Bounty Program?  
<p>First a quick definition. A bug bounty program is a security scheme offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers where individuals are paid to find security vulnerabilities. These programs incentivize independent security researchers and ethical hackers to discover and report potential flaws, making the technology more secure and reducing breach risk. So why don’t more companies have them?&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Objections to Bug Bounty Programs  
<p>I’ve been involved in a few companies where bug bounty programs were generally perceived negatively. Colleagues gave a number of reasons for not implementing a bug bounty program. These included:</p> 
  
  Too expensive  
  Takes several months before seeing results  
  It’s hard to manage and is extremely time-consuming  
  Researchers can be hostile  
  Quality of findings can be inadequate  
  
<p>However, I’ve been fully managing a bug bounty program for more than two years now and I can attest that these concerns are essentially baseless.&nbsp;</p> 
 Financial Concerns  
<p>The financial concern is misplaced since it’s significantly cheaper to find a critical vulnerability by doing a routine penetration test, or through a controlled bug bounty program, than if one of your customers discovers that vulnerability and demands a fix as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The consequences of customers and prospects finding security issues in an application can range from reduced confidence in your product, to actually losing an opportunity because the prospect considers the application insecure. This is far more expensive than the average bug bounty program. Not to mention the financial consequences of an actual security breach caused by a vulnerability.</p> 
 Results Timeline&nbsp;  
<p>Results can be obtained almost instantly. The researchers are usually highly motivated and working across multiple different time zones. Moreover, unlike penetration testing programs, which usually take place at specific points in time, bug bounty researchers test continuously. This allows you to constantly have an up-to-date understanding of your risk.</p> 
 Management and Scope  
<p>Bug bounty partner/platforms aid significantly when it comes to program management.</p> 
<p>Organizations hesitant to implement a bug bounty program can start by setting a private program that provides access to only a limited number of researchers. This gives organizations more control over the program and limits the number of reports they receive. A private program helps address concerns both about an overwhelming influx of reports and the cost of bug bounty rewards.</p> 
<p>Organizations can include production assets in the scope of their programs by disallowing certain types of testing. Common exclusions include denial of service attacks, social engineering, self-inflicting vulnerabilities, etc.</p> 
 Submissions Management  
<p>This is a more extensive topic that we will be covering in a future post, along with guidance on managing inadequate findings and researchers.</p> 
 Suggestions To Get Started  
 Preparing the Test Environment  
<p>For smaller organizations, it is usually easier to run a bug bounty program when the company only has one main core product or a limited number of offers. For larger companies that have hundreds of applications and thousands of endpoints, providing full access for testers can become a challenge.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ideally, a new test environment that researchers can freely use to run all the needed tests will be provided. If this is not possible, most companies already have a testing environment without any real data, which can be used for providing access to researchers.</p> 
 Including Production Assets  
<p>It is recommended to include all production assets in scope for a bug bounty program, otherwise companies will likely miss vulnerabilities that are only applicable to production applications and configurations. This doesn’t necessarily mean encouraging load testing in production, rather, if somebody finds an issue in production, it must be rewarded.</p> 
<p>For example, wouldn't you like to know if a person with limited resources and an open source web scanner were able to bring down an entire production environment? That’s certainly something I’d like to fix if it happened.</p> 
<p>HYPR has made significant performance improvements by analyzing the scan patterns that researchers performed in production assets. Furthermore, even if these assets are not included under the scope, there’s usually nothing stopping actors on the internet from scanning assets that require authentication.</p> 
 Final Recommendations  
  
  Use an existing platform: Implementing a bug bounty program can be challenging and there are many recommended bug bounty platforms that can help your organization get started in no time, and they handle all the communications, accounts, payouts (especially international payments), etc.&nbsp;  
  Start with a private program: A private program will limit the amount of researchers and initial time invested.  
  Implement guardrails: If there are some assets/domains/vulnerabilities that shouldn’t be included, these can be marked as out of scope.  
  Define payouts: Bounties are a great way to motivate researchers to participate in a program. Consider increasing the bounties whenever possible — use other bug bounty participating companies in your space for guidance.  
  Include all assets in scope: Production-like environments can be added instead of production if there are concerns.

<p>Healthcare technology is rapidly evolving and digital healthcare is now the norm. In order to deliver healthcare online, payer and provider organizations need the ability to securely and seamlessly share member and patient data across their various digital healthcare systems. Interoperability and modern identity and access management (IAM) are what make this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s (ONC) 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule was enacted. A significant component of the ONC’s Cures Act is its focus on interoperability. Electronic Medical Record (EMR)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complying with the Cures Act for interoperability requires the use of two standards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>&nbsp;SMART Health IT’s Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies (SMART) standard</p>
 
 <p>HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these two standards are what’s known as SMART on FHIR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ONC’s Rule and SMART on FHIR the stage is set for a more connected, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare system where clinical data can be more readily shared and accessed by healthcare providers, payers, consumers, and app developers alike.​</p>

  <p>"The AI Pivot" session at EIC 2024 offers a deep dive into the transformative journey from traditional product- and vendor-centric (digital) business models to robust, networked and agents based platform ecosystems in the AI-driven digital landscape. This transition marks a critical inflection point, heralding a new era where the confluence of technology, data, privacy and network effects reshapes industry paradigms and redefines the way we interact with the world.</p>
<p>12 years ago, KuppingerCole launched a Research Note decribing "Life Management Platforms" (LMP) as user-centric tools to support every-day tasks such as storage for sensitive documents and information, personal finance, investment and insurance management with high privacy and security standards. LMPs by definition were able to manage permissions and gave users control over their information sharing.</p>
<p>Since then, a number of such platforms were launched by different vendors and organizations covering parts or the whole set of features described in KuppingerCole´s research. Meeco has been and still is one of the first vendors of LMPs with a focus on financial applications.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since release of the KuppingerCole LMP paper: Decentralized Identity, Gen AI, Wallets, GDPR, eIDAS (2)... and more technologies, standards, governance frameworks and legislation came up since then and is about time to rewrite this profound part of research in the area of human-digital interaction.</p>
<p>Today we describe the former LMP concept as multi-agent based life management ecosystems that help us humans in all aspects of our daily life. They store our documents, buy our food online, navigate our vehicle, help us reducing the our CO2 footprint to a minimum, help us to stay healthy and to get wealthy, be productive at work or in school, manage our calendars propose holiday destinations and make appointments. We talk about agents we let do things for us within such Life Management Ecosystems in a privacy-by-design, secure by default, decentralized, vendor agnostic way. Globally.</p>
 A rough description of such an Ecosystem: 
 Decentralized and Self-Sovereign 
<p>Decentralization is a key aspect of these ecosystems, ensuring that no single entity has control over the entire system. This is achieved through the use of multi-agent systems, where multiple autonomous entities (agents) interact with each other to achieve their goals<br>These agents can share resources, including knowledge, information, contracts, trust, benefits, and goals<br>Self-sovereignty is another important aspect, where individuals have control over their own data. This is in line with the privacy-by-design principle, which ensures that privacy considerations and protections are embedded into the design and operation of the system</p>
 Multi-Agent AI and Edge AI 
<p>Multi-agent AI systems are used to simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to recreate and predict complex phenomena<br>These systems are used in many scientific domains including biology, ecology, and social science<br>Edge AI refers to the process of moving AI algorithms from the cloud and implementing them locally on a hardware device. The algorithms are run locally on the hardware device, allowing for real-time processing and decision-making, which is crucial for many applications in a life management ecosystem.</p>
 Wallets 
<p>(Global) Wallets are digital wallets that allow users to store and manage their digital identities, assets, and data. These wallets are designed to be secure and privacy-preserving, aligning with the principles of privacy-by-design and secure by default.</p>
 Privacy-by-Design 
<p>Privacy-by-design is a principle that ensures privacy is seamlessly integrated into products, services, and system designs by default<br>It promotes transparency about data usage, fostering accountability for how user data is collected, processed, and stored<br>This approach aligns with ethical principles by respecting user autonomy and promoting responsible data usage</p>
 Secure by Default 
<p>Secure by default means that products are resilient against prevalent exploitation techniques out of the box without added charge<br>These products protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities without end-users having to take additional steps to secure them<br>Vendor Agnostic<br>Being vendor agnostic means that the ecosystem is designed to work with technologies and applications from any vendor<br>This ensures interoperability, where multiple departments, systems, technologies, and applications work together for the same goal</p>
 eIDAS 2 Compliance 
<p>eIDAS 2 is a set of regulations in the European Union that govern electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. Compliance with eIDAS 2 ensures that the ecosystem adheres to the highest standards of security, privacy, and trust.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a multi-agent based life management ecosystem leverages a combination of advanced technologies and robust governance principles to provide a secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient system that can assist humans in various aspects of their daily life.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-ai-pivot-eic24"></a>

  <p>With the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) the European Union established an European DLT-infrastructure provided by the Member States. This means that the DLT nodes are in the responsibility of the Member States and so ensure a government trust anchor Since EBSI contains own governance and technical specifications together with conformance tests for wallet it provides a comprehensive framework for decentralized digital identities in Europe. EBSI is widely for use cases in education, public sector or traceability and with the eIDAS Bridge already useable within the eIDAS ecosystem.<br> As eIDAS 2.0 is technology neutral it provides the possibility to use the technical advantages of EBSI like distribution, crypto agility or performance (in comparison to existing TrustLists) on EUDI Alle,t QEAA but also trusted issuer registries, existing interoperability on decentralized identities based on established standards like W3CVC Data Model, ETSI ESI (especially reg. digital signatures as thexy are required for QEAA acc. eIDAS 2.0) also in eIDAS 2.0. As eIDAS 2.0 is not built on a green field EBSI also supports wide adoption of EUDI Wallet and related (qualified) trust services, as EBSI is already established infrastructure in Europe <br> With Section 11 the eIDAS 2.0 on the other hand introduce a dedicate qualified trust service for Electronic Ledger. This allows the provision of EBSI by fully liable QTSP under eIDAS 2.0 and allows the broad utilization of DLT for use cases like supply chain &amp; digital product passport (acc. EU Supply Chain Act), Organizational Digital Identity, Social Security, secure Data sharing etc. Within EBSI-VECTOR and EBSI-TRACE4EU more than 80 partners from all member states work on the establishment of a real decentralized and distributed ecosystem using EBSI as common infrastructure in Europe.<br><br> The session focus on the role of EBSI in the eIDAS 2.0 ecosystem so:</p>
 
 Legal Framework for EBSI within eIDAS 2.0 
 Needs on Governance in EBSI for adoption of eIDAS 2.0 
 Technical Framework 
 UseCases and Business Models for Wallets and QTSP using Ledger as well as QTSP for Ledger with EBSI and other DLT networks

  <p>In June 2023, the German Ministry of Interior presented the whitepaper "Beyond EU Digital Identity Wallet" as a kickoff for the project to define the concept for the upcoming eIDAS 2.0 identity ecosystem in Germany. The project intends to actively involve the public and civil society, citizens and the private sector in a transparent and open process. The main objective is to define a concept for an eIDAS-compliant architecture for Germany that ensures trustworthy and EU-wide interoperable wallets and support relevant use cases to German residents with state of the art user experience in a sustainable way. It will evaluate various options for issuance and maintenance of EUDI Wallet and then build and test a prototype for this infrastructure. A first revision of the Wallet architecture proposal was published in December 2023 on OpenCode. In our session, we will review the progress of the project and present the current status of the Wallet Architecture document and give an outlook of the upcoming developments and workshops.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/introduction-german-eudi-wallet-eic24"></a>

  <p>SAML and OpenID started with a simple model of bilateral trust. Relying Parties register with Identity Providers and exchange trust information so that the RP can know that they are talking to Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc. We have also had Smart Cards (PIV/CAC) for authentication based on a certificate signed by someone that chains back to a known trusted root. The smart card approach avoids the RP needing to register but has significant user privacy issues. The research and education communities have long understood the scalability issues with these approaches. This led to the development of SAML2 and SAML metadata being used to represent more complicated trust relationships, where a single RP may allow identities from hundreds of Identity providers without needing to set up bilateral relationships.&nbsp;<br> <br> We are now entering a new world of Identity Wallets that look a lot more like multilateral federations than a simple one-to-one relationship. For these sorts of credentials to be scalable, we need to represent how a RP/Verifier can be part of perhaps hundreds of overlapping trust groupings. While it might be practical in just the EU to issue special TLS certificates to RP so that they can ask for credentials, that quickly breaks down if multiple countries outside the EU decide that is a good model.<br> <br> This presentation will look at proposed trust models and explore how a number of implementations are using OpenID Federation to address these scalability issues.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multilateral-federation-eic24"></a>

While the EU has the benefit of eIDAS 2.0, other countries and regions still struggle with how to take advantage of digital identity credentials issued outside their borders. The challenges go beyond technical standards: it's not just about the structure of the data, it's also about how that data is verified, what level of assurance is offered, privacy considerations, and more. <br> <br> Making digital identity globally interoperable is a fundamental necessity for everything from education to finance and trade. It is the basis for social and financial inclusion as humans move around the world This session will review where efforts are underway to improve the global interoperability of identity and where there are still gaps, both in policy and technology, that need attention.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-interoperability-of-digital-identity-eic24"></a>

  <p>OIX has analysed eight Digital ID trust frameworks: US, Canada, EU, UK, Singapore, Thailand, MOSIP and Bank ID Sweden. The goal was to see if their policies could be expressed in a consistent way to enable interoperability of IDs across these eco-systems. The analysis found they share 75 common policy rule characteristics with 283 possible values. This is the DNA of Digital ID: trust frameworks are the same species but address the policy issues using a varied characteristics to meet local approaches to privacy, risk, security, and identity assurance. Our conclusion is that convergence of frameworks to a common set of policy criteria is unlikely, as they are necessarily different. Therefore, we have created a tool to allow policy criteria to be expressed and exchanged between trust frameworks and other parties.</p>
<p>This session will share:</p>
 
 An overview of our analysis of the eight trust frameworks 
 The contents of the DNA of Digital ID open criteria exchange framework 
 How the policy criteria will be used in a mixture of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ decision 
processes to enable roaming wallets
 How dynamic level of assurance assessments can be made.

The “traditional way” of dealing with shadow admins is mapping all of them and letting the identity team decide what to do with it. This approach can work only if the number of shadow admins is small, however, our research, that is based on data of more than 50 organizations, reveals that in most of the big organizations there are hundreds of shadow admins and sometimes even more.<br><br>We will present a novel method that not only finds the shadow admins, but also recommends the identity team which permissions should be revoked to mitigate as many shadow admins as possible. For instance, we discovered that in most organizations more than 70% of the shadow admins can be resolved by revoking one single permission. Our method is based on algorithmic tools and AI. We will share the core concepts of it and show a few real-life examples.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-based-approach-shadow-admins-eic24"></a>

We will explore typical patterns such as isolating accounts, systems, credentials, and networks. Additionally, we will discuss the various options available for defining privileged assets and access, as well as the potential for running Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) projects in parallel with PAM.</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect to consider is the concept of tier models and security domains. We will explore the role of different intermediaries, including Jump Hosts, Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs), and Agents, and their varying security properties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will address the often overlooked aspect of managing Secure Shell (SSH) keys within PAM. Lastly, we will touch upon the importance of having robust procedures in place to handle critical situations in emergency mode.</p>
<p>By understanding these PAM design patterns, organizations can assess their current practices and identify areas for improvement. This talk aims to provide valuable insights and practical guidance for organizations seeking to enhance their PAM programs and align with leading industry practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-design-patterns-eic24"></a>

   Are role models and least privileged at odds? When defining roles, we tend to grant more access in one role to avoid having to create multiple similar roles or managing exceptions. So where does that leave our pursuit of implementing a least privileged access model in a zero trust environment?

  <p>UN Strategic Development Goal 16.9 is to bring identity to 8 Billion people… what about enabling 8 billion people to have access to Digital Identity? How can we ensure digital identities are interoperable across borders? What do we need the G20 to do to help accelerate the work already underway? <br> <br> This MasterClass is will engage in these questions and more in the context of the Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI Hub) effort “to define what we need to achieve global interoperability for digital identity.” The SIDI Hub builds upon the OECD Recommendations on the Governance of Digital Identity (38 country adherents), and the “Human-Centric Digital Identity” whitepaper (cobranded by 13 non-profits). The first SIDI Summit was held last November, and convened experts from 21 non-profits, 22 countries, and 4 multilateral organizations (OECD, UN, World Bank, EU), to discuss whether to pursue interoperable digital identity, and if so how to achieve it? The findings of the first event were clear… 92% of attendees agreeing to continue the work in 2024, and the group achieved initial consensus on the tactics that can help the global community achieve digital identity interoperability in practice. <br> <br> During the MasterClass, participants will be asked to take part in an interactive survey. This data will be used to inform the SIDI Hub approach in 2024, and the G20 discussions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/prepare-for-g20-eic24"></a>

  <p>eBay is a global marketplace that empowers hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, trading articles worth around 90 billion dollars every year. We provide new financial services to our sellers, such as keeping funds in the users' accounts for reusing them on eBay to purchase items or to buy shipping labels. In order to secure the accounts of our European sellers and to be compliant with the PSD2 regulation, eBay requires sellers in the EU and UK to use two-factor authentication on our marketplace. This talk describes the journey of eBay offering various two-factor authentications to our millions of users. In particular, eBay was among the first large tech companies offering FIDO2 passkey authentication. We also authenticate access to regulated APIs via eIDAS certificates for licensed third-party providers, as well as protect other sensitive APIs via digital signatures over the payload.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ebays-identity-journey-eic24"></a>

  <p>Generative AI offers remarkable potential for innovation, but we must be vigilant about its dark side. As technology evolves, so do the tactics of cybercriminals, but the important thing to note is that we are actually dealing with a recognizable playbook and we have the tools to meet the challenge. By adopting proactive fraud prevention and strong authentication measures and fostering a culture of awareness, we can strive to harness the full potential of generative AI while protecting ourselves from the potential for misuse. Join us for a thought-provoking session on what this means practically and how to combine the available tools to effectively combat the risks of AI generated identity theft.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/dark-side-of-innovation-eic24"></a>

  <p>Bots are a scourge on customer identity and access management systems before, during and after the login process. How can we use the power of AI to find malicious bots and protect users while minimizing friction? This session presents real-life examples of bot attacks, AI-based bot mitigation techniques, quantifies their efficacy, and explores what's next for AI in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>AI Chatbots can do your homework, but can they safeguard your users while ensuring a seamless user experience? During this session, we share our firsthand experiences in creating AI controls that strike a balance between robust user protection and minimal user friction.</p>
<p>First, you must know your enemy. Our session will provide a comprehensive perspective from the vantage point of a Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) provider: geographical origins of bots, the networks they exploit, their targets (based on factors such as enterprise size and industry), their tactics to achieve their primary objectives, often revolving around financial gains.</p>
<p>With the backdrop of these threat actors' attempts to exploit CIAM systems, we compare three distinct approaches: a no-control baseline, rule-based controls, and AI-based controls.</p>
<p>AI-driven defenses demonstrate significant improvement from the rule-based baseline systems. Furthermore, an unexpected byproduct of a performing adaptive system like this one, is its quantifiable deterrent effect on bots (Like a lock on a bike, bots are deterred to easier targets).</p>
<p>But are AI-based bot mitigation techniques able to maintain a seamless user experience? The diminution of bot traffic has measurable advantages (more precise modeling of ‘normal’ traffic, ability to see higher quality/lower volume attacks), but AI-systems are probabilistic and cannot be perfect. False Positive Rates (How many humans are challenged by the security control) are a concern for many customers. We discuss tools and recommendations for customer-driven adjustment of risk/friction ratio. We wrap up this section with lessons learned from our journey implementing AI technology in protecting users.</p>
<p>We believe that AI controls will continue to improve user security while simultaneously minimizing friction for users. Then, what is the next challenge for AI-systems in CIAM? Our position is that upcoming challenges will demand paying attention to explainability, privacy and compliance. We are at the dawn of legislation on data privacy and ethics of AI systems, and AI-systems will need to be adequately explainable (deep neural networks aren’t, nor are LLMs) to meet compliance standards. Next year’s security systems will have to balance a third weight in the equation: Security vs Friction vs Explainability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/minimizing-friction-with-ai-eic24"></a>

   OAuth is a widely used authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user. However, it has historically been difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last six years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.

  <p>OAuth is a widely used authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user. However, it has historically been difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last six years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.<br> <br> There are challenges when trying to achieve high security and interoperability with OAuth 2: There are many potential threats, some not part of the original OAuth threat model. For seamless authorizations, optionality must be minimized in OAuth itself and also in any extensions used.<br> <br> Seven years ago, the IETF OAuth working group began work on the Security Best Current Practice document and more recently on OAuth 2.1. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation has created FAPI1 and FAPI2 security profiles.<br> <br> We will help you understand the focus of each document and when to use which. We show how to achieve on-the-wire interoperability and security using techniques like asymmetric client authentication and sender-constraining via DPoP and MTLS, discussing the benefits and potential disadvantages of each. We highlight the benefits for implementers and the role of conformance testing tools.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/high-security-interoperable-oauth-eic24"></a>

  <p>Traditional federation agreements are relatively static. It takes some effort to onboard an IdP and RP to each other, but once that trust is established, it's good until some exceptional event breaks the federation.<br> <br> But what about a more dynamic world, one where trust comes and goes based on context? What if users could be provisioned dynamically into a space based on trust from elsewhere? What if an isolated space could still function in a disconnected state and still have powerful security properties? What if these isolated spaces could reconnect to the network and provide audit capabilities and security signaling to other components throughout the wide ecosystem? And what if all of this could be built on a layer of trusted software that didn't rely on pre-placing keys or accounts ahead of time?<br> <br> This isn't addressed by only using local accounts, or creating and distributing shards of a global truth.

  <p>Starting from October 2024, all companies with critical infrastructure are mandated to grant access to their IT systems to customers and employees solely through secure multi-factor authentication. This requirement poses a significant challenge for businesses, especially in maintaining customer conversion rates. Implementing this regulatory obligation by adding a second factor (e.g., one-time password via SMS, email, or a separate authenticator app) incurs additional efforts for users and extra costs for companies.</p>
<p>Solution: PwC introduces the One-Click Login approach, a method that transitions existing authentication mechanisms, based solely on usernames and passwords, to a passwordless approach with an additional factor. Through a white-label SDK, which can be integrated into mobile customer and employee apps, the login process is simplified for the user to a single click by utilizing biometrics and device binding. The presentation will detail the necessary onboarding process and the integration with an existing IAM system, using the Ping Identity Suite (formerly Forgerock) as an example. It emphasizes simplifying the user flow and showcasing the advantages for businesses compared to other multi-factor authentication solutions.</p>
<p>Further Use: By linking the white-label SDK with an integrated wallet function, this use case also demonstrates how wallet-based solutions already provide value to businesses and users today (before the introduction of the EUDI Wallet). The presentation will further explore how additional attributes can be incorporated into the mobile wallet for use in single sign-on across various systems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mfa-according-to-nis2-eic24"></a>

  <p>What differentiates a digital identity wallet system from the currently widely deployed federated identity system is users' ability to be able to present attributes about themselves directly to the service provider, instead of being redirected to the Identity Provider who attests attributes about the users on their behalf. Anticipated advantages of digital identity wallets include, businesses can hope to lower their COGS by being able to perform user identification cheaper and faster, and users can hope to have a more seamless digital experience where they can more granularly control their digital personas.</p>
<p>The industry has come a long way understanding what it takes to build scalable and interoperable digital identity wallet systems. However, the work to make these wallets mainstream, where an ordinary user enjoys using the wallet and feels its benefits, remains.</p>
<p>This talk would discuss three key aspects needed to "cross the chasm": 1) build rails that issuers, wallets and verifiers can use to establish trust in each other; 2) agree on the incremental approach, agree on an 'initial' set of interoperable standards and stop pulling in multiple directions; 3) focus on a minimum set of wallet functions that users can easily understand the benefit and usability of.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-mainstream-eic24"></a>

  <p>There are serious challenges with our IAM environments. Year after year, we see identity-related attacks resulting in major breaches.</p>
<p>Technical baggage and assumptions from our past are holding us back. Zero Trust, rightly, advises us to verify trust again, and again. But, with current tools, this can be painful. To shore up weaker authentication systems, we sacrifice MFA user experience on the altar of security – mitigating newer attacks, but chipping away at workforce morale and productivity in the process. Passkeys are starting to help, but they're only the beginning; not the destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can do better. We must do better. The IAM paradigm is already starting to shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this thought-provoking keynote address, Josh Green will dive deep into the chasm that separates our current IAM environments from our ideal. With a blend of realism and optimism, Green will unveil the painful pitfalls that bedevil our present systems, delineate actionable strategies we can deploy to fortify our defenses today, and chart a visionary course towards a future where robust identity security is not only viable, but pervasive.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-of-iam-eic24"></a>

That’s the challenge that the Open Identity Exchange, it’s relying party working group and Daon sought to understand by undertaking a facilitated qualitative-research temperature check of opinion across relying parties from diverse sectors such as employment, healthcare, finance, payments, home rental, retail and gambling.</p>
<p>This session will examine the findings of the analysis and explore how some of the challenges might be addressed. Key findings where that relying parties:</p>
 
 need relevancy and clear value. A clear statement of benefits to win over the priorities of other stakeholders. 
 want to solve problems, not focus on technology components. Digital ID is a component not the outcome. 
 get confused and disengaged by jargon. 
 are aware of their social responsibilities and see digital ID as a way that these may be addressed. 
 see weakness and disconnected eco-system thinking. There’s much divergent thinking in the market at the moment which causes confusion and uncertainty. 
 want to know that their regulatory or industry body approves the use of digital identity.

  <p>In the realm of identity management within zero trust security frameworks, the "never trust, always verify" paradigm is critical. This approach, a departure from traditional IT security models, assumes no inherent trust in users, devices, or networks, regardless of their location or origin. It emphasizes continuous verification and authentication, fundamentally changing the way access and credentials are managed. <br> <br> In this context, the role of signature schemes in credential issuance is critical. Traditional methods that rely on a single issuing instance are incompatible with the Zero Trust philosophy. To align with this approach, threshold signature schemes become indispensable. These schemes distribute the responsibility of credential issuance across multiple parties (or isolated systems within a domain), thereby eliminating single points of failure in the process. <br> <br> The prominent BBS+ signature scheme stands out in this distributed approach. On the one hand, it offers compatibility with various zero-knowledge proof schemes, and on the other hand, it allows credential holders to selectively disclose certain attributes, thereby strengthening both privacy and security in line with zero-trust principles. However, when adapting schemes like BBS+ to a threshold setting, a key challenge arises: the issuance process becomes highly interactive, requiring continuous communication between all issuers during signing. This interaction creates bottlenecks for systems that need to issue large numbers of credentials and introduces potential security risks by providing additional attack vectors. <br> <br> To overcome these challenges, recent advances in the form of so-called "Pseudorandom Correlation Generators" offer an interesting approach. By facilitating a pre-processing phase, this new cryptographic primitive enables non-interactive credential issuance by schemes such as BBS+, eliminating the need for per-credential issuer communication. This development dramatically reduces communication overhead while ensuring complete isolation between issuing instances. <br> <br> This talk will provide a high-level overview of these advances and their implications for credential issuance in zero-trust environments, highlighting how they can potentially improve the security and efficiency of digital identity management systems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/threshold-signature-schemes-eic24"></a>

  <p>Contemporary institutions and record keeping systems using paper co-arose. Institutions created systems to track interactions with people over time, creating a form of institutional memory by using a range of paper-based technologies such as file record keeping and index card systems. Over the last 60 years, digital identity systems have emerged and continue to improve, thus accelerating the capacity of organizations to form institutional memories. Now we have the emergence of AI and machine learning that will advance this further - making super institutional memory. <br> <br> This session explores a reframe of seeing digital identity systems as institutional memory and considers re-framing the question as how good we want institutional memory to be when building identity systems. This could be a resolution to the race between companies, partially driven by surveillance capitalism, to collect data and regulatory bodies imposing laws and regulations on data collection in the name of “privacy”, some of which have not adjusted for new technology. These two drives are inherently in tension with each other. <br> <br> Asking "how good should institutional memory be'' transcends these two different drives and shifts the challenge of data collection out of a "corporate alone" decision or responsibility. It also invites a broader conversation with the public who interact with institutions and policy makers that regulate them. The answers to this question may be different for different types of institutions, but they can create new norms that bring different sides together to figure out how things should work and understand trade-offs and limits in new technologies such as decentralized identity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-systems-as-institutional-memory-eic24"></a>

<p>As all the requests within the network need to be authenticated, its robustness directly correlates with the overall integrity and continuity of digital and therefore-business operations.</p>
<p>Not only the availability but also low latency is key in global distributed ecosystems.</p>
<p>As experience has shown, one hyperscaler can’t guarantee this high demand in availability on its own.</p>
<p>To fulfill all these needs from businesses, applications and corporate we – together with our partners – came up with an multi region - multi hyperscaler architecture.</p>
<p>This talk will provide insight into the design, benefits, and drawbacks as well as&nbsp;the journey we have taken to reach this goal.</p>

  <p>Non-human identities are getting more and more important. IAM has the challenge to manage them with the same standards as human identities. Over the last years many tools and best practices have been developed to improve the situation. However, the more those identities mimic behavior of humans the harder current concepts work without reducing security and governance. An example is Robot Process Automation (RPA), which aims to automate processes done by humans, often for application which do not offer APIs. Subsequently those tools are using UI automation to achieve this goal. However, zero trust and identity controls like MFA or least privilege will interrupt this business processes automation.

<p>In this session, we will consider the ways in which AI will affect the subset of human interactions associated with financial transactions. The reliability and predictability that is required of systems operating in the general area of “finance,” and the large scales over which it is conducted, depend heavily on more formal, objectively measurable system performance parameters than is the case in many other domains of human behavior.</p>
<p>In the 20 minute presentation by James Garza, the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance will be discussed, particularly focusing on quantitative analysis and reinforcement learning, a subset of AI. Reinforcement learning can be more consistent than human traders, and this reliability allows for consistent and stable returns. Furthermore, reinforcement learning’s ability to rapidly process vast amounts of data helps identify patterns and insights humans might miss. Reinforcement Learning operates as a decision-making agent, learning from the consequences of its actions to maximise long-term rewards while minimising risks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI-powered information elements introduce both helpful and potentially harmful variables into the financial space. Also, the ways in which AI is integrated into finance can offer reproducible patterns for AI implementation in other domains, as well as lessons to be learned about potential system harms.</p>
<p>The session will offer just a glimpse of the potential AI holds for the future of finance. By harnessing AI responsibly, we can create a more inclusive, efficient, and secure financial system for all.</p>
<p>Let’s explore together:</p>
 
 
 
 Future of Personalized Finance: How might AI systems act as financial advisors that know you better than you know yourself? AI-powered algorithms can analyze your spending habits, financial goals, and risk tolerance to create personalized investment portfolios, budgeting plans, and even predict future financial needs. How will AI democratize access to financial advice, previously reserved for the wealthy. 
 Frictionless Transactions: The reliability of finance has historically been associated with endless paperwork to generate auditable paper trails for interaction accounting. AI-powered chatbots can handle routine tasks like account inquiries, fund transfers, and even loan applications, making financial transactions seamless and available 24/7. 
 Enhanced Fraud Detection AI will help to identify patterns of fraudulent activity in real-time, by analyzing massive datasets of transactions to help curb and prevent costly criminal activity. Greater reliability and confidence is a pathway to greater trust in financial systems. 
 Algorithmic Trading: With lightning-fast analysis and the ability to execute trades in milliseconds, AI-powered algorithms are already powering high-frequency trading. In the future, their impact could extend beyond Wall Street, potentially making automated investment management commonplace for individual investors. However, ethical considerations and potential market manipulation risks need careful attention. 
 Democratizing Access to Capital: AI can open doors for those traditionally excluded from traditional financial services. By assessing creditworthiness based on alternative data sources beyond credit scores, AI can enable lenders to extend loans to underserved communities, promoting financial inclusion and economic growth. This also comes with challenges, like ensuring fair and unbiased lending practices. 
 
 
 
<p>By the end of our session, attendees will have a broader perspective on the role of finance among a broad array of information systems, and how financial institutions and processes, and the many processes that are affected by finance, can be changed – for better and worse – with AI.</p>

   The statement that “to know you is to love you” has never been more true or relevant as we face more and more challenges from synthetic identity and AI-driven threats. Identity is no longer just an IT security issue but a key business enabler as businesses work to delight their consumers, partners and employees with frictionless user experiences that also improves the security of access to the data and resources IT works to protect. 
 
 We all know security is a choice people make, and if we make it difficult, people will not choose it. But if we make security seamless and put the control of what personal information can be shared, we can build trust over time and in the end get to know more about our users as we recognize them each time we engage with them.&nbsp; 
 
 In this session, I’ll introduce how IAM practitioners can establish trust through decentralized identity, leverage threat detection and mitigation tools to seamless engage users, and balance frictionless experience and security by implementing an adaptive trust model for governing access entitlements. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/evolution-of-identity-trust-eic24"></a>

Inspired by Clint Eastwood's iconic quote, "Go ahead, make my day!" – a testament to determination and confidence in confronting challenges – we metaphorically align CIAM with taking charge of our digital identities and standing resolute against potential threats.</p>
<p>CIAM emerges as a critical solution in addressing the contemporary digital landscape, ensuring user security and privacy while facilitating seamless and personalized interactions. It equips us with the means to handle user authentication and authorization, uphold their consent, and empower them with control over their data. Through CIAM, we envision a future where user security, privacy, and autonomy reign supreme in both B2B and B2C environments, fostering trust and loyalty among stakeholders.</p>

<p>As organizations strive to harness the power of AI while controlling costs, leveraging anything as a service (XaaS) models emerges as a strategic approach. In this blog, we’ll explore how businesses can use both on-premises and cloud XaaS to control budgets in the age of AI, driving financial sustainability without compromising on technological advancement.&nbsp;</p>







 Embracing the power of XaaS&nbsp; 



<p>XaaS encompasses a broad spectrum of cloud-based and on-premises service models that offer scalable and cost-effective solutions to businesses. From software as a service (SaaS) to infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and beyond, XaaS enables organizations to access cutting-edge technologies and capabilities without the need for upfront investment in hardware or software.&nbsp;</p>



 Harnessing flexibility and scalability&nbsp; 



<p>One of the key advantages of XaaS models is their inherent flexibility and scalability, whether deployed on premises or in the cloud. Cloud-based XaaS offerings provide organizations with the agility to scale resources up or down based on demand, enabling optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency. Similarly, on-premises XaaS solutions offer the flexibility to scale resources within the organization’s own infrastructure, providing greater control over data and security.&nbsp;</p>



 Maintaining cost predictability and transparency&nbsp; 



<p>Controlling budgets in the age of AI requires a deep understanding of cost drivers and expenditure patterns. XaaS models offer organizations greater predictability and transparency in cost management by providing detailed billing metrics and usage analytics. With granular insights into resource consumption, businesses can identify opportunities for optimization and allocate budgets more effectively.&nbsp;</p>



 Outsourcing infrastructure management&nbsp; 



<p>Maintaining and managing on-premises infrastructure for AI workloads can be resource-intensive and costly. By leveraging both cloud-based and on-premises XaaS offerings, organizations can offload the burden of infrastructure management to service providers. Cloud-based XaaS solutions provide scalability, flexibility and access to a wide range of AI tools and services, while on-premises XaaS offerings enable greater control over data governance, compliance and security.&nbsp;</p>



 Accessing specialized expertise&nbsp; 



<p>Implementing AI initiatives often requires specialized skills and expertise in areas such as data science, machine learning and AI development. XaaS models provide organizations with access to a vast ecosystem of skilled professionals and service providers who can assist in the design, development and deployment of AI solutions. This access to specialized expertise enables businesses to accelerate time-to-market and achieve better outcomes while controlling costs.&nbsp;</p>



 Facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation&nbsp; 



<p>In the age of AI, rapid experimentation and innovation are essential for staying ahead of the competition. XaaS models facilitate experimentation by providing businesses with access to a wide range of AI tools, platforms and services on demand. This enables organizations to iterate quickly, test hypotheses and refine AI solutions without the need for significant upfront investment. Embracing a culture of experimentation helps businesses drive innovation while minimizing financial risk.&nbsp;</p>



 Managing budgets effectively&nbsp; 



<p>As organizations navigate the complexities of AI adoption and strive to control budgets, leveraging both on-premises and cloud XaaS models emerges as a strategic imperative. By embracing the flexibility, scalability, cost predictability and access to expertise provided by XaaS offerings, businesses can optimize costs, drive innovation and achieve sustainable growth. Whether deployed on premises or in the cloud, XaaS serves as a catalyst for success, empowering organizations to unlock the full potential of AI while maintaining financial resilience in an ever-evolving business landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The average lost business cost following a data breach was USD 1.3 million in 2023, according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/E3G5JMBP">IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach</a> report. With the rapid emergence of real-time payments, any downtime in payments connectivity can be a significant threat. This downtime can harm a business’s reputation, as well as the global financial ecosystem.</p>



<p>For this reason, it’s paramount that financial enterprises support their resiliency needs by adopting a robust infrastructure that is integrated across multiple environments, including the cloud, on prem and at the edge.</p>



 Resiliency helps financial institutions build customer and regulator confidence 



<p>Retaining customers is crucial to any business strategy, and maintaining customer trust is key to a financial institution’s success. We believe enterprises that prioritize resilience demonstrate their commitment to providing their consumers with a seamless experience in the event of disruption.</p>



<p>In addition to maintaining customer trust, financial enterprises must maintain regulator trust as well. Regulations around the world, such as the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-operational-resilience-act">Digital Operational Resilience Act</a> (DORA), continue to grow. DORA is a European Union regulation that aims to establish technical standards that financial entities and their critical third-party technology service providers must implement in their ICT systems by 17 January 2025.</p>



<p>DORA requires&nbsp;financial institutions to&nbsp;define the business recovery process, service levels and recovery times&nbsp;that are acceptable for their business across processes, including payments. Traditionally, this has caused covered institutions to evaluate their cybersecurity protection measures.</p>



<p>To meet customer and regulator demands, it is critical that financial institutions are proactive and strategic about creating a cohesive strategy to modernize their payments infrastructure with resiliency and compliance at the forefront.</p>



 How IBM helps clients address resiliency in payments 



<p>As the need for operational resilience grows, enterprises increasingly adopt hybrid cloud strategies to store their data across multiple environments including the cloud, on prem and at the edge. By developing a workload placement strategy based on the uniqueness of a financial entity’s business processes and applications, they can optimize the output of these applications to enable the continuation of services 24/7.</p>



<p><a>IBM Cloud</a>®&nbsp;remains committed to providing our clients with an enterprise-grade cloud platform that can help them address resiliency, performance, security and compliance obligations. IBM Cloud also supports mission-critical workloads and addresses evolving regulations around the globe.</p>



<p>To accelerate cloud adoption in financial services, we built <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services">IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a>®, informed by the industry and for the industry. With security controls built into the platform, we aim to help financial entities minimize risk as they maintain and demonstrate their compliance with their regulators.</p>



<p>With approximately 500 industry practitioners across the globe, the expertise of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/payments?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700077912690888&amp;p5=e&amp;p9=58700008538420112&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwl4yyBhAgEiwADSEjeM-7exVj8fuF7QP6UhitENdPBVu5DpRjBGV31xKDI-VxPdQyimH5aBoC4f0QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Payments Center</a>® provides clients with guidance on their end-to-end payments’ modernization journey. Also, clients can use payments as a service, including checks as a service, which can help give them access to the benefits of a managed, secured cloud-based platform that can scale up and down to meet changing electronic payment and check volumes.</p>

<p>This blog has been written as an explainer to support the wider <a href="https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/">Life-Ennobling Economics conversation</a>. It is focused on the LEE aspiration of moving beyond colonising capital and explores how this could be applied to financing a FreeHouse. The work is part of a collaborative initiative between Dark Matter’s Next Economics Lab and Radicle Civics&nbsp;Arc.</p><p>In our work at Dark Matter Labs we talk a lot about the need to respect and steward the shared commons. Whilst a Commons framing is frequently associated with governing communal resources such as grazing land and fishing stocks, it can also be applied to less tangible value flows. Real estate prices are an interesting example. Driven by diverse contributions, from local businesses and schools to parks and improved transport links, the shared value generated is largely captured by privately owned assets. Put another way, public investment is driving private wealth. A logical intervention is to bring land and buildings into common stewardship, rendering embedded dynamics such as price speculation and extractive rent obsolete.</p><blockquote>So far so good but there is a giant elephant in the room: how can we bring a house or a piece of land into common ownership in the first place? Why would an existing property owner give up their rights to receive future benefits? If we need to borrow money and generate future financial returns to secure the initial site, are we simply perpetuating the status quo in the name of a new economy? If the transfer is funded by philanthropy or gifted, how will this translate into shifts in the ‘real’&nbsp;economy?</blockquote> Setting a strong intention for practical action <p>Recently we have received feedback questioning whether this kind of discussion is adding anything of value. There is a rising and palpable sense of frustration. Rhetoric and provocations are one thing, but are they really doing anything to help? Are they of any practical use to those at the frontline of the housing crisis? Actually we agree, but from a yes / and perspective. We absolutely need practical action, but let’s not forget that the actions taken in response to the 2008 financial crisis are a big driver for the mess that we find ourselves in today. Perhaps if more inclusive conversations had taken place, involving diverse voices, things would have evolved differently. We can’t know for sure, but demystifying topics such as finance and governance is core to our&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>So here we are wondering what to do about the entrenched dynamics of housing and the financial system. Where should we start? Probably with a few obvious yet difficult questions: how can we interact with finance to bring a house into common ownership? In doing so, what would be the least extractive way possible? If we manage, what kind of financial setup would ensure that regenerative and equitable intentions sit at the heart of its operations? Critically, how can we test our ideas on the&nbsp;ground?</blockquote><p>We are using the following principles to develop non-extractive pathways for bringing a house into the commons. The aim is to apply these examples to a FreeHouse demonstrator that <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics</a> intend to start work on later this year. We also hope to connect with mainstream financial actors who are innovating in this field to test our assumptions. If you are working in this field and would be interested to join a conversation then please do get in&nbsp;touch:</p><p>Financing principles for a FreeHouse:</p>  No economic rent (generated by the set up funding or in the ongoing operation);  Utilise multi-sensory, ‘buffer’ metrics (to reduce unintended value extraction);  Minimise new money creation (to reduce future claims on finite resources);  IOE — Infinite Outcome Exchange¹ (remove capital from the current extractive, overshoot economy in exchange for infinite economic outcomes e.g. solidarity, knowledge)  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@journosousa?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Aaron Sousa</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>  No economic&nbsp;rent  <p>Economic rent = income derived from ownership or control over a limited asset or resource. Such income is attained without any expenditure or effort on behalf of the resource holder OR the income is in excess of their opportunity cost i.e. the minimum the asset holder would accept to transfer or invest&nbsp;it².</p><p>In the context of a Freehouse, we want to protect against two sources of economic&nbsp;rent:</p>  Re-commoning the House: to begin the Freehouse journey we need to transfer the ownership of the House from the market to the Commons. This involves making a capital payment to the current holders of the property rights. We want to design this initial funding agreement so that the provider of financial capital does not receive any economic&nbsp;rent.  Financing the Commons: once the House is under commons stewardship the intention is that it will generate value to support itself, via activities such as community energy and user contributions. The goal will then be to direct any unused financial surplus to align with the no-rent principle. One example of this would be to create a fund for future house projects to reduce the external capital required on start-up. Surplus above a set percentage could be automatically redistributed to this&nbsp;fund.  <p>2. Utilise, multi-sensory ‘buffer’&nbsp;metrics</p><p>Where measures of success are required to secure funding, we will strive to incorporate indicators that respect the intrinsic and entangled values that are generated by living systems. This principle aims to avoid the erosion of often unnoticed stocks and flows of value in pursuit of a defined one. For example, if outcomes based financing is secured for planned community solar panels, we might unintentionally disrupt vital pollinator habitats in the area surrounding the house whilst striving to meet this singular target. If multi-point and multi-sensory indicators are used to validate outcomes and improve the learning capacity of governance systems, misaligned incentives can be&nbsp;reduced.</p><blockquote>The Rumsfeld Matrix of knowns and unknowns:</blockquote><blockquote>“Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones” — Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence,&nbsp;2002</blockquote><p>3. Minimise future&nbsp;claims</p><p>This principle will keep the amount of new credit used (i.e. commercial bank loans) to a minimum. Where a loan is deemed the most appropriate financing instrument, we will strive to find a product that is linked to existing savings (e.g. Credit Union loans). By doing this, the intention is to take a stand against unsustainable future claims on the environment and increasing fragility of the global financial system. When new money is created, this credit (together with its associated interest) creates a future productive liability, which equates to a future claim on the energy and materials that will be required to settle it. The physical claims are coded into fiat money³ creation and at current levels are essentially a fatal contract with the future of the&nbsp;Earth⁴.</p><p>4. IOE (Infinite Outcome Exchange)</p><p>Here the house will playfully subvert the concept of Outcomes Based Financing. The aim is to provide infinite returns such as reciprocity, trust and knowledge in exchange for non-returnable financial capital. The principle is based on an aspiration to remove fiat money from circulation and thus in a small way weaken its extractive power. In its current form fiat money converts complex, entangled values into an abstract and highly liquid exchange medium. If you wanted to, you could exchange a Canadian lynx for a barrel of oil, potentially even making a profit in the process⁵. Incredibly, you could do so from such an emotional and physical distance that you wouldn’t even need to question the morality of your actions. Our current monetary system rewards the exploitation and pollution of everything that we need to thrive (and even survive), whilst money itself self-perpetuates, creating an ever increasing cycle of destruction.</p><blockquote>How could this work in practice? Perhaps the European Investment Bank (or a development bank) could step up to invest in the non-specific benefits of city transitions? By doing so it could set a precedent to shift outcomes based financing to a new level for other transition initiatives. If the benefits are achieved then the surplus could even be paid-forward to a public trust to improve other local services.</blockquote> Using speculative case studies to test the edges of what might be&nbsp;possible <p>The four speculative case studies described below have been designed to match the motivations of capital holders with the principles outlined above. They might seem far-fetched at first, but for each case study we have included some potential pathways that align with existing organisations and financial motivations. The next step will be to socialise them with people working in these areas for critical feedback.</p><blockquote>We are genuinely curious and open to be challenged. What are we missing? What are we getting wrong? Are there similar or adjacent innovations being developed?</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lunarts?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Volodymyr Hryshchenko</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>1Layered economy&nbsp;approach</p><p>This will involve looking at the different economies that the House will be part of (e.g. land, materials, energy generation, right-of-use) and matching them to appropriate funding streams. This could take the form of a portfolio of investments, loans and grants which have differential interest rates depending on the activity supported. The idea would be to create a matching platform to work out where differential interest rates, grants or preferential loans terms that are already on offer can be matched with elements of the House’s economy. For the model to remain non-extractive each funding stream will need to be carefully assessed in terms of fair effort or opportunity cost (for example an ultra low interest rate would be a significant opportunity cost for the investor).</p><p>As an example, a three way split could be proposed as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Right-of-use economy: for the areas of the House that are designated for residents, an ultra long-term loan (10 years +) could be used to secure a fixed monthly cost. This might suit a private impact investor or local pension scheme interested in supporting just transition outcomes.  Creative economy: for paying guests (accommodation and events), a more flexible shorter-term loan could be arranged based on forecast guest income. Potentially, paydowns could be planned to align with the busy visiting periods i.e. immediately after summer. For this type of funding to meet the ‘no economic rent’ principle the lender could commit to developing pathways to make it easier for other mixed housing models to access preferential loan rates. An example would be to use the <a href="http://www.positivemoney.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021_Building-Renovation-TLTROs.pdf">ECB’s TLTROs</a> (targeted long term refinancing operations) as an onramp for other alternative housing&nbsp;models.  Generative systems: grants or incentivised green loans could support the installation of renewable energy systems. The surplus generated would provide additional income to paydown the other loans further in the&nbsp;future.  <p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actors: private impact investor, local pension fund, business lenders, government matched funding for green initiatives.  Motivations: reputation, ESG compliance, political pressure for banks to play their part in a just transition.  Proposed agreement: mixed contracts via a central platform.  Potential partners / collaborators: Positive Money Europe has been<a href="https://unlock.green/about/"> campaigning</a> for commercial banks to play their part in green home renovations by leveraging European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy instruments. One suggested pathway is to channel preferential interest rates offered on TLTROs (targeted long term refinancing operations) towards sustainability loans. These loans can be at extremely low or even negative interest rates. A coalition of German development banks recently co-issued <a href="https://www.imug-rating.de/en/news-en/first-german-social-community-bond-wins-environmental-finances-bond-award-2023/">a social bond</a> linked to affordable housing provision and might be interested in providing low interest finance (Investitionsbank des Landes Brandenburg<a href="http://www.ilb.de/"> (ILB)</a>, <a href="http://www.ifbhh.de/">IFB Hamburg</a>, <a href="http://www.isb.rlp.de/">ISB&nbsp;Mainz</a>)  <blockquote>Terms like targeted ‘long term financing operations’ and ‘central bank monetary policy instruments’ can seem technocratic and removed from everyday life. In reality, they are not as complicated as we might be led to believe. For example, TLTROs are simply long-term loans made by the European Central Bank to commercial banks, at low or even negative interest rates, to stimulate lending to customers⁶. Organisations like Positive Money are doing a brilliant job of debunking and opening these topics up for conversation. In fact, central banks exist in service of economic stability so their role in addressing the public housing crisis would seem a logical extension of their current&nbsp;remit.</blockquote><p>2Resilience investment mortgage</p><p>This proposal is based on the risk exposure of mortgage providers. Tighter ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting requirements are forcing lenders to openly state their strategies for hedging against cascading climate and social risks. We see this as an opportunity to design a new class of mortgage, where the provider makes an advanced purchase order for future resilience as part of the agreement. In practical terms, this would mean that a proportion of the mortgage loan would not be repayable. Initially this would be a direct cost to the mortgage provider, based on the risk of future weather damage or defaults due to the rising cost of living. The remainder of the mortgage would be a standard arrangement where the House would make regular repayments plus interest. However, the advance resilience discount would in effect reduce the interest paid compared to a regular mortgage.</p><p>For example:</p><p>If the cost of the property was EUR 200,000 and the future risk was assessed at&nbsp;15%</p>  Risk cost = EUR 16k (15% *&nbsp;200,000)  Base mortgage = EUR 184 (residual value)  <blockquote>We appreciate that not everyone is interested, familiar or comfortable with accounting. This is actually something we would like to address. Why should the inner workings of professions like accountancy remain out of reach? Given their impact on decision making at the highest levels, it seems a missed opportunity to leave it in the hands of a small sector of society. For anyone that is interested the accounting entries on the mortgage providers books could work as&nbsp;follows:</blockquote><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: a mortgage provider with a high volume of mortgage loans in a specific&nbsp;area.  Motivation: protecting against the future risk of mortgage defaults (e.g. caused by extreme weather, cost of living pressures).  Proposed agreement: Part advance purchase order, part mortgage.  Potential partners / collaborators: Mortgage providers who are innovating in the field such as <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/business/corporate-banking/specialist-teams/sustainability-and-esg-financing.html">ESG Financing at Lloyds&nbsp;Bank</a>.  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lg17?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Lance Grandahl</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>3Strategic co-investment</p><p>This proposal looks at stakeholders providing a non-returnable financial investment and becoming partners with the House for mutually beneficial activities. The motivation for the investor would be having access to the House to test innovative technologies or to become part of its creative infrastructure. For example, a private company could co-invest (with The House) in the opportunity to test computational value mapping tools. A university might partner with the House to look at the links between collaborative living and sustainable outcomes. The capital would not be repayable and the house would be investing itself as an innovation catalyst.</p><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: private tech company, university, performing arts&nbsp;group.  Motivation: innovation potential, reputation, ESG.  Proposed agreement: time bound generative use of the house in exchange for a non-returnable financial investment.  Potential partners / collaborators: universities who are focused on exploring new economic thinking in urban environments, for example the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/studieren/studienangebot/gesamtes-studienangebot/studiengang/urban-management-m-sc">Urban Management Programme at Technische Universität Berlin.</a>  <p>4Joint ownership linked to pay-it-forwards mortgage</p><p>Here the suggestion is for a lender to become a co-owner of the House, and for the House to gradually purchase the lender’s share until it owns itself in full. This type of arrangement allows for a better alignment of shared risk at the outset. Over the period of co-ownership the House would pay rent to the lender for using the part that is still under their ownership. The principle is similar to Islamic Diminishing Musharaka Financing Products (DMFPs) which are designed to avoid income being generated via interest.</p><p>With existing DMFPs the rent is normally fixed, but there is potential for the rent to be linked to the surplus generated from the house’s activities. In this case, the mortgage agreement would stipulate that the principal repayments are based on a percentage of the surplus generated by the house. If there is no surplus nothing is due and no ‘rent’ accrues. This idea could be extended into a pay-it-forward solidarity mortgage.

But chances are, you’re under attack. So how do you know if you’re under attack? Well, the safe bet is to simply assume you already are. But, there are other indicators. Odd login behaviour, large numbers of failed login attempts, and huge spikes in login attempts are all likely evidence of something malicious afoot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As your trusted IAM partner, Ping has a vested interest in helping you protect your business. Our experience with the largest enterprises in the world has shown us that fraudsters, as big and scary as they can be, are also human and follow the path of least resistance. They mostly target the weakest links – your users. With the increasing sophistication and quality of attacks, users often fall victim to credential theft via phishing, vishing, smishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks, precisely because it is so challenging to differentiate malicious messages from genuine ones.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In an era marked by rapid technological advancement and global upheaval, understanding the landscape of AI regulation is more critical than ever. This session aims to unravel the complexities of AI regulation, focusing on Europe's nuanced, risk-based approach while casting a wider net to examine global strategies in a multipolar world.</p>
<p>The session will dissect the multifaceted nature of AI regulation. We begin with Europe’s methodical framework, which assesses AI applications through a risk-based lens, aiming to foster innovation while safeguarding ethical standards. This approach, encapsulated by initiatives like the GDPR and the proposed AI Act, sets a precedent in balancing technological progress with individual rights and societal values.</p>
<p>Our exploration then expands to the global stage, where diverse regulatory philosophies reflect the multifaceted challenges and priorities of different nations and cultures. In a world facing myriad crises and conflicts - each with a substantial information component - these regulations are not just legal frameworks to guide AI system growth but also mirrors of broader geopolitical dynamics. The session will provide:</p>
 
 A Detailed Examination: Insight into Europe's risk-based regulatory strategy for AI, highlighting its principles, challenges, and influence on global norms. 
 Global Perspectives: An analysis of how various countries approach AI governance, reflecting the broader geopolitical landscape and its implications for international relations and tech leadership. 
 Industry and Societal Impact: Consideration of how these AI regulatory frameworks shape industry innovation, ethical AI development, and the balance between technological growth and societal well-being. 
 Strategic Foresight: Engaging discussions on the future trajectory of AI regulation, considering the impact of ongoing global crises and the shift towards a multipolar world order. 
 
<p>This session offers policymakers, industry stakeholders, and tech enthusiasts a comprehensive understanding of AI regulation's current state, fostering informed strategies to navigate the intricacies of AI governance in a rapidly evolving world.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/approaches-to-ai-regulation-eic24"></a>

The emergence of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) has introduced new paradigms for digital identity that empower individuals and organizations with greater control and privacy while also ensuring interoperability and trust at scale.</p>
<p>This talk delves into how SSI and DID can be leveraged to create a more secure and trustworthy framework for identity verification and management within global automotive network Catena-X. We will explore how these technologies facilitate seamless interactions by enabling legal entities to present verifiable credentials in a peer-to-peer manner without the need for a central authority.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/fostering-trust-did-ssi-eic24"></a>

  <p>With the growing exposure of digital services and assets through application programming interfaces (APIs) and the emergence of the API Economy, entire business models are starting to be built around APIs. Increasingly, APIs are designed to be used externally as part of an organisation’s service delivery model.</p>
<p>The adoption of the OAuth protocol has allowed consumer-to-business (C2B) integrations to authorise access to APIs in a standardised way. However, business-to-business (B2B) integrations using OAuth are now rapidly growing, and as API ecosystems become more complex, there is an urgent need for further standardisation. Although OAuth supports direct B2B integration, there is no standard way to implement delegated B2B authorisation because OAuth delegation was primarily designed for C2B integration where the resource owner is an individual consumer.</p>
<p>There are use cases where, for an online business to provide services to their customers, they need authorised access to resources owned by the customer organisation at third-party resource providers.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore how OAuth and its extensions, such as rich authorisation requests and token exchange grant types, can be used to allow a resource owner client to dynamically delegate access to its resources to another client using delegated B2B authorisation.</p>
<p>The presentation will cover the following topics:</p>
 
 Business use case for B2B delegated authorisation 
 Brief overview of the OAuth 2.0 protocol 
 Proposed enhancements to the OAuth 2.0 standard to achieve interoperable B2B delegated authorisation 
 Security considerations

However, AI agents are often hampered by the lack of necessary context to complete critical tasks. Sharing unrestricted access to personal data with an AI agent leads to serious privacy concerns. <br> <br> This presentation seeks to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach utilizing verifiable credentials and identity wallets to give an AI agent selective access to personal data in a privacy preserving manner. Trinsic’s CEO, Riley Hughes, will share a never-before-seen demo of how a user can create a trusted identity in the form of a verifiable credential, then utilize the identity attributes to allow an AI agent to act on his behalf in a personalized manner. While the actions are performed by the AI agent, there will be a trusted link back to a real human who has given verifiable permission to the AI agent to access their data.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/preserving-privacy-data-sharing-eic24"></a>

  <p>A significant trend in cybersecurity breaches is the shift from targeting endpoints to hijacking user identities. This evolution marks a significant change in attack vectors, emphasizing the need for robust Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR). The presentation will delve into the dynamics of this trend, elucidating the mechanisms through which attackers infiltrate systems by exploiting identity vulnerabilities instead of traditional hardware or software loopholes.<br><br>In response to the increasing focus on identity-based threats, there has been a paradigm shift in organizational structures and workflows. Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) teams are no longer siloed entities; they are increasingly integrated with Security Operations Centers (SOC). This presentation will explore the multifaceted implications of this integration. Attendees will gain insight into how the fusion of IAM and SOC functions is reshaping security strategies, fostering a more resilient, proactive defense against identity-based attacks.<br><br>Topics covered will include the evolution of ITDR tools and techniques, the role of artificial intelligence in predicting and mitigating identity threats, and the critical importance of fostering a culture of security awareness throughout the organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/itdr-modern-security-eic24"></a>

In this interconnected digital space, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a big deal. It helps manage who gets access to what, especially in a time when our digital identities are targets for cyber threats.<br><br>Keeping our online identities safe is super important because it's where our personal and work lives meet. Bad actors, like hackers and data breaches, try to take advantage of this. That's why we need a strong plan called Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR).<br><br>ITDR isn't just a tool; it's a mix of technology, ways of doing things. This presentation looks into how ITDR works and why it's super important in modern cybersecurity. ITDR has four main parts: making a basic identity plan, finding risks, spotting problems quickly, and having ways to respond. All these parts help keep our identities safe and protect important data.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/safeguarding-digital-identities-eic24"></a>

  <p>The role of identity continues to be in high focus for defenders and attackers alike. While Identity and Access Management systems have improved greatly with the increased usage of MFA, PAMs, federated identity, AD &amp; Azure AD, and detection and response systems such as EDR, SIEMs and XDR, successful, massive breaches leveraging identity still are occurring regularly. Why? How? In many organizations there are major vulnerability and detection gaps between primarily preventive IAM controls and increasingly common attacker tools and techniques that circumvent them. This is most evident post initial compromise where more sophisticated attackers show off their skills in the middle of the attack chain to move laterally and escalate their privileges on their way to the organization’s crown jewels. As with every attacker move there is a defender counter move. This has led to the emergence of identity threat detection and response (ITDR) solutions. Can ITDR solutions and associated security processes break the middle of the attack chain?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybercriminals-after-all-these-years-eic24"></a>
