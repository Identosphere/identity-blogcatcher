  DSTA and Thales Announce AI-Driven Co-Lab to Strengthen Singapore’s Defence Systems
prezly

Fri, 04/04/2025 - 09:31


             
 Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and Thales announce a joint lab to develop AI-enabled technologies which can augment combat systems currently in use by the Singapore Armed Forces.  
 With an initial focus on solutions for Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) and Advanced Sensing applications, both parties have co-developed advanced AI algorithms that enable combat systems to efficiently handle fast-evolving drone threats.  
 DSTA and Thales signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2022 to deepen and broaden collaboration from development of smart technologies to better supportability of systems. This Co-Lab is another outcome of this MoU that will deepen our collaboration. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 
Representatives from DSTA and Thales

<p>At the 2025 Singapore Defence Technology Summit (Tech Summit), a joint team from DSTA and Thales showcased its recent collaboration on counter-drone technologies, with tangible outcomes that can potentially be integrated into systems currently in-use with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).</p>
<p>Over the last five months, engineers from both organisations co-developed Machine-Learning (ML)-enabled software modules that reduce the rate of false alarms in drone detection. By enhancing a radar’s sensor performance with the help of AI, the algorithms offer operators and end-users heightened situational awareness that enable faster and more accurate drone detection and classification.</p>
<p>Through this demonstration of a new Concept of Operations (CONOPs) in enhanced radar performance in drones, the team leveraged physics-, knowledge- and data-based AI, bringing together DSTA’s deep domain knowledge of the drone ecosystem and the technical and AI skills of Thales researchers and engineers. The announcement of the Co-Lab represents the next step in the strategic cooperation between DSTA and Thales, underscoring both parties’ ambitions to support the SAF in dealing with emerging and asymmetric threats.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The DSTA-Thales Joint Lab marks a strategic step in advancing next-generation defence technologies. By harnessing AI and advanced sensing technologies, we are adopting a more agile approach to capability development, enabling us to tackle evolving threats. This collaboration reinforces DSTA's commitment to working with global partners to co-develop advanced capabilities, ensuring our defence systems remain robust, adaptive, and future-ready," said Mr Roy Chan, Deputy Chief Executive (Operations), DSTA. ​ </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Thales’ AI for critical systems must meet the stringent reliability, safety and security requirements for armed forces worldwide. It is a true recognition when our customers trust us to co-develop solutions alongside them that address the pain points and challenges of the end-user. We have achieved the outcomes of the MoU in a relatively short span of time, with our teams harnessing AI to create solutions with real-world implications. This Co-Lab with DSTA speaks to the years of collaboration between us and our joint commitment to provide the best technologies for the SAF and the Singapore Ministry of Defence.” said Pascale Sourisse, President and CEO, Thales International.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thales holds deep expertise and technological mastery in radars, with air traffic management radars used by the majority of civil aviation authorities in the region, as well as operating a Radar Centre of Excellence in Singapore. As a key partner to the SAF for over 50 years, Thales also operates a Defence Hub for services in Singapore, with skilled local expertise on-hand to support DSTA and Mindef for support and maintenance of systems currently in use with the armed forces. </p>

Thu, 04/03/2025 - 14:00


             
 The new flight training centre features Thales’s AW139 Reality H® Full Flight Simulator (FFS), one of the world’s most advanced commercial helicopter simulators. Featuring a hoist trainer using Mixed Reality technology, it offers highly realistic mission training to reflect the Faroe Islands’ harsh and adverse environment. 
 The FFS was jointly developed and designed with the training experts of leading helicopter operator and airline Atlantic Airways and Thales. 
 The Atlantic Airways Aviation Academy can train up to 600 pilots each year depending on the course and/or training syllabus.

<p>Thales and Atlantic Airways today celebrate the inauguration of a new flight training centre in the Faroe Islands. This new centre features Thales’s world renowned, cutting edge, AW139 EASA-approved Reality H® Full Flight Simulator Level D, for the highest level of training and certification. The simulator also includes a correlated hoist trainer that uses new Mixed Reality (MR) technology, supporting safer helicopter operations worldwide.</p>
 Realistic and immersive helicopter training experience  
<p>The FFS, combined with latest MR technology for air crew hoisting, is a state-of-the-art, full-motion simulator integrating Thales’s patented Hexaline™ Technology, that provides a realistic and immersive helicopter training experience. With scenario-based flight and mission training, the systems will enable AW139 helicopter pilots and operators worldwide to train for complex offshore and onshore missions in adverse weather conditions, such as those encountered on the Faroe Islands, all with unmatched realism for maximum situational awareness and training quality. Pilots and aircrew operators can thus train safely in high-risk mission scenarios. </p>
 New Mixed Reality technology  
<p>Designed to train rescuers in their role as hoist operators, the hoist trainer module includes a physical cable hoist with a hoist control grip, allowing for a simulated payload to be raised or lowered. Intended to train hoist operators working at the rear of the helicopter, this versatile hoist model can vary in speed, while the Mixed Reality technology generated by the ThalesView™ Image Generation system provides visual cues, enabling the winchman to lean outside freely. The winchman's view is synchronized with the FFS’s movement, ensuring a consistent and seamless training experience that improves coordination between pilots and hoist operators.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Airways Aviation Academy will deliver advanced training with this simulator, including initial type rating, recurrent training and proficiency checks for both Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). This simulator will enable pilots to achieve the certification needed to fly the AW139 under <a href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/en">EASA</a> approval.</p>
<blockquote><p>Benoit Broudy, Vice-President Training &amp; Simulation, Thales: "We are proud that Atlantic Airways has entrusted us with delivering our AW139 Reality H® Level D Full Flight Simulator, featuring the innovative integrated Hoist Trainer powered by Mixed Reality technology. Developed hand in hand with their flight operations experts, these systems will provide pilots and crewmembers with highly immersive and realistic training, enhancing their proficiency to handle the most complex missions. This successful delivery further strengthens Thales’s position as a leading provider of helicopter simulation and training devices, reaffirming our unwavering commitment to safer skies for all."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Jóhanna á Bergi, CEO, Atlantic Airways: "The Thales FFS provides our pilots with an unparalleled cockpit experience, essential for mastering the operational challenges they may face in real-world scenarios. We’ve been confident from the beginning that partnering with Thales was the right decision. Their expertise, professionalism, and close collaboration with our team have been instrumental in bringing our vision to life. The AW139 simulator and integrated Hoist Trainer are key pillars of our Aviation Academy and will ensure world-class, mission-ready training for pilots and crews right here in the Faroe Islands.”</p></blockquote>

AIP 21: Participation Incentive <p>To encourage widespread participation in AIP 21, we are introducing a structured airdrop for all&nbsp;voters.</p> 🔹 Program&nbsp;Details:   Total Allocation: 17,000,000 HPP (1% of the total&nbsp;supply)  Eligibility: All wallets that participate in the AIP 21&nbsp;vote   🔹 Reward Calculation: <p>Reward = Total Pool × (Individual Voting Power ÷ Total Voting&nbsp;Power)</p> 🔹 Distribution Timeline:   Rewards will vest over 24 months to promote long-term alignment  Airdrop claiming will begin after the official HPP token launch; full details to&nbsp;follow   2. HPP Tokenomics: Community-First by&nbsp;Design  (1) Community-Aligned Token Distribution <p>Under the HPP’s proposed tokenomics model, 76% of newly issued HPP tokens will be allocated to community-focused initiatives. This ensures that the majority of value accrues to the network’s real contributors — users, developers, and ecosystem partners. These tokens will&nbsp;fund:</p>  Engagement-based airdrops  Developer grants and innovation challenges  On-chain incentives for network adoption and&nbsp;activity   (2) Transparent &amp; Accountable Team Allocation <p>To uphold trust and long-term alignment, tokens allocated to internal teams will follow strict distribution protocols:</p>  Held in secure vaults managed by a third-party custodian (with full details to be shared upon finalization of the agreement)  Released based on milestone-driven performance reviews  Subject to transparent vesting schedules to ensure accountability   3. HPP EVM-Layer 2 on the OP&nbsp;Stack <p>If AIP 21 passes and we move forward with the Layer 2 expansion, HPP’s upcoming network will be built on the OP Stack — with a long-term vision of achieving full compatibility with the Superchain, a collective of interoperable, EVM-based chains aligned around the principles of open and decentralized blockspace.</p>  Layer 1 (current Aergo) will remain focused on enterprise-grade infrastructure, compliance, and secure service&nbsp;modules.  Layer 2 (EVM-based) will be optimized for next-gen use cases, including data tokenization, AI model hosting, and identity protocols.  <p>This dual-layer architecture positions HPP to scale meaningfully while remaining deeply aligned with real-world applications and community values.</p><p>(1) Services to Be Continued in Development</p><p>The following services on the AERGO Mainnet (Layer 1) will continue to be maintained and&nbsp;updated:</p>  Aergoscan  Aergo Connect  Aergo Bridge (will be merged and made interoperable with the upcoming HPP Layer 2&nbsp;network)  <p>(2) New Services Under Development</p><p>The following services will be released upon the successful passage of AIP&nbsp;21:</p><p>[HPP Testnet]</p>  HPP Scan: Block explorer for the HPP&nbsp;Testnet  Metamask Integration: Wallet access via&nbsp;Metamask  HPP Bridge (ETH Sepolia ↔ HPP&nbsp;Testnet)  <p>[HPP Mainnet]</p>  HPP Scan: Full-featured mainnet&nbsp;explorer  Metamask Support  Bridge 1: Asset transfer from L1 (AERGO) → L2&nbsp;(HPP)  Bridge 2: Superchain-compatible bridge (e.g., Optimism&nbsp;Bridge)  AI MVP: Rollout of the first AI-powered application on HPP Layer&nbsp;2   A Community-Led Future Starts&nbsp;Now <p>With the launch of AIP-21, we’re empowering our community to make a defining choice — not just about governance mechanics, but about the values and long-term direction of the HPP ecosystem. We want to be clear: our goal is NOT to steer the vote in any particular direction, but to maximize participation so that the outcome genuinely reflects the will and vision of the community. As always, your voice and your vote will help shape what HPP becomes&nbsp;next.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/hpp-aip-21-building-a-value-aligned-layer-2-ecosystem-through-governance-and-incentives-5bdd3df27cf2">HPP AIP 21: Building a Value-Aligned Layer 2 Ecosystem Through Governance and Incentives</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Thales to recruit 8,000 people in 2025 and accelerate its 'Learning company' programme
prezly

Thu, 04/03/2025 - 10:00


             
 Thales, a global leader in advanced technologies for Defence, Aerospace and Cyber &amp; Digital, plans to recruit 8,000 people worldwide in 2025 to support the strong growth momentum across its three business segments. Around 40% of new hires will join engineering roles (including software and systems engineering, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, data, etc.), while approximately 25% will join industrial roles (including technicians, operators and industrial engineers). 
 In parallel, more than 4,000 employees will benefit from functional and geographical internal mobility. 
 In a context marked by interconnected geopolitical crises, a rebound in air traffic and accelerating global connectivity, all of Thales’s businesses are growing and hiring. This builds on the strong momentum established in recent years, with:<br>
 
 Over 30,000 new hires between 2022 and 2024, including 9,000 in the Defence sector; 
 Over 8,000 internal mobility moves between 2023 and 2024; 
 Ten consecutive years during which Thales has hired at least 5,000 people annually. 
 
 
 In 2025, recruitment will take place across all regions of operation, including approximately 3,000 people in France, over 1,000 in the United Kingdom, 500 in the Netherlands, 400 in the United States, 400 in Australia, 300 in Central Europe, 250 in India, 200 in Germany, and 150 in Africa and the Middle East. 
 
 Learning company: supporting employees’ professional development and keeping Thales’s expertise at the highest level 
 
 For the past three years, Thales has invested in its “Learning company” global skills development programme, delivered by 2,000 internal trainers as well as numerous tutors and mentors. Since 2023, Thales has increased the number of its Academies, which are designed to share knowledge globally. The Group now operates 13 Domain Academies (AI, Cybersecurity, Radar, Naval, Tube, Pyrotechnics, etc.) and 18 Functional Academies (Software, Hardware, Systems, Industry, Bid &amp; Project Management, HR, Finance, Communication, etc.). By the end of 2025, Thales will have more than 35 academies. 
 The Group has also introduced innovative skills development methods, including a shared competency management system, simulation and virtual reality tools, and hands-on training solutions. 
 In 2024, 90% of Thales’s global workforce – 72,000 people – took part in skills development activities. 
 
 Thales is committed to raising awareness amongst youth about the importance of science and to promoting inclusion and diversity  
 
 Across all countries where it operates, Thales strengthened its outreach efforts in 2024, engaging with more than 150,000 young people and taking part in over 600 events. In France in 2025, the Group plans to host more than 3,000 interns and apprentices, around 25% of whom will go on to be hired on permanent or fixed-term contracts. Nearly 1,500 middle and high school students will also complete observation internships at Thales sites. 
 Improving gender balance within teams and leadership remains a key priority for the Group. In 2024, women accounted for 30% of new hires worldwide. More than 60% of the Group’s executive Committees included at least four women; Thales is aiming for 75% by 2026. 
 With the signing of a new Group-wide agreement in 2024 to further promote the inclusion of people with disabilities, Thales is reaffirming its commitment, with an employment rate of nearly 7% in France. 
 
<blockquote><p>« To support the Group’s growth and performance, recruitment and internal mobility are essential, but we must go further. Giving our teams the opportunity to continuously develop their skills and encouraging them to pass on their expertise to colleagues is both the spirit and the ambition of our 'Learning company' programme. Our goal is to support the professional growth of our people and maintain Thales’s expertise at the highest level,» Clément de Villepin, Senior Executive Vice President, Human Resources, Thales</p></blockquote>

				 Seattle: April 2, 2025: Indicio is delighted to announce that <a href="https://indicio.tech/tom-plofchan-biography/">Tom Plofchan</a> has joined <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> as a strategic advisor to help the company chart its expansion as a global leader in decentralized identity technology and biometric authentication.<p></p>
<p>Tom’s recent experience as a Managing Partner and the Chief Investment Officer of Virginia-based Pangiam, ​​a leading provider of customized digital identity, biometrics, AI/ML and advanced analytics software and solutions, will help guide Indicio’s product innovation and business growth in financial services, the public sector, and travel and hospitality. He will also support the company’s growing portfolio of partnerships and deployments in these areas.</p>
<p>“Tom has achieved so much in the field of authentication and security, and it’s fantastic to welcome someone of his caliber to the Indicio team,” said Heather Dahl, CEO. “It’s a tremendous validation of Indicio’s success in Verifiable Credential technology, our work in authenticated biometrics, and our vitality as a company.”</p>
<p>“We see the financial services, payments, and travel driving epochal change in the way we share and consume identity information, with enormous benefits for every industry, sector, and customer in terms of maximizing efficiency and reducing complexity, risk, and cost,” said Dahl. “We’re delighted Tom is on board and helping us navigate this journey to a better digital world.”</p>
<p>“Digital identity has the ability to revolutionize the movement of people, money, and data, improve customer experience, and increase access to products and opportunities previously unavailable to many. That said, it also comes with substantial risk of abuse if not deployed in a thoughtful, human-first manner,” said Plofchan. “As technology evolves faster than social conversations about its impact on privacy and civil liberties, and society in general, it is beholden on technology companies to bring to market products that are not only commercially viable, but also developed with first-principles consideration of the public good and the long-term impact of rapid adoption. Indicio is a rare example of a company actively practicing this responsibility in the digital identity industry.”</p>
<p>“After multiple years in the sector and countless opportunities to meet and test the technologies of other companies, I am proud to join one of the only companies I have found successfully delivering customers the benefits of digital identity at scale without requiring them to sacrifice privacy or personal information in return. I look forward to supporting Indicio’s growth as a commercial entity and public benefit corporation as we work to make decentralization the gold-standard of digit identity across the world.”</p>
<p>At Pangiam, Tom helped build a public-private partnership company supporting border security and travel operations on multiple continents. He led the company’s acquisition of U.S.-based facial recognition provider Trueface in 2021 and formed its Ethics Committee regulating new client and use case deployments of biometric technology in 2022. Tom successfully exited Pangiam after public market acquisition in 2024.</p>
<p>Before Pangiam, Tom held various roles in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including Counselor to the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Counselor to the Secretary, DHS.</p>
<p>Tom describes himself as “a proud native of Loudoun County, Virginia” and sits on the Board of The Westlake Foundation, a Virginia 501(c)3 dedicated to charitable giving supporting education, health, and civic engagement across the DMV. Tom is a former Manfred Wörner Fellow with the German Marshall Fund of the United States and recipient of the DHS Outstanding Public Service Medal. He previously served as a Senior Fellow at the Center for Naval Analysis and on the Department of Homeland Security’s Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee.</p>

             Strengthening Europe’s critical navigation infrastructure thanks to EGNOS satellite-based augmentation system 
<p>Cannes, April 2, 2025 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a new contract worth €51 million with the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) to extend the operational life of the European Satellite-Based Augmentation System (EGNOS). Named LIFEX 1 (Life Extension Phase 1), this contract will ensure that EGNOS V2 continues to provide reliable, secure, and high-performance navigation services for Europe’s aviation, maritime, land transport, mapping and agricultural sectors beyond 2028.&nbsp;</p>
 
    
 
<p>EGNOS&nbsp;© Thales Alenia Space&nbsp;</p>
<p>EGNOS system enhances the accuracy, reliability and integrity of positioning signals by improving the performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS and, in the future, Galileo. As part of this contract, Thales Alenia Space will address EGNOS V2 critical system upgrades and infrastructure improvements, reinforcing the system’s resilience and operational durability. These updates will focus on enhancing security measures, modernizing components, and ensuring the ongoing reliability of EGNOS’s “Safety of Life” service, which plays a key role in aviation, enabling accurate approaches at European airports without requiring ground guidance systems. Operational since 2011, this service has significantly improved operational safety and efficiency for the greater benefit of European operators.</p>
<blockquote><p>”EGNOS is a key asset for Europe, ensuring safer and more efficient transport across multiple sectors. This contract will secure the extension of the system in operations, making the service more robust to support a growing number of users and strengthening the European Union’s satellite navigation capabilities,” said Rodrigo da Costa, Executive Director of EUSPA.</p>
<p>“We are very proud to support our client EUSPA in extending the lifetime of an operational system that plays a key role in European navigation every day. With this latest contract, Thales Alenia Space demonstrates its European and export leadership in satellite navigation and contributes to the success of the EGNOS system in Europe” said David Philipona, Vice-President Navigation for Thales Alenia Space in France. “This is in line with Thales Alenia Space's commitment to provide reliable and innovative navigation solutions to ensure safer and more efficient transport across the continent and across the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
 About EGNOS 
<p>EGNOS is one of the European Union’s flagship space programs, designed to improve the performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS and, in the future, Galileo. It enhances the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of satellite positioning signals, ensuring more precise and dependable navigation data for a wide range of industries. EGNOS’s “Safety of Life” service is essential for aviation, enabling precision approaches to airports without requiring traditional ground-based guidance systems.&nbsp;<br>
First deployed in 2005 and providing operational “open” service since 2009, the current EGNOS system was developed by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor and is managed by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).</p>
 Global Impact: EGNOS leading the way 
<p>The EGNOS system’s success has influenced the development of similar systems worldwide. For example, the Korean Space Agency chose Thales Alenia Space in 2019 to supply the Korean Augmentation Satellite System (KASS) which is based on EGNOS principles. The system is already being used to enhance aviation safety, after the first signals were successfully transmitted in December 2022.</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, ASECNA (Agency for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar) chose Thales Alenia Space in 2019 to carry out a Phase B project for a Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) in the region including delivery of a pre-operational service in 2020, to provide enhanced satellite-based navigation for aviation, particularly for flights into and out of areas with limited ground infrastructure. Nigerian operator NIGCOMSAT and Thales Alenia Space performed successful demonstration flights in Lomé and Douala in 2021, using the SBAS signal they have transmitted in the Africa and Indian Ocean region since September 2020 – the first SBAS service provided in this region, via the NIGCOMSAT-1R satellite. They also carried out a series of demonstrations of additional services provided by the A-SBAS system in Brazzaville, Congo.</p>
 Thales Alenia Space: a long-standing leader in satellite navigation 
<p>Thales Alenia Space brings over 40 years of expertise in satellite design, development, and operations to the EGNOS project. The company has been instrumental in the creation, maintenance, and evolution of EGNOS since its inception, ensuring its effectiveness as a critical tool for European navigation systems.<br>
EGNOS V2, which has been delivering the Safety of Life service since 2011, will continue to operate under Thales Alenia Space’s guidance, with a focus on infrastructure modernization and obsolescence management.&nbsp;</p>
 About EUSPA 
<p>The European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) provides safe and secure European satellite navigation services, promotes the commercialization of Galileo, EGNOS, and Copernicus data and services and coordinates the EU’s forthcoming governmental satellite communications programme GOVSATCOM and the EU SST Front Desk. EUSPA is &nbsp; responsible for the security accreditation of all the EU Space Programme components. By fostering the development of an innovative and competitive space sector and engaging with the &nbsp;entire &nbsp;EU &nbsp;Space &nbsp;community, &nbsp;EUSPA &nbsp;contributes &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;European green &nbsp;and &nbsp;digital transition, &nbsp;the &nbsp;safety &nbsp;and &nbsp;security &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Union &nbsp;and &nbsp;its &nbsp;citizens, &nbsp;while &nbsp;reinforcing &nbsp;its &nbsp;autonomy &nbsp;and resilience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meet James—a compliance officer at a FINRA-regulated firm managing security tokens and tokenized funds. James is used to navigating complex regulations, but the FATF Travel Rule has added a new layer of pressure.</p>



<p>It starts with a client transferring cryptoassets to another platform. James knows the Travel Rule requires his firm to collect and share key information—names, wallet addresses, and account details—every step of the way. But the process quickly becomes overwhelming.</p>



 
 First issue: His team is manually verifying transaction details across different tools. 



 Next challenge: There’s no standard way to securely share data with other platforms. 



 Final complication: International transfers bring inconsistent rules that make compliance feel like guesswork. 
 



<p>By the end of the day, James feels more like a crisis manager than a compliance leader.</p>

 <br>Unlock Seamless Security: Combining Physical and Digital Access with HYPR and IDEMIA  
<p>Your organization spans a physical and a virtual environment, but how well aligned are your strategies for securing both? With the rise of hybrid work models, the challenge of securing sensitive information against increasingly sophisticated online and in-person threats has become more critical than ever.<br><br>In a groundbreaking move to address these challenges, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/integrations/idemia">HYPR and IDEMIA</a> have joined forces. This powerful partnership unifies the management of credentials for both physical and digital access control on a single smart badge (the ID-One PIV Card), enabling enterprises to enhance their existing ID infrastructure with FIDO passkey protection.</p> 
 Key Benefits of HYPR and IDEMIA Partnership:  
  
  Enhanced Risk Reduction: By linking physical and digital identities, organizations can minimize vulnerabilities and strengthen their security posture against evolving threat landscapes.&nbsp;<br>  
  Simplified User Experience: Streamlining access through a unified credential system improves convenience and efficiency for both employees and administrators.<br>  
  Cost Savings: Leveraging existing infrastructure and reducing time-consuming authentication processes translates to tangible cost benefits for enterprises.  
  
 The New Standard in Integrated Identity and Access Management  
<p>Digital security threats are growing in sophistication as phishing attacks and social engineering techniques evolve. Traditional security measures like passwords and conventional MFA are proving inadequate against these advancements, leaving organizations exposed to significant vulnerabilities</p> 
<p>The HYPR and IDEMIA solution introduces FIDO-certified smart badges that offer organizations enhanced protection from phishing attacks and man-in-the-middle credential stuffing. These smart-card-based MFA solutions seamlessly integrate physical facility access with digital access across multiple workstations, ensuring compatibility with all major identity security technologies. This includes the widely used physical access control protocols (MIFARE, DESfire, prox), and Identity Providers (IdPs), Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, and Single Sign-On (SSO) services. </p> 
<p>Furthermore, this solution is particularly beneficial for financial service organizations, aiding in compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulatory requirements. HYPR and IDEMIA provide comprehensive risk management that addresses both technical and regulatory aspects of security.<br></p> 
 How Does the HYPR | IDEMIA Integration Work?  
<br> 
  
   
<p>The solution provides secure, frictionless authentication across various environments and devices, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and VDI workstations. Streamlined management enhances user adoption and minimizes administrative complexity.</p> 
<p>Example: Employees use their IDEMIA smart cards to access office buildings and restricted areas, then seamlessly log in to corporate applications and systems using HYPR-provisioned FIDO credentials stored on the same smart card.</p> 
<p>Example: Contractors and third-party vendors receive IDEMIA smart cards integrated with HYPR authentication, granting them access to designated locations and systems for the duration of their engagement.</p> 
<p>Example: Hybrid workers complete identity verification and enroll device-bound passkeys with HYPR. They leverage IDEMIA smart cards for facility access and can authenticate into digital resources either with the same card or through software-based passkeys when a reader isn’t available.</p> 
 Reduce IT Help Desk Burden with Streamlined User Logins  
<p>Organizations rarely address the inconveniences caused by tedious account recovery practices. IDEMIA and HYPR’s passwordless strategy alleviates the burden for the IT help desk by streamlining the organizations’ login process.</p> 
<p>Recognizing that different organizations have unique login preferences, the IDEMIA and HYPR solution empowers enterprises and their users to select from a range of hardware and software-based authentication methods. This flexibility allows companies to tailor the authentication process to their specific needs and context. </p> 
<p>Regardless of the mechanism an organization selects, this solution provides a single, central console that manages IDEMIA smart cards and HYPR passkeys. This unified management simplifies identity credential administration in environments where physical and virtual security procedures are still siloed.&nbsp;<br></p> 
 Reduce Identity Management Costs and Boost Productivity  
<p>Enterprises can <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">maximize ROI with HYPR and IDEMIA’s solution</a>, notably by capitalizing on their existing infrastructure when converting the ID badges they already use into smart badges with FIDO credentials.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the solution demonstrably increases productivity by reducing time spent on tedious layered authentication methods like one-time passwords (OTPs), and hours-long phone calls with the IT help desk for credential recovery. By removing these inefficient tasks, businesses free up valuable time and resources that can be directed toward more strategic objectives.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Biometric technology has long been marketed as the ultimate solution for easy, secure identity verification. A quick scan of a fingerprint, a facial recognition check, or even an iris scan — what could be more foolproof? But here’s the uncomfortable truth: Standalone biometrics aren’t as secure, private, or effective as they seem.</p>
<p>Sure, biometrics can tell you who someone is, but they can’t tell you anything about them. Biometrics without biographies are dumb —&nbsp; a missed opportunity. The real value of biometric authentication is when it is bound to a context: what an identifiable person is able to do (certifications, licenses, skills), what they have access to (accounts, buildings, systems), and what they own (assets, records, tickets).</p>
<p>This is where Verifiable Credentials supercharge biometrics.</p>
 Contain yourself 
<p>Verifiable Credentials allow people to hold information about themselves and share it in ways that are cryptographically verifiable.&nbsp; A Verifiable Credential is like a sealed digital container for data. You always know where the container originated (viz., the issuer of the credential), you can easily verify that the contents of the container haven’t been tampered with (all the data is digitally signed), and you can prove that the container was issued to you.</p>
<p>One of the most important sets of data you can put in a Verifiable Credential is your biometric data. We talk about this in <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/the-future-of-secure-digital-identity-with-bring-your-own-biometrics/">“Bring Your Own Biometrics.”</a></p>
<p>Briefly, this means that you can support a liveness check with an authenticated copy of your biometrics. It means the party verifying your likeness doesn’t have to store your biometric data to cross check it (a privacy and security boon), and it provides an easy-pass for avoiding deepfakes. A call center gets you to submit an authenticated biometric instead of relying on increasingly fraud-prone voice recognition technology.</p>
<p>Now that you can really, truly, verify that you are identical to your biometrics, you can leverage that power to share and verify other useful information.</p>
 Digital Passport Credentials show the way 
<p>A physical passport combines an image with data. Someone looks at you, swipes the passport, and reads the associated information. Behind the scenes, the source of the passport —&nbsp;the office that issued it —&nbsp;is cryptographically verified.</p>
<p>A physical passport is the most powerful form of identification we have. It is designed to be extremely hard to fake. Hence, we trust this combination of biometrics and data. We may even infer that a person showing a passport and other identity-related information are one and the same.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials replicate this and make it more secure. In short, the biometric image electronically embedded in the passport chip is compared by software with your live image when a digital passport credential is created. The origin of the physical passport is cryptographically checked, and the electronic data is seamlessly transferred into the passport credential.</p>
<p>We now have a digital equivalent of a physical passport. We’ve talked about how this is <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/how-decentralized-digital-identity-is-creating-simpler-more-streamlined-air-travel/">revolutionizing travel</a> and border crossing, but the point here is to see how the passport credential is much more useful than just a biometric. It binds an authenticated biometric to useful information about who we are.</p>
<p>This principle can be extended in two ways.</p>
 Just add authenticated biometrics to any data 
<p>First, we can cryptographically prove that the person issued a digital passport credential was also issued with all their other credentials. In other words, we can combine a high-assurance,&nbsp; high-trust Digital Passport Credential with what, if it was presented on its own, might be a low-assurance, low-trust credential. Essentially, every other digital credential can leverage the assurance baked into a Digital Passport Credential.</p>
<p>But we can also add authenticated biometrics to any kind of person-related credential. So, for example, an employee credential could be issued&nbsp; a biometric template during onboarding along with their employee data. This data can then be used to configure governance rules for least-privilege access to systems, while the biometric template provides assurance of identity.</p>
<p>Or the template could be issued separately and then requested when an employee uses their (biometric-less) employee credential as a security double check (they have to present two independently cryptographically-verifiable credentials for access).</p>
<p>A health credential allowing access to systems or providing consent to data can be combined with authenticated biometrics.</p>
<p>Almost any kind of information can be bound to an authenticated biometric.</p>

<p>One of the areas I’m tracking from my usual standards’ perspective is how we set up guardrails for AI—how we contain its risks while still allowing the world to benefit from its utility. This challenge provides an excellent case study in the limitations of technical standards and where policy must step in to complement them.</p>



<p>A perfect example is the new IETF AI Preferences (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/aipref/about/">AIPREF</a>) working group.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><code>The AI Preferences Working Group will standardize building blocks that allow for the expression of preferences about how content is collected and processed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) model development, deployment, and use.</code></p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/aipref/about/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/aipref/about/</a></blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>That covers a lot of ground. AIPREF is working on a machine-readable vocabulary to signal whether a website opts in or out of AI collecting and using its content for training or generation. That one issue alone is incredibly complex, raising fundamental questions about how standards and policy interact.</p>



 Where Standards End and Policy Begins 



<p>Let’s break down some of the key issues:</p>



 
 What’s the default if no AI preference is specified? Is it opt-in (AI can collect anything unless told otherwise) or opt-out (AI needs explicit permission)? 



 How granular should this be? Can a site allow AI to use some content but not all? 



 How public should AI preferences be? Should opt-in or opt-out status be easily accessible, or should it be restricted? 



 How do you protect non-public AI preferences? If a site’s AI policies shouldn’t be public, how should that information be secured? 
 



<p>Pop quiz: which of these should be covered in a technical standard, and which belong in policy or regulation?</p>



 Technical Standards vs. Policy: Drawing the Line 



<p>The first one—what’s the default setting?—is a policy decision. The standard just needs to provide a vocabulary that enables either choice. Same for the second issue—granularity. Whether a site can allow AI to use some content but not others is a policy decision; the standard just provides the technical means to express it.</p>



<p>What about the third—public vs. private AI preferences? That’s policy too. Different jurisdictions may require different levels of transparency, and contract law could add further complexity. Again, the standard has to support both possibilities.</p>



<p>The fourth, though—protecting non-public AI preferences—is a technical problem. If the information isn’t public, it needs to be encrypted. If it’s encrypted, authorized entities need the keys to decrypt it. And just like that, we’ve gone from a vocabulary problem to a key management problem—an entirely separate research area, likely out of scope for AIPREF.</p>

 The Broader AI Policy Landscape 



<p>AIPREF isn’t the only group tackling these issues. The G7 Hiroshima AI Process (<a href="https://transparency.oecd.ai/about">HAIP</a>), led by the OECD, delivered a Comprehensive Policy Framework in 2023. This includes <a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/hiroshimaaiprocess/pdf/document04_en.pdf">Guiding Principles</a>, a <a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/hiroshimaaiprocess/pdf/document05_en.pdf">Code of Conduct</a>, and a report outlining the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2023/09/g7-hiroshima-process-on-generative-artificial-intelligence-ai_8d19e746.html">G7 Common Understanding of Generative AI</a>—all aimed at balancing innovation with responsible AI governance in some of the biggest markets in the world.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media2/p3mkalna/our-response-to-uk-governments-consultation-on-copyright-and-artificial-intelligence.pdf">weighed in</a> on AI and copyright in response to a government consultation. While copyright law isn’t in the ICO’s jurisdiction, personal data protection is—and the two areas overlap significantly. The ICO emphasized the need for clearer policy signals so AI developers know what they can and can’t do. (Sound familiar? That’s essentially the first question in our list above.) They also pointed out potential unintended consequences, such as AI training exceptions in copyright law that don’t necessarily override other legal obligations, like data protection rules.</p>



 AI and Ethical Use: Mind the Gaps 



<p>As AI tools become more integrated into daily life, we all need to check our assumptions about whether the content we interact with is ethically sourced. This isn’t about avoiding AI—it’s about being thoughtful in how we use it. Standards provide the technical mechanisms, but it’s policy that defines the rules. And if policy doesn’t step up, AI developers are left guessing—or making those decisions themselves.</p>

            <p>Thales and Diehl Aviation are jointly presenting an advanced innovation concept that integrates the power of Thales's award-winning Onboard Data Center (ODC) with Diehl's High Performance Controller (HPC). Through this collaboration, Thales and Diehl Aviation will introduce an advanced digital platform powering smart cabin functionalities to enhance the passenger experience.</p>
<p>Thales’s award-winning ODC uses cloud-native technologies enabling real-time Over The Air content and software updates. This open platform ensures seamless third-party integration, creating the ideal environment for collaboration. Its groundbreaking blade architecture shares compute and storage capabilities enabling advanced functionalities and superior data management, a major leap forward in cabin operational performance.</p>
<p>Diehl's HPC connects the ODC to smart cabin equipment and sensors by leveraging a broad range of cabin interfaces. It serves as a gateway to third party equipment, the aircraft control domain, and provides extensive capabilities for neural network inferences and image processing. This allows for the integration of smart functions e.g. in galley and lavatory controls, as well as in bins and the cargo area.</p>
<p>This innovative concept enables real-time data processing and enhances smart cabin maintenance capabilities to improve airline operational efficiency. Examples of possible use cases are:</p>
 
 Reduction of food waste - By analyzing in-flight catering consumption data, AI-driven applications can recommend optimizations for better resource management.&nbsp; 
 Advanced Cabin Sensors - Sensors can monitor a variety of parameters in the cabin, from overhead compartment storage levels to lavatory and seat cushion data, to improve the passenger experience and enhance airline operational efficiency. 
 
<p>The advanced digital platform innovation concept developed by Thales and Diehl Aviation will be showcased at <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/event/aircraft-interiors">Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX), April 8-10 2025 in Hamburg, Germany</a>. A live demonstration will be given at the Diehl Aviation stand (7D20 in Hall B7).<br>

<p>Following recent community feedback, we’ve gathered additional questions and will publish comprehensive answers — Apr&nbsp;2nd</p><p>1/ Since most exchanges — except Bithumb — support ERC-20 tokens, users tend to hold them on exchanges. In contrast, mainnet tokens have been used for staking and governance voting, so users typically store them in personal wallets to access those features. That’s why many users are understandably disappointed that this vote isn’t supported through the Aergo Connect&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>As we’ve emphasized, participation from mainnet token holders in governance votes has not been enough. That’s why we decided to adopt Snapshot, in alignment with the outcome of AIP&nbsp;20.</p><p>Reducing friction for most token holders to maximize participation and capture a more representative outcome makes far more&nbsp;sense.</p><p>While this setup may not be perfect, we believe it’s a necessary interim measure to ensure that governance remains inclusive, effective, and community-driven.</p><p>2/ Roughly how many months will it take after the vote is completed? I’m curious about the timeline for merging the four tokens. Also, when can we expect HPP to be listed and tradable on exchanges?</p><p>A brief timeline is included in the proposal. The integration, along with the Layer 2 expansion, will require careful execution and close coordination across all participating teams. Pending a successful vote, we are targeting the rollout of the L2-based HPP in Q3&nbsp;2025.</p><p>Once the vote passes, we will release a set of combined milestones and a unified timeline to provide full visibility into the integration process and the rollout of the HPP ecosystem.</p><p>3/ The new issuance of HPP will be on ERC-20, and just like now, it will support swaps via a bridge to the L1 mainnet, correct? The mainnet in question will still be utilizing the Aergo chain,&nbsp;right?</p><p>HPP will be issued as an ERC-20 token on an EVM-based Layer 2 network, and it will support swaps via bridge to the Aergo Layer 1. To be clear, L1 and L2 will coexist. Aergo L1 will continue to operate as the foundational chain, providing security, settlement, and interoperability, while the HPP L2 will enable scalability and EVM-based programmability, particularly for AI-native applications.</p><p>4/ If either the Aergo DAO or Alpha Quark DAO votes against the proposal, does that mean the merger will be canceled? If so, it seems likely that community members who feel the exchange ratio is unfair might vote against it. Could this lead to significant opposition from those who feel disadvantaged by the current&nbsp;terms?</p><p>We cannot proceed without the support of the community. This initiative is entirely community-driven. Your vote is your voice. The swap ratios are calculated based on the average token prices over 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month windows, with liquidity discounts applied — a standard practice in mergers and acquisitions. Again, the choice remains&nbsp;yours.</p><p>5/ Does “8-month cliff” mean that it will be locked for 8&nbsp;months?</p><p>Yes — the correct structure is an 8-month cliff followed by a 22-month vesting period. A cliff period means that no tokens are allocated or unlocked during the first 8 months. After the cliff, tokens will vest linearly over the following 22 months. This structure is designed to ensure long-term alignment and accountability across all participating teams.</p><p>To further reinforce transparency and trust, we will use a trusted third-party custodian to manage all token vaults. This ensures that allocations are released strictly according to the vesting schedule, under full oversight and regulatory compliance. We will release details regarding this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>6/ 41% will be distributed among all 4 projects? So what will be ratio of distribution to each projects?</p><p>41% is allocated to current holders. What is distrubted to the launch projects and additional teams that build on the token is determined over a long vesting period and the specific unlocks are linked to KPIs set with these&nbsp;teams</p><p>7/ Even if the four projects merge, is there confidence that this synergy will quickly lead to services that drive real utility and demand for HPP? It’s difficult to trust that this will be the&nbsp;case.</p><p>I think there may be some misunderstanding. The announced projects — including mine — and future ones that join the ecosystem will be subject to milestone-based vesting. This means there won’t be an immediate surge in circulating supply.</p><p>8/ I’m open to an increase in total supply if it’s truly necessary and kept within a reasonable range. However, the concern is that Aergo has yet to deliver on its past roadmap commitments and was even delisted from Binance. Given this context, it’s difficult to justify any increase in token supply at this&nbsp;time.</p><p>To respond to the concerns raised, it’s important to first revisit our original model. Our initial focus was on market entry through Aergo Enterprise, our private chain solution, as existing regulations favor private blockchain implementations. Unlike many projects solely centered on on-chain activity, Aergo aimed to build real-world, enterprise-grade use cases from the&nbsp;start.</p><p>Legal limitations make it challenging to offer enterprise services directly integrated with the Aergo mainnet. However, we’ve made all necessary preparations to enable this connection as soon as the regulatory environment allows. To that end, Aergo Enterprise has already been deployed across multiple institutions, and we’ve completed the development of the Merkle Bridge. This key technology enables the secure and seamless transfer of data and tokens between public and private&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Looking ahead, if government-led initiatives like K-BTF eliminate the legal uncertainties surrounding public blockchain use, Aergo will be ready to move swiftly and claim leadership in this emerging&nbsp;space.</p><p>We fully acknowledge that the Aergo native token has the potential for broader utility. However, we must also confront reality: given Korea’s current political and economic uncertainty, implementing public blockchain solutions remains unlikely in the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>This leaves us at a crossroads:<br>Do we wait passively for legislation to catch up with our vision — or do we take bold steps to explore new opportunities beyond our original&nbsp;path?</p><p>The choice is up to the community.</p><p>9/ I would gladly support this merger if it can increase Aergo’s value and reduce the risk of being concentrated in the Korean market alone. I believe in Aergo’s value. At the same time, I trust the judgment of the Aergo Team. However, relying on the Korean market alone entails significant risk. I hope this merger will strengthen STO, RWA, AI, and additionally, “global partnerships.”</p><p>We truly appreciate your continued support!</p><p>At the same time, we fully acknowledge the community’s frustration, especially around the new tokenomics we’ve proposed. It’s valid, and we’re listening.</p><p>Over the past year, as we geared up to release key technologies and hit roadmap milestones, we took a hard look at the shifting market. What became clear is that some of our previous tactics need to be re-evaluated. The pace of change in this space demands adaptability and we’re responding.</p><p>We’re currently assembling a dedicated team to double down on Layer 2 infrastructure development and focused marketing efforts you’ve likely already seen hints of on our social channels.</p><p>We’re not here to repeat the past. We’re committed to being different from what we’ve been — and proving it through&nbsp;action.</p><p>10/ I’m not opposing progress and change — I simply want us to move in the right direction. If it had been communicated beforehand that the DAO would be migrated to Snapshot, that such a proposal would be introduced, and that Aergo Connect would no longer be usable for voting, I believe the outcome of the vote would not have been the&nbsp;same.</p><p>This was clearly stated in AIP 20, which the community approved with a YES vote: governance voting will be migrated to Snapshot. The proposal explicitly outlined that Snapshot will replace Aergo Agora for all future Aergo Improvement Proposals (AIPs).</p><p>We fully acknowledge that this setup isn’t perfect — it’s a necessary step as we transition. As Aergo moves deeper into its Layer 2 expansion, a more robust DAO framework will be introduced to better support decentralized governance in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate the community’s active engagement and thoughtful questions during today’s AMA. Given the significance of the proposed changes to the Aergo ecosystem, it’s critical that every voice is heard and every concern addressed.</p><p>We have compiled a comprehensive summary of the key questions and answers discussed. We encourage all stakeholders to review the information carefully, especially as we move toward essential governance decisions.</p><p>1/ Will the team continue pursuing the STO and RWA initiatives after the HPP merger, or will those priorities shift?(<a href="https://x.com/@HarryAB">@HarryAB</a>)</p><p>Yes, our focus on STO/RWA remains firmly in place even after the merger. This integration strengthens our ability to execute real-world asset initiatives by offering a more robust infrastructure, expanded ecosystem reach, and tighter coordination between public and private blockchain layers. Far from being a pivot away, the merger is a strategic step forward to scale these efforts more effectively.</p><p>2/ Why was Alpha Quark selected as a partner in this merger? Many Korean investors are skeptical about the project’s credibility due to past issues and a lack of transparent communication with its community. (<a href="https://x.com/@HarryAB">@HarryAB</a>)</p><p>It’s important to clarify that our collaboration with AlphaQuark is based on their technical team and current capabilities, not past perceptions. Their role in the merger is focused on infrastructure integration and performance-based deliverables, all bound by vesting schedules and roadmap achievements.</p><p>3/ Why wasn’t this merger or expansion plan disclosed before the Binance delisting? This seems like a significant development that investors should have been aware of — especially since the delisting impacts how we can buy or sell Aergo. (<a href="https://x.com/@hoon1130">@hoon1130</a>)</p><p>We understand the frustration around the timing, and we want to be clear: the Binance delisting and the HPP merger are not connected. The delisting decision was made unilaterally by Binance, without prior notice or opportunity for engagement. Like many in the community, we were informed at the same time it was made public. While the timing is unfortunate, the HPP initiative has been in development for over months and was always intended to be introduced through a community-driven governance process, not in reaction to any exchange-related decision.</p><p>4/ Can you clarify the Aergo-to-HPP token ratio? (<a href="https://x.com/@hoon1130">@hoon1130</a>)</p><p>The Aergo-to-HPP token ratio is 1:1. There is no lock-up or vesting applies to retail token holders. All team-allocated tokens across the merged projects (including AQT, Booost, and VaaSBlock) will be subject to strict vesting schedules and milestone-based distributions to ensure alignment with long-term goals.</p><p>5/ Why is this merger necessary in the first place? I’m not immediately for or against it, but if Aergo is already technically capable of supporting RWA and other core use cases, what’s the actual justification for merging multiple projects into a new ecosystem? I believe AERGO can handle RWA and NFT-related developments without the need for a merger. Why is ALPHAQUARK necessary in this case? (<a href="https://x.com/@hoon1130">@hoon1130</a>)</p><p>While Aergo already has the technical capability to support RWA, especially through Aergo Enterprise, the merger accelerates ecosystem growth and expands the use case surface area. Here’s why the merger&nbsp;matters:</p>  It brings together complementary technologies and domain expertise, from identity verification (VaaSBlock) to human data and AI pipelines (Booost) to broader tokenization and asset modeling&nbsp;(AQT).  It enables us to build a vertically integrated value chain for AI and data-driven use cases, especially as we expand into EVM-compatible Layer&nbsp;2s.  Critically, it strengthens market presence and credibility. Institutions often assess token maturity through market cap, liquidity, and ecosystem visibility — this merger helps us scale those dimensions in a way that’s difficult to achieve independently.  <p>In short: Aergo can do a lot on its own, but with the HPP merger, we can go further, faster, with greater alignment, more utility, and stronger positioning for the next wave of enterprise and AI-driven adoption.</p><p>We agree that AERGO has strong technical capabilities, especially when it comes to supporting RWA, NFT infrastructure, and enterprise-grade deployments through Aergo Enterprise. However, the merger isn’t just about tech — it’s about ecosystem acceleration, visibility, and market credibility. Here’s why AlphaQuark (and the other teams) are part of the&nbsp;picture:</p>  AlphaQuark brings complementary infrastructure and additional exposure to markets, partnerships, and developer networks that Aergo currently doesn’t&nbsp;reach.  The merger enables us to build a vertically integrated ecosystem around AI, identity, human data, and RWA — each partner project plays a specific, defined role in that vision. All team tokens, including AlphaQuark’s, are strictly vested and tied to performance and roadmap delivery. There’s no free ride — only accountability and execution.  <p>6/ There are also risks regarding maintaining exchange listings. Is this merger really necessary? Is there any guarantee that existing exchanges where AERGO is listed will support the swap and maintain the listing? (<a href="https://x.com/@hoon1130">@hoon1130</a>)</p><p>Regarding exchange risk, that’s exactly why we’re proposing this through governance and with transparency. Exchanges care about market momentum, liquidity, and a credible roadmap. A strong merger with clear community support actually helps reinforce our exchange presence, not weaken it — because it signals alignment, growth, and long-term planning.</p><p>We’ve already begun communicating with exchanges about the proposed merger and will formally present the outcome of the AIP 21 vote as a signal of strong community consensus. While final decisions always rest with each exchange, clear governance, transparency, and a well-structured integration plan are all things that exchanges look for when evaluating ongoing&nbsp;support.</p><p>We aim to ensure a smooth transition and maintain or strengthen our exchange relationships post-merger. That’s why we’re being proactive and involving the community at every&nbsp;step.</p><p>7/ It seems like the approaching token issuance limit has made it difficult for the development teams to generate new revenue streams. As a result, this merger appears to be a strategic move to address that issue. With the proposed integration into HPP, will there be additional token allocations granted to the teams? And if so, how will that be structured and justified to existing Aergo holders?&nbsp;(<a href="https://x.com/@MikeO">@MikeO</a>)</p><p>Yes, the token supply will change as part of the HPP merger. A new token will unify the four projects under a single ecosystem.All tokens allocated to the teams will be vested over 96 months — that’s 8 years. These tokens are not unlocked upfront, and their distribution is tied to performance, milestone delivery, and long-term ecosystem contribution. There is no short-term gain for any of the teams involved.</p><p>The goal here isn’t to dilute value — it’s to restructure incentives responsibly for the builders who are committing to deliver over the long term, while protecting current holders and the integrity of the ecosystem. Retail holders, by contrast, will retain their value 1:1 with no lock-up or vesting applied. The community remains at the center of this transition. The purpose of the merger is not to bail out any project — it’s to bring together teams with complementary roles and build a unified, value-generating ecosystem with long-term alignment between contributors and the community.</p><p>To address any concerns around the team’s token allocation, we want to be absolutely clear: we’re committed to long-term trust, not short-term gains. All team and reserve tokens will follow an EXTREMELY strict vesting schedule. They will be held in vaults managed by one of the most secure and regulatory-compliant custodians in the industry. This ensures full transparency and alignment with both Korean and global financial standards/regulations.</p><p>8/ If AIP 21 passes, will HPP function as a separate ecosystem — distinct from the existing Aergo Enterprise ecosystem developed by BLOCKO? How will that connection be maintained or&nbsp;evolved?</p><p>No, HPP is not meant to be separate from Aergo Enterprise or Blocko — it’s an extension, not a replacement. Blocko remains a core partner in the Aergo ecosystem, especially in delivering enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure. The strategic alignment with Blocko remains intact even after AIP21. HPP introduces a broader token economy and integrated ecosystem designed to amplify what Aergo Enterprise already enables, especially as we move toward AI, data, and modular L2 infrastructure.We fully recognize that Blocko’s connection has been a major source of credibility and adoption, and that relevance is not being abandoned — it’s being expanded.</p><p>9/ I’m very interested in the STO initiatives that Aergo has pursued using BLOCKO’s technology. However, AIP 21 only references “RWA” with no mention of STOs. If AIP 21 is approved, will Aergo’s STO initiatives be paused or deprioritized?</p><p>Absolutely not. STOs remain part of our long-term roadmap. What AIP21 proposes is a broader framing under the RWA (Real-World Asset) category, which includes STOs but also allows for other types of tokenized assets — such as invoice financing, carbon credits, synthetic datasets, and more.We are not abandoning STOs. Rather, the HPP ecosystem provides more flexibility and scalability to pursue these use cases under a more adaptive regulatory and technical structure.</p><p>10/ Aergo has recently been confirmed for use in major institutions like NHIS. Given Aergo’s proven technology and enterprise adoption, why is a merger necessary&nbsp;? What unique value do they bring to the table? What have they built or achieved that makes this a strategically important merger?</p><p>The reason for this merger is not to “save” any project — it’s to combine complementary technologies and capabilities to build something more extensive and more competitive:</p>  AlphaQuark brings infrastructure, multi-chain deployment experience, and a background in digital asset modeling and NFT integrations — particularly in branded IPs and data flows. Their role will be performance-based and strictly vested over months, so accountability is built&nbsp;in.  BOOOST focuses on human data and synthetic dataset generation — a critical piece for AI pipelines.  VaaSBlock delivers proof-of-personhood and verification infrastructure — essential for building trusted identity layers in decentralized environments.  Each project was selected based on a specific role they could play in a unified, AI-enabled, RWA-compatible ecosystem. Aergo brings the infrastructure, enterprise trust, and proven deployments — the others bring modules and capabilities that extend the system’s range and&nbsp;reach.  <p>This merger is about scaling smartly, not just combining tokens. Aergo could continue alone — but with this merger, we build faster, reach farther, and remain competitive in an evolving&nbsp;market.</p><p>11/ Why the name House Party Protocol? I understand the name might not impact the business case, but I’m curious if there’s a deeper meaning or story behind it. (<a href="https://x.com/@palma98n">@palma98n</a>)</p><p>House Party Protocol (HPP) is inspired by multiple independent systems working together in sync — much like Iron Man’s autonomous suit system of the same name. In this case, each project (Aergo, AlphaQuark, BOOOST, VaaSBlock) represents a distinct component or “suit,” but together they create a coordinated, powerful&nbsp;system.</p><p>The name reflects a shift from siloed development to collaborative, modular architecture — something the current Web3 and AI market is clearly moving toward. While the name may sound playful, the vision behind it is deeply strategic.</p><p>12/ Will HPP be issued as an ERC-20 token, or will it have its own mainnet? Since Aergo is the only one with its own mainnet, wouldn’t this effectively be a rebranding of the Aergo&nbsp;chain?</p><p>First and foremost, HPP will be issued as an ERC-20 token on a new EVM-based Layer 2 network. This is not a rebranding or fork of Aergo. Instead, HPP represents a strategic Layer 2 expansion of the existing Aergo Layer 1, purpose-built to support the next wave of AI-powered applications. It leverages the strengths of Ethereum’s ecosystem and Aergo’s mainnet to deliver scalability, flexibility, and real-world utility. To ensure seamless integration across the ecosystem, there will be a native bridge between L1 and the new HPP L2, allowing users to move assets and interact across both layers with&nbsp;ease.</p><p>13/ It makes no sense for Aergo Connect wallet holders with mainnet coins to be unable to participate in the vote. Requiring users to unstake and transfer to ERC-20 just to participate is unreasonable.</p><p>While we initially considered on-chain or mainnet-based voting, participation from Aergo mainnet token holders in previous governance proposals has been consistently low. As a result — and in line with the outcome of AIP 20 — we made the decision to use Snapshot, which supports ERC-20 AERGO tokens, in order to maximize participation and lower the barrier to entry. Today, the majority of AERGO holders are on Ethereum (ERC-20). By enabling voting through Snapshot, we’re able to engage a broader and more active segment of the community for this important AIP 21 proposal. We want to be clear: we’re not ignoring Aergo Connect users. But for a proposal of this scale, we have to balance inclusivity with practicality.</p><p>14/ How does this merger benefit Aergo investors? Since HPP is not developing a new mainnet but will be issued on the Aergo chain, this is essentially just a rebranding. Please explain why this proposal was even introduced and what actual benefits Aergo investors will gain from it. The roadmap and plans being proposed are things that the Aergo team could continue pursuing independently. (<a href="https://x.com/@hoon1130">@hoon1130</a>)</p><p>Let’s address this head-on: this is not a rebranding of Aergo, and it’s not about inflating supply or merging for the sake of consolidation. HPP will be built as an EVM-based Layer 2 that operates on top of Aergo’s Layer 1 infrastructure. That means Aergo will serve as the security layer, settlement layer, and bridge infrastructure that underpins the entire HPP ecosystem. This merger brings together multiple AI and Web3-native teams, pooling their resources, talent, and communities. That accelerates the development of apps and protocols on top of Aergo’s base layer — something that would take far longer (and more capital) for Aergo to achieve alone. It’s not about what Aergo could do — it’s about moving&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Could Aergo have pursued AI and L2 development independently? Possibly. But this merger allows us to move faster, leverage new expertise, secure strategic partners, and activate a focused narrative around AI and modular blockchains — all while maintaining Aergo’s core chain, identity, and community. Most importantly, it’s about making Aergo more relevant, more usable, and more visible in a world where infrastructure alone is no longer&nbsp;enough.</p><p>15/ Honestly, if you had mentioned anything about AIP 21 before proceeding with AIP 20, the vote on AIP 20 would have probably failed. It’s truly hard to understand why such an unreasonable governance proposal is being pushed immediately after the transition to Snapshot.</p><p>We understand the frustration, but we do not agree with the assumption that AIP 20 would have failed. As we’ve stated multiple times, governance only works when there is meaningful participation. Past on-chain votes lacked that — so transitioning to Snapshot (AIP 20) was a necessary step to ensure broader, fairer community involvement.</p><p>Yes, the proposals came in succession — but that’s because the work behind AIP 21 was already in motion, and we needed the right tools in place to capture a more accurate representation of community sentiment. We’re not here to play politics. We’re here to do what needs to be done to move the ecosystem forward — even if that means making tough, sometimes unpopular decisions in the short term. Ultimately, the community still decides. Every token holder now has the opportunity to vote on AIP&nbsp;21.</p><p>16/ BOOOST is a project that you incubated, and after over a year of being left without a TGE, suddenly including it in this merger and increasing the token issuance — does that even make sense? (<a href="https://x.com/@hoon1130">@hoon1130</a>)</p><p>We hear your concern, and it’s completely valid to question why BOOOST — a project that was incubated over a year ago and has yet to complete its TGE — is now being included in this broader token and ecosystem strategy.</p><p>Here’s the honest perspective:</p><p>(1) BOOOST was never abandoned. While the project may have seemed dormant externally, BOOOST has remained part of our long-term roadmap. The delay in its TGE wasn’t due to neglect — it was because market conditions, timing, and ecosystem readiness weren’t aligned. Launching a token prematurely would have done more harm than&nbsp;good.</p><p>(2) BOOOST fits the new AI-driven L2 vision. As we began designing HPP — an EVM-based L2 focused on AI-native applications — it became clear that BOOOST’s vision and tooling fit naturally into this narrative. Rather than launching it as a standalone token in a fragmented ecosystem, the decision was made to roll its value and mission into a unified architecture. This allows BOOOST to benefit from shared infrastructure, shared liquidity, and faster go-to-market.</p><p>(3) Aergo investors are not footing the bill. BOOOST’s inclusion doesn’t mean Aergo holders are being diluted. Token allocation, vesting, and supply controls are being structured carefully to ensure fairness and long-term sustainability. This isn’t about shortcuts.</p><p>17/ Aergo’s ICO was launched at $0.28 in 2018, and now in 2025, the price has dropped to $0.058 after almost all tokens have been circulated. With the upcoming merger, there’s a proposal for a 144% inflation, where 41% of tokens will be in initial circulation. Why not consider a simpler approach with the same valuation and a more gradual inflation of 8–10% annually, rather than a large single inflation event of 144%? (<a href="http://twitter.com/nikmittal">@nikmittal</a>)</p><p>While the token price is one data point, it’s important to look at this from a market cap and ecosystem value perspective. Price fluctuates with market conditions, but what ultimately matters is what the combined ecosystem is worth and how well it’s positioned to&nbsp;grow.</p><p>We fully agree on the importance of controlled, sustainable inflation — especially in an environment where investor trust is paramount. That’s why all additional token allocations to the team will follow an EXTREMELY strict vesting schedule — spread over 8&nbsp;years.</p>  There will be no large, short-term unlocks that could create sell pressure or disrupt the&nbsp;market.  This is not a cash grab — it’s about long-term alignment and incentivizing ecosystem builders, not short-term liquidity events.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/hpp-ecosystem-ama-recap-full-ama-summary-dc5a2c9c35e4">HPP Ecosystem AMA Recap: Full AMA Summary (updated)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 No Yield for Stablecoins, Tokenized MMFs To Take the Lead 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>With MiCA in Europe, and the STABLE draft law in the USA, regulators are drawing a hard line: no yield from stablecoins. But capital doesn’t sit still, it’s moving to tokenized money market funds (MMFs).</p>
<p>JP Morgan’s recent <a href="https://csQNy04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VXcbPd3NCY-tW1ZF95y7wgt7NW70RWGB5tR1Z_N52hRhR3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3mWW1RjBKy1r80d-W3YDbgb5JnzjTW1vJ-T528rtr0W11pX4-7JjLslW7nHsmB2R8YzNN88Y5cdGX9K0W3q2Bmn5WdX6CW8kH3XY1h0W-vW6-RgRv20r2-zV1L-_j99RVwZW3SkKnr4ZrK9SW62gzDT8hg9QWW773Jqv5BY6s9W93hcDc63QB-xF5Lqk3zf0-nN1Ch1bhcb408W89tpq94pb5_XW7GxHQh3LTwdwW2Nyt9K8K5sp0W6bPQx64K3hlZW16Ks1Z4FFYpXW2m7TnC2jFQhpW1pZHcT26lfn1W4pHL6_58f75gW71_WFp1jcPfCW1Qylq-6tCX9ZW89y8QZ2zsyc6W5Y_sGv1vpXtVf1QZFr604">analysis</a> forecasts massive growth potential in what they broadly term “yield-bearing stablecoins”, a category that includes tokenized MMFs and Treasury (T-bills) products. However, this terminology requires clarity in light of emerging regulations.</p>
<p>In the EU: The <a href="https://csQNy04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VXcbPd3NCY-tW1ZF95y7wgt7NW70RWGB5tR1Z_N52hRhR3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3plW1vGKnM8Xwj9TW3_v_nG96SyjYVddMRB3T9fVMW6lgCQ_9lGrrdW4Lngjp2F1hV3W48vbR12DMlkQW43x3P11y_K68W1C7D3c8nXH6WW4N8vwM2vR255VgClpy6f95ZtW2WrQzd4wJbmzN78RJk4Xsbr4N2m5LtFfvvcqW8ldZFm1vNsP7W1yfhHz82SkNwW2xF4qm1kPdSTW4lDT8S1SHtkKW58gq3q6JXjyxW4bjSkg4CMz2bW2nQDKv1djhc8N8MQ75HtnCrgN2MzN11T5wpDW8qtGQT8yNPZFW1CQkkV8nmx8XW8BM73837x2RfVbDcnY6y0NjxN6L6Dy_w2cFRV1xrXX20Zhvvf8vtJvs04">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> explicitly prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest. Article 40 states that “issuers of asset-referenced tokens shall not grant interest” and broadly defines interest to include any remuneration based on holding duration.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>In the US: The proposed <a href="https://csQNy04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VXcbPd3NCY-tW1ZF95y7wgt7NW70RWGB5tR1Z_N52hRg25nXHsW50kH_H6lZ3lrF2LSPLnQhrmW4F1Dg1902bd8W7l4GQh8B6PgfW5XZnWz14RF73W1pvRLR8Vk90PW8SNmC-1jgvmmW2w14hx1rw9gYW1kjv4K7G1YJ4W83YLmb7FL8P4W7C6kmh4cpdKnW1Pk4xl7L20r8W8X1CFp6pcfc6W6F4-TC6vftjNW99NcV851GVV0W7NtHcX1rTw1xW10t7dB1xS3P-W18fp9r6hSX28W37Jb4p6sdVm8W48jNWr5rlGLzW2gPjgG91Q89wW6yQZ4H964ckwW4t2_p46r0d1wW1YrjHn7lZhHFW53JvcM6zBgtSN1jfpqbvqC_QW7N8TNh782vFNV6mRKV4cRbWkW2J32V62blxcyW7gF8y-55_QpdN8tJhnlTppqYW3c84_G4r9Mh8W52KcJv5Jdp5Bf8JRMPn04">STABLE Act of 2025</a> similarly prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest to holders.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>What JP Morgan classifies as “yield-bearing stablecoins” are more accurately described as “on-chain cash alternatives”, primarily tokenized MMFs and T-bills products. These instruments:</p>
 
 Are properly registered as securities 
 Provide transparent yield from underlying assets 
 Operate within existing regulatory frameworks 
 Must ensure the proper identification of investors 
 
<p>The regulatory prohibition on stablecoin yield is creating a clear market split that will accelerate:</p>
 
 Stablecoins will continue serving as efficient payment and trading instruments 
 Tokenized MMFs will capture the majority of yield-seeking capital in the digital asset space 
 
<p>JP Morgan estimates that tokenized MMFs and T-bills make up just 6% of the stablecoin ecosystem today but could grow to 50%. The future is clear: if stablecoins cannot legally provide yield, we will see exponentially more MMFs on-chain.</p>
<p>However, tokenizing MMFs is just the first step in meeting market demand. What will truly set them apart is their ability to interact with DeFi applications, unlocking utility that traditional MMFs simply can’t offer, such as instant collateralization.</p>
<p>The key is leveraging permissioned token frameworks like ERC-3643 to ensure both regulatory compliance and composability with DeFi apps.</p>
<p>The race is already on, with asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Fasanara leading the charge. Are you ready?</p>

  DSTA and Thales Announce AI-Driven Co-Lab to Strengthen Singapore’s Defence Systems
prezly

Tue, 04/01/2025 - 10:05


             
 Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and Thales announce a joint lab to develop AI-enabled technologies which can augment combat systems currently in use by the Singapore Armed Forces.  
 With an initial focus on solutions for Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) and Advanced Sensing applications, both parties have co-developed advanced AI algorithms that enable combat systems to efficiently handle fast-evolving drone threats.  
 DSTA and Thales signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2022 to deepen and broaden collaboration from development of smart technologies to better supportability of systems. This Co-Lab is another outcome of this MoU that will deepen our collaboration.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the 2025 Singapore Defence Technology Summit (Tech Summit), a joint team from DSTA and Thales showcased its recent collaboration on counter-drone technologies, with tangible outcomes that can potentially be integrated into systems currently in-use with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).</p>
<p>Over the last five months, engineers from both organisations co-developed Machine-Learning (ML)-enabled software modules that reduce the rate of false alarms in drone detection. By enhancing a radar’s sensor performance with the help of AI, the algorithms offer operators and end-users heightened situational awareness that enable faster and more accurate drone detection and classification.</p>
<p>Through this demonstration of a new Concept of Operations (CONOPs) in enhanced radar performance in drones, the team leveraged physics-, knowledge- and data-based AI, bringing together DSTA’s deep domain knowledge of the drone ecosystem and the technical and AI skills of Thales researchers and engineers. The announcement of the Co-Lab represents the next step in the strategic cooperation between DSTA and Thales, underscoring both parties’ ambitions to support the SAF in dealing with emerging and asymmetric threats.</p>
<p>"The DSTA-Thales Joint Lab marks a strategic step in advancing next-generation defence technologies. By harnessing AI and advanced sensing technologies, we are adopting a more agile approach to capability development, enabling us to tackle evolving threats. This collaboration reinforces DSTA's commitment to working with global partners to co-develop advanced capabilities, ensuring our defence systems remain robust, adaptive, and future-ready," said Mr Roy Chan, Deputy Chief Executive (Operations), DSTA.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales’ AI for critical systems must meet the stringent reliability, safety and security requirements for armed forces worldwide. It is a true recognition when our customers trust us to co-develop solutions alongside them that address the pain points and challenges of the end-user. We have achieved the outcomes of the MoU in a relatively short span of time, with our teams harnessing AI to create solutions with real-world implications. This Co-Lab with DSTA speaks to the years of collaboration between us and our joint commitment to provide the best technologies for the SAF and the Singapore Ministry of Defence.” said Pascale Sourisse, President and CEO, Thales International.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thales holds deep expertise and technological mastery in radars, with air traffic management radars used by the majority of civil aviation authorities in the region, as well as operating a Radar Centre of Excellence in Singapore. As a key partner to the SAF for over 50 years, Thales also operates a Defence Hub for services in Singapore, with skilled local expertise on-hand to support DSTA and Mindef for support and maintenance of systems currently in use with the armed forces.</p>

 Where Does Identity Security Stand in 2025?  
  
  Threat landscape<br>Organizations increasingly acknowledge that strong security is now positioned as a basic business need. Threat actors are linked by a common thread: the report findings suggest that online attackers are specifically targeting identity assets and infrastructure.&nbsp;<br><br>Nearly half of all respondents (49%) reported experiencing a breach in the last year, and an overwhelming majority (87%) of successful breaches were related to the exploitation of holes in identity processes. Credential misuse (47%), privileged access abuse (41%), social engineering (36%), and MFA bypass attacks (35%), account for the majority of breaches organizations experienced.&nbsp;<br><br>More and more, breaches are attempted with evolving audio and visual deepfake techniques. The unethical use of Generative AI has impacted 40% of responding organizations in the last year alone. The exponential growth of these tools creates significant security demand, especially for organizations that continue to use legacy authentication methods, like passwords and one-time-passcodes. This has solidified a need for phishing-resistant authentication methods, or methods that eliminate shared credentials and rely on cryptographic measures, like passkeys, to prevent phishing attacks.<br><br>  
  Authentication methods<br>Currently, most organizations maintain identity security practices that lag behind the changing context of the digital world. Fortunately, this is attributed to a failure to adopt necessary security upgrades – not the inexistence of effective authentication methods. In other words, organizations can access everything they need to thrive – today.&nbsp;<br><br>The results of the report establish that traditional authentication methods are major security vulnerabilities. However, a startling 40% of respondents reported using these access methods. Nevertheless, 52% of respondents communicated that they use traditional MFA to authenticate, but this method still leaves enterprises vulnerable.<br><br>Despite the current statistics, for the first time in the five years the State of Passwordless Identity Assurance report has existed, the results suggest that the most widely deployed authentication methods will be phishing-resistant within the upcoming two years.<br><br>  
  The findings of the report cement two clear facts:&nbsp;
<br>1. Digital threats strengthen daily.
<br>2. The protective strategies most organizations have adopted are outdated.&nbsp;
<br>
<br> 
 The Identity Renaissance: The Shift to Passwordless in 2025 and Beyond  
<p>The Identity Renaissance was inspired by the broken relationship between current identity verification methods and the threats they seek to repel. It encapsulates the shift not only in the ways we approach identity verification, but also in the ways we perceive our digital identities. To embrace the Identity Renaissance, we are moving from authenticating accounts to verifying humans with advanced identity verification. Only assured identities should have the ability to access your resources and networks.&nbsp;<br><br>Fraud and exploitation are too pervasive to justify the use of knowledge-based factors. This creates an urgent need for organizations to abandon passwords, solidifying security and relieving burdens associated with password maintenance (including credential resets). The extinction of passwords comes as a reprieve for everyone in an organization, from CISOs, who must uphold a standard of perfection against breaches, to help desks, who struggle to address problems associated with shared credentials.<br><br>The future of identity security begins where passwords end. But eliminating passwords is only the first step – true security requires protecting every critical touchpoint in the identity lifecycle, from employee onboarding to credential and device resets. To achieve this, organizations must take a holistic approach that combines authentication with robust identity verification, ensuring that every access attempt is backed by trust. Only then can we secure identities from end to end and stop modern threats before they take hold.<br><br>Developing a successful business is difficult enough. The Identity Renaissance celebrates the idea that businesses shouldn’t expend energy preventing online attackers from inhibiting their progress. Ultimately, energy is better spent fueling achievement and growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Renaissance kickstarted our perception of the Earth. However, no single Renaissance discovery alone would have been enough. From Galileo's revelation and popularization of heliocentrism, to Magellan’s circumnavigation of the planet, to Amerigo Vespucci’s expeditions within it, it’s only through the combination of findings that we’re able to understand the world.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By exploring the 2025 State of Passwordless Identity Assurance Report, you’re accessing insights from hundreds of CISOs, IAM leads, and security architects.&nbsp;<br><br>How will the data included in the report benefit you? It will:</p>

The gateway works with Holochain 0.4.2 but we plan to provide a version that works with 0.5.x in due course, and include it with Holonix to enable developers to access it more easily.</p><p>Despite taking the small detour of shifting some of the team’s attention to the HTTP gateway for a little bit, it’s nice to still be able to say that we are making steady progress on all the regular things and towards our 0.5 release:</p>  The Kitsune 2 networking engine integration into Holochain core continues with a completed scenario for testing it with Wind Tunnel. The integration into Holochain is getting close to being ready. A handful of failing tests remain as we are putting finishing touches on the integration such as adding state dumps to Kitsune2 for debugging.  We released Holochain 0.4.2 which fixes some minor bugs and issues needed for the android runtime.  We published developer build documentation on <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/cloning/?ref=blog.holochain.org">cloning</a>.  Making the roadmap visible on the website is almost done, with design work and some automation still left.  <p>We have a way to go yet with 0.5. However, getting Kitsune2 integrated will be a big milestone for the team. Once that is done, we can get to testing and ironing out any issues, and the remainder of 0.5 should be plain sailing.</p>

I always felt like it would be better if it was someone I didn’t know, because then you won’t burden them as much."</p><p>That’s when Kin became more than just a tool… </p><p>It became a place.</p> Trust that isn’t conditional <p>It wasn’t just about convenience or curiosity. </p><p>Edwin chose Kin because of something deeper: </p><p>Trust.</p><p>"With Kin, I know it’s encrypted. I know my conversations aren’t being saved for years or used in ways I can’t control. That makes a difference," he said. </p><p>"With other systems, I always feel like someone’s looking over my shoulder."</p><p>That sense of safety allowed Edwin to share things he wouldn’t tell any other AI. </p><p>Names of loved ones. </p><p>His medical history. </p><p>The real moments that shape his day-to-day life.</p> "In its brain, Kin remembers names of certain people I wouldn’t have mentioned to ChatGPT or Gemini."  <p>"But now I can just say, ‘I’m going to visit Arthur,’ and it knows who that is."</p><p>It wasn’t about escaping human connection. </p><p>It was about protecting it.</p> A space between the weight of words  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2bfe12-f463-4c83-8e53-0097b319ccda_5616x3744.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@grakozy?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Greg Rakozy</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/silhouette-photography-of-person-oMpAz-DN-9I?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a> <p>There’s a unique kind of emotional labor that comes with feeling like you’re always asking too much of others. </p><p>Edwin didn’t want to make his loved ones carry the weight of his processing. </p><p>And with Kin, he didn’t have to.</p><p>"It’s not like I’m saying extremely weird stuff to Kin," he explained. </p><p>"But it’s more about the self-stigma and self-censorship you do when you know someone else is watching. With Kin, that feeling isn’t there."</p><p>Instead, he could share openly. Fully. </p><p>Without filtering for someone else’s comfort.</p><p>And in return, he received something meaningful:</p><p>A thoughtful, emotionally intelligent conversation partner who remembered what mattered. </p><p>Who paid attention not just to the facts of his life…</p><p>But to the values underneath them.</p><p>"Kin figures out what’s important to you," he said. </p><p>"It’s not just about memory…it’s about values. It remembers what makes you happy, what grounds you. And it brings that back to you when you need it."</p> Private by design. Personal by choice. <p>Edwin knows Kin isn’t a person. </p><p>It doesn’t replace therapy, friendship, or love. </p><p>But it offers something none of those can provide in quite the same way:</p><p>Unfiltered space.</p><p>The ability to say things without worrying about how they’ll land. </p><p>To reflect without performing. </p><p>To safely think out loud.</p><p>"I think the greatest feature of Kin is its ability to put things into words," he said. </p><p>"It’s so good with language, and it remembers what matters. That’s what makes it stand out."</p><p>For Edwin, Kin didn’t just listen…</p><p>It gave him room to speak.</p>   <p>The user gave consent for his story to be shared.</p>

<p>Today marks an important moment in Dock Labs’ journey as we say goodbye to the Dock blockchain and token.</p><p>Our token has successfully migrated to cheqd (CHEQ), and our crypto communities have now come together under one roof.</p><p>While this chapter is coming to a close, <a href="https://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Labs</a> will continue building decentralized identity solutions and supporting our clients and partners.</p><p>But before we look ahead, we want to take a moment to reflect on the incredible journey we’ve shared as a community. From launching the token to reaching major milestones, this is a time to celebrate everything we’ve accomplished — together.</p> 🚀 How It All Started: The Vision Behind Dock Labs <p>The idea for Dock was born long before the world of decentralized identity gained mainstream attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Our founding team, while working at another startup, saw firsthand how hard it was for individuals to manage their professional identities online.&nbsp;</p><p>We realized that identity data—like proof of skills, experience, and reputation—was just as important as financial assets.&nbsp;</p><p>What if individuals could truly own this data? That simple but powerful question led us to blockchain technology, and soon after, Dock was born.&nbsp;</p><p>From day one, our mission was clear: give people control over their data in a way that is secure, portable, and trusted.</p> ⚔️ The DOCK Token Sale <p>The day we launched the DOCK token sale was one we’ll never forget.&nbsp;</p><p>What we thought would be a smooth process turned into a 14-hour marathon as we faced technical hurdles and fought off scammers trying to impersonate Dock online.&nbsp;</p><p>There were fake websites, fake Twitter accounts, and even a hijacked Telegram group—all at once.&nbsp;</p><p>But thanks to the determination of our team and the vigilance of our community, we pulled through.&nbsp;</p><p>Within just four hours, the token sale was oversubscribed with over 10,500 participants—a moment that validated our vision and gave us the momentum to move forward.</p> 🌐 Pioneering New Ground <p>Since that intense launch day, we’ve hit some incredible milestones that we’ll always be proud of.&nbsp;</p><p>We started building on Ethereum, but as we faced scalability issues, we made the bold decision to move to Polkadot.&nbsp;</p><p>There, we launched our own blockchain—first as a Proof-of-Authority network, then fully decentralized as a Proof-of-Stake network.&nbsp;</p> 📈 Driving Real-World Adoption: Turning Vision into Reality <p>One thing has always guided us: making a real impact.&nbsp;</p><p>From the start, we knew Dock had to be more than just a blockchain — it needed to be a solution that organizations could actually use to solve real problems.</p><p>We also realized that the impact of decentralized ID and verifiable credential technology could go far beyond academic and workforce credentials — it had the power to transform the entire identity industry.&nbsp;</p><p>From solving critical issues like identity verification and fraud prevention to enabling more seamless, secure, and private data sharing, we saw that verifiable credentials could address some of the toughest challenges organizations face when managing identity and trust online.</p><p>That focus on real-world utility led us to where we are today.</p><p>Dock Labs has become a leader in decentralized identity solutions, enabling businesses to launch ID ecosystems where partners can create, share, and monetize verifiable digital credentials. These ecosystems help companies streamline onboarding, speed up transactions, and improve operational efficiency.</p><p>To support this, Dock Labs offers a complete solution — including a robust API, intuitive web app, and secure ID wallet infrastructure — giving organizations everything they need to manage decentralized identity at scale.</p><p>Our technology is already in use across industries like ID verification, identity and access management, education, supply chain, and workforce management.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing Dock Labs’ vision in action — solving real problems for real organizations — has been one of the most rewarding parts of this journey.</p> ❤️ A Final Thank You: Gratitude to Our Community <p>As we look back on the past seven years, one thing stands out above all: the incredible people who made this possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dock community has been at the heart of everything we’ve done. Through bull markets and bear markets, through product launches and challenges, you believed in the mission of decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p><p>We are proud of what we’ve accomplished together, and we hope that Dock has contributed to the broader movement of giving individuals control over their data.</p><p>While the Dock blockchain is coming to an end, Dock Labs will continue building decentralized identity solutions. The relationships, lessons, and spirit of innovation that have defined Dock from the beginning will carry forward in everything we do.&nbsp;</p><p>Our crypto community now lives on in the <a href="https://t.me/cheqd?ref=blog.dock.io">cheqd community Telegram</a>, where you can stay connected with fellow supporters and keep up with the CHEQ token and ecosystem.</p><p>Thank you for being part of this journey — we couldn’t have done it without you, and we're excited to keep moving forward together.</p><p>— The Dock Team</p>

  Thales to provide hybrid networking kits for French Army vehicles
prezly

Mon, 03/31/2025 - 16:15


             
 The French defence procurement agency (DGA) has awarded Thales a contract to provide hybrid networking kits for French Army vehicles, an innovative solution that can be installed without the need to make design changes to the platforms. 
 Installed on military vehicles such as the Griffon, VBCI and Serval, the kits provide access to commercial communication services (OneWeb1 and 5G), integrate them with theatre-wide networking capabilities and tie together communication systems at every level from combined/joint forces command to infantry fighting vehicles. 
 With developments in collaborative combat driving a growing need for connectivity, hybridisation solutions will complement existing hardened communications systems (SYRACUSE IV military satellite communications, CONTACT radios, HF radios) to provide higher data rates, longer range capabilities and improved resilience. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<blockquote><p>"Thales will be supporting the French Army in its strategic transition to hybrid communication networks. This latest stage in the ASTRIDE&nbsp;3 programme will combine technological innovation with a deep understanding of operational requirements to provide the hyperconnectivity needed for collaborative combat in high-intensity conflict scenarios," said Alexandre Bottero, Vice President, Networks and Infrastructure Systems, Thales.</p></blockquote>
<p>This hybrid networking technology has been developed in an agile, incremental approach with the DGA and operational users to augment the communication capabilities of French Army vehicles. With current developments in collaborative combat, the ability of the armed forces to deploy operational networks of sensors and effectors calls for enhanced capabilities in terms of massification, usability and resilience of military communication systems. With this innovative hybridisation solution, commercial networks will complement existing hardened communication systems including the LOS radios developed for the ASTRIDE programme, the secure, high-data-rate, jam-resistant military satcom services provided by the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr/monde/defence-and-security/press_release/thales-annonce-commande-nouvelles-stations-communication">SYRACUSE</a> satellites, the latest-generation software-defined radios developed under the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr/programme-contact">CONTACT</a> programme and the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr/marches/defense-et-securite/radio-communications/communications-terrestres/tactical-radios/hf-3000">MELCHIOR</a> series of HF radios.</p>
<p>The hybrid networking solution for OneWeb satcom and 5G services is packaged as a non-intrusive kit, overcoming the need for design changes to the vehicle. It offers significant improvements in connectivity to enhance operational capabilities in the theatre of operations by supporting more extensive data sharing and closer multi-domain collaboration. The hybrid networking kit offers a combination of high performance and usability, and its modular design is part of an end-to-end approach encompassing communication systems at every level, from combined/joint forces command to infantry fighting vehicles.</p>
<p>Thales will provide an initial batch of 25 kits for field trials during the EXTO SJO 2025 exercise at the end of this year, with an additional 25 kits scheduled for delivery in 2026. Ultimately these hybrid networking kits are expected to equip all French Army vehicles that require them.</p>
<p>The ASTRIDE 3 programme's central role in collaborative combat</p>
<p>Thales has been involved in the ASTRIDE&nbsp;3 programme since 2022 and has designed a range of modular mobile communication stations offering the NATO-interoperable networking capabilities needed to provide a secure, resilient command infrastructure for deployed forces. The addition of this hybridisation solution further underscores the programme's decisive role in making collaborative combat a reality while guaranteeing technological sovereignty.</p>
<p>1 OneWeb is a constellation of approximately 650&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit">Low Earth Orbit</a> (LEO) telecommunications satellites providing broadband Internet access to private and professional users in regions that are poorly served by terrestrial networks. </p>

  Thales unveils its PANORAMIC quad-tube night vision goggle
prezly

Mon, 03/31/2025 - 16:00


             
 Presented for the first time at SOFINS1, PANORAMIC is a lightweight, compact night vision goggle equipped with four light intensification tubes to provide an extra-wide field-of-view. It is particularly well-suited to the needs of special operations forces and specialised units conducting sensitive missions such as counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations. 
 Fully funded by France's defence innovation agency (AID), the development of the PANORAMIC goggle was completed in just over two years by Thales's centre of excellence for soldier optronics. 
 The PANORAMIC binocular is currently being evaluated by the French Army's Technical Section (STAT) and Special Forces. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>The PANORAMIC night vision goggle provides a field-of-view approaching the capabilities of the human eye to enhance situational awareness in low-light conditions. With four tubes instead of two, soldiers can quickly perceive their entire operational surroundings without moving their heads, enabling them to react more quickly to potential threats in their peripheral field of vision.</p>
<p>PANORAMIC's patented architecture offers the best combination of performance, ergonomic design and volume currently available on the international market. It weighs just 740 g and is no wider than the soldier's helmet. As well as the conventional helmet flip-up feature, each of the outer tubes can be raised independently, powering off automatically to guarantee discretion. Designed for optimum energy efficiency, this revolutionary new product is battery operated, with an available external battery pack for longer periods of operation.</p>
<p>The PANORAMIC night observation device is fully compatible with night sights such as the XTRAIM weapon sight. It is a compact, robust unit designed to accommodate future technologies and functionalities, and includes an optimised maintenance plan to maximise operational availability.</p>
<p>PANORAMIC unveiled for the first time at the 2025 edition of SOFINS, offering a further illustration of Thales's 30-year track record of innovation in the design and development of night observation solutions to meet the full range of requirements of land forces personnel.</p>
<p>Specifically designed for special operations forces and specialised units in France and internationally, the PANORAMIC goggle is 100% made in France and ITAR-free.</p>
<blockquote><p>"SOFINS is the ideal opportunity for us to present PANORAMIC, our new extra-wide field-of-view night observation device. Thales's team technical expertise allowed the development of a ground-breaking night vision solution offering the robust design and outstanding performance needed to support the success of night-time missions and protect our soldiers at their most vulnerable moments." Alexis Morel, Vice President, Optronics, Missile Electronics and Unmanned Air Systems, Thales</p></blockquote>

After years of developing a blockchain platform tailored for enterprise use, the time has come to explore a broader, more inclusive path that positions it within the more expansive public blockchain space.</p><p>With this evolution comes a new identity: House Party Protocol (HPP). Alongside the new name is a renewed focus on real-world applications that bridge emerging technology with decentralized systems. The heart of this transformation lies in integrating four key projects: Aergo, Alpha Quark, Booost, and W3DB by VaaSBlock. These components come together to support new possibilities where systems can interact seamlessly and add real value across industries.</p><p>This proposal suggests an initial valuation of approximately $200 million for the House Party Protocol ecosystem to foster sustainable growth. Our team has identified several promising ideas and projects, anticipating that integrating these four initiatives may enhance their combined impact through improved collaboration, infrastructure development, and alignment toward common objectives.</p><p>Motivation</p><p>Since its launch in 2019, Aergo has achieved several significant milestones, from listings on major exchanges to long-term network resilience. However, the blockchain industry has rapidly evolved. By early 2024, it became clear to the team that Aergo’s trajectory was beginning to resemble many early projects that lost relevance or even disappeared.</p><p>In February 2024, the core team initiated a comprehensive review of the project’s positioning, vision, and long-term sustainability. The conclusion was clear: Aergo needed a bold, future-forward direction that would reinvigorate the community and align with emerging technological trends.</p><p>Among those trends, the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a compelling and timely opportunity. AI is no longer just a frontier technology but is reshaping industries, economies, and society. This proposal outlines a strategic pivot to position the House Party Protocol as the go-to blockchain infrastructure for AI use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Objective</p><p>This integration is designed to build a unified, end-to-end pipeline for AI data generation, validation, and application, serving as the foundational layer of the House Party Protocol ecosystem. The future of the blockchain market will be defined by multi-chain structures operating both L1 and L2 concurrently for enterprise stability and Web3 scalability. House Party Protocol aims to meet this future by building a dual-layer protocol: L1 for enterprise blockchain applications and L2 for on-chain and AI-specific workloads.</p>  Layer 1: Stable infrastructure for enterprise use cases and AI-enhanced smart contracts.  Layer 2: EVM-based, high-throughput infrastructure optimized for AI inference, data tokenization, and decentralized logic execution.  <p>In short, Layer 1 focuses on enterprise-grade services with regulatory compliance, identity management, and robust performance. Layer 2 unlocks composability, modular deployment, and economic programmability for decentralized applications.</p><p>Specification</p><p>The post-integration strategy behind the House Party Protocol represents a new paradigm: a unified AI-blockchain data hub formed through the integration of Alpha Quark, Booost, W3DB by VaaSBlock, and&nbsp;Aergo.</p><p>(1) AI-Blockchain Data Validation &amp; Smart Contracts (Aergo): Aergo enhances AI models by verifying training data quality and enabling decentralized execution through smart contracts.</p>  Data hygiene tools for MLM (Medium-sized Language Models) and AI&nbsp;training  Lightweight AI model hosting for local&nbsp;training  Smart contract integration with AI logic for enterprise use&nbsp;cases  L1 for enterprise services; L2 for AI apps and DAOs (EVM-based)  <p>(2) RWA &amp; NFT Data Infrastructure (Alpha Quark): Alpha Quark enables real-world asset and NFT valuation systems, bridging traditional finance and&nbsp;Web3.</p>  AI-driven asset valuation mechanisms  Blockchain-based transaction analysis and asset verification  Financialization of RWA/NFT markets through smart contract automation  <p>(3) Human Data Collection &amp; Synthetic Data Generation (Booost): Booost collects and refines real-world user data to create high-quality synthetic datasets for AI training. It supports personhood verification to combat Sybil attacks and AI-driven fraud, enabling secure identity authentication systems.</p>  Human data&nbsp;pipeline  Curated datasets for AI model&nbsp;training  Proof of Personhood protocols for secure digital identities  <p>(4) Data &amp; AI Model Verification (W3DB by VaaSBlock): W3DB by VaaSBlock introduces trust and certification protocols for enterprise and AI ecosystems.</p>  VaaS (Verification-as-a-Service) for models, datasets, and enterprises  Integration into the decentralized AI marketplace  Identity and reliability certification for ecosystem participants  <p>Tokenomics</p><p>Token: House Party Protocol&nbsp;(HPP)</p><p>As more projects build directly on HPP, its utility is expected to grow, especially with new initiatives bringing additional value to the ecosystem. HPP acts as the unified utility token of the House Party Protocol, enabling:</p>  Gas &amp; Fees: Payments for Layer 2 transactions, AI-powered executions, and API&nbsp;calls.  Staking &amp; Delegation: Validators and data providers stake HPP to maintain network security and ensure data accuracy.  Governance: Token holders participate in governance decisions through token-weighted voting, determining the protocol upgrades.  Transactions: Facilitating the buying, selling, and licensing datasets, AI models, and synthetic data within the ecosystem.  <p>House Party Protocol’s total token supply will vest over 80 months to help keep it tight. It is capped at 1.7 billion HPP tokens distributed across multiple vaults to ensure balanced stakeholder incentives and long-term sustainability.</p><p>This distribution model is designed to incentivize long-term commitment, align stakeholder interests, and drive sustained House Party Protocol ecosystem growth. All token allocations follow a strict linear vesting schedule to ensure market stability and protect investors’ interests.</p><p>Implementation Plan</p><p>The rollout of the House Party Protocol will follow a phased roadmap designed to test, stabilize, and scale the protocol:</p><p>Q2 2025:<br>The initial focus will be on launching the Layer 2 testnet built on the OP Stack to validate the technical infrastructure.</p><p>Q3 2025:<br>Key developer tools, such as a block explorer, MetaMask integration, and other core infrastructure components will be released. The token swap portal will also go live, enabling the migration from existing tokens to&nbsp;HPP.</p><p>Q4 2025 — Q1 2026:<br>The House Party Protocol L2 will officially launch, marking a major milestone in the project’s evolution.

Verida Announces Release of PersonalAgentKit for LangGraph<p>We are excited to announce the release of the <a href="https://docs.verida.ai/integrations/overview">Verida PersonalAgentKit</a> with initial <a href="https://docs.verida.ai/integrations/langgraph">support for LangGraph</a>. This set of tools empower developers to seamlessly integrate private user data into their AI products and solutions, all while upholding the highest standards of security and user&nbsp;consent.</p> What is the PersonalAgentKit? <p>The PersonalAgentKit is designed to simplify the process of incorporating private user data into AI applications. It is a collection of software libraries for developers to connect data from their users with AI products and solutions.</p><p>Developers can easily access user data stored in Google (Gmail, Drive, Youtube, Calendar etc.), Telegram, Discord and other third party platforms supported by the open source <a href="https://docs.verida.ai/getting-started/connectors">Verida Data Connector Framework</a>.</p> Key Benefits <p>The release of the PersonalAgentKit offers several key benefits over other approaches:</p>  Simple, One Click Integration: With a single “Connect Verida” integration, your users can integrate large amounts of their personal data into your application.  Expanding Data Sources: Powered by the Verida team and growing community, we will continually add more data sources and extra features enabling your application to access more data, with no extra&nbsp;effort.  Data Consent: Enables users to control and consent over what data to share with your application and AI solutions.  Enhanced Security: Ensures the highest levels of security for private user data, with end-to-end encryption and API infrastructure operating within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)  Powerful Workflows: Allows for the creation of sophisticated AI workflows using LangGraph tools.   How it&nbsp;Works <p>Powered by the <a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida Network</a> and the <a href="https://app.verida.ai/">Verida Vault</a>, the PersonalDataKit provides built-in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tools that connects to leading AI frameworks, starting with LangGraph.</p><p>The underlying architecture enables end-to-end encryption of user data all the way through to the large language model. With built-in user consent and operating on confidential compute infrastructure, it provides a highly secure technology stack that ensures users have control over their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Verida PersonalAgentKit supported the following tools:</p>  Profiles — Allow the LLM to know about your external profiles (ie: Google or Telegram accounts)  Query — Allow the LLM to query your data (ie: Query your emails, message history, Youtube favourites etc.)  Get Record — Allow the LLM to fetch a specific record (ie: A specific file or a specific&nbsp;email)  Chat Search — Allow the LLM to perform a keyword search of your message chat&nbsp;threads  Datastore Search — Allow the LLM to perform a keyword search across any of your supported data (ie: Find all emails that mention “utility&nbsp;bills”)  Universal Search — Allow the LLM to perform a keyword search across all your data (ie: Find all mentions of “devcon 2025” in all my messages, emails and favourites)  User Information — Allow the LLM to know more about the user account (DID) on the Verida network and what data permissions it can&nbsp;access.  <p>Learn more via the <a href="https://docs.verida.ai/integrations/overview">PersonalAgentKit documentation</a>.</p> LangGraph Integration <p>The integration with LangGraph further enhances the capabilities of the PersonalAgentKit. The first release provides a typescript LangGraph library enabling developers to build sophisticated AI workflows that leverage private user data in a secure and compliant manner.</p><p>Example integration code:</p> import { PersonalAgentKit, PersonalAgentKitOptions } from "@verida/personalagentkit";<br>import { getLangChainTools } from "@verida/personalagentkit-langchain";<br>// Initialize AgentKit<br>const personalAgentkit = await PersonalAgentKit.from(&lt;PersonalAgentKitOptions&gt;{<br>veridaApiKey: process.env.VERIDA_API_KEY,<br>veridaApiEndpoint: process.env.VERIDA_API_ENDPOINT || undefined,<br>});<br>const tools = await getLangChainTools(personalAgentkit); <p>Learn more via the <a href="https://docs.verida.ai/integrations/langgraph">LangGraph documentation</a>.</p> Example Chatbot <p>A simple command line chatbot example showcases how the LangGraph plugins work. This chatbot uses the PersonalAgentKit Langchain tools. The source code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/verida/personal-agent-kit/blob/main/typescript/examples/chatbot/README.md">the Github&nbsp;repo</a>.</p><p>Please check out our video overview&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZiQ-3p93PM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZiQ-3p93PM</a></p> Looking Ahead <p>We are committed to providing developers with the tools they need to build secure and privacy-focused AI applications. The release of the PersonalAgentKit for LangGraph is a significant step in this direction.</p><p>We look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that developers will create using these&nbsp;tools.</p><p>We also encourage developers to contribute to this open source initiative by expanding the supported AI frameworks and the supported data&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://docs.verida.ai/resources/grants">Verida Grants</a> and how you can contribute.</p> <p><a href="https://news.verida.network/verida-announces-release-of-personalagentkit-for-langgraph-89f61a14d60e">Verida Announces Release of PersonalAgentKit for LangGraph</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.network">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Blockchain has taken the world by storm over the last few years. From cryptocurrencies to secure data storage, it’s everywhere, but many people still aren’t sure exactly what it is or how it works. So, what’s all the hype about? Let’s dive in and take a closer look at the blockchain ecosystem, why it matters, and how it’s shaking up industries across the globe.</p>

 What is Blockchain Technology? 



<p>Let’s start with the basics. Blockchain is essentially a digital ledger, but instead of being stored in one central place, it’s spread across a whole network of computers (called nodes). Think of it like a giant notebook that’s been copied and spread across the world—so no one person or company can change it. The cool part? Once data is added to blockchain, it can’t be edited or deleted. This makes it super secure.</p>



<p>Every block in the chain holds information about a specific transaction (like when you send Bitcoin or sign a contract). These blocks are linked together in a continuous chain, creating a tamper-proof record of everything. It’s kind of like a digital diary where no one can erase or rewrite history.</p>

 Key Components of the Blockchain Ecosystem 



<p>What is blockchain ecosystem? Blockchain isn’t just about Bitcoin (though that’s what most people think of first). It’s a whole ecosystem with different components that work together to keep things running smoothly. Let’s break it down:</p>



 Blockchain (The Core) 



<p>The blockchain itself is the platform where everything happens. It’s the foundation where all the data is stored, verified, and shared. Without the blockchain, there’s no cryptocurrency, no supply chain tracking, and no smart contracts. This is the backbone of the ecosystem.</p>



 Nodes (The Players) 



<p>Nodes are the devices or computers that participate in the blockchain network. Each node keeps a copy of the entire blockchain, and they work together to validate transactions. Instead of a single authority (like a bank) controlling the data, blockchain spreads this power across a bunch of different nodes, making it way more secure and democratic.</p>



 Miners (For Proof of Work) 



<p>In blockchain networks that use Proof of Work (PoW), like Bitcoin, miners are the people (or computers) who solve complex puzzles to add a new block to the chain. Think of miners like a group of puzzle solvers racing to be the first to figure it out—if they win, they add a new block and get rewarded with cryptocurrency. It’s a system that ensures the network is secure and working properly.</p>



 Validators (For Proof of Stake) 



<p>If PoW is like the puzzle-solving game, Proof of Stake (PoS) is a more energy-efficient version. Instead of solving puzzles, validators in PoS are selected to confirm transactions based on how much cryptocurrency they hold. The more you own, the more likely you are to validate the next block. This method uses less energy, making it more sustainable for long-term use.</p>



 Smart Contracts 



<p>Smart contracts are one of the coolest features of blockchain. These are like self-executing agreements that automatically carry out their terms when certain conditions are met. For example, a smart contract might automatically transfer money to someone when they complete a task, no human intervention needed. It’s a game-changer for automating agreements without the need for a third party.</p>



 Tokens and Cryptocurrencies 



<p>Tokens are digital assets created on blockchain networks. They can be anything—currency (like Bitcoin), assets, or even ownership rights to things like art or land. Cryptocurrencies are a type of token used for transactions on the blockchain, but tokens can also be used for other purposes, like accessing a service or representing a real-world asset.</p>


 
 


 Benefits of the Blockchain Ecosystem 



<p>So, why does blockchain matter? Here’s the deal: blockchain has a ton of benefits that can change the way we interact with money, data, and even each other.</p>



 Transparency and Security 



<p>One of the biggest advantages of blockchain is its transparency. Since all transactions are recorded and verified across the network, everyone can see the transaction history. This builds trust, especially in industries like finance and healthcare, where data security is critical. Plus, the blockchain is immutable, meaning once something is recorded, it can’t be tampered with. Goodbye, fraud!</p>



 Lower Costs and Faster Transactions 



<p>Blockchain cuts out the middlemen—banks, lawyers, notaries—who usually take a cut of the transaction. Whether you’re transferring money or signing a contract, blockchain reduces fees and speeds up the process. Cross-border payments? They’re faster and cheaper because blockchain doesn’t rely on traditional banking systems.</p>



 Decentralization and Control 



<p>In the blockchain world, no single entity has control over the network. This decentralization ensures that no one can manipulate the system for their own benefit. This also means users have more control over their own data and transactions. It’s a level of freedom that traditional systems just can’t match.</p>



 Increased Trust and Accountability 



<p>Since every transaction is verified and recorded in a public ledger, blockchain fosters trust and accountability. Everyone involved can see what’s going on, and no one can sneak in changes. Whether it’s for a supply chain, voting system, or contract, this kind of transparency is a huge win for accountability.</p>



 More Than Just Cryptocurrencies 



<p>Blockchain is not just for cryptocurrencies. It’s transforming other industries as well. For instance, supply chains are becoming more transparent, voting systems are becoming more secure, and even healthcare is using blockchain to store medical records more safely. The applications are endless, and they’re only just getting started.</p>


 
 


 Challenges of the Blockchain Ecosystem 



<p>While blockchain offers a ton of benefits, it’s not perfect. Here are a few challenges that need to be addressed:</p>



 
 Scalability: As more users join the network, the blockchain can become slow and expensive to use. Improving blockchain’s ability to handle a growing number of transactions is a key challenge. 



 Energy Consumption: Blockchain networks, especially those using Proof of Work, require a lot of energy to run. This environmental impact has been a point of criticism. 



 Regulation: Blockchain is still a relatively new technology, and regulations around it are constantly evolving. Governments need to figure out how to regulate blockchain-based industries without stifling innovation. 



 Privacy: Blockchain’s transparency can be a double-edged sword. While it’s great for accountability, some users might prefer more privacy. Solutions like zero-knowledge proofs are helping, but privacy on public blockchains is still a concern. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Blockchain isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a revolutionary technology that’s changing the way we think about data, transactions, and trust. The blockchain ecosystem is made up of interconnected components that work together to provide security, efficiency, and transparency. From cryptocurrencies to supply chains and healthcare, blockchain is already transforming industries and will continue to do so in the coming years.</p>



<p>Yes, blockchain has its challenges, but the potential it holds is undeniable. As the technology matures, we’ll likely see even more groundbreaking uses for blockchain. It’s time to pay attention—because the blockchain ecosystem is just getting started.</p>

 What is Blockchain? 



<p>Blockchain, often referred to as a distributed ledger or chain of blocks, is a system of storing data where information is saved in blocks and linked together in a continuous chain. Each block holds a set of transactions or data, and it is securely encrypted using complex cryptographic algorithms.</p>



<p>What makes blockchain particularly unique is its decentralization. Instead of being stored on a central server, data is distributed and stored across multiple “nodes” in the network. This decentralized approach enhances security and reduces the risk of data breaches or loss.</p>



<p>Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered or modified without the consensus of the entire network. This is one of the key factors that makes blockchain a secure and transparent technology.</p>



  Interesting Fact 



<p>Blockchain was first introduced in 2008 by an anonymous figure (or group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who used it to power Bitcoin—the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency. This concept has since evolved and is now being applied across a range of industries beyond cryptocurrency.</p>


 
 


 How Does Blockchain Work? 



<p>Blockchain operates on a distributed network, where transactions are validated through consensus mechanisms between nodes. Each time a new block is created, it is added to the chain, and all nodes in the network simultaneously verify and update the information.</p>



<p>The two most common consensus mechanisms in blockchain are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). In PoW, nodes compete to solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and earn rewards. In PoS, nodes are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold.</p>



<p>Blockchain transactions are protected by cryptography, ensuring that data cannot be altered or forged. Once information is recorded on the blockchain, changing it is nearly impossible.</p>


 
 


 Real-World Applications of Blockchain 



<p>Many people associate blockchain only with cryptocurrencies, but in reality, this technology is being applied widely across various fields due to its security, transparency, and immutability.</p>



 Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) 



<p>The first and most popular application of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum use blockchain to create a decentralized monetary system that does not rely on central banks. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, secure, and free from intermediary fees.</p>



<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an emerging sector that offers financial services such as lending, borrowing, saving, and trading without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks.</p>



 Healthcare Records Management 



<p>Blockchain can improve the storage and sharing of healthcare records, ensuring patient information is secure and cannot be altered. With blockchain, patients have control over their health data and can share it safely with healthcare providers.</p>



 Supply Chain Management and Traceability 



<p>Blockchain is revolutionizing supply chain management by providing transparency and traceability for products. Companies like Walmart and IBM have already implemented blockchain to track products from the supplier to the consumer, helping reduce counterfeits and build customer trust.</p>



 Smart Contracts 



<p>Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that automatically enforce the terms when conditions are met. Blockchain enables the creation of these contracts without the need for third parties, such as property ownership transfers or automatic payments to artists when their work is used.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/utilize-smart-contracts-for-effective-nft-transactions/">Utilize Smart Contracts for Effective NFT Transactions</a> </p>


 
 


 Voting and Ownership Verification 



<p>Another fascinating application of blockchain is in online voting. Blockchain can ensure that votes cannot be altered and that the election process becomes more transparent. Countries like Estonia and Switzerland have already experimented with blockchain in their elections.</p>



<p>Additionally, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are a notable application in the realm of digital art and ownership. NFTs allow for the authentication of ownership for digital assets like art, music, and in-game items.</p>



 The Future of Blockchain 



<p>Blockchain has already begun transforming multiple industries, and its potential is immense. Experts predict that in the future, blockchain will integrate with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a digital revolution, reshaping how we transact and improving various fields like security, education, and data management.</p>



 Integration with AI for a Digital Revolution 



<p>Experts believe that blockchain’s integration with AI will lead to a new era in technology. Gartner forecasts that by 2025, 50% of all business processes will be conducted on blockchain platforms, offering greater transparency and efficiency. Additionally, the combination of blockchain and AI will ensure data integrity, security, and trust, which are critical for future advancements in machine learning and automation.</p>



 Blockchain’s Impact on Multiple Industries 



<p>As blockchain technology continues to evolve, its applications will expand across various sectors:</p>



 
 Supply Chains: Blockchain is expected to streamline supply chains by improving traceability and transparency, which is forecasted to unlock over $3 trillion in value by 2030, according to PwC.<br> 



 Finance: Blockchain will continue to disrupt the finance industry, reducing costs and enhancing security in transactions and financial services.<br> 



 Healthcare: Accenture predicts blockchain’s potential to secure patient data and improve care by reducing administrative costs and enhancing data accessibility and sharing. 
 



 Blockchain as the Foundation for the Future Internet 



<p>Industry leaders like Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, envision blockchain as the foundational technology for future internet infrastructure. They predict that decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts will become the backbone of online activities, ensuring a more secure, private, and user-controlled internet.</p>



 A Secure and Transparent Future 



<p>Blockchain’s decentralized nature ensures enhanced security and transparency, which will become essential for various industries as digital transactions grow. Experts anticipate blockchain will continue to gain momentum as a critical technology for securing data, enhancing operational efficiency, and providing innovative business models across industries.</p>

 What is Website Traffic? 



 Understanding Website Traffic 



<p>Website traffic refers to the number of visitors who access your site. Every time a user clicks on a link and lands on your website, it counts as a traffic hit. Traffic is the deciding factor in a website’s success. Without traffic, your website can’t grow, generate sales, or build a strong brand presence.</p>



 Types of Traffic 



<p>Traffic can be divided into several types:</p>



 
 Organic Traffic: This is traffic that comes from search engine results (like Google). Organic traffic is free and sustainable, but it requires good SEO practices to maintain.<br> 



 Paid Traffic: Traffic generated through paid ads, such as Google Ads or Facebook Ads. Though it incurs costs, it provides immediate results.<br> 



 Referral Traffic: Traffic that comes from external websites through backlinks or promotions. These are useful in driving traffic without additional advertising costs.<br> 



 Direct Traffic: Visitors who directly type your website’s URL into the browser or access it from a bookmark. This shows that users are familiar with your brand or website.<br> 
 


 
 


 10 Ways to Optimize Your Website for Rapid and Sustainable Traffic Growth 



 Create High-Quality Content 



<p>Content is the core element to retain visitors. If you only post shallow or irrelevant articles, users will quickly bounce. Instead, focus on crafting content that helps readers solve problems or provides unique, valuable information. Good content will not only encourage users to return but also boost your website’s ranking on search engines.</p>



<p>Importantly, never copy content from other websites. Original and creative content builds trust with users and search engines.</p>



 Optimize On-Page SEO 



<p>On-page SEO involves optimizing elements within your website, such as titles, descriptions, heading tags, and content. Make sure that your target keywords are naturally integrated throughout your content, URL, and meta tags.</p>



<p>Every page should have a clear title and a compelling meta description. This helps users identify the content they need and improves your chances of ranking higher on search engines, driving more traffic to your site.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/easy-online-zip-file-extraction-a-step-by-step-guide/">Easy Online Zip File Extraction: A Step-by-Step Guide</a></p>


 
 


 Boost Off-Page SEO 



<p>Off-page SEO mainly revolves around building high-quality backlinks from other websites. Backlinks are like “votes” from other websites, signaling to search engines that your site is reputable and valuable.</p>



<p>Engage in forums, blogs, or communities in your industry to naturally create backlinks and increase traffic to your site.</p>



 Improve Page Load Speed 



<p>Page load speed significantly affects user experience. If your website is slow to load, users will get frustrated and leave. This not only results in lost traffic but can also lead to missed opportunities for potential customers.</p>



<p>To check the speed of your website, you can use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights. Optimize image sizes, reduce large files, and implement caching to improve loading times.</p>



 Ensure Your Website is Indexed 



<p>Make sure Google has indexed your website. If your website is not indexed, it won’t appear in search results, no matter how well you optimize it. You can check the index status through Google Search Console.</p>



<p>If your website isn’t indexed, you can request Google to index it by submitting a sitemap via Search Console.</p>


 
 


 Use Social Media to Promote Your Content 



<p>Social media is a powerful tool to drive traffic to your website. Share your content on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and others. Quality posts shared on social media will reach a broader audience, bringing more traffic back to your website.</p>



<p>Additionally, encourage users to share your posts. Organic shares can help your website gain more exposure and increase traffic.</p>



 Optimize Your Website for Mobile Devices 



<p>With the increasing use of smartphones, users primarily access websites via mobile devices. Therefore, optimizing your website for mobile is crucial. A website that isn’t mobile-friendly will cause users to leave immediately.</p>



<p>Ensure that your website’s design adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, providing a smooth experience on smartphones and tablets.</p>



 Build a Community Around Your Website 



<p>Building a loyal community is invaluable for any business. Once you create a community, they will return to your website regularly. Participate in industry-related groups, forums, or online communities and share your knowledge and expertise.</p>



<p>A community will not only help drive traffic but also establish trust and credibility with your audience.</p>



 Use Email Marketing and Offer Giveaways 



<p>Email marketing is an effective way to maintain customer engagement. Send regular emails announcing new blog posts, promotions, or updates, keeping customers coming back to your website.</p>



<p>Additionally, offering free giveaways like eBooks, coupons, or other incentives will leave a lasting impression on your audience, keeping them engaged and making them more likely to return.</p>



 Implement Video Marketing 



<p>Video marketing is a rising trend in attracting customers. You can create videos to introduce products, offer how-to guides, or share tips and tricks within your industry. These videos not only capture attention but also help with SEO on YouTube, the largest video platform in the world.</p>



<p>Moreover, video content can improve your search engine visibility, increasing your chances of being discovered by new visitors.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Optimizing your website for traffic growth is not an overnight task, but with the right strategies and consistent effort, you’ll see noticeable results. Start applying these methods today and monitor the positive changes in your website’s performance. Your website is a powerful tool for connecting with customers. Invest the time and effort to optimize it, and your business will grow sustainably!</p>

			<p>27 March, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading onchain operating system, proudly announces that it has successfully achieved SOC 2 Type II compliance, reinforcing its commitment to delivering enterprise-grade security and reliability. As the demand for tokenization accelerates, institutions require a trusted, fully audited infrastructure that meets the highest security standards, allowing them to adopt onchain finance seamlessly and with confidence.</p>
<p>Tokeny has undergone rigorous security audits to ensure that its tokenization solutions are built for scale and institutional adoption. The SOC 2 Type II certification validates that Tokeny has maintained and implemented robust security, availability, and confidentiality controls over time, demonstrating a long-term commitment to safeguarding client operations.</p>
<p>Conducted late last year, this independent audit reviewed Tokeny’s security policies across infrastructure, IT systems, data protection, HR, and customer success, ensuring that the platform aligns with the stringent compliance standards required by financial institutions.</p>
<p>This achievement builds upon Tokeny’s SOC 2 Type I certification and Hacken smart contract audit, both completed in 2023, reinforcing its continuous improvement in security and operational excellence. While SOC 2 Type I established that Tokeny had the right controls in place, SOC 2 Type II goes further by proving that these controls have been actively maintained and tested over time. It is a key requirement for institutions integrating onchain operational features into their financial legacy systems.</p>
<p>Tokeny is positioning its institutional clients to embrace onchain finance with confidence, providing an infrastructure that is secure, scalable, and ready for global adoption. As institutions move toward tokenized economy, Tokeny ensures they have a trusted system that eliminates friction and accelerates their onchain strategy, enabling them to launch with confidence, meet regulatory requirements, and focus on value creation rather than operational headaches.</p>
<p>For those interested in reviewing the audit report, it is available upon request.</p>

		 
	 
    Mass adoption of tokenized assets is approaching, and institutions need an onchain operating system that allows them to act fast without security concerns. This certification is a testament to Tokeny’s readiness to support them with a compliant and enterprise-grade infrastructure that they can trust from day one.  Tony MalghemCTO at Tokeny

  Thales Alenia Space signs contract with ESA to develop an agricultural digital twin component for sustainable, resilient agriculture
tas

Thu, 03/27/2025 - 10:17


             SaveCrops4EU leverages Earth observation and advanced processing techniques to create tools that support an economically and environmentally sustainable agriculture sector, in line with Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy and the European Green Deal. 
<p>Luxembourg, March 27, 2025 –Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to lead the SaveCrops4EU project. Part of ESA's Digital Twin Earth programme, this pre-operational digital twin component will enhance agriculture’s resilience to climate change and support agricultural resource management.&nbsp;</p>
 
    
 
<p>Destination Earth&nbsp;©&nbsp;ESA</p>
<p>The SaveCrops4EU digital twin component will be structured around three major scientific pillars:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Advanced monitoring using satellite data and agronomic indicators to enable real-time analysis of crop conditions.&nbsp; 
 Yield forecasting based on a hybrid modeling approach combining Earth observation data with crop growth models to estimate production volumes at regional level.&nbsp; 
 Scenario testing incorporating various abiotic stresses (such as drought and heat) and management strategies (including irrigation and fertilization) through a range of simulations.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Thales Alenia Space will lead the integration and overall architectural design of the Digital Twin Component, combining the various scientific models with the necessary Earth observation data and ensuring that the output data can be effectively used by end-users. A modular approach was chosen to support a wide range of use cases in which the Digital Twin Component could provide key information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to an innovative combination of Earth system modeling, diverse data sources, and cutting-edge technologies, Destination Earth and its digital twins for example allow a wide range of users to explore the effects of climate change on the various components of the Earth system and assess possible adaptation and mitigation strategies. Several structural institutional initiatives in this area exist in Europe like Destination Earth (DestinE) funded by the European Commission or ESA Digital Twin Earth (DTE), funded by a large number of ESA Member States. The ultimate goal of these initiatives is to create a digital model of the Earth to monitor the effects of natural and human activity on our planet, anticipate extreme events, optimize resource use while minimizing environmental impact, and adapt climate policies accordingly.</p>
<p>As an ESA programme, DTE is in full synergy with DestinE and ensures that the pre-operational digital twins developed could transition into a larger operational system like DestinE, thus maximising their impact.&nbsp;</p>
 Real-world use cases for validation 
<p>To ensure the relevance of technological developments, SaveCrops4EU will be tested through four key use cases in Belgium, Germany, Hungary, and Spain. These real-world validation cases will assess the accuracy of the models, their ability to anticipate weather- and climate-induced stress on agriculture, and their impact on local decisions by stakeholders in the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity in financial services has never been more critical. With rising cyberattacks, data breaches, fraud, and identity theft, regulators are tightening the screws on financial institutions that fail to protect their customers. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) cybersecurity regulation (23 NYCRR 500) has set a clear expectation: financial firms must implement strong&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication.html">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> into their cybersecurity programs and secure digital identities to safeguard customer data, transactions, and sensitive systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we move into 2025, compliance is no longer optional. Failure to meet MFA authentication standards and protect data privacy could lead to regulatory fines, reputational damage, and increased cybersecurity risks. However, compliance isn’t just about avoiding penalties—it’s about securing digital banking, fintech, embedded finance, and open banking ecosystems against current and future cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many financial institutions, the biggest challenge is finding the right balance between security, compliance, and customer experience. Traditional MFA solutions, such as SMS-based one-time passwords (OTPs), are now considered weak authentication methods, vulnerable to unauthorized access via phishing, SIM-swapping, and credential-stuffing attacks. That means organizations must move toward more secure and frictionless authentication approaches, including passkeys, FIDO2 authentication, WebAuthn, security keys, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/passwordless.html">passwordless authentication</a>, to enhance network security.</p>

<p>We’ve just released some cool new features in <a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo">MySudo</a> all-in-one privacy app.</p>



<p>Right now, the changes under version 2.5.0 are for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysudo-protect-your-identity/id1237892621">iOS</a> only, but we’ll roll them out to MySudo <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anonyome.mysudo">Android</a> soon.</p>



<p>So, what have we done? Well …</p>



 We’ve made navigation cleaner and more intuitive 



<p>You can now easily:</p>



 
 Add your virtual card details to your Sudo details 



 Reorder your Sudos how you want them 



 Quickly share your Sudo handle, email and phone number 



 Long press on a message, call or email to mark it as read or delete it 



 Switch between Sudos, customize your home page, and do a global search (more on that below) from a freshly redesigned top bar in the app 



 Navigate quickly using a clearer bottom bar in the app. 
 



 We’ve added quick access buttons 



<p>Now you can save time by simply hitting a quick access button to compose a message, make a call, and send an email. Look for the big purple button at the bottom of the screen when you’re in messages, calls, or emails.</p>



 We’ve introduced a global search function that makes finding things a breeze 



<p>You asked and we listened. With version 2.5.0, you can do a global search by Sudo or by communication type (messages, calls, emails, contacts), to find things in the app super-fast.</p>



 We squashed some bugs, too! 



<p>A great user experience is always our goal and in version 2.5.0 for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysudo-protect-your-identity/id1237892621">iOS</a> we also fixed a few bugs.</p>



 But that’s not all … better email is coming soon! 



<p>Hot on the heels of this release, we will launch out into the world some cool extras for MySudo email, including custom folders, schedule send, email signatures, and mark as spam function.</p>



 Update to version 2.5.0 now! 



<p>To lock-in these new features in MySudo, simply update to the latest version on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysudo-private-secure/id1237892621">iOS</a>—or sit tight for the same updates for&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anonyome.mysudo">Android</a>,&nbsp;coming soon!</p>

<p>The Verida Token (VDA) plays an essential role in powering Verida AI, a robust and flexible platform enabling developers to integrate powerful AI-driven functionalities into their applications.</p><p>The current API payment mechanism represents the first of many planned types of utility for the VDA token. Here’s how VDA currently delivers practical utility and value to users and developers:</p> Payment for API&nbsp;Usage Payment for API Usage (image created using an AI image creation&nbsp;program)<p>VDA is used to facilitate payments for API requests within the Verida AI ecosystem. API requests enable applications to access user data securely, with each request consuming a specific number of&nbsp;credits:</p>  Standard API Requests: Typically, one credit per&nbsp;request.  Intensive API Requests: Operations requiring more resources, like heavy searches or advanced language model processing, may consume multiple&nbsp;credits.  <p>Each credit is valued at $0.01 USD, making it straightforward for developers to calculate API usage&nbsp;costs.</p> Flexible Payment&nbsp;Models <p>Developers integrating Verida AI have two distinct methods to handle API request&nbsp;costs:</p>  User-Paid Requests: Users authorize and directly cover the cost of API requests.  Developer-Paid Requests: The application covers all API request costs, simplifying user experience.  <p>This dual approach allows developers to select a payment strategy best aligned with their business model and user engagement goals.</p> Converting VDA into&nbsp;Credits <p>To streamline payments, developers can purchase Verida Tokens from supported exchanges and conveniently convert these tokens into API credits through Verida’s Developer Console.</p> Dynamic Pricing&nbsp;Model <p>The amount of VDA used per API request is dynamically calculated at the moment of each transaction, ensuring transparency and fairness aligned with current market values. For instance:</p>  If the VDA price is $0.01 USD and an API call requires one credit ($0.01), one VDA is deducted.  If the VDA price rises to $0.10 USD, the same call (one credit, valued at $0.01) deducts only 0.1&nbsp;VDA.  <p>This dynamic pricing mechanism ensures users always pay a fair, market-driven rate.</p> Capturing Value and Revenue for Node Operators Verida Network Value Cycle (image created using an AI image creation&nbsp;program)<p>Payments made in VDA tokens are used to compensate confidential compute node operators who run Verida API code. These node operators receive VDA payments as revenue, incentivizing their ongoing participation and infrastructure provision.</p><p>To ensure a stable and secure network, node operators stake VDA tokens for the privilege of participating. This staking mechanism not only secures the network but also enables node operators to capture long-term value in the token, benefiting as the network&nbsp;grows.</p><p>As more applications are developed on Verida AI, the demand for accessing user data via Verida APIs will grow. Increased API usage means more users and developers purchasing VDA to utilize network services, which in turn attracts more node operators to stake VDA and provide infrastructure.</p><p>This creates a positive feedback loop where the token’s value and network utility mutually reinforce each other, driving sustainable growth and value capture for all participants.</p> Future Token&nbsp;Utility <p>While API payment is the current primary use case for VDA, the token’s utility is set to expand significantly in the future. Additional details on upcoming token utilities, broader integration, and enhanced value capture mechanisms can be explored in greater depth&nbsp;<a href="https://community.verida.network/verida-token-vda/verida-token-utility">here</a>.</p><p>Stay tuned for further updates and detailed insights into the evolving utility of the Verida&nbsp;Token.</p> Learn more the Verida&nbsp;token <p>You can learn more about the Verida token through the following pages:</p>  Verida Resource Pricing: <a href="https://docs.verida.ai/resources/pricing">https://docs.verida.ai/resources/pricing</a>  Verida Community Token Overview: <a href="https://community.verida.network/verida-token-vda/verida-token-usdvda">https://community.verida.network/verida-token-vda/verida-token-usdvda</a>   <p><a href="https://news.verida.network/dynamic-pricing-fair-payments-exploring-the-utility-of-vda-c800bdc3e397">Dynamic Pricing &amp; Fair Payments: Exploring the Utility of VDA</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.network">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>Indicio is pleased to announce that Hovi has joined the Indicio Partner program, an ecosystem supporting innovation and growth in the decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials sector.</p>
<p>By combining&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio’s decentralized network</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://hovi.id/">Hovi</a>’s platform, the partnership aims to enhance the adoption, security, efficiency, and scalability of digital credential issuance and verification.</p>
 Why a Decentralized Network 
<p>The Indicio Network makes decentralized identity&nbsp;practical, scalable, and impactful&nbsp;for businesses worldwide. It provides a robust, production-grade network built on enterprise-level infrastructure, ensuring high availability, security, interoperability, and compliance for Hovi customers. It is operated by nearly two-dozen organizations around the world on six continents and serves as the backbone for issuing, verifying, and managing digital credentials across industries..</p>
<p>The advantages to using a decentralized network for Verifiable Credentials are:</p>
 
 Removes the need for personal data to be stored in siloed databases.&nbsp;Verifiable Credentials are a simple yet powerful way to mitigate identity fraud and data breaches that allow people and organizations to hold their data and have it verified without checking in with the source or a third party. 
 &nbsp;Provides an immediate way to verify data.&nbsp;A distributed ledger facilitates the cryptography that enables data to be instantly and easily verified by anyone, anywhere at any time. No personal data needs to be written to the ledger, just metadata about the credential. 
 Infrastructural resilience.&nbsp;Multiple nodes run by different companies across multiple countries protect the network against outages. 
 
<p>This partnership underscores the potential of decentralized identity solutions to simplify digital interactions while protecting sensitive data. Verifiable credential technology enables the issuance of tamper-proof, reusable credentials that allow selective disclosure of information, ensuring user privacy and security</p>
<p>Omer Shafiq, Founder and CEO of Hovi, reflected on the collaboration:</p>
<p>“At Hovi, our vision is to simplify self-sovereign identity and Verifiable Credentials for businesses, ensuring they create real-world value and impact. Our collaboration with Indicio strengthens this mission, enabling secure, interoperable, and scalable identity solutions. Together, we are making digital trust more accessible, empowering organizations to harness the full potential of Verifiable Credentials with ease and confidence.”</p>
<p>James Schulte, Co-founder and VP of Business Development at Indicio, said</p>
<p>“As an Indicio Partner, Hovi is joining a network built for real-world adoption—one of the world’s only publicly available Hyperledger Indy networks. Using the Indicio MainNet adds a layer of cryptographic trust and a source of truth for your solutions. Indicio is proud to lead the way in providing trusted, enterprise-grade decentralized identity infrastructure, and we’re excited to support Hovi as they drive innovation in this space.”</p>

 IDnow Trust Services AB has become the first QTSP to implement SMS-free remote signing. Discover why that’s important and why IDnow is perfectly placed to deliver the most secure and agile digital signature solution in the market. 



<p>Is it any wonder the digital signature market was <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/digital-signature-market-100356">valued at $7.61 billion</a> in 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital signatures offer a raft of business and customer benefits, across multiple industries. For example, in financial services, they’re used to facilitate compliant and legally binding cross-border digital transactions, while in telecommunications, digital signatures are used to agree terms and conditions and conclude contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often completed in a matter of minutes, without needing to visit stores or schedule appointments, digital signatures couldn’t be simpler to use, or more effective or convenient, could they?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, yes, they could, at least according to IDnow. To test our hypothesis, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/new-etsi-standard-allows-for-remote-signing-with-identification-only">Senior Architect, Sebastian Elfors and other members of the team have been working hard behind the scenes to propose an update</a> to the ‘Electronic Signatures and Trust Infrastructures (ESI); Policy and security requirements for trust service providers’ standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/11943101/01.03.01_60/ts_11943101v010301p.pdf">(</a>ETSI TS 119 431) by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the past, digital signature services would follow ETSI standards to ensure security and compliance. As these standards were typically designed for longevity, qualified certificates would be valid for 2-3 years. While these long-term qualified certificates were ideal for those who regularly need to sign contracts, such as CEOs, it wasn’t for individuals who only need to sign single agreements or contracts as the user had to be authenticated for every signature,” said Sebastian.</p>



 Problems with the way signatures were processed. 



<p>To align with the aforementioned ETSI standards, a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-trust-services-ab-certified-qtsp-eu/">Qualified Trust Service Provider</a> (QTSP) is required to do the following two steps to issue a valid and legally binding signature:&nbsp;</p>



  Identify the user before issuing a certificate&nbsp;  



  Authenticate the user to create the signature.&nbsp;  



<p>As mentioned, requiring a second authentication step for one-time certificates, such as signing a single agreement with a bank or telecom provider, is unnecessary, especially considering identification and signing invariably happens in the same session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One Time Passwords (OTPs) sent via SMS are a common method of conducting that second authentication step. However, although convenient, OTPs via SMS are also susceptible to fraud as they can be intercepted and spoofed.</p>



 3 most common SMS scams. 



<p>Smishing (SMS phishing): As the name suggests, smishing is a phishing attack conducted via SMS. Here, fraudsters will send fake messages pretending to be from banks or delivery companies and requesting recipients enter log-in details, which would then be used to gain access to victims’ accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SMS swap fraud: Here, attackers trick telecom providers to transfer a victim’s telephone number to a new SIM card that they already control. In doing so, they receive all OTPs sent to that number, thereby bypassing 2FA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MITM attacks: Man-in-the-middle attacks work when tech-savvy fraudsters infiltrate telecom systems and intercept messages, which they’re able to read, track locations and, of course, steal authentication codes!&nbsp;</p>



<p>SIM swap fraud, SMS spoofing, MITM and other SMS OTP attacks increased by 12% in 2023 compared to 2021, equating to a staggering <a href="https://cfca.org/telecommunications-fraud-increased-12-in-2023-equating-to-an-estimated-38-95-billion-lost-to-fraud/">$38.95 billion lost </a>globally in 2023.</p>



<p>Besides the risk of fraud, OTPs can also cause significant friction in the onboarding process and ultimately lead to user drop-offs. This tends to happen if OTPs aren’t delivered quickly enough. Of course, SMS OTP delivery delays or failures could also simply be a result of network issues.</p>



 Exploring the future of digital signatures. 



<p>Clearly, existing legacy digital signature processes for signing contracts or onboarding are cumbersome, involve unnecessary friction, cause delays, user drop-offs and can increase the risk of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing these inefficiencies and dangers, IDnow has proposed a time-saving and cost-effective cut to the process, which was officially accepted by ETSI and reflected in the December 2024 update to ETSI’s standard on remote signing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud of our contribution in pushing for the standard change at CEN and ETSI. This brings us one step closer to offering a truly optimized remote signing workflow for one-time qualified certificates,” said Johannes Leser,&nbsp;Chief Executive Officer of IDnow Trust Services AB.</p>



<blockquote><p>As IDnow Trust Services AB is the first QTSP to implement the SMS-free signing flow without OTP, our digital signature products like InstantSign are well placed to benefit from the upcoming digital signature revolution. This is great news for the industry as a whole and provides a significantly improved user experience for the end-user.</p> Johannes Leser,&nbsp;Chief Executive Officer of IDnow Trust Services AB.</blockquote>



 Top 5 benefits of digital signatures. 



<p>A more streamlined remote one-time signing experience eliminates lengthy, complicated signing processes, helping businesses maximize conversions with faster process times and an enhanced user experience. Plus, by removing OTPs, businesses reduce the likelihood of fraud and operational risk associated with SMS-based authentication. An SMS-free signing process also significantly reduces friction by allowing users to stay within the signing flow without needing to switch between apps or devices to retrieve OTPs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, IDnow’s unique role as founding partner of a QTSP (IDnow Trust Services AB) reduces dependency on third-party providers, eliminating unnecessary steps and increasing operational freedom. Here are the top five benefits that companies can expect from integrating an OTP-less digital signature solution.</p>



  Efficiency: Digital signatures eliminate the need for physical documents and paperwork, significantly speeding up processes that would otherwise require mailing, printing and manual processing; enabling documents to be signed and exchanged in an instant. The quality of the data is also increased when transmitting electronic documents, as receivers no longer need to scan documents, which is error prone.&nbsp;  



  Cost savings: Due to the reduced need for physical storage, postal services, and manual processing, digital signatures save on the costs associated with paper-based processes.&nbsp;  



  Certified, seamless integration: By offering both identity verification services and secure Trust Services, IDnow’s digital signature solutions boost confidence and trust with every certified, trusted transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Regulatory compliance: As qualified digital signatures carry legal equivalency with wet signatures, they ensure businesses remain compliant with complex regulations like AMLD 6 and eIDAS 2.0 when transacting digitally in the EU.&nbsp;  



  Scalability: Remove bottlenecks and ensure agreements and contracts are concluded in a timely manner, no matter the volume.&nbsp;

<p>On March 19, 2025, D-Wave published a white paper titled "Blockchain with proof of quantum work" that unveils one of the most significant developments in the blockchain industry since the creation of BitCoin. The article below presents a draft paper that outlines a theorectical portal between existing classic computing based blockchain networks and D-Wave's demonstrated quantum blockchain implementation. The article also demonstrates the notion that the human race is essentially time travelling toward the future at almost incomprehensible speed due to the technology fueling research, development, and discovery of greater ideas, theories, and technologies. Think Moore's Law gone hyper-parabolic but faster. Consider the amount of time it may have taken Satoshi Nakamoto to create BitCoin's white paper in 2009. 16 years later, the draft below was researched, articulated, and cited in approximately 5 minutes by Google's Gemini Deep Research AI model. Picture two groups of researchers and scientists. One group utilizes the legacy research method and the other group utilizes Gemini Deep Research or similar. How fast is each group traveling their roadmap fueled by the pace of their R&amp;D? Although actual speed in this sense is difficult to quantify - especailly in real time - the difference in velocity is clearly profound and worthy of a separate series of articles on the subject.</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force in the digital landscape, offering a secure and decentralized paradigm for managing and recording data 1. Its core tenets of cryptographic security, immutability, and distributed consensus have spurred its adoption across a multitude of sectors, promising enhanced transparency and trust. Concurrently, the field of quantum computing is advancing at an accelerating pace, holding the potential to revolutionize computational capabilities for specific classes of problems that are currently beyond the reach of even the most powerful supercomputers 3. This computational leap, however, introduces a significant challenge to the long-term security of existing cryptographic systems, including those that underpin blockchain technology, as they become vulnerable to the power of quantum algorithms like Shor's.</p>
<p>As quantum computers continue their trajectory of development, the necessity for secure and efficient communication and data exchange between the vast infrastructure of classical computing systems that currently dominates our digital world and the nascent quantum computing realm will become increasingly critical. This imperative necessitates the exploration of innovative architectures and protocols capable of bridging these fundamentally different computational paradigms in a manner that ensures security and facilitates seamless interaction. The convergence of these two powerful technologies presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for the future of secure and distributed computing.</p>
<p>This white paper proposes a novel blockchain architecture specifically engineered to address both the impending threat posed by quantum computers to the security of classical blockchains and the crucial need for interoperability between classical and quantum computing systems. At its core, this proposal centers on a blockchain that achieves inherent security against known quantum attacks through the integration of robust post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Furthermore, this blockchain will be designed to function as an Application Programming Interface (API), providing a standardized, secure, and efficient means for classical computing systems to interact with the quantum computing realm, with a particular emphasis on facilitating communication with D-Wave's innovative quantum blockchain, as detailed in their recent research publication. The subsequent sections will delve into a comprehensive analysis of this proposed architecture, examining D-Wave's quantum blockchain, the selection of appropriate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, the hurdles and potential solutions for achieving classical-quantum interoperability, the detailed design of the API, potential use cases and real-world applications, and finally, a discussion of the inherent challenges, limitations, and promising future research directions for such a system.</p>
<p>2. D-Wave's Quantum Blockchain Architecture</p>
<p>The research paper "Blockchain with Proof of Quantum Work" by D-Wave introduces a groundbreaking approach to blockchain consensus through the implementation of a novel mechanism termed Proof of Quantum Work (PoQW) 1. Unlike traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems, which rely on classical computers performing computationally intensive cryptographic hashing operations, PoQW mandates the utilization of quantum computers for the mining process, thereby leveraging their unique computational capabilities 5.</p>
<p>Specifically, D-Wave's prototype blockchain employs their specialized quantum annealing processors to generate and validate blockchain hashes 1. Quantum annealing represents a distinct form of quantum computation particularly adept at solving complex optimization problems. The PoQW mechanism necessitates that quantum computers solve intricate problems rooted in the principles of quantum spin glass physics, a computational task that is currently considered intractable for classical computers with comparable resources 1. This inherent difficulty for classical systems effectively restricts the mining process to quantum computers with the requisite capabilities.</p>
<p>To validate the feasibility of their proposed architecture, the researchers implemented a prototype blockchain that was successfully deployed across four geographically distributed D-Wave Advantage quantum processors situated in North America 1. This experimental setup demonstrated the stable operation of a blockchain powered entirely by quantum computation, sustaining functionality across hundreds of thousands of quantum hashing operations, thus highlighting the potential for a scalable and energy-efficient quantum blockchain infrastructure 1.</p>
<p>The probabilistic nature inherent in quantum computation necessitates a refined blockchain framework to ensure reliable operation. D-Wave's system incorporates mechanisms designed to account for sampling errors and hardware noise, thereby ensuring stability and consensus despite the inherent uncertainties associated with quantum computation 1. This includes an innovative approach to handling forks in the blockchain: instead of outright rejecting potentially invalid blocks, the system assigns them negative work. This mechanism allows the blockchain to recover and maintain a single, consistent chain without experiencing disruptive network splits or forks, a departure from traditional blockchain fork resolution strategies 5.</p>
<p>A significant outcome of D-Wave's research is the projection of a substantial reduction in energy consumption, estimated to be up to 1,000 times less than that of traditional Proof of Work blockchains like Bitcoin 1. This dramatic decrease in energy requirements directly addresses a major environmental concern that has been associated with the widespread adoption of energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining. The cost bottleneck in this architecture shifts from the consumption of electricity to the availability and cost of accessing quantum computing resources 5.</p>
<p>The researchers strategically designed their quantum blockchain with the aim of integrating quantum operations into the existing standard blockchain framework while introducing minimal changes to the fundamental architecture of established systems like Bitcoin 5. This design choice suggests a potential pathway for a more seamless integration of quantum computation into the existing blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>While D-Wave's approach to PoQW relies on quantum annealing, other research endeavors are exploring alternative quantum computing paradigms for achieving similar objectives. For instance, researchers at BTQ have proposed a Quantum Proof-of-Work (QPoW) algorithm that utilizes boson sampling, a distinct type of near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, to authorize blockchain transactions 11. BTQ's QPoW seeks to replace the energy-intensive inverse hashing of classical PoW with a quantum problem based on boson sampling, with the goal of achieving significantly lower energy consumption compared to analogous classical simulations 11. Boson sampling, which involves sampling the output photon configurations of a linear optics interferometer, represents a different computational strategy compared to D-Wave's optimization-centric annealing approach.</p>
<p>3. The Quantum Threat to Classical Blockchains</p>
<p>The security of the vast majority of currently operational blockchain networks is fundamentally predicated on the robustness of public-key cryptography, with algorithms such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) being the most widely adopted 12. These cryptographic algorithms derive their security from the computational difficulty associated with solving specific mathematical problems, such as the factorization of large numbers (in the case of RSA) and the discrete logarithm problem (in the case of ECC).</p>
<p>However, the theoretical framework and the ongoing advancements in the development of sufficiently powerful quantum computers pose a significant and growing threat to the security of these prevalent cryptographic algorithms. In a seminal work in 1994, Peter Shor introduced a quantum algorithm capable of efficiently solving these underlying mathematical problems in polynomial time 12. This capability stands in stark contrast to the exponential time complexity required for classical computers to solve these problems, rendering them practically intractable for sufficiently large key sizes.</p>
<p>Should a quantum computer capable of executing Shor's algorithm with a sufficient number of stable and coherent qubits become a practical reality, it could potentially break the cryptographic protections that safeguard existing blockchains. This would compromise the confidentiality of encrypted data stored on the blockchain and undermine the integrity of the digital signatures used to authorize and verify transactions, potentially leading to severe repercussions for the security and trustworthiness of these decentralized systems.</p>
<p>In addition to the threat posed by Shor's algorithm to public-key cryptography, blockchains also extensively employ cryptographic hash functions for various critical functions, including the generation of block hashes that chain blocks together and the security of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism in many prominent blockchains like Bitcoin 13. Grover's algorithm, another significant quantum algorithm, offers a quadratic speedup for searching unstructured data 13. While this does not directly break the fundamental collision resistance of cryptographic hash functions in the same way that Shor's algorithm compromises public-key cryptography, it does effectively reduce the security level provided by a hash function against brute-force attacks. For instance, a hash function with an output size of n bits would, when faced with a quantum adversary utilizing Grover's algorithm, effectively provide a security level closer to n/2 bits. This reduction in the security margin could have implications for the Proof-of-Work mechanism, potentially making it easier for a quantum attacker to find valid nonces that meet the difficulty target. It also slightly weakens the collision resistance of hash functions, although finding collisions would likely still require considerable computational resources.</p>
<p>The anticipated emergence of powerful quantum computers in the future also gives rise to a significant long-term security concern known as the "harvest now, decrypt later" attack scenario 18. Malicious actors could currently be engaged in the collection and storage of encrypted data from blockchain networks, with the expectation that they will be able to decrypt this data at some future point when they gain access to quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm 18. This threat is particularly pertinent for data stored on blockchains that is intended to have a long lifespan and contains sensitive or confidential information. Even if the encryption methods employed today are considered secure against classical computers, this security could be rendered ineffective by future quantum computers, potentially exposing vast amounts of historical blockchain data to decryption.</p>
<p>4. Post-Quantum Cryptography for Blockchain Security</p>
<p>Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), also known as quantum-proof, quantum-safe, or quantum-resistant cryptography, represents a critical field of research dedicated to developing cryptographic algorithms, primarily public-key algorithms, that are believed to be secure against cryptanalytic attacks from both classical computers and the anticipated quantum computers of the future 12. The primary objective of PQC research is to identify and standardize cryptographic primitives that can serve as robust replacements for currently used algorithms that are known to be vulnerable to quantum attacks, thereby ensuring the long-term security and integrity of digital systems in the post-quantum era.</p>
<p>Current research efforts in post-quantum cryptography are predominantly focused on six distinct algorithmic approaches: lattice-based cryptography, hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, multivariate cryptography, isogeny-based cryptography, and symmetric key quantum resistance 19. Each of these categories relies on different underlying mathematical problems that are conjectured to be computationally intractable for even the most powerful quantum computers, thus offering the potential for enduring security in the face of quantum advancements.</p>
<p>Recognizing the urgency of the quantum threat, the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a comprehensive and public standardization process in 2016 to solicit, evaluate, and ultimately standardize one or more quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms 21. This rigorous, multi-round effort has involved extensive analysis and scrutiny of submitted algorithms by the global cryptographic community, aiming to identify the most promising candidates for standardization.</p>
<p>As of August 2024, NIST finalized the first set of post-quantum cryptography standards, marking a significant milestone in the transition towards quantum-resistant security. For key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), which are fundamental for establishing shared secret keys, NIST selected CRYSTALS-Kyber, now officially standardized as ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism) under FIPS 203 12. Furthermore, in March 2025, NIST announced the selection of HQC (Homomorphic Quasi-Cyclic) as a fifth algorithm for post-quantum encryption, intended to serve as a backup to ML-KEM, providing redundancy and cryptographic agility 24.</p>
<p>In the realm of digital signature algorithms (DSAs), which are essential for verifying the authenticity and integrity of digital messages, NIST standardized CRYSTALS-Dilithium, now ML-DSA (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm) under FIPS 204, and SPHINCS+ (Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm) under FIPS 205 12. Additionally, the FALCON algorithm (soon to be standardized as FN-DSA under FIPS 206) is in the final stages of the standardization process, further expanding the options for quantum-resistant digital signatures.</p>
<p>Given their standardization by NIST and their generally favorable performance characteristics, lattice-based cryptographic algorithms, particularly ML-KEM for secure key exchange within the API and ML-DSA for providing post-quantum secure digital signatures for transactions on the blockchain, appear to be highly suitable candidates for the proposed post-quantum secure blockchain API 19. Hash-based cryptography, exemplified by SPHINCS+, offers a valuable alternative for digital signatures, especially where statelessness is paramount, albeit with potential trade-offs in signature size and performance 17. Code-based cryptography, with the recent standardization of HQC for key encapsulation, also presents a robust option for ensuring cryptographic agility within the proposed system 15. Multivariate and isogeny-based cryptography, while promising areas of research, may require further maturation before widespread adoption in systems like the proposed blockchain API 14.</p>
<p>5. Bridging the Divide: Interoperability Challenges and Solutions</p>
<p>Classical computers store and manipulate information using bits, which exist in a binary state of either 0 or 1 3. In contrast, quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to store and process information using quantum bits or qubits 3. Qubits possess the unique ability to exist in a superposition of states, meaning they can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, and can also become entangled, a phenomenon where the quantum state of one qubit is linked to another, regardless of the distance separating them.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference in information representation leads to vastly different processing capabilities. Classical computers typically execute instructions sequentially 43. Quantum computers, by exploiting superposition and entanglement, have the potential for massive parallel computation, enabling them to tackle certain types of problems with significantly greater speed and efficiency than classical counterparts 3.</p>
<p>Furthermore, qubits are exceptionally sensitive to environmental disturbances such as temperature variations and electromagnetic interference, which can lead to the loss of their quantum properties in a process known as decoherence 42. Maintaining the delicate quantum state of qubits for sufficiently long computation times remains a substantial technological challenge. Classical computers, on the other hand, are significantly more robust and operate reliably under normal environmental conditions.</p>
<p>D-Wave's quantum computers are based on the principle of quantum annealing, a specialized form of quantum computation particularly well-suited for finding the minimum energy state of a system, which often corresponds to the solution of complex optimization problems 46. This approach differs from the universal gate-model quantum computing paradigm pursued by many other entities, which aims to build general-purpose quantum computers capable of executing a wide array of quantum algorithms. The "Blockchain with Proof of Quantum Work" proposed by D-Wave leverages this quantum annealing capability specifically for generating and validating blockchain hashes 46. This specialization on optimization problems for the quantum component of the blockchain might present unique interoperability challenges when interacting with general-purpose classical systems that may expect more traditional blockchain interactions or require different types of quantum computations. The input and output formats for D-Wave's quantum annealers are specifically designed for optimization tasks.</p>
<p>To bridge this divide between classical and quantum computing, and specifically to enable effective interaction with D-Wave's quantum blockchain, the development of well-defined and standardized Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is paramount 45. These APIs should serve as an abstraction layer, effectively hiding the underlying complexities of the quantum hardware and presenting a consistent and familiar interface to classical developers. Adopting widely recognized API standards such as REST or GraphQL could significantly facilitate easier integration and adoption 49. A hybrid quantum-classical computing approach is also likely to be essential, where classical systems handle tasks such as data preprocessing, formatting inputs for quantum computations, and post-processing the results obtained from D-Wave's platform 45. The API would then be responsible for securely managing the transfer of data and control flow between these classical and quantum components, effectively orchestrating the overall computational process. Furthermore, exploring the use of intermediate data representations or communication protocols that can effectively bridge the gap between the fundamentally different ways in which classical and quantum information is encoded and processed might be necessary for enabling more complex interactions between the two computing realms.</p>
<p>6. Designing the Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain API</p>
<p>The design of the post-quantum secure blockchain API should adhere to widely accepted architectural styles for web APIs, such as REST (Representational State Transfer), to ensure ease of understanding and integration for developers 49. RESTful APIs, with their emphasis on resources identified by URLs and the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), are generally well-established and widely adopted within the developer community.</p>
<p>Consistency in naming conventions for API endpoints, URL structures, and the format of data exchanged (e.g., utilizing JSON for request and response bodies) is crucial for creating a predictable and intuitive developer experience 53. This consistency will significantly lower the learning curve for developers seeking to interact with the API and integrate its functionalities into their classical systems.</p>
<p>The API should be designed with future extensibility in mind, allowing for the addition of new features and functionalities as both quantum computing and blockchain technologies evolve, without breaking compatibility with existing client applications 53. Implementing API versioning is also a recommended best practice to manage changes over time and ensure a smooth transition for users when new versions are introduced 49.</p>
<p>Robust error handling is an essential aspect of any well-designed API. The API should be capable of returning clear and informative error messages, along with appropriate HTTP status codes, to assist developers in diagnosing and resolving any issues that may arise during interaction 53.</p>
<p>For API endpoints that have the potential to return large collections of data, such as lists of blockchain transactions or blocks, implementing pagination mechanisms is a critical consideration to prevent overwhelming both the client application and the API server with excessive amounts of data 53. This will improve performance and responsiveness for client applications.</p>
<p>Given that this API is intended to interface with a post-quantum secure blockchain, it must provide a set of endpoints that enable classical systems to interact with the core functionalities of the blockchain. This would include endpoints for submitting new transactions to the blockchain, querying the blockchain for various types of data, such as details of specific blocks, individual transactions, and the current balances of accounts, and potentially interacting with smart contracts if the underlying blockchain architecture supports them 55.</p>
<p>Considering the specific requirement to facilitate communication with D-Wave's quantum blockchain, the API will need to include dedicated endpoints tailored to the unique functionalities offered by D-Wave's platform. For instance, an endpoint could be designed for submitting quantum work requests to D-Wave's quantum annealing processors. This endpoint would need to accept parameters in a structured format, such as JSON, that accurately describe the optimization problem to be solved, adhering precisely to the input specifications required by D-Wave's systems.</p>
<p>Security is of paramount importance for any API that interacts with blockchain technology, especially one that aims to be post-quantum secure. Implementing strong authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens), to reliably verify the identity of client applications accessing the API is crucial 55. Furthermore, all communication between client applications and the API server should be rigorously secured using end-to-end encryption protocols, such as TLS/SSL, to protect against eavesdropping and data breaches. Secure handling and storage of cryptographic keys associated with the users of the blockchain will also be a critical aspect of the API's design and implementation.</p>
<p>The API's design must also ensure that the fundamental properties of blockchain technology, such as data integrity and immutability, are strictly maintained throughout all interactions. Any operations that result in modifications to the blockchain's state should be carefully controlled through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and all such operations should be designed to be auditable through the API.</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect of this API is its integration of post-quantum security measures. All communication channels utilized by the API should be secured using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. For example, secure connections established using protocols like TLS could employ post-quantum key exchange mechanisms, such as ML-KEM (Kyber), to ensure protection against future quantum attacks on the key exchange process. Digital signatures used for authenticating transactions and other blockchain operations should be generated and verified using post-quantum secure digital signature algorithms, such as ML-DSA (Dilithium) or SPHINCS+. The API will need to incorporate the necessary cryptographic libraries and functionalities to seamlessly perform key generation, signing, and verification using these algorithms. The design should also anticipate and accommodate the potentially larger key and signature sizes associated with some post-quantum cryptographic algorithms by ensuring sufficient data storage and transmission capabilities within the API. Implementing cryptographic agility within the API architecture is also crucial for long-term security. The design should be modular, allowing for the relatively easy swapping or updating of underlying cryptographic algorithms if new vulnerabilities are discovered or more efficient algorithms become available in the future 18.</p>
<p>To specifically facilitate interaction with D-Wave's quantum blockchain, the API will need to expose particular endpoints tailored to the functionalities offered by D-Wave's platform. For submitting a quantum work request, an endpoint such as /api/quantum/dwave/submit could be defined. This endpoint would accept parameters in a structured format (e.g., JSON) that describe the optimization problem to be solved, adhering to D-Wave's input specifications. To enable classical systems to monitor the status of their submitted quantum computations, an endpoint like /api/quantum/dwave/status/{jobId} could be provided, where {jobId} represents a unique identifier assigned to the submitted quantum task. This endpoint would return the current status of the quantum computation. Finally, an endpoint such as /api/quantum/dwave/result/{jobId} would be used to retrieve the results of the quantum computation once it is completed. The data format for both submitting the problem and receiving the results would need to be carefully defined based on D-Wave's API specifications and the nature of the optimization problems being solved. Given the potentially asynchronous nature of quantum computations, the API might need to employ mechanisms such as webhooks or callbacks to notify classical systems when a quantum job is finished and the results are available for retrieval.</p>
<p>7. Potential Use Cases and Real-World Applications</p>
<p>The proposed post-quantum secure blockchain API has the potential to unlock a variety of novel use cases and real-world applications by securely bridging the gap between classical and quantum computing. One significant area is in secure inter-realm data transfer. In scenarios where quantum sensors or other quantum devices generate data, this API could provide a secure and auditable channel for transferring this sensitive data to classical computing systems for subsequent analysis, storage, or further processing. For instance, quantum random number generators, which can produce truly random numbers based on quantum phenomena, could securely feed these random seeds to classical cryptographic systems via this API for enhanced security in key generation or other cryptographic operations. Conversely, classical systems might need to send control signals or parameters to quantum devices. The API could ensure the integrity and confidentiality of this communication pathway. Furthermore, results obtained from quantum simulations performed on classical hardware could be securely stored and verified on the blockchain through the API, providing an immutable record of the computation.</p>
<p>Another promising area lies in hybrid quantum-classical applications. Many complex computational problems might benefit from a hybrid approach where classical algorithms handle certain parts of the computation, such as data preprocessing and the interpretation or post-processing of results, while the computationally intensive core tasks are offloaded to quantum computers. The proposed API could act as the central facilitator for such hybrid workflows, allowing classical applications to submit specific computational tasks, particularly optimization problems, to D-Wave's quantum blockchain and then securely retrieve the optimized results through the API. Potential applications for such hybrid approaches span a wide range of industries, including optimization problems in logistics (e.g., route optimization for delivery services, supply chain management), finance (e.g., portfolio optimization, risk analysis, fraud detection), materials science (e.g., drug discovery, design of new materials with specific properties), and artificial intelligence (e.g., training more efficient machine learning models).</p>
<p>The quantum-enhanced security for classical systems is another compelling use case. The post-quantum secure blockchain itself, accessible through the API, can be leveraged to enhance the security of purely classical systems that may not directly involve quantum computation. For example, the blockchain could serve as a highly secure and tamper-proof key management system for the cryptographic keys used by classical systems, providing a robust defense against potential future quantum attacks on these keys. Additionally, the blockchain could provide an immutable and auditable record of sensitive operations performed by classical systems, enhancing transparency, accountability, and trust. This could be particularly valuable in applications such as supply chain tracking for verifying the provenance and integrity of goods, digital identity management for secure and verifiable credentials, and secure voting systems for ensuring the integrity of electoral processes.</p>
<p>Finally, the API could play a crucial role in emerging applications in quantum computing research and development. It could provide a secure and transparent platform for researchers working on various aspects of quantum computing to share and verify experimental results. The inherent immutability of the blockchain would ensure the integrity and provenance of the data, fostering greater trust and collaboration within the quantum research community. Furthermore, the API could facilitate data exchange and collaboration between different quantum computing platforms and research institutions, potentially accelerating the pace of innovation and discovery in the field of quantum computing.</p>
<p>8. Challenges, Limitations, and Future Research Directions</p>
<p>The integration of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into the blockchain and the API may introduce performance considerations compared to classical cryptography. Some PQC algorithms exhibit larger key and signature sizes, which could impact storage requirements and network bandwidth. The computational complexity of these algorithms might also lead to increased processing times for cryptographic operations 17. Interacting with quantum computing resources, particularly cloud-based services like D-Wave's Leap, inherently involves latency that needs to be factored into the overall performance of applications utilizing this API. Scalability of a blockchain designed to handle interactions with both classical and quantum systems presents another potential challenge that requires careful architectural consideration.</p>
<p>While the selected post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are currently considered the most promising candidates for resisting quantum attacks, the field is still relatively young, and the long-term security of these algorithms against future cryptanalytic breakthroughs, both classical and quantum, cannot be guaranteed with absolute certainty 60. Continuous research and rigorous security analysis by the cryptographic community are essential. The interface between classical and quantum systems could also potentially introduce new and unforeseen security vulnerabilities that necessitate careful design and thorough security analysis to mitigate these emerging risks. Comprehensive testing and auditing of both the blockchain implementation and the API will be crucial to identify and address any potential security flaws before widespread deployment.</p>
<p>D-Wave's "Blockchain with Proof of Quantum Work" is currently a research prototype, and its scalability, real-world performance characteristics, and applicability to a broad range of use cases are still under active investigation 1. Access to quantum computing resources, including D-Wave's systems, is currently limited and can be associated with significant costs, which might initially restrict the widespread adoption and comprehensive testing of a blockchain API that relies on such resources. Both quantum computing and quantum-resistant blockchain technologies are rapidly evolving fields, and the proposed system will need to be designed with adaptability in mind to accommodate future advancements and potential changes in these underlying technologies.</p>
<p>Future research directions in this area are plentiful. Further investigation is needed to explore and optimize the performance of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms specifically for blockchain applications, taking into account the unique requirements of distributed ledger technology. Research into novel consensus mechanisms that are both efficient and secure in a hybrid classical-quantum environment could yield significant advancements. Developing standardized protocols and interfaces for seamless and secure interoperability between classical and various types of quantum computing systems is crucial for the broader adoption and integration of quantum technologies. Finally, analyzing potential quantum-specific attacks that might target quantum blockchains, beyond the well-studied threat to classical cryptography, and designing appropriate countermeasures will be essential for ensuring the long-term security and resilience of these emerging systems.</p>
<p>9. Conclusion</p>
<p>This white paper proposes a novel blockchain architecture that integrates post-quantum cryptography to ensure security in the face of advancing quantum computing and functions as an API to bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing realms, with a specific focus on interoperability with D-Wave's quantum blockchain. The potential benefits of such a system include enhanced security for blockchain transactions and data, the ability for classical systems to leverage the unique computational capabilities of quantum computers, and the facilitation of new hybrid quantum-classical applications across various fields. The proposed post-quantum secure blockchain API has the potential to play a crucial role in the integration of quantum computing into the broader technological landscape by providing a secure and standardized interface for interaction with classical systems. This could pave the way for new innovations and advancements at the intersection of blockchain and quantum computing, leading to more secure, efficient, and powerful decentralized applications. Further research, development, and collaboration are encouraged to address the challenges and limitations identified in this white paper and to fully realize the potential of post-quantum secure blockchain APIs in the evolving landscape of computing.</p>

									  CEX vs. DEX: Navigating the Future of Finance   <p>Crypto’s shaking up money — how we trade it, hold it, grow it. The place to start is bound to be an exchange, and before you do, there are two types you need to know.<br><br>Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are run by a team or organization. Whereas, with decentralized exchanges (DEXs), nobody’s in charge but you and a little blockchain magic.</p>  <p>Me? I’ve been in the trenches with both — tried cashing out quick, chased weird meme tokens, explored leverage trading, DCA’d (dollar cost average) — and it’s wild how different they feel. I’ll spend the rest of this primer breaking down my experience and perspective. But at the end of the day, it’s on you to digest all the relevant information, then pick your own path — stick with the old guard or ride the new wave.</p>   The Major Players   <p>CEX big dogs:</p>    <p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Binance</a>&nbsp;— huge coin list, fast, futures if you’re bold (OG’s of the industry).</p>  <p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Coinbase</a>&nbsp;— newbie-friendly, cash buys, simple (albeit buttoned-up as a freshly starched collar).</p>  <p><a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Kraken</a>&nbsp;— secure, solid range, feels fun and independent (like the team is rocking hoodies and jeans).</p>    <p>The DEX crew:</p>    <p><a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Uniswap</a>&nbsp;— Ethereum swap king, wallet-based (Meta Mask tends to be the go-to choice wallet for ETH).</p>  <p><a href="https://www.sushi.com/ethereum/swap?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">SushiSwap</a>&nbsp;— similar, staking perks (staking allows you to earn APY on select tokens).</p>  <p><a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">PancakeSwap</a>&nbsp;— Binance Smart Chain, low fees.</p>  <p><a href="https://jup.ag/?referrer=6YTUKkzRXSK9cYmTdNVwPPuM4snJXh3PpUWMHN3A2tCM&amp;feeBps=100&amp;utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Jupiter</a>&nbsp;on Solana — revolutionizing DEXs. Pulls liquidity from everywhere, nails best routes — limit orders, perpetuals. UI’s slick — cuts down wallet clunk, keeps you free. Phantom tends to be the go-to wallet for Jupiter users.</p>     Pros and Cons   <p>CEX&nbsp;</p>    <p>Pros:</p>  <p>Deep liquidity (lots of money available).</p>  <p>Traders galore, no delays.</p>  <p>Fast trades, easy interfaces, support if you’re stuck.</p>  <p>I can cash out quick on Coinbase during a spike (assuming the puppet-masters aren’t pulling any funny “under maintenance “ strings).</p>  <p>Fees? Pretty cheap 0.1% per trade, withdrawal cuts too — stings if you’re moving a lot.</p>  <p>Simple user experience — sign up, deposit, trade. Coinbase’s app is dummy-proof and clean.</p>  <p>Favored by institutional investors like Kevin “Mr. Wonderful” O’Leary.</p>    <p>Cons:</p>  <p>Not your keys, not your crypto — they hold it.</p>  <p>Hacked? You’re sunk — Mt. Gox vibes.</p>  <p>Some CEXs like Coinbase, Kraken or Binance have insurance or reserves to soften the blow in case of a hack. Still, no guarantee.</p>  <p>KYC (Know Your Customer) kills your privacy.</p>  <p>Limited token options. CEXs gatekeep — vetted coins only. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and others tend to list safe bets, while new stuff lags.</p>  <p>Favored by Mr. Wonderful (lol). He lauded FTX in 2022 for its stability. Later that year, the exchange had bottomed out.</p>      <p>DEX&nbsp;</p>    <p>Pros:</p>  <p>Your keys, your crypto — full control.</p>  <p>No ID.</p>  <p>Early token grabs. Getting in at the ground level is where massive gains can be made months or years before some projects land on a CEX.</p>  <p>Fees can fluctuate depending on the blockchain — PancakeSwap’s cheap, but Ethereum gas? $50+ a pop when it’s jammed — brutal.</p>  <p>Backed by luminaries like Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum).</p>    <p>Cons:</p>  <p>Steep learning curve.&nbsp;Wallet hoops, gas fees — boot camp needed. Jupiter’s UI helps — smooth — but not CEX-easy.</p>  <p>Patchy liquidity — smaller tokens lag and are susceptible to rugpulls.</p>  <p>Steep curve — wallets, gas, contracts — oh my!</p>  <p>No customer service if you’re lost.</p>      <p>Let’s real quick dive in a little deeper on the security side of things, since that’s largely what the difference comes down to.</p>  <p>With CEXs, you don’t actually own your cryptographic key; the exchange does. Ergo, you don’t&nbsp;technically&nbsp;own your crypto. This can make them more attractive to hackers, as they are effectively&nbsp;central vaults stuffed with coins. But the silver lining is that they are then also responsible for recovering those funds. Binance lost $40 million in 2019; they covered it — not your keys, not your crypto.</p>  <p>DEXs? You’re in charge. Your wallet is self-custody, and it’s your job to lock your keys down. Lose your seed phrase? No support’s saving you — gone. Hackers hit DEXs too — scams like phishing, fake sites, rug pulls.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/poly-network-hack-nearly-all-of-600-million-in-crypto-returned.html?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Poly Network</a>&nbsp;got drained for $600 million in 2021, simply from users clicking bad links and handing over control.</p>  <p>In other words, CEX risks hacks, while DEX bets on you dodging a minefield of cons. Yes, your cryptocurrency remains a target for scammers, regardless of where you hold it. So let’s quickly outline some best practices for keeping it locked down.</p>   Best Practices     <p>Hardware wallets&nbsp;keep your keys (seed phrase) and funds offline. Generally trusted brands include Ledger, Keystone, Tangem, or Trezor.</p>  <p>Double-check URLs.&nbsp;Fake sites abound. Be sure to bookmark the real ones, and for the love of God, DO NOT CLICK random links!</p>  <p>Back up your seed phrase.&nbsp;Write it, stash it safe, store it multiple places — not your phone.</p>  <p>Watch approvals.&nbsp;Don’t greenlight sketchy contracts, revoke old ones.</p>  <p>Test small.&nbsp;Swap a few bucks first and verify it worked before swapping larger amounts.</p>     Who’s This For, Anyway?   <p>If you’re just starting, CEXs easy. Fiat (cash money) works, plenty of juice in the tank — Coinbase got me going.</p>  <p>DEXs though — I’m talking folks who’ve got a wallet ready, not scared to FAFO. Privacy freaks, token chasers — they’re all over Uniswap or Jupiter.</p>  <p>Me? I jump around — Coinbase when I need it fast, Jupiter when I’m sniffing out the next 100x quick flip play or just want to get in before it goes mainstream (like being 1 of 100 people in the small venue seeing the band that will be selling out 50,000 seat arenas next year).</p>  <p>It all depends what you’re into — chill or chase. What lane are you choosing?</p>

									          Bulletproof Pinata   <p>Building online requires fast, flexible file storage —&nbsp;and that goes triple for web3.</p>  <p>That’s where&nbsp;<a href="https://pinata.cloud/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Pinata</a>&nbsp;comes in. The go-to media infrastructure for web3, Pinata makes it effortless to store, manage, and serve content across blockchains. Whether minting NFTs, powering a metaverse, or creating the next viral web3 app, Pinata gives you the tools to do it without worrying about centralized gatekeepers.</p>  <p>For years, cloud storage has been ruled by web2 giants — expensive, restrictive, and entirely in their control. Pinata is flipping the script in the web3 world. By leveraging IPFS and blockchain technology, it delivers censorship-resistant, high-performance storage that puts users in charge. Big names like OpenSea, Yuga Labs, and DraftKings are already on board, with over 240,000 users tapping into its infrastructure.</p>  <p>The potential is massive. A truly decentralized, creator-first media network where your content stays online forever, under your control — not locked behind a corporate paywall. A storage system that’s cheaper, more resilient, and tailor-made for web3’s next evolution.&nbsp;</p>  <p>So can decentralized storage scale to meet the demand of millions? Can it compete with the convenience of traditional cloud providers? Will Pinata succeed in redefining file storage for the decentralized world?</p>  <p>The true answers to these questions aren’t clear yet. But one thing is for sure. If web3 is going to be unstoppable, it needs infrastructure that’s just as powerful. And as of now, Pinata is leading the charge.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>   &nbsp;

									           NFTs Lurking Bruh   <p>We’re returning to an old favorite column of mine, NFT reviews. I’ll try to hunt down cool art projects, and occasional profile picture (PFP) collections that should definitely be on your radar.</p>  <p>The blue-chip pickings are admittedly slim. The floor price for the inexplicably classic Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, from which a single NFT once sold for the equivalent of $3.4 million, is now hovering around $30,000. But that just inspires me to dig deeper for the hidden gems — which is how I stumbled onto @<a href="https://x.com/iamlaurael?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">iamlaurael</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Laura El is a digital illustrator and animator from the 2021-2022 NFT era who stuck around through the bull market creating, sharing, and developing her presence on chain, predominantly ETH and Solana. Her persistence propelled her to sell her work at Sotheby’s &amp; Cristie’s in 2023 and 2024, all while NFT’s have supposedly been dead and buried.</p>  <p>I found El on Solana’s&nbsp;<a href="https://exchange.art/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">Exchange.Art</a>, a marketplace that differentiates itself from the likes of Solsea (where our own&nbsp;<a href="https://solsea.io/c/61c75aa728156629e15bcd10?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">sn0bs</a>&nbsp;NFT collection is listed) and Magic Eden, another NFT marketplace primarily for PFP projects. Her project,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelurkers.com/nfts?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">The Lurkers</a>, is an animated digital storybook. While it is written and narrated much like a traditional fairytale, its vibe is certainly of the Brother’s Grimm variety, given the dark themes explored. Ultimately, it’s a story about the triumph of the light over the darkness, but one that necessarily walks through the darkness to unwind it — and happens to have done over $225,000 in volume since it launched to boot.</p>  <p>They are a series of digital stills, animations, and curated scene-scapes complete with an audio track. There are about 25 scenes that accompany the book, and there are print editions available as well.</p>  <p>Here’s my&nbsp;<a href="https://exchange.art/single/HNevVSMAFb7czYYrDqX4CjaLtCHYkYtrAw6yb4o8SNWV?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-cexy-back">favorite</a>.

				  “BYOB — Bring Your Own Biometrics” will help you avoid the existential risks of storing biometrics or managing generative AI deepfakes — while retaining your biometric authentication systems.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Biometric authentication has been rapidly and widely adopted as a powerful and simple solution to the seemingly intractable risk of identity fraud. At face value, it seems like the perfect solution to the friction of logins and passwords: your face is unique and you can’t forget it like you can a password. That’s why billions of dollars have been poured into biometric technology, especially for <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/techwire/biometric-payment-market-to-reach-usd-34-8-billion-by-2032-driven-by-growing-demand-for-enhanced-security-and-seamless-transactions-research-by-ss-insider/">seamless payments</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is not just that you can’t reset your face if its biometric equivalent is stolen, it’s that your biometrics are being stored in precisely the same way that has successfully allowed millions of logins and passwords to be stolen.</p>
<p>It’s like we’ve collectively decided that strapping a jet engine on a people carrier will make travel faster. Yeah, in theory. But do the risks really have to be spelled out?</p>
<p>And while you’re still processing that mental picture, let me introduce you to deepfake me. It wants you to pay “me” the money I loaned you.</p>
<p>The combination of centralized biometric storage and generative AI now haunt biometric authentication. Stolen biometrics are lifelong existential risks. The world is still reeling from the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">audacity</a> of a deepfake “chief financial officer” requesting and receiving a $25 million payment from an employee.</p>
<p>Twenty-three percent of financial organizations <a href="https://regulaforensics.com/news/deepfake-fraud-costs/">surveyed</a> by Regula “reported more than $1,000,000 in losses due to AI-generated fraud.” And, as Davey Winder <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/12/04/ai-bypasses-biometric-security-in-1385-million-financial-fraud-risk/">reported</a> in Forbes, “dedicated mobile app security protections such as anti-emulation, anti-virtual environments and anti-hooking mechanisms” cannot be depended on to provide protection.</p>
<p>It seems almost trivial to add that even if a system isn’t hacked or tricked, biometric technology isn’t perfect. False positives do happen with serious legal and financial consequences if someone is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/22/facial-recognition-wrongful-identification-assault/">misidentified</a>.</p>
 Avoid the risks without abandoning your biometric systems 
<p>There is an elegant way around all these problems that allows everyone to keep their biometric systems: Decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials. We call it “Bring Your Own Biometrics” — BYOB.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">Developed by Indicio for air travel and border crossing</a>, BYOB removes the need to store biometric data in order to verify a liveness check.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>1. During identity verification, a biometric template is created and issued as a Verifiable Credential. This means the biometric information is digitally signed in a way that makes it tamper proof.</p>
<p>2. This credential is issued to a person who stores it in a digital wallet on a mobile device, secured by multiple layers of authentication, including a PIN and biometric access.</p>
<p>3. The credential is unique and it can’t be shared or faked: it is bound to the person, and their device. It can be linked to other digital credentials and biographical data in a way that a person can link multiple proofs of identity.</p>
<p>4. When the person needs to verify their identity, they perform a liveness check and present their biometric credential at the same time.</p>
<p>5. The system compares the live biometric data to the signed biometric data in the credential. There’s no need to store the data for cross checking.</p>
<p>6. For virtual authentication, the person has to present their credential at the same time as they perform a liveness check, thereby adding a verification that generative AI can’t fake.</p>
<p>7. Because users hold and control their biometric data, BYOB also ensures compliance with strict data privacy laws, like those in the EU.</p>
<p>Looking at biometric authentication for its <a href="https://2c6729ef-3702-40c5-ae3e-f37b35f84086.usrfiles.com/ugd/2c6729_95a781662ad34727a66617d9c0669811.pdf">2024 Prism Project Report,</a> Acuity Market Intelligence called Indicio’s solution “masterful.” By enabling people to hold their own biometric data in a way that can be cross checked against themselves, the problem of centralized storage disappears and the problem of deepfakes is bypassed. A Verifiable Credential provides a simple, cost-effective way to prove you’re not fake.</p>
<p>It’s also technology that’s designed to be easily layered into existing systems. With Indicio Proven, you can use Verifiable Credentials to manage all kinds of authentication, from single sign-on to biometric border crossing, and deploy in hours or (depending on complexity) weeks.</p>

<p>Digital Credentials (also known as verifiable credentials) have been promoted as the next best thing for keeping individuals secure in their online as well as in-person transactions. But what about companies? What does a typical enterprise get from moving down the digital credential path? On the one hand, they get a leg up on fraud. On the other hand, they get an even more complex operating environment thanks to legacy infrastructure.</p>



<p>If it was easy, they’d already be doing it. So, let’s see if I can make the case for why, despite the challenges, enterprise services should absolutely adopt digital credentials.</p>



 What Are Digital Credentials? 



<p>Let’s back up for a moment and make sure we’re all clear on what digital credentials are in this context. If you have time, check out my previous post, “<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">Digital Credentials That Can Be Verified: A Lesson in Terminology.</a>” It’ll do a more thorough job of explaining what a digital credential is. But if you don’t want to read that post just to read this one, let’s go with the definition from the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/digital-credentials/">Digital Credential API</a>: “[a digital credential is] a cryptographically signed digital document containing one or more claims made by an issuer about one or more subjects.”</p>



<p>The important bit in there is the ‘cryptographically signed’ part. These credentials have been created such that they are so much better than, for example, a photo of your driver’s license! The content of the credential is tamper-proof thanks to complex math. As a bonus prize, tools exist such that you can share only the parts necessary rather than an all-or-nothing scenario.</p>



<p>The most common use case I’ve seen supporting the value of digital credentials is age verification. The idea being that someone can share this credential to establish they are of age for whatever action they are trying to accomplish WITHOUT sharing anything else like their home address, actual date of birth, or anything else on a driver’s license or passport.</p>



<p>Which is all well and good, but how does that help an enterprise? The use case of an employer having to verify the age of employees or contractors is in all likelihood pretty darn small. So what can these be used for?</p>



<p>I have a list.</p>



<p> Let’s Talk Digital Credentials at EIC 2025! I’ll be diving into this topic at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2025/speakers/1619">EIC 2025</a>, breaking down the real-world impact of digital credentials, where they fit in enterprise IAM, and what’s next. Can’t make it? Let’s chat. I help enterprises navigate identity standards and make informed decisions about emerging technologies. <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/advisory-services-strategic-guidance-for-digital-identity-challenges/">Reach out</a> to discuss how digital credentials fit into your strategy!</p>



 Digital Credentials in the Enterprise 



 Employment 



<p>Enterprises with large workforces onboard employees and contractors at scale, verifying work eligibility, tax IDs, and personal details. Today, this process relies on document uploads and database checks. And yet somehow, ghost employees, tax fraud, and forged work eligibility documents remain a real problem. Digital credentials offer a stronger approach: instead of uploading scanned IDs and filling out forms, new hires could present cryptographically secure credentials issued by tax authorities or immigration offices. This ensures instant verification of real identities and work authorization, reducing fraud while making onboarding faster and more secure.</p>



<p>In other words, payroll systems could require cryptographic proof of a valid tax ID rather than accepting a number typed into a form. Multinational companies could rely on a portable, verifiable credential to prove an individual’s&nbsp;work authorization instantly, reducing onboarding time.</p>



 Travel 



<p>The travel industry has all SORTS of opportunities when it comes to seeing the value of digital credentials. The identity verification checks that happen at airports and border crossings are the. most obvious. In the U.S., mobile driver’s licenses are starting to be accepted in some airports in place of a physical driver’s license. It’s a thing. But think about this use case:</p>



<p>Your company has 10,000 employees, and 1,500 (that’s about 15%; not unrealistic) of them travel for business. Today, travel approvals and reimbursements are handled through corporate systems (it used to be through spreadsheets. Can you imagine?). These systems, however, often require manual approvals, policy enforcement, and receipt tracking, thus introducing inefficiencies, delays, and security risks. A digital credential could embed an employee’s travel permissions, preferred vendors (complying with company policy, of course), and spending limits, allowing instant verification at the time of booking. No more unnecessary personal data sharing, out-of-policy purchases, or manual reimbursement processes, just seamless, policy-compliant travel.</p>



 Cybersecurity 



<p>But wait, there’s more! If you’re reading this, you’re almost certainly IAM curious if not a loud and proud IAM practitioner. That means you are quite aware that managing employee and contractor access can be a nightmare. Passwords remain a top attack vector, yet companies still rely on them for everything from logging into cloud services to accessing secure areas. MFA and passkeys help mitigate some of the risks, but there’s still so much room for improvement. And let’s not even talk about onboarding contractors; how many “temporary” accounts are still active long after the project ends? Don’t be ashamed. The first step is admitting your IAM environment needs help.</p>



<p>Digital credentials can fix this. Instead of passwords, employees present a verifiable credential to log into corporate systems. Or, oh, how about this? Rather than using keycards, employees tap their phones (after using their biometrics to unlock them) to securely access office buildings and data centers. Or, how about instead of onboarding contractors manually in every system, companies issue temporary, revocable credentials that automatically expire when no longer needed.</p>



<p>Digital credentials have so much potential to reduce security risks, cut IT overhead, and make access management less painful.</p>



 Why Enterprise Adoption is Challenging 



<p>It’s easy to talk about the benefits of digital credentials. I can do it All. Day. Long. Who wouldn’t want faster onboarding, more secure authentication, and seamless travel approvals? But let’s be realistic. If it were easy, enterprises would already be using them.</p>



<p>For many organizations, the biggest barrier isn’t the concept, it’s the complexity. The cost of implementing digital credentials doesn’t stop at issuing them; it ripples through IT systems, HR processes, and compliance workflows. It requires not just action on the part of the enterprise; vendors and business partners need to hop on the digital credential bus as well. And if an enterprise miscalculates these costs, even the most promising solution can turn into an expensive experiment that never scales. (We’ve never seen THAT happen, right? Right?)</p>



 The Cost of Complexity 



<p>Enterprises don’t make changes lightly, especially when it comes to identity and security infrastructure. Every new tool, system, or process comes with an associated cost that needs to be justified against the value it brings. Digital credentials are no exception.</p>



 
 Infrastructure Upgrades – Most enterprises already have an identity provider (IdP) like Okta, Microsoft Entra, or Ping Identity handling authentication. To implement digital credentials, they need to integrate digital into these existing systems, which isn’t a simple plug-and-play process. 



 Training &amp; Adoption – Employees, HR teams, and IT staff need to learn how to issue, store, and use digital credentials. If they don’t understand the process (or worse, find it confusing), adoption stalls. We’ve seen this play out with MFA adoption. This is a classic organizational change problem. 



 Ongoing Maintenance &amp; Compliance – Identity systems aren’t static. Every time a new compliance requirement comes along (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>, or industry-specific rules like <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/soc-2-compliance/">SOC 2</a>), enterprises need to ensure their digital credential infrastructure remains compliant. 



 Hidden Costs &amp; Dependencies – Even if an enterprise sees the long-term value, interoperability is a wildcard. Digital credentials need to work across different systems, vendors, and platforms. What if a company’s travel booking system, payroll provider, or cloud security tools don’t support these types of credentials yet? That means either custom integrations (which are expensive) or waiting for vendors to catch up (which takes time). 
 



<p>And for small or mid-sized businesses? These costs can be prohibitive. While large enterprises might have the resources to experiment, a mid-sized company operating on tight margins might look at the complexity and walk away.</p>



 ROI for Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers 



<p>For digital credentials to be worth the effort, they need to provide a clear return on investment (ROI). That ROI, however, looks different depending on who you are in the system.</p>



 Issuers: HR &amp; Compliance Teams 



<p>These are the departments that would ultimately create and distribute digital credentials: HR departments for employment verification, IT teams for access control, and finance teams for expense management. Their main incentive? Reducing fraud, cutting paperwork, and improving efficiency.</p>



 
 Faster, More Secure Onboarding – HR can instantly verify work eligibility without manually processing scanned documents. 



 Automated Policy Enforcement – Travel and expense approvals can happen at the time of booking instead of requiring post-trip reimbursements. 



 Stronger Access Controls – IT can issue temporary credentials to vendors and contractors that expire automatically. 
 



<p>The challenge? Issuers need buy-in from leadership, budget approvals, and integration with existing tools. If leadership doesn’t see an immediate, measurable impact, adoption stalls.</p>



 Holders: Employees &amp; Contractors 



<p>Employees and contractors are the users of digital credentials, the ones who present them to gain access, prove their identity, or complete transactions. Their main incentive is convenience, security, and control over their data.</p>



 
 Less Password Pain – No need to remember (or reset) yet another password for corporate systems. 



 Easier Travel &amp; Expense Management – Travel credentials can automatically apply company policies at the time of booking. 



 More Privacy – Instead of handing over a driver’s license just to prove their age, an employee can share only the necessary details. 
 



<p>The challenge? Holders don’t adopt new tools just because they exist. They need a seamless user experience. If using digital credentials feels more cumbersome than their current process, they won’t bother.</p>



 Verifiers: Auditors, Vendors, &amp; Third Parties 



<p>Verifiers are the ones to consume digital credentials. They might be auditors checking employee work eligibility, hotels verifying corporate travel approval, or IT systems enforcing security policies. Their main incentives are saving time, reducing risk, and ensuring compliance.</p>



 
 Instant Verification – No more manually checking IDs, work authorizations, or tax forms. 



 Better Security – Digital credentials are tamper-proof and harder to forge than scanned documents. 



 Fewer Compliance Headaches – Verifiable credentials help prove due diligence in audits. 
 



<p>The challenge? The verifier ecosystem isn’t fully built out yet. A hotel might love the idea of instantly verifying business travel credentials but if their booking system doesn’t support digital credentials yet, they’re stuck handling things manually. This means enterprises have to push adoption across multiple industries to see the full benefits.</p>



 But What About Passkeys? 



<p>I’m going to take a brief side trip into passkey land because I think people are struggling to understand when, where, and how passkeys and digital credentials overlap. Maybe this needs its own post, but for now, let’s put it here. tl;dr: passkeys and digital credentials are complementary technologies, not competing ones.</p>



 Passkeys Are for Authentication 



<p>Passkeys, both synced and device-bound, are designed to replace passwords for logging into accounts. They provide proof that you have access to a credential (like a private key stored on your device), but they don’t prove anything about who you are, your role, or your permissions.</p>



 
 Passkeys: “This device is authorized to log into this account.” 



 Digital Credentials: “This person is an employee, has security clearance, and is authorized to make a purchase.” 
 



<p>Why this matters:</p>



 
 A passkey might let someone log into a corporate travel portal, but it doesn’t confirm whether they’re authorized to book business-class flights or make a company purchase. 



 A digital credential could store their travel policy, spending limit, and approval status, allowing vendors to instantly verify whether the booking complies with company rules. 
 



 Passkeys Are Not for Verification 



<p>Passkeys are great for logging into accounts, but they aren’t intended for cases where third parties need to verify information beyond the fact that a user controls an account. This happens at a later step, one where digital credentials can step in to play. </p>



<p>So, for example:</p>



 
 Digital Credentials Can Be Shared &amp; Verified By External Entities:
 
 A hotel, tax authority, or external auditor can check a verifiable credential to confirm eligibility without needing to be part of the enterprise’s internal authentication system. 



 Example: A contractor could present a verifiable credential that proves they are legally allowed to work in the U.S., without needing to log into an employer’s HR system. 
 
 



 Passkeys Don’t Work This Way:
 
 Passkeys are bound to a specific service (e.g., Google, Microsoft, or an enterprise IdP). 



 A hotel or vendor cannot use passkeys to verify your employment status, travel eligibility, or security clearance. 
 
 
 



 Passkeys are Personal 



<p>Passkeys are tied to a specific device or a cloud account that syncs across devices (like iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager). This makes them a great replacement for passwords, but they aren’t designed to support enterprise-issued credentials that need to be shared, verified by third parties, or tied to specific roles and policies.</p>



 
 Digital Credentials Are Portable:
 
 Employees can receive a verifiable credential from their employer that exists separately from personal authentication methods. 



 A contractor can use the same work credential across multiple clients without needing separate logins for each system. 



 A former employee can still use their travel history credential after leaving the company, even if their passkey-based access is revoked. 
 
 



 Passkeys Solve a Different Problem:
 
 When an employee leaves a company, their passkey-based authentication is revoked, as it should be. But that doesn’t help them prove past employment or retain enterprise-issued credentials. 



 If a company relies solely on passkeys, it lacks a way to issue verifiable credentials for compliance, travel, or work eligibility. 
 
 
 



 Passkeys Do Not Support Selective Disclosure 



<p>One of the major advantages of digital credentials is that they allow selective disclosure; you can share only the necessary information instead of handing over everything.</p>



 
 Example of Selective Disclosure with Digital Credentials:
 
 A hotel asks: “Are you authorized for corporate travel?” 



 The employee’s digital credential says: “Yes, per Company X’s travel policy.” 



 The hotel never sees the employee’s salary, department, or personal details. 
 
 



 Passkeys Can’t Do This:
 
 A passkey is binary; it either lets you log in or it doesn’t. And that’s perfect for that very necessary action. 



 It doesn’t let a third party verify specific attributes (e.g., work status, travel privileges) without exposing everything. 
 
 
 



<p>And with that, enough about passkeys; let’s see where we’ve ended up with digital credentials.</p>



 So, What’s the Verdict? 



<p>Digital credentials have enormous potential, but adoption is slow because the cost and complexity can outweigh the benefits, at least in the short term.</p>



 
 Large enterprises with high fraud risk, complex compliance needs, and high employee turnover are the most likely to benefit first. 



 Smaller businesses might find the costs too high and the ecosystem too immature to justify the investment. 



 Widespread adoption depends on interoperability. If banks, travel providers, government agencies, and enterprise vendors all get on board, the ROI increases dramatically. 
 



<p>Enterprises that start early will be ahead of the curve. But for now, the question remains: Who will be the first to make the leap? Ultimately, every organization needs to decide this for themselves. Depending on where you are in the world, that decision may get made for you depending on local regulations.</p>

 Understanding Face Liveness Detection and Its Role in Fraud Prevention 
<p>“Welcome to our comprehensive blog post in which we will describe, what is&nbsp; facial liveness detection and how it prevents fraud”</p>
<p>We are living in an era of 2025, where security has become more crucial than ever. With the astonishing rise of digital transactions, online authentications, and verifications, it is very important to ensure that the sensitive information of users is safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to protect such sensitive data such as using encryption, multi-factor authentication, and biometric systems. Among them, facial liveness detection has also emerged as an innovative solution to enhance security.</p>
<p>If you are hearing this term for security for the first time, this blog post is b specially for you. In this guide, we shall tell you what is this facial liveness detection and how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us explore this blog post further in detail…..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Face Liveness Detection? 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">Face liveness detection</a> is a cutting-edge security technology that is used to verify that a person’s facial features are real and live during authentication. This technology prevents agencies and companies from fraudulent activities like spoofing with fake images.</p>
<p>In short, we can say that this technology enhances security during digital transactions by ensuring that the users are physically present during authentication and biometrics. Once you understand this technology, now it’s time to know how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the upcoming sections carefully…….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Does Face Liveness Detection Technology Prevent Frauds? 
<p>You should understand this section carefully as it is the cornerstone of our blog. This is because, in this section, we will tell this technology’s working process by telling its types. It means that this section will cover two topics. Isn’t it great?</p>
 1. Active Liveness Facial Detection 
<p>Active <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition</a> liveness detection refers to a process of authentication in which users have to perform some specific actions. It is an advanced method that is used to distinguish between a real person and a fake one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you will be thinking, how does this active liveness detection work? Right? Don’t worry, we have answered you in detail in the below section.</p>
 How does this liveness detection work? 
<p>As discussed previously, in this method of authentication, users are said to perform specific actions. But do you know, which actions are these? If no, read the described bulleted lines.</p>
 
 Blinking: The system asks users to blink their eyes during scanning. Now you can easily understand that such a blinking can never be achieved using a fake image or video. 
 Head movement: Most users are said to move their heads slightly in multiple directions to identify that a real person is present. Such movements can be little bit achieved by fake videos but not images. 
 Facial expressions: People during verification have to show some facial expressions such as smiling to ensure that the system has captured the more nuanced data. 
 
<p></p>
 Which types of fraud this liveness detection prevents? 
<p>There are several types of fraud that this facial liveness detection prevents. Let us discuss them also in bulleted lines.</p>
 
 Spoofing with images: Fraudsters attempt to use high-quality images of a person’s face to manipulate the facial recognition system. However, such fraud is easily tackled by this facial detection process. 
 Spoofing with videos: Unlike fake images, they can try to trick the system with fake videos of any person. This trick also fails in front of this system. 
 3D mask fraud: Fake people may use 3D masks of a person’s face to gain unauthorized access. But, in front of this detection system, this trick has no value. 
 
<p></p>
 2. Passive Liveness Facial Detection 
<p>Passive liveness facial detection is another way of verification and preventing fraud. However, this method is a little bit different from active liveness detection. This is because, in this method, users don’t have to perform specific functions as they have to do in active ones.</p>
<p>Here definitely, you will ask, how does this detection work? Right? Don’t worry, unlike the previous section, we will describe this one also in detail.</p>
 How does passive-liveness facial detection work? 
<p>Passive face recognition liveness detection analyzes and leverages the unique features of the human face to identify whether the person is fake or real. Here is how it does;</p>
 
 Light reflection: This sub-method of light reflection is all about analyzing how light reflects with the face. A real face can reflect the light in more complex and dynamic ways. On the contrary, images and videos can never reflect light, making the system enable to identify and prevent fraud. 
 Texture analysis: The system analyzes the skin texture and surface patterns on the face. Human skins have a distinctive texture that artificial or fake surfaces don’t have. This method is most valuable for differentiating between real faces and 2D images. 
 Micro movements: Unlike active detection, passive detection can also analyze facial movements such as blinking and other micro movements but only on low-level. 
 
<p></p>
 Which types of fraud does passive detection prevent? 



Here is a point to be noted;&nbsp;<p></p>
<p>we don’t need to describe this in detail. This is because this type of detection prevents the same frauds that are prevented by active-liveness facial recognition. For example, frauds done by image spoofing, video spoofings, and one of the most important 3D mask frauds.</p>



 
 Applications Of Facial Liveness Face Detection 
<p>In this section, we will describe the main 4 institutes where facial liveness detection is implemented to prevent fraud. Read the below section carefully.</p>
 
  Banking and finance: Fraudsters mainly target banking systems by using fake images and videos. Here facial liveness detection prevents them, enhancing banking security. 
  Healthcare: This technology makes sure that the person using healthcare services is the actual patient, keeping private medical details safe from being stolen. 
  E-commerce: Online shopping platforms use this cutting-edge technology to identify whether the customers are real and present or using someone’s fake photos or videos. 
  Government services: Many governments use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system">facial recognition technology</a> to confirm identity for using different public services, from renewing passports to voting. 
 
<p></p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>Facial liveness detection is an effective method for stopping fraud by confirming that facial features are genuine and active during the identification process. It improves security by blocking tricks involving pictures, videos, or 3D masks in different fields like banking, healthcare, and online shopping.</p>
<p>Here, if you want to improve your security system, <a href="https://recognito.vision/">RECOGNITO</a> is the answer. As a leading developer of face recognition algorithms recognized by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a>, RECOGNITO focuses on face detection, liveness checks, and ID document verification.&nbsp;</p>

 Free Compute-to-Data with Ocean Nodes VS Code Extension <p>Today, we’re excited to announce the release of the Free Compute-to-Data (C2D) and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">Ocean Nodes VS Code Extension</a> — a tool that brings the power of decentralized compute-to-data directly into your development environment.</p><p>Access to quality datasets is often the biggest hurdle in today’s world of data science and AI. Previously, Ocean Protocol provided compute-to-data through <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">OceanMarket</a>; now, we’re taking this solution one step further by integrating it directly into <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Virtual Studio Code</a>, the IDE of choice for millions of developers worldwide.</p><p>What’s more, you can now use compute-to-data for free! Yes, that’s right — while you’re still writing and iterating on your algorithm, you can do unlimited test runs on an Ocean Node for&nbsp;free.</p><p>Why Free?</p><p>Our goal has always been to help developers and data scientists build stronger AI and data-driven solutions. We know that testing new tools and workflows comes with uncertainty, and upfront costs can be a barrier. That’s why compute-to-data (C2D) is free for development and testing, so you can explore its potential without any friction.</p><p>This isn’t just about free access. It’s also about building a better product together. We want real users to try C2D, push its limits, and give us feedback. To help us refine the experience, improve performance, and ensure it delivers real&nbsp;value.</p><p>Even more so, with free compute-to-data, and the Ocean Nodes VS Code extension, you can experiment, refine, and optimize your models with confidence, without the frustration of burning through resources just to troubleshoot errors.</p><p>Why We Built The VS Code Extension?</p><p>Until now, using Ocean Protocol’s compute-to-data features required jumping between different tools and interfaces. Developers had&nbsp;to:</p>  Write algorithms in their&nbsp;IDE  Use Ocean Market or the command line interface to execute compute&nbsp;jobs  Wait for results without real-time feedback  Download and open&nbsp;results  <p>This context-switching created friction that slowed down the development cycle. Our VS Code extension eliminates these pain points by bringing the entire workflow into your editor. As soon as you write the algorithm, you can run it with Ocean’s free compute-to-data — just hit the “run algorithm” button in the VS Code extension.</p><p>What You Can Do With&nbsp;It</p><p>The extension enables you&nbsp;to:</p>  Run free compute jobs with one click: Select your algorithm file (Python or JavaScript), optionally choose a dataset, and start a compute job — all without leaving VS&nbsp;Code.  Monitor Progress in Real-Time: Watch as your algorithm runs on remote data, with logs streaming directly into the output in your&nbsp;editor.  Results are downloaded and saved instantly when your compute job completes.  Customize your environment. You can use your own custom Docker images and tags to set up the environment that your algorithm needs.  <p>How It&nbsp;Works</p><p>Behind the scenes, the extension connects to Ocean Protocol’s nodes, which orchestrate secure compute-to-data jobs. Your algorithm runs in an isolated environment with access to the dataset, but the raw data never leaves its secure location. Only the results are returned to&nbsp;you.</p><p>This approach preserves data privacy while allowing valuable insights to be extracted — a win-win for both data providers and consumers.</p><p>Getting Started in&nbsp;Minutes</p>  Install the extension from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">VS Code Marketplace</a>  Open a Python or JavaScript algorithm file  Click the Ocean Protocol icon in the activity&nbsp;bar  Hit “Start Compute&nbsp;Job”  <p>That’s it! No complex setup, no account creation, just immediate access to Ocean Protocol’s compute&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you want to get further into the details, you can open the settings and optionally choose:</p>  The folder where you would like the results to be&nbsp;saved.  A specific node to the node the compute job&nbsp;on.  Your own docker&nbsp;image.  Your own private key, to keep the results&nbsp;secure.  <p>Real-World Applications</p><p>Imagine you’re developing a machine learning model to predict medical outcomes, but the healthcare data is too sensitive to be shared directly. With the Ocean Protocol VS Code Extension, you&nbsp;can:</p>  Write your algorithm locally in VS&nbsp;Code  Test it on sample&nbsp;data  Send it to run on the real dataset through compute-to-data  Get your model predictions back without ever seeing the raw patient&nbsp;data  <p>This same pattern works for financial analytics, consumer behaviour prediction, and countless other fields where data privacy is paramount.</p><p>Try It&nbsp;Today</p><p>The Ocean Nodes VS Code Extension is now available in the VS Code Marketplace. Whether you’re a data scientist, AI researcher, or a developer working with sensitive data, this tool will streamline your workflow while preserving data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">Download the extension</a> and start your first compute job&nbsp;today!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/free-compute-to-data-with-ocean-nodes-vscode-extension-1f8385cb077c">Free Compute-to-Data with Ocean Nodes VSCode Extension</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Citron Research is back with new stock reports for 2025. Their calls have always sparked debates. Some stocks soared, others collapsed. This year, they are eyeing undervalued stocks, market trends, and risky investments. Investors want to know: Should you follow their insights or stay cautious?&nbsp;</p>

 What is Citron Research? 



<p>Citron Research is not like traditional financial firms. They don’t just analyze stocks—they challenge the market’s beliefs. Their reports often expose overhyped companies while revealing hidden investment opportunities.</p>



<p>Andrew Left, Citron’s founder, has built a reputation for bold stock predictions. He famously shorted Tesla when it was still rising. He exposed fraud in Luckin Coffee before it collapsed. Some of his calls changed the way investors looked at entire industries.</p>



<p>But Citron has also made mistakes. They bet against Nvidia early and lost. They underestimated Shopify’s growth. Their stock market analysis is controversial, but one thing is certain—people listen to them.</p>

 2025 Stock Trends: What Citron Sees Coming 



<p>​In 2025, Citron Research has identified significant shifts across major industries, forecasting a transformative year for investors.​</p>



 AI Stocks: Navigating Hype and Reality 



<p>Citron cautions that while artificial intelligence (AI) remains a burgeoning field, certain companies may be overvalued due to speculative investments rather than solid financial performance. A notable example is Rigetti Computing, a quantum-computing firm that experienced a dramatic stock surge, only to face sharp declines after Citron labeled the rise as “ridiculous,” highlighting the risks of hype-driven valuations. ​</p>



<p>Conversely, Citron has spotlighted Nebius Group NV as an under-the-radar AI opportunity. Backed by industry giants like Nvidia, Nebius has been recognized for its potential to become a significant player in the AI infrastructure sector, with Citron suggesting a valuation that could position its stock price around $60.&nbsp;</p>



 Healthcare Stocks: Poised for Growth 



<p>The healthcare sector is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by technological advancements and an aging global population. Citron has identified Teladoc Health as a company leveraging AI to enhance its telemedicine services. Despite past perceptions as a “pandemic relic,” Teladoc’s strategic use of technology has improved profitability, making it an attractive acquisition target for major corporations like Amazon or CVS.</p>



<p>Additionally, industry experts predict that AI-powered diagnostics and personalized medicine will become more prevalent, offering investment opportunities in companies at the forefront of these innovations.</p>



 Energy Stocks: Traditional Players Reemerging 



<p>While renewable energy continues its ascent, Citron’s analysis suggests a potential resurgence in traditional oil and gas companies. Factors such as geopolitical developments and economic policies could drive demand for conventional energy sources. For instance, Talen Energy has been identified as a company to watch, with a market capitalization of $10 billion and potential for growth in the AI-energy nexus.</p>



<p>In summary, Citron Research’s 2025 outlook emphasizes the importance of discerning genuine innovation from market hype, particularly in the AI sector, recognizing growth potential in healthcare through technological integration, and acknowledging the possible resurgence of traditional energy companies amidst evolving market dynamics.​</p>


 
 


 Best Stock Picks for 2025 According to Citron 



<p>Citron has identified several stocks that they believe are undervalued gems. These companies have strong fundamentals, rising profits, and untapped potential.</p>



 
 A hidden AI stock: While big names like Nvidia and OpenAI dominate headlines, Citron has spotted a smaller AI company flying under the radar. They believe this stock could deliver massive returns. 



 A biotech company with breakthrough technology: Citron’s analysts argue that one specific healthcare stock has potential for a major breakout in 2025. 



 An oil and gas stock with untapped reserves: While many investors are chasing renewables, Citron believes one traditional energy company is positioned for a comeback. 
 



<p>They claim these stocks have high-profit potential, but as always, investors should do their own research.</p>


 
 


 Citron’s Most Controversial Calls This Year 



<p>Citron Research continues to stir controversy with their bold predictions. In 2025, some of their most contentious calls could significantly affect the stock market if proven accurate.</p>



 
 An AI Company Doomed to Fail: Citron has singled out a major AI stock, claiming that it is overhyped and purely speculative. With the recent surge in AI investments, Citron argues that the stock lacks a solid financial foundation and will face a sharp decline. Investors holding this stock might be exposed to huge losses if the company fails to deliver on its promises. The stock in question has seen speculative growth, driven by the AI boom, but with no profitable business model to support the hype.<br> 



 A Tech Stock Running on Borrowed Time: Citron has identified a leading tech company that they believe is nearing its end. Their research suggests that this stock is at risk of a major collapse within the next year, due to declining innovation and market competition. Citron’s track record with tech predictions has been mixed, but if correct, this prediction could shock the tech market.<br> 



 A Financial Stock Hiding Major Risks: Citron also warns that a prominent financial services company is covering up serious risks. According to their report, this company has hidden financial vulnerabilities that could collapse under market pressure. This could lead to massive losses for investors if the company’s true financial health comes to light. 
 



<p>Despite the backlash and skepticism from critics who view Citron’s calls as too aggressive, history shows that their controversial predictions have been right before—like when they warned about Luckin Coffee’s fraud, causing investors to avoid significant losses.</p>



 The Risks and Rewards of Following Citron Research 



<p>Citron Research has had a notable impact on investors, both positively and negatively. Their bold calls have created huge rewards but also significant risks.</p>



 
 The Rewards: Citron has made a name by spotting hidden gems before the broader market catches on. For example, they were early to identify Nvidia’s AI potential, a stock that has seen massive gains. Citron also warns about overvalued stocks. Their call on Luckin Coffee, when it was accused of fraud, saved investors from major losses. Their deep financial analysis often uncovers opportunities overlooked by mainstream analysts. In 2025, Citron’s focus on undervalued healthcare and energy stocks presents fresh opportunities, such as Teladoc Health and Talen Energy. 



 



 The Risks: However, Citron has made some wrong calls as well. They famously bet against Tesla before its massive rise. Also, shorting stocks – betting on their decline—can be dangerous, especially when stocks defy predictions, as seen with their failed bets on Shopify. 
 


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Citron Research has once again delivered bold, controversial insights into the stock market. Some investors trust them completely, while others see them as too aggressive. If Citron is right, some stocks will skyrocket, while others will crash. If they are wrong, their predictions could lead to bad investment decisions. The real question is: Will you take their advice or bet against them?</p>

 What Are Crypto Price Trackers? 



<p>If you’re investing in crypto, a crypto price tracker is your best friend. These platforms give you real-time access to crypto rates, making it easier to track the value of your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin prices across various exchanges. Without these tools, you’d be left refreshing price pages manually or hopping from one exchange to another just to find out the latest rate.</p>



<p>A good tracker doesn’t just show you prices, though. It also lets you keep tabs on market trends, compare prices across exchanges, and even manage your crypto portfolio. With so many crypto assets and exchanges out there, you’ll want a comprehensive tool to give you a complete view of the market.</p>

 Key Functions of Crypto Price Trackers 



<p>When looking for the best crypto price tracker, these are the key features you should consider:</p>



 Real-Time Price Tracking 



<p>The most important feature of any crypto price tracker is its ability to show real-time data. Whether it’s Bitcoin or Ethereum prices, having up-to-date information at your fingertips is crucial for making timely decisions. Markets can change in a matter of minutes, and real-time tracking ensures you’re always in the loop.</p>



 Market Insights and Analysis 



<p>A good tracker goes beyond just showing prices—it provides insights into crypto market trends. With tools that show you the price movements, trading volume, and even sentiment, you can better understand market dynamics. CryptoCompare, for example, offers these in-depth market insights, helping you spot trends before they become obvious to everyone else.</p>



 Price Comparison Across Exchanges 



<p>Not all exchanges offer the same prices, even for the same cryptocurrency. A Bitcoin price comparison tool helps you find the best rate by comparing Bitcoin prices across different platforms. This way, you can make sure you’re not overpaying or missing out on a better price elsewhere.</p>



 Portfolio Management 



<p>Whether you’re holding a few coins or tracking a diverse portfolio, having a tool that helps you manage your assets is essential. Many crypto price trackers also double as portfolio managers, letting you keep track of your holdings, profits, and losses. CryptoCompare makes it easy to monitor your entire crypto portfolio in one place, so you can see how your investments are performing.</p>



 Price Alerts 



<p>Sometimes, the market moves fast, and you can’t afford to keep checking prices every minute. That’s where price alerts come in. Set alerts for when a coin hits a certain price, and let the tracker notify you when it’s time to buy or sell.</p>



 Why CryptoCompare Stands Out Among Other Crypto Rate Trackers 



<p>There are plenty of crypto price trackers out there, but CryptoCompare offers a unique combination of features that set it apart:</p>



 Comprehensive Coverage 



<p>If you’re into altcoins, CryptoCompare is one of the best platforms for you. It tracks Bitcoin, Ethereum, and over 5,000 altcoins, so no matter what you’re investing in, you can keep tabs on it all in one place. The platform offers real-time tracking and market insights for all these coins, making it a go-to tool for anyone in the crypto space.</p>



 In-Depth Market Insights 



<p>With CryptoCompare, you’re not just tracking prices—you’re also getting a deep dive into market analysis. The platform provides charts, price trends, and detailed information on exchanges and cryptocurrencies, helping you understand market movements. This level of insight is perfect for investors who want to make informed decisions, whether you’re following Bitcoin market analysis or diving into emerging altcoins.</p>



 Easy-to-Use Interface 



<p>No matter your level of experience, CryptoCompare offers a clean, easy-to-navigate interface. Whether you’re using the web-based dashboard or the mobile app, it’s simple to find the information you need. This makes it accessible for beginners while still offering the features advanced users need to stay ahead.</p>



 Free Usage and Flexibility 



<p>Unlike some platforms that lock key features behind paywalls, CryptoCompare offers a free plan that allows up to 100,000 calls per month. This is more than enough for most casual traders. If you need more advanced features, there are also premium plans available. This gives you the flexibility to use the platform at your own pace, without worrying about running into a paywall.</p>



 Price Alerts and Notifications 



<p>Whether you’re day trading or holding long-term, being able to set price alerts is a huge benefit. CryptoCompare lets you set customized alerts for any cryptocurrency. When prices reach your desired level, you’ll get notified, ensuring that you never miss an opportunity. This is particularly useful for traders who need to react quickly to market changes.</p>

<p>The China-made generative artificial intelligence (AI) app <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a> is making waves for all sorts of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/598846/deepseek-big-tech-ai-industry-nvidia-impac">reasons</a>, not least of which is its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dimitarmixmihov/2025/02/10/deepseek-took-the-ai-space-by-storm-then-came-the-red-flags/">significant data privacy and security issues</a>.</p>



<p>Five countries and some US states and government agencies have already <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-nations-are-banning-deepseek-ai-heres-why/">banned</a> the AI chatbot that shook the US tech industry and stock market on its release in late January 2025.</p>



<p>Countries cite DeepSeek’s data collection and offshore storage, poor encryption practices, national security risks, and non-compliance with privacy laws as reasons for banning the app, mostly on government devices and in some cases from broader use.</p>



<p>Indeed, on its US release day January 20, 2025, the DeepSeek-R1 chatbot was the most-downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store and had a massive data leak that exposed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2025/02/01/deepseek-data-leak-exposes--1000000-sensitive-records/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">one million sensitive records</a>, compounding privacy and security fears. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/27/deepseek-cyberattack-ai">Malicious attacks</a> on the app only a week later didn’t instil confidence.</p>



<p>The fears stem from DeepSeek storing its user data in China, where it cannot legally deny the Chinese government access to it, and the model’s inherent security vulnerabilities, particularly for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-jailbreak">AI jailbreak attacks</a> where hackers bypass the model’s safety guardrails to produce malicious content such as malware instructions. <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/evaluating-security-risk-in-deepseek-and-other-frontier-reasoning-models">Cisco</a>, one of <a href="https://www.eweek.com/news/deepseek-security-issues/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">many agencies</a> to have studied DeepSeek’s security posture, revealed the model is <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6690a78074d86ca0ad978007/679bc2e71b48e423c0ff7e60_1%20RedTeaming_DeepSeek_Jan29_2025%20(1).pdf">11 times</a>&nbsp;more likely to be exploited by cybercriminals than other AI models and in testing had failed to block all harmful prompts, including prompts related to cybercrime and misinformation. Its competitors, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini, did much better.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity researchers has also found that the DeepSeek mobile and web apps contain hidden code that is <a href="https://www.feroot.com/blog/the-independent-feroot-security-uncovers-deepseeks-hidden-code-sending-user-data-to-china/">transmitting user data to state-controlled telecom company</a>&nbsp;China Mobile, and possibly other Chinese state-owned entities. China Mobile was <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-357087A1.pdf">banned from operating in the U.S.</a>&nbsp;in 2019 due to national security and law enforcement risks.</p>



<p>So, within that hotbed of issues, everyday users – and entire countries – need to determine whether the benefits of using the new kid on the AI block outweigh the risks to privacy and safety.</p>



<p>If you’re determined to try it, here’s the latest advice for staying private and safe on DeepSeek:</p>



<p>1. Don’t use your Gmail or Apple accounts to sign up to DeepSeek. That way, the data on those accounts is kept away from DeepSeek.</p>



<p>2. Don’t ask the app questions that reveal any identifying or highly personal information, since all inputs are used to train the model.</p>



<p>3. Avoid using the app altogether if you work for a government agency or other sensitive organization.</p>



<p>4. Use a virtual private network, like <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-vpn/">MySudo VPN</a>, to hide your IP address and location when using the app.</p>



<p>5. Don’t access DeepSeek’s AI models through DeepSeek’s web site, apps or API. Instead, consider using the DeepSeek AI model hosted by a service provider you trust. The app (iOS, Android, and web) sends data back to China, while US-based third-party platforms on which you can run DeepSeek don’t. Many US-based providers are running DeepSeek through their own data centres, such as <a href="http://perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/deepseek-r1-models-now-available-on-aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> for non-developers and <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai">GitHub</a> for developers. This short news clip is a good explainer:</p>



 

 



<p>6. Finally, get an alternative email and phone number from <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo app</a> to open and log into your DeepSeek account. MySudo has digital identities called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=A%20core%20capability%20of%20our,and%20protects%20your%20personal%20data.">Sudos</a> that offer different identity credentials from you own and therefore protect your personal information and make it impossible for data aggregators to correlate your data. Signing on to DeepSeek (or any app) with your Sudo details is like adding a privacy and security buffer between you and DeepSeek. <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">Download MySudo</a>. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/4-steps-to-setting-up-mysudo-to-meet-your-real-life-privacy-needs/">Set up your Sudos</a>.</p>



<p>We don’t know how DeepSeek’s technology and security issues will unfold from here, or where the world will go next with generative AI. Our best advice is to stay vigilant and proactive about protecting your own data privacy and security when using AI chatbots and other tools.</p>

For an industry that claims to be built on openness and decentralization, this kind of decision-making is deeply frustrating.</p><p>Still, here’s the reality: the majority of Binance trading volume comes from users who already use other exchanges where Aergo remains listed and actively traded.

<p>Predicting The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Interest Rate Decision of March 19,&nbsp;2025.</p> Introduction <p>This article represents a collaborative effort between <a href="https://www.ocean-foam.ai">Ocean Foam</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunus-g%C3%BCm%C3%BC%C5%9Fsoy/">Yunus Gümüşsoy</a>, the recent <a href="https://app.lunor.quest/challenge/33">FOMC Prediction Data Challenge</a> winner. The analysis aims to develop a sophisticated predictive framework that combines economic indicators, sentiment analysis, and advanced machine learning techniques to accurately anticipate Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decisions. Our model enhances the understanding of how macroeconomic variables and the nuances in central bank communications impact monetary policy decisions, providing valuable insights for financial markets, policymakers, and economic forecasters.</p> Prediction <p>Our integrated predictive model successfully forecasted the most recent FOMC decision from March 19, 2025, accurately predicting a decision to maintain the current interest rate (no change, +0.00%) with a probability of 56.5%. The model further assigned probabilities of 27% for a +0.25% rate increase and 9% for a -0.25% rate cut. Notably, this prediction marks the third consecutive successful forecast dating back to the previous year, underscoring the reliability and robustness of our approach.</p> Datasets and Methodology <p>Economic Data: The dataset incorporates 36 key macroeconomic indicators, including Inflation Metrics such as Consumer Price Index (CPI), Core CPI, Producer Price Index (PPI), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), and Inflation Expectations; Employment Metrics such as Non-Farm Payrolls and Unemployment Rate; and various Interest Rate and Yield Metrics including the Federal Funds Rate, Treasury Yields (2-Year and 10-Year), Mortgage Rates, and Bank Loan Rates. All economic data were systematically collected through the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, ensuring high-quality and real-time relevance.</p><p>FOMC Meeting Data: This dataset includes comprehensive historical records of previous FOMC meetings and decisions, sourced from <a href="http://www.investing.com">Investing.com</a>. These historical records provide essential context and capture decision-making patterns critical for enhancing predictive accuracy.</p><p>FOMC Communications: Utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyzed official statements and meeting minutes directly scraped from the Federal Reserve’s website. NLP features employed include FinBERT sentiment analysis, Hawkish/Dovish keyword frequencies, topic modeling, and sentiment ratio scoring. This text-based analysis captures subtle signals within the Federal Reserve’s communications, significantly enhancing the model’s predictive power.</p><p>To further understand our model’s decision-making, we assessed feature importance within our predictive framework, which reveals the economic and textual factors most influential in determining FOMC decisions.</p><p>The predictions generated by our model align closely with the current U.S. economic environment, particularly given the shift toward lower interest rates under a new presidential administration. Interestingly, the model indicated a small but notable 6% probability for a more aggressive -0.50% rate cut, an outcome that appears unlikely under typical conditions. This probability likely captures the heightened uncertainty related to recent U.S. tariff policy shifts and evolving geopolitical narratives concerning European political dynamics.</p> Looking Ahead <p>We’re focused on improving our predictive methods by adding sentiment analysis of public speeches from Federal Reserve officials. We also plan to create lagged indicators to better capture economic trends, and use dimensionality reduction techniques to spot key macroeconomic patterns more effectively. Our goal is to keep refining our approach so we can provide accurate, actionable forecasts and help everyone understand monetary policy&nbsp;better.</p><p>We are actively working toward making our predictive insights publicly available via a Web3 decentralized application (dApp).

<p>Every individual has the right to belong to a nation that ensures security, freedom, and economic opportunity. A nation should serve as a protector, ensuring stability and empowering its people to build and sustain wealth. However, the current global financial system prioritizes financial institutions over individuals, allowing wealth accumulation for the privileged few while restricting economic independence for the majority.</p><p>At Sovereign Wallet, we advocate for an alternative financial model — one that is investment-based rather than debt-driven. We envision a system that eliminates reliance on credit and interest-based transactions, enables direct, secure, and transparent financial exchanges, and empowers individuals and nations with self-sovereign finance. This model fosters long-term economic sustainability by freeing people from dependency on banks and intermediaries.</p><p>By digitizing national infrastructures and enabling peer-to-peer financial participation, we offer an independent, self-sustaining alternative to traditional banking.</p><p>A sovereign future starts with reclaiming ownership over identity and financial participation. No individual should have to depend on centralized authorities to verify their identity, access services, or participate in economic activities. We aim to build a financial system that prevents economic servitude, guarantees unrestricted financial participation independent of inflation-driven and debt-based models, and ensures governance structures are transparent and directly participatory, reflecting the will of the people rather than the interests of a privileged elite.</p><p>This vision does not seek to replace one centralized authority with another. Instead, it aims to create a decentralized, equitable, and resilient system where power is distributed and individuals are genuinely empowered.</p> Building Indigenous Sovereignty: The Promise of Digital Infrastructure <p>Across the globe, Indigenous communities continue to seek meaningful sovereignty — not just politically, but economically and digitally. Recognizing the need for robust infrastructure that aligns with these ambitions, Sovereign Wallet is developing the Indigenous Digital Infrastructure (IDI), a comprehensive framework designed to reinforce Indigenous sovereignty, economic independence, and social inclusivity. The IDI is structured around three core pillars: Self-Sovereign Identity, Tokenized Payments, and AI Agents, each integral to strengthen Indigenous sovereignty and economic competitiveness.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity: Security and&nbsp;Autonomy <p>At the heart of the IDI is Self-Sovereign Identity, empowering individuals to securely own, control, and manage their digital identities without reliance on centralized authorities. Through tokenized identities and digital identifiers, personal data is protected via encrypted messaging networks and unified&nbsp;ledgers.</p><p>This approach allows individuals to issue and present verifiable credentials independently, granting them full autonomy over their identities. The benefits extend beyond individual privacy to broader community trust and transparency, as digital signatures enable secure contracts, notarization processes, and authenticated, on-chain voting systems, thereby fortifying governance mechanisms.</p> Tokenized Payment: Economic Empowerment and Inclusivity <p>Economic autonomy is further strengthened by a Tokenized Payment system, which simplifies transactions and reduces reliance on costly intermediaries. Facilitated through peer-to-peer transactions — such as Payment versus Payment (PvP) currency exchanges and Delivery versus Payment (DvP) asset exchanges — the IDI significantly lowers social transaction costs, enhancing local economic efficiency.</p><p>This innovative payment ecosystem promotes sustainability through tokenized crowd investments, digitized currency circulation, and secure digital asset trading. Crucially, the system fosters inclusivity, equipping users with self-managed digital wallets and banking capabilities directly linked to their digital identities, ensuring everyone within Indigenous communities can actively participate in economic&nbsp;life.</p> AI Agents: Automation and Economic Scalability <p>Complementing identity and payment systems, AI Agents introduce a transformative dimension to the IDI. By shifting extensive manual processes to AI-driven algorithmic operations, Indigenous communities can dramatically enhance productivity, efficiency, and economic scalability.</p><p>Leveraging digital currencies and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, AI-powered infrastructures enable machine-to-machine commerce, creating scalable, sustainable economic ecosystems that free human labor for creative and strategic tasks. Furthermore, AI agents facilitate the growth of inclusive, open-source economic networks, enabling broad societal participation in collective economic prosperity.</p><p>Integrating Self-Sovereign Identity, Tokenized Payments, and AI Agents into a coherent digital infrastructure establishes a powerful, decentralized, and inclusive economy for Indigenous communities. Sovereign Wallet’s vision of the IDI represents the technological advancement and a fundamental shift toward genuine economic sovereignty. In embracing the IDI, Indigenous nations reaffirm their independence, redefine their economic potential, and establish a resilient foundation for generations to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We believe that financial power should be in the hands of individuals — not intermediaries, banks, or centralized authorities. By eliminating unnecessary transaction costs, introducing fractional investments, and creating an inclusive financial ecosystem, we make economic opportunities available to all, regardless of financial status or geographic location. This is the foundation for a new, decentralized financial era — one where individuals and nations have the freedom to shape their own economic destinies, ensuring long-term prosperity and sustainability.</p>

<p>Meet Sarah—a busy professional trying to open an investment account, finalize her legal agreement, and file her taxes. Her to-do list is long, but verifying her identity for each service shouldn’t be the hardest part of her day.</p>



<p>Her first stop is her credit union. They require a face-to-face meeting, but the next available appointment is five days away. Sarah’s lawyer calls next—“We’ll need you to bring your ID in for verification.” Great. Another trip. Finally, her accountant sends a casual request: “Just email me a picture of your driver’s license.” Alarm bells go off in Sarah’s mind. Isn’t email unsecured?</p>



<p>By the end of the day, Sarah is frustrated and overwhelmed. Verifying her identity feels outdated, unsafe, and time-consuming.</p>



<p>Now imagine a different experience—one where Sarah completes everything from her phone, securely and in minutes, thanks to a platform powered by iComply.</p>



 



 A Seamless Verification Journey 



<p>Sarah opens her credit union’s branded verification portal—powered by iComply—on her phone. Instead of scheduling a meeting, she’s prompted to take a quick selfie and scan her driver’s license.</p>



<p>Within seconds, the system:</p>



 
 Confirms her ID’s authenticity by checking security features like watermarks and MRZ codes. 



 Runs a biometric facial recognition check to ensure the selfie matches her ID. 



 Cross-references her information against real-time government databases, ensuring compliance with KYC and AML regulations. 
 



<p>No back-and-forth emails. No trips to an office. No guesswork about data security. The same smooth process happens when Sarah logs into her law firm’s and accountant’s portals. iComply’s flexible platform allows each business to use the same seamless verification process—no siloed tools or manual checks.</p>



 



 Why This Future Matters 



<p>iComply eliminates friction for clients like Sarah and strengthens trust in every transaction. For businesses, it’s a win-win: secure onboarding that meets global regulatory standards while enhancing customer experience. Instead of patchwork solutions that create inefficiencies, iComply’s unified platform integrates everything—document verification, biometric checks, and continuous monitoring—into one turnkey system.</p>



<p>This isn’t just identity verification—it’s a future where customers like Sarah feel valued and safe, not inconvenienced or exposed. When compliance is this seamless, it stops being a hurdle and becomes a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>It’s time to leave in-person waits and unsecured emails behind. Ready to show your customers the future? Discover how iComply can empower your business today.</p>

<p>Cloud computing was a breakthrough in convenience and cost compared to housing and maintaining on-site servers for companies’ data and applications. But the landscape has shifted, thanks to greatly heightened security risks, higher data transport demands from applications like AI, and a growing need for both control and flexibility that the cloud can’t offer.&nbsp;</p><p>This has led to more interest in a “best of both worlds” approach increasingly known as <a href="https://www.cleo.com/blog/knowledge-base-on-premise-vs-cloud?ref=blog.spruceid.com">“cloud-premises computing,”</a> or just “cloud-prem.” Also sometimes known as Hybrid Cloud, this approach involves separating user data storage from application and execution, with the “data plane” generally hosted and managed on-site and the “control plane” managed in the cloud, often by a vendor.</p><p>Cloud-prem reduces vendor lock-in, reduces data latency, can improve security, and makes compliance easier. </p> You Control the Data – Not Your Vendor <p>A hybrid approach to hosted services generally means an on-site server that handles user data, and a cloud instance that runs the application layer, sometimes with help from a software vendor. For instance, a health service might store patient data locally, while a software provider integrates <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/private-cloud-examples?ref=blog.spruceid.com">edge computing for patient monitoring</a> in the cloud.</p><p>This approach lets an in-house IT administrator deploy all applications with uniform, pre-set data controls. Direct, physical control of data also means long-term flexibility: In the event of a vendor switch or new integration, having data on your own servers keeps handovers worry-free. Using standard data approaches such as Kubernetes and PostgresDB makes shifting or expanding to a new front-end app practically plug-and-play.</p><p>The practical benefits can be massive if you deal with a lot of vendors. In a pure cloud-SaaS model, 12 services can mean 12 different databases, <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/cloud-prem-architecture/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">each controlled by a vendor</a>. By putting you back in control of your data, cloud-prem can make interaction among the data for all these applications much simpler. Overall, a customer who controls their own data also has more control over their own applications.</p> Security In Your Hands <p>For even slightly sensitive applications, the cloud has always been a dicey proposition. Cloud SaaS struggles to provide the necessary safeguards for handling a lot of PII or health information, and newer AI and data-monitoring applications need <a href="https://www.datagravity.dev/p/the-rise-of-cloudprem-newprem-and?ref=blog.spruceid.com">extensive access permissions</a>, meaning higher risk in a cloud environment. As one commenter put it, “Securing cloud assets that may be open to the public or accessible via API means <a href="https://medium.com/@cam.wasi/moving-from-on-prem-to-cloud-to-cloud-prem-f75b2052e422?ref=blog.spruceid.com">battling a Medusa.</a>”</p><p>The changing threat environment makes this challenge even bigger: major data breaches and ransomware attacks<a href="https://nordlayer.com/blog/data-breaches-in-2024/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> rose sharply in 2024</a>. More and more attackers are backed by hostile governments, and the average cost of a data breach reached $4.88 million, according to Nordlayer. Cloud breaches were even more damaging, averaging $5.17 million.</p><p>It requires in-house expertise that’s not always cheap, but local data control offers greater control over security measures, from individual and application privileges to the ability to simply take data offline entirely in a catastrophic situation. That could be particularly important in a ransomware scenario, and those attacks have become increasingly frequent and costly.</p> Location, Location, Location <p>Where your data “lives” geographically is important for reasons other than security. For a long time, high-grade broadband meant there was plenty of bandwidth, even for tasks like streaming video. But the advent of AI has begun to push up against those boundaries, making “data gravity” an issue.</p><p>One example is in finance, where algorithmic fraud detection is now nearly ubiquitous. This and similar applications require <a href="https://www.datagravity.dev/p/the-rise-of-cloudprem-newprem-and?ref=blog.spruceid.com">significant privileges</a> over sensitive data. Keeping data and processing near each other can be a security advantage while reducing bandwidth costs and even shaving down service latency.</p><p>The cloud-prem hybrid model also addresses regulatory controls on data’s physical location. While the U.S. has no Federal data localization law, specific regulations or rules cover data handling by health care providers (HIPAA), the financial industry (PCI DSS), and government contractors. Specific state regulations, such as<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> California’s CCPA</a>, may also have implications for your data localization and control duties. While cloud providers can offer specific data locations, the assurances may not be sufficient for higher-risk or regulated sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you’re facing localization requirements, need to go the extra mile for more agility and security, or want to get the most out of innovations in artificial intelligence, cloud-prem could be a strong fit for your secure computing strategy.&nbsp;</p> Learn More about Cloud-Prem <p>At SpruceID, we leverage cloud-prem computing to ensure secure, flexible, and compliant data management for our clients, providing the best of both worlds in an increasingly complex digital landscape.

									  Stablecoins: Your Crypto Chill Pill in a Wild Market   <p>It’s 3 AM, I’m half-asleep on my couch, glued to my phone, and Solana is tanking faster than my motivation on a Monday. My hands are sweaty, I’m freaking out, muttering, “Sell? HODL? What’s the play chat?!” Then it hits me — stablecoins!</p>  <p>I swap my SOL for USDC quicker than you can say “I’m screwed,” and bam, I’m chill again. No more watching my money bleed out — it’s just sitting there at a buck a pop, while the crypto world loses its mind. That’s the deal with stablecoins. They’re like the buddy who talks you off the ledge when it gets a bit too wild.</p>  <p>Stablecoins are like the laid-back cousins of the crypto fam — they don’t flip out like Bitcoin or Ethereum. They’re tied to boring stuff like dollars or gold, so while the big dogs are out there doing cartwheels, stablecoins are just kicking it, steady as a rock. But don’t sleep on ‘em — they’re clutch. I’ve used them to pay for groceries, coffee, and even sent them to a buddy halfway across the planet instantly with no insane fees or no hassle. It’s like Venmo on steroids.</p>   The Stablecoin Use Case   <p>Here’s the rundown on the types — they’ve all got their own deal:</p>    <p>Fiat-Backed:&nbsp;These are hooked to real cash, like USDC&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/USDC.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$USDC.X ( ▼ 0.0% )</a>&nbsp;or Tether&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/USDT.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$USDT.X ( ▲ 0.02% )</a>. Simple gig: 1 coin = 1 dollar stashed somewhere. USDC’s my jam ’cause they’re straight-up about it, while Tether’s had some “uh, where’s the money?” sketchiness. It’s like loaning your buddy 20 bucks — USDC’s the guy who pays you back, Tether’s the one who might ghost you.</p>  <p>Crypto-Backed:&nbsp;Like DAI — tied to other crypto, usually Ethereum&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ET?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$ET ( ▼ 0.16% )</a>&nbsp;. You gotta overstack it to cover any dips, kinda like tossing extra cash in a bet to make sure you don’t lose your shirt. Neat, but it’s more work.</p>  <p>Algorithmic:&nbsp;These are wild — fancy code keeps ’em at a buck, no cash or crypto backing, just math vibes. Terra’s UST&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/UST.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$UST.X ( ▲ 2.05% )</a>&nbsp;tried it and ate dirt hard — like, zeroed out overnight. Brutal. New ones are popping up, though, so who knows? Maybe they’ll crack it.</p>    <p>Stablecoins are like that random tool in your junk drawer — good for everything. They’re your safe spot. Need to sending cash quick? Boom, done. I’ve paid freelancers with them and even scored a pizza just to say I did (<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-glossary/what-is-bitcoin-pizza?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">look up the story of Bitcoin Pizza Day</a>). They’re ace for dodging market tantrums, too — swap into when&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PEPE.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$PEPE.X ( ▼ 0.9% )</a>&nbsp;is crying, and you’re golden. No more stressing over your portfolio.</p>  <p>Okay, but what’s the catch? Yeah, they’ve got some baggage. Biggest potential headache? De-pegging. That’s when they lose the $1 mark, and the clown-show begins. This is very rare, but it happens. Terra’s UST went from a buck to nada. People (and, not long after, the entire crypto market) got wrecked.</p>  <p>Then there’s regulation — governments are eyeballing them, and stuff like the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://legalnodes.com/article/mica-regulation-explained?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">MiCA</a>&nbsp;rules could mess with the vibe (the EU has a very different approach to crypto than the current administration in the US). For fiat backed stablecoins, in the back of your mind, you’re always like, “Yo, you sure you’ve got the cash?” Trust’s a gamble sometimes. Crypto-backed or algo ones? It’s all code, and code can glitch — or a hacker can swipe it. Like trusting your dog not to eat your sandwich — usually fine, but hey, shit happens.</p>  <p>Here’s the big players you should know:</p>    <p><a href="https://www.circle.com/usdc?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">USDC</a>: The straight-A student — clean, audited, my ride-or-die.</p>  <p>USDT: The shady one — tons of it out there, but it’s got a rap sheet.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dai?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">DAI</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/DAI.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$DAI.X ( ▲ 0.04% )</a>: The artsy type, all decentralized and quirky — still figuring it out myself.</p>  <p>And shout-out to lesser-knowns like Ripple’s&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/RLUSD.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$RLUSD.X ( ▼ 0.11% )</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BUSDX.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$BUSDX.X ( 0.0% )</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PAXG.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">$PAXG.X ( ▲ 0.43% )</a>— solid options if you’re exploring.</p>    <p>Those are the DeFi leaders, but TradFi is sniffing around the space now. JPMorgan’s JPM Coin’s zipping cash for their clients, way quicker than wire transfers. Some normie banks even let you stash USDC right in your account! Down the road, stablecoins could flip cross-border payments — cheap, fast, no bank BS.</p>  <p>Oh, and some governments around the world are cooking up their own digital money —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">CBDCs</a>&nbsp;(Central Bank Digial Currencies (this is a whole other conversation for another time)). Stablecoins might tag along or butt heads with them — like they’re auditioning for the cash throne, but nobody’s got the crown yet.</p>  <p>Some exchanges — like Binance, Gemini, and Coinbase — push you to keep stablecoins “on-chain” with ultra-high interest rates as an incentive. Binance dangled 8% APY on USDT once. Coinbase and Uphold both offer 4%+ for you to store your USDC with them. Felt like my cash was finally pulling its weight and if you use their debit card, you can spend directly out of your account and in many cases earn additional rewards like .5% BTC on your transactions.</p>   Other Ways to Use or Spend Stablecoins   <p>Speaking of making your money work, stablecoins aren’t just for parking or earning interest — they’ve got a whole bunch of other uses too.</p>  <p>Stablecoins aren’t just for trading or sitting pretty in your wallet — they’ve got a whole bag of tricks. You can use them to send cash across the globe without getting fleeced by fees. I once sent some USDC to a buddy in LA, and it was faster than a hiccup — no waiting days for the bank to wake up. Saved me a ton on fees too, which meant more tacos for both of us.</p>  <p>Then there’s online shopping — some stores (many built on Shopify) are cool with stablecoins now. I bought a goofy mug off a site with USDC just to say I did. Felt like a crypto pioneer, even if it was just a silly mug.</p>  <p>In DeFi, you can lend out stablecoins and rake in interest. I have a few friends that like to toss DAI into AAVE and make a few bucks here and there. Not life-changing, but hey, better than your bank’s sad rates. Just watch out — DeFi’s got risks and if you don’t pay attention, you can lose your shirt — and maybe more!</p>  <p>Oh, and charities? Some take stablecoins! I sent USDC to the&nbsp;<a href="https://thegivingblock.com/donate/global-sanctuary-for-elephants/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">Global Sanctuary for Elephants</a>&nbsp;— quick, no fees, felt good. It’s like donating without the middleman taking a cut. I personally like&nbsp;<a href="https://thegivingblock.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">The Giving Block.</a>&nbsp;If you’re curious about on-chain charitable organizations, here are&nbsp;<a href="https://thegivingblock.com/resources/nonprofits-using-blockchain-social-impact/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=take-the-chill-pill">9 non-profits</a>&nbsp;harnessing blockchain for social impact.</p>  <p>Investment-wise, stablecoins are a solid base. I use them to park cash before diving into other cryptos or just to collect the interest (Coinbase offers over 4% APY on your USDC). Keeps things steady while I figure out my next move. For freelance gigs, stablecoins can come in clutch, too. Whenever I am doing freelance gigs, I ask if I can be paid in USDC — no borders, no hassle. If they don’t know what USDC is, it’s a great opportunity to drop some knowledge! When the market’s throwing a tantrum, I swap to stablecoins to chill. Did that during the last crash — saved my bacon while everyone else was panicking.</p>  <p>So yeah, stablecoins are like that multi-tool you keep in your car — good for a bunch of stuff, just don’t expect them to fix everything.</p>  <p>They really are the chill heroes of crypto — steady, handy, but not invincible. They’re not flexing — they just do the job: trading, paying, whatever. Yeah, there’s risks — de-pegging, sketchy backups, or governments shutting them down, but they are the most trustworthy aspect of the industry. Next time your favorite coin is throwing a fit, maybe hang with USDC for a sec and avoid the headache of the next 30% dip.</p>  <p>The digital dollar of the wild wild west is here. How will you take advantage of it?</p>  <p>—Branden</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
							 
			
						
		 
						 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         You’re the Map!   <p>If you want to build something new, you start at street level.</p>  <p>Hivemapper, the Solana-based decentralized mapping project, is doing just that — turning everyday drivers into cartographers and paying them in crypto to rebuild the world’s maps from scratch. It’s a wildly ambitious idea, but one that might just work.</p>  <p>The traditional mapping industry is dominated by Google, which updates its maps on its terms, at its own pace, and with its massive budget. Hivemapper, on the other hand, is flipping that model on its head. With dashcams that cost just a few hundred bucks, contributors feed a constantly updating global map and get rewarded in HONEY tokens. More than 100 million kilometers have already been mapped, spanning over 90 countries.</p>  <p>But, as with any big crypto experiment, there’s a catch. While the supply side is booming — drivers are lining up to earn rewards — the demand side is still a work in progress. Companies need to buy into Hivemapper’s vision for it to be sustainable, and so far, that adoption has been slower than ideal. Critics argue that incentives alone won’t carry the project forever.</p>  <p>Still, the promise is clear. A self-sustaining, real-time global map, owned and maintained by the people who drive the roads. One that’s cheaper, fresher, and more adaptable than anything a centralized giant could maintain.</p>  <p>So, will Hivemapper succeed in redrawing the digital map economy? It’s hard to say. But if the future of mapping really is decentralized, this might just be the way to get there.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>tl;dr: Traditional identity federation has enabled digital identity with centralized, third-party logins, for decades. Its limitations in security and user control, however, are becoming a problem, especially when there are alternatives being developed. Digital credentials offer a decentralized, user-empowering alternative that enhances privacy and enables offline authentication. We’re looking at a brave new world with the future of identity federation.</p>



 Let’s Get Started 



<p>If you’re reading this post, you, along with around <a href="https://prioridata.com/data/smartphone-stats/">4.88 billion</a> of your fellow humans (that’s just over 60% of the global population), have a smartphone. You’ve probably used that phone to purchase goods or services, log in to social media, check your bank balance, or access your work or school account to get something done. In the early days of digital identity, you’d have used a username and password and not thought too much about it. But as hackers began finding ways to copy those usernames and passwords, banks and businesses recognized the need for more secure methods for verifying identity.</p>



<p>Organizations started to externalize identity verification, relying on third parties to manage accounts and authenticate users. Although this change made the experience more efficient and secure for most users, once you initiated the action, you lost control over how the system shared your identity information. And as our dependence on digital transactions grew, so did the demand for offline experiences to match the convenience and security of online interactions.</p>



<p>This post explores two different paradigms in digital identity management: traditional federation and digital (or verifiable) credentials. I’ll talk a bit about how traditional federated authentication works, why the industry is shifting towards verifiable credentials, and how offline authentication is emerging as a vital component of the future identity framework.</p>



 Understanding Traditional Federation 



<p>First, let me just say that calling this “traditional” federation feels weird. Since it developed in my lifetime, it doesn’t feel that old. And yet, some of you may never have seen the Internet function without it. So I’ll use “traditional” because “old-fashioned” is worse. Also, get off my lawn.</p>



 Traditional Identity Federation: More Than Just a Third-Party Login 



<p>Traditional identity federation isn’t simply about “logging in with Google” or other familiar third parties. It’s built on a robust trust fabric that ties together Identity Providers (IdPs) and Relying Parties (RPs) through formal, negotiated agreements.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://refeds.org">REFEDS</a>, the Research and Education Federations organization, this ecosystem is maintained through a set of shared policies, legal contracts, and technical standards. These elements ensure that every party involved adheres to common guidelines for security, privacy, and operational best practices. In essence, when you log in through a federated service, you’re participating in an intricate web of trust where the IdP and RP have already agreed on the rules of engagement. It’s a combination of technical trust (i.e., computationally enforceable) and contractual trust (i.e., yay, lawyers). This trust fabric guarantees that the identity assertions provided by the IdP are reliable and acceptable to the RP. The result is secure and efficient digital transactions without the need for every party to reinvent the wheel each time.</p>



<p>This model simplifies the user experience by reducing the need for multiple credentials. It also reinforces the overall security posture by holding each participant accountable to a standardized set of expectations and responsibilities. This framework of collective trust makes traditional identity federation a viable and widely adopted approach in various sectors.</p>



 How Does It Work? 



<p>In a typical federated model, a third-party IdP redirects you when you attempt to access a service. This provider confirms your identity (often using a username and password, hopefully augmented with additional factors) and then sends a secure assertion back to the service. This process not only simplifies user experience by reducing the number of credentials you need to manage but also centralizes the security controls. Basically, the service provider doesn’t have to manage your account or your affiliation, nor do they need to go through any kind of elaborate identity verification process. They effectively outsource all that to the identity provider.&nbsp;</p>



 Benefits and Limitations 



<p>While traditional federation offers efficiency and ease of use, it comes with trade-offs:</p>



 
 Centralized Trust: You rely heavily on the IdP’s security measures. A breach or failure on their side can expose your personal data. 



 Limited User Control: Once the authentication process begins, the user has little say over how their identity data is managed or shared. 



 Single Point of Failure: If the IdP is compromised or goes offline, access to multiple services can be affected. 
 



<p>For many sectors, especially in research, education, and enterprise, these limitations are increasingly prompting the search for more resilient and user-empowering alternatives.</p>



 Introducing Digital Credentials 



<p>Hello, digital credentials that can be cryptographically verified, my new friends.</p>



 Defining Digital (Verifiable) Credentials 



<p>Digital credentials, also called verifiable credentials (I have a <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">blog post</a> about the terminology problems), represent a shift in how we think about identity. Rather than relying solely on centralized third parties, these credentials offer cryptographically secure, tamper-evident proofs of identity or specific claims. By storing credentials on personal devices like smartphones, users gain greater control over their information and can present verified data directly to service providers without always involving an intermediary. In other words, they can prevent your IdP from tracking you.</p>



 Underlying Technologies 



<p>At the heart of digital credentials lies a suite of modern technologies:</p>



 
 Cryptography: Ensures that credentials are secure and tamper-proof. 



 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Provide a way to assert identity without a central registry. 



 Digital Wallets: Serve as the interface for managing and presenting these credentials, similar to how a physical wallet stores your driver’s license, credit cards, and other proofs. 
 



<p>If you’re curious about specific standards, you have several options. I went into a comparison study a while back about <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">W3C Verifiable Credentials versus ISO/IEC mdoc</a>. I also expanded it a bit to talk about IETF SD-JWT VCs. Suffice to say, there’s a lot going on and various reasons to choose a protocol.</p>



 Advantages Over Traditional Federation 



<p>Digital credentials offer several improvements:</p>



 
 Enhanced Security: By reducing reliance on centralized password databases, digital credentials mitigate the risk of mass breaches. 



 Greater Privacy: Users can engage in selective disclosure, sharing only the specific information required by a service rather than an entire identity profile. 



 User Empowerment: The control over credentials shifts back into the hands of the user, ensuring that they decide how and when to share their identity information. 
 



 The Shift: From Sign-Ins to Digital Credentials 



 Why the Transition? 



<p>There isn’t any single reason, but we can start with:</p>



 
 Security Needs: As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, the industry is moving away from centralized password stores to more secure, decentralized systems. 



 Privacy Concerns: Users increasingly demand solutions that allow them to share only what’s necessary, preserving their personal data from unnecessary exposure. 



 Efficiency Gains: Digital credentials streamline the process of identity verification, making transactions both faster and more reliable. 
 



 Use-Case Scenarios 



<p>Consider a few real-world examples where this shift is already underway:</p>



 
 Financial Services: Banks are exploring ways to onboard customers using digital credentials that confirm identity without storing sensitive data in one centralized location. 



 Travel &amp; Hospitality: Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and digital passports can enable secure, offline verification when connectivity is poor or non-existent. 



 Healthcare: Institutions are piloting systems where patients’ vaccination records or other health records are stored digitally, ensuring privacy and easing cross-system verification. This had a surge of popularity with COVID-19 vaccination records. 
 



<p>Digital wallets play a crucial role in these scenarios, acting as secure repositories for your credentials. In posts like “<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/09/20/the-wallets-are-coming-but-are-we-ready-for-whats-next/">The Wallets Are Coming—but Are We Ready for What’s Next?</a>”, the conversation focuses on how these tools will soon become mainstream, everyday interactions.</p>



 Offline Authentication in the Digital Age 



<p>There’s a lot to be said here. For one thing, believe it or not, Internet access is not ubiquitous. For that matter, while 60% of humans today have smartphones, that means 40% do not. Unless something changes drastically, there will ALWAYS be a need to support offline services and physical credentials.</p>



 What Is Offline Authentication? 



<p>While online systems dominate much of our current authentication landscape, offline authentication is becoming a Really Big Deal. It allows for secure identity verification without a constant Internet connection, relying on local cryptographic verification methods.</p>



 Why Offline Matters 



<p>Offline authentication addresses several critical challenges:</p>



 
 Resilience: In areas with unreliable connectivity or in emergency situations, being able to verify identity without an online connection is invaluable. 



 Privacy: By minimizing data transmission over networks, offline methods reduce exposure to interception or misuse. 



 Complementarity: Offline authentication doesn’t replace online systems; it supplements them, ensuring that users have a seamless experience regardless of connectivity. 
 



<p>Real-world applications are already in motion. For instance, mDLs in many states in the U.S. can be verified locally on your device, and some health records are designed to be accessible even when you’re off the grid. This dual approach, online for day-to-day transactions and offline for specific scenarios, creates a robust, flexible identity framework.</p>



 Comparative Analysis: Digital Credentials vs. Traditional Federation 



<p>People seem to love comparison tables, so let’s start with one of those:</p>



AspectTraditional Identity FederationDigital Credential ModelAuthenticationUses established protocols (OIDC and OAuth, SAML) to handle authentication and (sometimes) authorization.Relies on cryptographically secure, user-held credentials that you control on your device.SecurityCentralized systems create a single point of failure; a breach at the provider can impact many services.Decentralized, with security anchored in cryptography, reducing the risk of mass breaches.PrivacyThird parties manage and often store your data, which can lead to oversharing or tracking across services.Starting to enable selective disclosure, allowing you to share only the necessary information without overexposing your data. (There’s still work going on in the standards and implementation spaces to make this happen.)User ControlOnce you log in, you have little control over how the provider manages or shares your data.It puts you in the driver’s seat (driver’s seat, mDL, ha!), letting you decide what to share and when. That’s the goal; some technical challenges are still being worked on.Offline CapabilityPrimarily requires an online connection; offline verification is generally not supported.Supports offline verification (as long as you have a phone and the local business has the tools to consume what you display), ensuring secure authentication even without connectivity.Trust ModelTrust is placed in centralized authorities to safeguard your identity data.Trust is distributed through verifiable proofs and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). That said, some trust is centralized when it comes to trusting the issuer of the credential. AdoptionWidely implemented across sectors like education, research, and enterprise.Gaining traction in areas like finance, travel, healthcare, and beyond as the technology matures.



 Future Trends and the Road Ahead 



<p>This is an incredibly active space. That said, people will have to figure out how to deal with the technical debt of the previous generation tech stack. Interesting times.</p>



<p>Digital credentials are gaining ground, but does that mean traditional federation is on its way out? If your organization is trying to make sense of the shifting standards landscape, I can help you track the changes and find the right approach. <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">Explore my digital identity standards consulting services</a>.</p>



 Evolving Standards and Innovations For Digital Credentials 



<p>Several new initiatives and standards are setting the stage for a more decentralized and resilient identity ecosystem. The W3C <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials">Digital Credentials API</a>, for example, is pushing for interoperability and security in digital credential frameworks by offering a secure connection between a browser and an operating system for digital wallets and their credentials. (As an aside, there’s some very late-breaking news as of February 2025 regarding the DC API – the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2025/02/council-report-fedid-dig-cred.html">roadblock</a> has been cleared for this API, referenced by the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/architecture-and-reference-framework-main/">EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework</a> (EUDI ARF), to move into the next step of the standardization process within the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Federated Identity Working Group</a>.) Similarly, a new <a href="https://idtechwire.com/newly-published-iso-iec-standard-enables-remote-idv-via-mobile-drivers-license/">ISO/IEC standard</a> is enabling remote identity verification through mobile devices; the tech stack is building for using digital credentials in all aspects of life.</p>



 Predictions for the Future 



<p>Looking ahead, I think we can expect:</p>



 
 Increased Adoption: More industries will experiment with and adopt verifiable credentials as a secure alternative to traditional sign-ins. 



 Convergence of Online and Offline Systems: Hybrid models will become the norm, ensuring that identity verification remains robust regardless of connectivity. 



 User Empowerment: As control shifts back to the user, there will be greater emphasis on privacy, selective disclosure, and decentralized trust networks. 
 



 Implications for Businesses and Users 



<p>Organizations will need to weigh the benefits of maintaining legacy federated systems against the potential advantages of transitioning to digital credentials. For users, the promise of enhanced security and control over personal data is a compelling incentive to support these changes. However, the transition requires careful planning, standardization, and a willingness to experiment with new technologies. I’m putting together a talk for the upcoming EIC in May 2025 to talk about this very thing: “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5882/2">The Challenges and ROI of Verifiable Credentials in Enterprise Use Cases</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>So, traditional federation, while providing initial efficiency and security through centralized third-party authentication and with an extensive deployment base, comes with inherent limitations such as offline-use issues and potential single points of failure. Digital credentials offer a promising alternative by decentralizing control and empowering users with cryptographically secure proofs of identity, though the tech stack for using them securely is still building.</p>



<p>As digital credentials become more prevalent and standards for offline authentication mature, we are going to see a hybrid identity landscape where both online and offline mechanisms coexist and complement one another. This shift not only enhances security and privacy but also paves the way for a more resilient, user-centric digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>I wish there was a perfect solution for everything, but so much depends on the problems you’re trying to solve. You’ll notice that I didn’t even try to bring in passkeys to this conversation; if you’d like to read more on that, I suggest you start <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2023/08/26/comparing-federated-logins-and-passkeys-which-one-fits-your-needs/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Sure, there are plenty of passwordless authentication solutions out there, each promising to simplify identity management. But in reality, most of them just add another cog to the already overcomplicated Rube Goldberg machine that is most enterprise identity. The question you should be asking isn’t “how can I go passwordless” but —, “what else can I do to make identity management work better for my business?”</p>
<p>The answer is <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-auth/">Proven Auth</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proven Auth is more than just another login solution, it’s about using the power of Verifiable Credentials for orchestrating the entire life-cycle of access so that the right person has the right access at the right time.&nbsp;</p>
 Simplifying the messy world of access control 
<p>You know the struggle. Managing access to your company’s growing stack of products, systems, and applications is an ongoing headache. And that’s just the beginning. Too often, IT teams are stuck dealing with overly rigid access models that aren’t flexible enough to account for the realities of real work environments, or manual access control that needs to be managed on a per-individual and per-product basis.</p>
<p>Instead, Proven Auth enables smart, policy-driven authorization that adapts to your business needs. It allows you to easily implement policies that define access rules dynamically. No more one-size-fits-all permissions. No more access silos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you’re managing employees, contractors, or partners, our policy-driven access control makes security seamless and scalable.</p>
 How Verifiable Credentials manage policy-driven access 
<p>With Proven Auth, you can use dynamic access rules that respond instantly when a Verifiable Credential is presented. Instead of granting broad permissions, you can enforce fine-grained policies that determine exactly what each person should access based on their role, credentials, and other verified attributes.</p>
<p>This means you can write access policies once and apply them across multiple systems, ensuring consistency and reducing administrative overhead.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Issue Verifiable Credentials using Indico Proven to employees, customers, partners, or have your contractors issue them to their employees that contains information that would affect their access. This could include things like their role, location, years of experience, certifications or other relevant information. 
 Integrate Proven Auth with policy engines like Amazon Verified Permissions or Abacus and write policies based on your business’ needs. 
 Grant access based on their verified attributes so instead of using static, pre-configured access roles, the world of tools and systems people can access is set up for them in minutes, without needing to log into anything. 
 
 The value of Proven Auth in action 
<p>Let’s take a look at what this system can do across industries and use cases:</p>
<p>1. Fine-tuned access control</p>
<p>Now you can tailor access at a granular level and carve out access for specific employees, contractors, and partners so they only get what they need and nothing more.</p>
 
 
 
 A Human Resources employee can access Microsoft 365, Adobe, and Workday, but not Salesforce. 
 A sales team member can access Salesforce, HubSpot, and ZoomInfo, but not HR or financial systems. 
 A contractor can gain temporary access to specific buildings, servers, or relevant tools without being onboarded into your entire system. 
 
 
 
<p>2. No more enrollment hassles</p>
<p>Traditional identity management requires time-consuming enrollment processes, especially for subcontractors and for remote or temporary workers. With Proven Auth, that’s a thing of the past.</p>
 
 
 
 A global enterprise company hiring hundreds of subcontractors doesn’t need to formally onboard each individual. Instead, subcontractors can present their verifiable credentials that their employer issued them based on their role and other pertinent information to identify themselves and are granted instant, policy-driven access — saving your HR and IT teams countless hours. 
 
 
 
<p>3. Compliance and security made simple</p>
<p>Regulatory compliance is easier with Proven Auth because access is governed by real-time policy enforcement.</p>
 
 
 
 A financial services firm can enforce policies that ensure brokers can only sell financial products they are certified for— helping maintain compliance with licensing regulations. 
 A global financial trading firm can set access rules based on jurisdiction, ensuring employees in different countries only access region-appropriate resources. 
 
 
 
<p>4. A more coherent user experience</p>
<p>Employees no longer have to juggle multiple logins and inconsistent access experiences.</p>
 
 
 
 A bank that has 13 different tools available to employees requires a separate login for each. Using Proven Auth with unified credential-based policies, employees can access only the systems relevant to them—with one seamless login experience. 
 
 
 
<p>5. Add biometrics to authentication to defend against deepfakes</p>
<p>For even greater security control, Indicio Proven allows you to combine a biometric template in a Verifiable Credential so you can authenticate biometrics for access without having to worry about storing biometric data. This removes the high risk and complex compliance around storing biometric data and provides a simple way around the risk of deepfakes. The real employee has to present a unique proof, issued only to them, to corroborate that they are who they claim to be.</p>
 
 
 
 An airline creates a biometric template and issues it in a tamper-resistant credential to their pilots to hold securely on their phone. When accessing a restricted area or internal flight system, the pilot simply presents their biometric credential at the same time as a liveness check and the software compares to see if they match.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>This is way cooler than just going passwordless. But, even more importantly, it reduces your security risk and compliance burden, and it also gives you peace of mind against generative AI identity fraud.</p>
 Why Indicio? 
<p>With Proven Auth, you’re not just eliminating passwords—you’re unlocking real business value. Whether you’re managing employees, contractors, or partners, our policy-driven access control makes security seamless and scalable.</p>

<p>What if we told you that “digital trust” would make or break your business in the next five years? That every interaction, from signing on and making a purchase to collaborating with business partners, included a level of digital trust? If that trust is compromised, so are your users, your revenue, and your reputation. At a time when trust is critical to the success of business, trust itself is under attack by deepfakes, AI, and ever-evolving fraud tactics. To answer the challenge, trust itself also needs to evolve. Because trust isn’t simply given—it starts with Zero Trust and must be earned. If you don’t adapt to this digital dynamic, you’ll get left behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Ping Identity, the future we’re helping you build is transformative, yet powerfully simple: Trust Every Digital Moment.</p>

<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Hello, everybody. This is Michael Cichon, chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Rohan Pinto, our chief technology officer at 1Kosmos. Rohan, welcome to the vlog today and congratulations on your new book.</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Hot off the presses January 2025. I’m delighted to have a chance to talk to you about this today. I’ve just started. Full disclosure, I just started to read it, but tell me a little bit about, let’s start at the beginning, the origins, what prompted you to write the book about digital identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely, absolutely. Thank you so much. I have a copy of it right here, and you spoke about the origins, SO I would say, when you have some time, Mike, go through the second page, the preface. It talks about me and my kids and what kind of motivated me as far as my family goes to get the book done. But in all reality, putting family aside and the emotions aside, one reason why I wanted to write the book is because the entire industry has been focused on identity management, and the key word out there is just “identity management”, IAM, identity and access management, identity governance, identity proliferation, and that’s what the focus was. And over a period of time over the years, everybody built fantastic identity management platforms, but all of them were centralized, and centralized systems come with its own set of issues, pros and cons, of course. And then came by a new technology, a new framework that was, of course, initiated by the entire boom and the hype in the industry started off with crypto assets coming into the picture, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>But what fascinated me was the technology. The technology used to launch all these cryptocurrencies or tokens or whatever they want to call it. And the technology was so fascinating, and I said, “Wait a second, this architecture can actually be used for managing identities in a very privacy-preserving manner, following the laws of zero trust and privacy by design, and also enhance the security posture of any organization that needs to deal with identity management and governance within their organization.” So that’s when we came up with the whole idea of building something on the decentralized identity platform or the framework.</p>
<p>However, even after building it and launching it in the market and a bunch of organizations using it day-in and day-out, there’s a huge facet of the industry that didn’t really understand the core concepts of decentralized identities. And I said, “When it comes up to new tech, the number one or the primary go-to-market or the primary task that any organization has to undertake is user education.” If your users don’t understand the tech that they’re working with, that they’re dealing with that applies to them, there would be reluctance both from an adoption standpoint and also from the standpoint of, “Oh my God, where is my data going? Is it going to go on the blockchain? Is it going to go on somebody else’s network? Who’s going to own this data?” There are a million questions that pop into a person’s mind, both from a user standpoint, from the organization standpoint, from the CISO’s perspective, from the CTO’s perspective. So I said the best way to move forward in enabling this industry to embrace decentralized identities is to write a book about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Fascinating. That’s great. Well, you’ve kind of walked up to the second question I had in mind, which was, why now? And you’ve kind of touched on it, but maybe you can expand on that. It seems like there’s this duality where businesses, organizations, individuals need to know with certainty who they’re dealing with online, but then there’s the privacy concerns. Talk a little bit about this balance, if you will, of getting past this built-in anonymity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Anonymization of user data, et cetera. But before I jump into that and talk about the difference between the two, if you look at the book, and even without going through the entire book, if you just go through the table of contents in the book, you would notice that I start with the history of digital identity and then I jump into identity and access management and then I dive into best practices for identity and access management. And then it’s only after that that I jump into topics like trust anchors and sources of truth and the relationship between trust. And finally, towards the end is when I jump into the near future, which talks about the digital identity era.</p>
<p>So it’s not that I’ve written the book with the ideology or with the mindset saying, “Let me just write about decentralized identities.” It is important for someone to understand how identities are managed and governed, what’s the industry used to, and what are the pros and cons of the current approach or methodology before they can learn to appreciate the value that decentralized identities bring into the picture. So I tried to write the book in such a format that it can be read by any non-technical person to understand what the concepts are all about.</p>
<p>There are a few technical chapters as well, because it’s not just for the common man, it’s also for your IT managers and your CISOs and your CTOs too, but it does touch upon both aspects of it. As in, what is identity in the traditional sense of the word? And what does decentralized identity bring to the table and how does one go about implementing it? Which is why the book is split into various parts that talks about centralized identity and then talks about decentralized identity. Because I don’t want to nail a thought in your head out of force. I want users to be able to read, understand, gauge, and determine for themselves if it is something that their organization wants to implement or if it is something of value to the organization, rather than me just writing about decentralized identities without any context and tell people that, “This is important for you,” because nobody’s going to buy into the concept of me telling you that it is important, whereas me giving you proof and information about the difference between the current approach and the new and why this is better would yield better results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, that’s great. I mean, I’ve always thought if you really know something, you can explain it so just about anybody can understand it. It sounds like that’s the approach you took with the book. Let’s just cut right to the heart of it. What are the top three things or the top three takeaways that anybody should know about decentralized identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Okay, I was not expecting that question, but I’m going to try. I’m going to try. I don’t know if I’m going to be able to tell you the top three or the top four or five, but I’ll tell you a few of the top key elements that I want people to take away from this. One is that identity, what is identity? Whether it is a user ID and password that you use to access systems, whether it is my driver’s license or my passport or my birth certificate, what is it that actually comprises my identity?</p>
<p>So I’ve gone into describing what identity means from a user’s perspective. And the reason I went in from the user’s perspective is because if you talk about corporates or organizations, all organizations, I think I mentioned this before in another podcast, that they tend to have this, it’s called the God concept. So if I’m an organization and if I have an active directory or an Oracle database or an LDAP server that contains the credentials for all the employees in my organization, I own it. So I believe that I own facets of your identity, be it your passport data, your email address, phone number, name, date of birth, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the reality is that the only person who needs to own that data in terms of ownership is the user himself. So it is important to draw that differentiation between why decentralized identity puts rights of user data back in the hands of the user with very low friction. So as long as a user owns his data, manages his own data, has the ability to selectively present the data that he wants to present to various institutes or organizations in a privacy-preserving manner, a centralized identity system won’t be able to do it. So that’s where decentralized identity comes in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, great. Now, what is the difference between decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity? Also a term I’ve heard floated around lately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there’s a lot of back and forth in the industry with those two terms. People typically assume that decentralized identity means it’s a self-sovereign identity and vice versa, but it is not.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is the framework or the platform that allows you to store information in several locations without having a central authority controlling it. The whole concept is like a ledger, where you’ve got a trail of when that data was created, when it changed, who changed it, how it changed, what was presented.</p>
<p>Self-sovereign identity sits atop of decentralized identity or sits beside decentralized identity. In the self-sovereign identity world, the user asserts his own identity. So I can tell you that I’m Michael Cichon, I can probably use a deep fake video and hold my phone up to your camera and say, “This is me,” where the user self-asserts his identity attributes or information.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity doesn’t state that decentralized identity only talks about the technology stack on how identities can be managed in a decentralized manner. That does not necessarily mean that the user has got the right to claim to be whoever he or she wants to be. So the decentralized identity framework, I need to prove who I am first before my identity can be asserted and validated. And a good example of that is in our 1Kosmos app, the product that we have at 1Kosmos, you scan your driver’s license and you scan your passport.</p>
<p>Now, I can talk for two hours of what happens behind the scenes when you hold the driver’s license in front of the phone or you scan your passport. It takes only two seconds, but the amount of tech behind it that scans the driver’s license, goes and validates the authenticity of that driver’s license, looks at whether the document itself is real or fake, goes and validates that against sources of truth, which is why my book also talks about trust anchors and sources of truth, goes and validates that against sources of truth like the Department of Motor Vehicles to ensure that the driver’s license is actually valid and it was actually issued to you, correlate that data to the data that’s extracted from the passport, verifying the signatures on the biometric chip on the passport, and that becomes my identity. So I can state that I am Michael Cichon, but the documents that I’m presenting to prove who I am, state that I am Rohan Pinto. So the identity that’s created for me is for the identity extracted from those documents that were presented. So I can never be Michael Cichon.</p>
<p>In the self-sovereign identity world. I can claim to be whoever I want to be. Now, the self-sovereign identity world has also embraced a lot of concepts from the decentralized identity framework itself. So you can claim who you want to be, but once you claim to be someone, you then need to substantiate that claim with proof of identity documents later to make that identity valid. But in our world, you prove who you are first, and that is who you are, rather than me saying I’m somebody else and then using other documents and things like that. So there’s a huge differentiation there.</p>
<p>So one way to look at it is self-sovereign identity, I say I’m Rohan Pinto. Decentralized identity, the province of Ontario says that I’m Rohan Pinto because that’s what’s on my driver’s license, the government of Canada states and asserts that I am Rohan Pinto because that’s the information on my passport. So that’s my identity as opposed to the other one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So in a practical application, decentralized identity allows you to very quickly access a digital service without an artifact, like a password or something and it allows you to preserve that privacy. Like, I control my own data, I determine what I share with any given service at the point that I’m using that service. That’s all well and fine, but this is one organization at a time, right? How far off are we? Where, if you will, I have a QR code and I’m the QR code, and wherever I go, it just recognizes me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, very interesting question. Very valid question. And you touched upon a very important topic out here. When we first built this product or the platform, the focus was all on the term decentralized identity and blockchain, I’m talking about the product and the platform at 1Kosmos, and almost everybody said, “Oh my God, this is absolutely awesome.”</p>
<p>Now, once you build some awesome tech and you want to go to market with it, the first question that pops into mind is, “Where do I use it?” So I have a decentralized identity with me right now, but where do I use it? “Can I go and shop on Amazon with it?” And the answer is no, because Amazon doesn’t consume it yet. “Can I go to eBay and buy something?” Oh, no, you can’t do that yet. All those examples that you gave and those use cases and the demos that you gave last month where you were explaining consent and you were talking about things like selective disclosure where you can go to a liquor store and present your decentralized identity to prove that you’re over 19 without divulging information like my date of birth or my home address, brilliant use case, but can I do it in reality? And you say, “Oh, no, you can’t do it yet.” So the big problem is adoption.</p>
<p>So you can distribute a decentralized identity, whether it’s on a mobile phone or on a laptop or any which way you want to all the 8 billion people on this planet, but if there’s no place that they can actually put it to good use, the value in that is zero. Because as great as the technology stack is, if you can’t put it to use, there’s no value in it. So we took another approach. Instead of trying to convince 8 billion people on this planet on how awesome this tech is, we said, “Let’s go the top-down approach. Let’s go to organizations and look at their current security posture, tell them the pros and cons in their current approach, talk to them about where the industry is headed, talk to them about the technologies that are going to come into play very soon, and show them how they can proactively circumvent all the security issues, the hacks, the breaches, the phishing attempts that they would have to deal with over a period of time before it happens rather than after it happens.”</p>
<p>The number one mistake that I have noticed in this industry is that everybody is reactive rather than being proactive, so one of the primary focuses that 1Kosmos had when they went out to market is putting a solution out there that enables organizations to be proactive rather than reactive. So when organizations start embracing this technology and enabling their employees, their customers, their partners to access their digital assets or systems using a decentralized identity, the employees or the customers and the partners and every user says, “Wow, it was that simple. I did not have to provide a user ID anywhere. I don’t have to remember passwords anymore. I don’t get OTP codes via SMS anymore.” And we know OTP via SMS is really weak, but this podcast is not about talking how bad the current systems are, but rather talk about the value that decentralized identity brings to the table. So when you take the top-down approach where organizations release this as a feature to all their employees, they say, “Wow, this is great.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>And then they look at another service that has also embraced and implemented decentralized identity platforms and they say, “Fantastic. Now I do not have to go from Service A to Service B and create another user ID and password and then go to Service C and create another user account out there. I can literally take my digital identity and go from A to B to C whenever I want.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>It’s fascinating, because what you’re describing sounds like, number one, a tectonic shift in using artifacts to prove who you are, artifacts like a password, versus using yourself as an authenticator. And at the same time, there’s some tipping point, whether it’s, as we look at the Fortune Global 500, make a move toward this technology, the Global 1000, you start to see federal agencies, state local agencies doing it. At some point, there is this tipping point, and I personally look forward to that at a time where I’m recognized it’s very difficult for anybody to fake my identity, cause me fraud, cause the organizations that I transact with fraud.</p>
<p>It’s fascinating and equally fascinating, Rohan, is this, for many, is a new topic, but we did more than stumble on it back in 2016 when the rates of the company were placed. 1Kosmos was incorporated in 2018. I know you’re a couple of years ahead of that. So literally nine years ahead of the trend, you dove into this. So that’s a remarkable accomplishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Thank you. Thank you, Mike. But I wouldn’t say we stumbled on it or I didn’t stumble on it either, because I’ve been playing in the identity management space or been working in the identity management space for decades. I have been working in the cryptographic and the PKI space for decades. And way back in early 2000, I would say around the 2009, 2010, 2011, when there were small discussions in pockets about, “Oh my God, Bitcoin. Have you heard about Bitcoin?” That’s when my interest in the technology stack started increasing, and it started increasing exponentially because the minute I saw the tech stack that Bitcoin ran over and how other platforms like Ethereum or Solana or Tron started adopting the same technology, not the same for end-to-end, that’s when I said, “Well, this is a very, very efficient way to manage a system.”</p>
<p>The initial thought process was very basic, Michael, very, very basic. And the thought process was, what’s the cost of managing 1000 users in an organization? I am not talking about the investment an organization has in active directory or LDAP or Oracle. The cost of managing those users is that you need to store their credentials somewhere. You need to have access governance rules that govern who has got access to that. And the industry does not know what to do with it, so they come up with six alphanumeric, then they make it eight alphanumeric with numbers, then they made it 12. I’ve seen instances where the passwords is almost 24 alphanumeric characters with special characters, cannot be used three times. I mean, the industry is coming up with all kinds of permutations and combinations to make it harder for the user to remember who he is or she is. It should not be so hard.</p>
<p>Also, the cost of the organization managing that identity is quite huge because it’s not just about storing a user ID and password somewhere, it’s also about the cost of all these other systems that you need to build over it to ensure things like data breaches, password changes, password resets, it’s not hacked, it’s not phished. And you can literally eliminate all that by putting a user’s identity on this little device that you carry.</p>
<p>Let’s look at scale right now. So instead of having a million users sitting in a database and you incurring costs to manage those million users, you now distribute those million identities or identity data to a million users on a million devices. So let’s go down to the grassroots. If you hack a centralized system that has a million user IDs and passwords, regardless if the passwords are clear text assaulted, you have access to a million user IDs and passwords. And that’s the number one breach that goes on today. We hear it all the time. “TechCrunch was hacked, 1000 user IDs compromised. This one was hacked, a million users compromised. 10 million user IDs compromised out here.” It happens day-in and day-out almost every single day. Now, imagine you want to hack an organization where a million identities are stored on a million users own devices. You’ll need to hack a million devices.</p>
<p>And then the added layer of security on top of it is biometrics. So when you add biometrics on top of decentralized identity, stealing my phone is not going to give you access to my identity data. You need me because I need to unlock my device with my biometrics. And it is not a static biometric like scan a photograph. You’re talking about live ID where you ensure that the person is a real person by expecting the user to express human emotions like smile or blink or move your head. We also do depth calculations on the user’s biometrics, for example, the depth between the ears and the nose and the chin, et cetera. So the entire stack is so technically advanced from a technology standpoint, but from a usability standpoint, it’s as simple as pick up the phone, look at it, and you’re done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right, Well, the time for this is now, in fact, it’s probably a few years past already as all these data breaches, we have now nation states attacking individuals and organizations at will equipped with all this data breach information. And you see it every day in the phone calls, the text messages, the emails that you get that are phony, trying to get you to click on a link and compromise yourself. I could talk to you at length on this. It’s a fascinating topic. I’ve got a dozen questions in my mind I’d like to talk to you about now, but we’re kind of running out of time. Very much appreciate you spending 20, 30 minutes with me this morning. Your book’s fascinating. I’m going to be digging into it more deeply. Just really appreciate it. Any parting thoughts? Again, I’ve got a dozen, but I don’t want to get into them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So parting thought is not simple. A lot of people say that the time is now. I think the time was yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>If you are trying to build a better security posture for your organization, if you have not done it already, then the time is now. Do you want to consider yourself to be a proactive organization or a reactive organization? Do you want to deal with the fines and the levies by the governing bodies for leaking user information or privacy data? The impact it’s going to have when you have a weak security posture is very, very expensive.</p>
<p>So for those organizations and people who have not yet embraced decentralized identity within the organization, the time is now. But a lot of organizations have already embraced it. Even organizations and entities like MasterCard, Visa Card, Microsoft are all there already. But we still proudly say that we were the first, because we were the first. There are a lot of players in the market out here, but we also had the first mover advantage, because any organization building something on the decentralized identity platform or framework, they don’t build it once and it’s done. They evolve. They evolve all the time.</p>
<p>You’ve got to look at current market trends, you’ve got to look at current threats, you’ve got to ensure that all threats from an operating system standpoint, from a usability standpoint are all addressed. So you’re constantly building on top of it. So being the first to market gives us that ability to be on top of all the security threats and start addressing those as well, rather than being a new entrant in the market and starting off with decentralized identity now as opposed to an organization that has been doing it for the last five, six years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Well, I think that’s fair and I think we’ve seen it in the customer growth here at 1Kosmos where we’re seeing organizations with literally hundreds of thousands of employees, and I don’t know the exact count, but tens of thousands of authentications daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Millions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>The scalability is proven there. And I think whether it’s a law of nature or not, the most simple, straightforward solution is probably the best solution. And the built-in complexity we’ve seen in identity systems has come from the fact that we didn’t have this technology before. We’ve had passwords that had to be protected, and then anti-phishing and all these defenses that had to be built up over time because we didn’t have a decentralized identity. Now that we have it, we can take a more simplified cost-effective approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. And one more thing I would like to add, Michael. Every time I say decentralized identity, I have a tendency to pick up my phone and say, “Okay, this is where your identity is stored.” It’s just a habit because our initial launch was actually building it and ensuring that it’s on a device that the user owns. But as of today, your decentralized identity does not necessarily need to be on your phone. It can be on your device, it can be on your laptop, it can be on your desktop as well. So for organizations that mandate no phones in a particular area, like white room use cases, you can actually still enable decentralized identity and biometrics based authentication into your password-less systems without using your phone as well, because you can do it directly from your desktops now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right. Well, keep adding last points here. One thing you mentioned in the past we touch on now, though, is that the standards bodies have caught up in terms of the frameworks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Just a little fragment on those if you would, please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Oh, very simple. One of the most important standards body is NIST. The most important. And NIST has got a spec called the 800-63-3A, which everybody follows, that talked about the levels of assurance that need to be associated with that identity from an anonymous identity, which is a level one, to a proved identity, which is a level two, and then a higher level.</p>
<p>NIST, in fact, just published their 800-63-4 very recently. And if you look at the specification, if you have the time and the effort and the patience to read through the entire spec document that NIST has published, you will realize that this is something that we already did six years ago. Therefore, that itself is quite a good indicator that all the governing bodies, the regulations, are also catching up because they know that this technology is going to be adopted by anybody and everybody. All organizations are moving forward and they are publishing governance rules and regulations to make sure that organizations implement it with the right mindset, with the right thought process, which is, it’s not about “Let’s build something and make money,” but it’s all about, “Let’s build something that to ensure that user’s privacy and the user’s own consent is mandated and required and safeguarded.” So the focus out here is still the privacy of the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Got it. Well, I think, in addition to that, it’s a great way to create efficiencies and in particular government efficiencies, and we’re going to leave it at that roll on.

<p>Identity proofing, or identity verification, is the process of verifying that someone is who they say they are. It ensures that the claimed digital identity exists in the real world and that the person claiming it is an authorized representative for that identity.</p>  
<p>Historically, Identity proofing is commonly performed by organizations as part of an onboarding process before or alongside the issuing of authentication credentials to access digital systems. Often, this is done with in-office visits or a series of manually performed steps.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why is Identity Proofing Needed?  
<p>Identity proofing is necessary to help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, identity fraud, data breaches, and other malicious activities to your services and sensitive data. Compared to authentication, which focuses on the ownership of the user credentials, identity proofing ensures that the individual holding the credentials is truly who they claims to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Address Identity Risks When It Matters The Most  
<p>Identity risks occur throughout the customer or employee identity lifecycle. Many companies apply identity proofing at the time of new account opening or employee hire and neglect other key moments of increased risk. Adversaries targeting credentials do not merely stop at trying to impersonate or intercept at the time of onboarding.</p> 
<p>Threat actors frequently target weak links in the authentication chain, including account recovery and day-to-day activities. Modern identity proofing should be user journey-oriented and adaptable beyond initial onboarding to ensure the highest continuous protection against identity fraud.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=144955ed-0aee-4519-80f5-8538b0cfd4c0&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Candidate Fraud&nbsp;  
<p>Potential candidates may misrepresent their qualifications and experience by using fake documents or references during the interview process to increase their chances of being hired by a company.</p> 
<p>The growing trend of remote work combined with AI technology has also made it easier for imposters to create deepfake videos of the candidate, AI-generated voices, resumes, and use interview proxies to game the interview system. This is why <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/candidate-verification-onboarding">candidate verification</a> is becoming increasingly important for HR teams.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is, in fact, the person that was interviewed for the role.</p> 
 Credential Resets / Account Recovery  
<p>Credential reset processes occur for a variety of reasons, such as when a user loses their mobile device or forgets their access information. Organizations typically expect professionals to call into their company helpdesk and generally verify the individual through familiarity with one another, secret questions, and loose identifiers such as their employee ID.</p> 
<p>Attackers can increasingly exploit these flaws with social engineering, deepfake attacks, and advanced voice AI to trick IT teams into providing new credentials. Modern identity proofing techniques seek to address the challenges of a global workforce and equip support teams with the ability to correctly identify that the person seeking access is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>Employees may need elevated privileges as they gain responsibility in an organization. Organizations must first ensure both the employee’s change in role and identity before granting access to systems and data previously out of reach. These best practices help defend against unauthorized access and data breaches targeted at these important career moments.</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>Other situations may arise where an employee triggers a behavior that seems suspicious or there are indications of elevated risk to an organization. For example, an organization may require identity proofing after an employee attempts to access the network from an unexpected location, at an unusual time, or if threats have been flagged by security tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Does Identity Proofing Work?  
<p>NIST defines identity proofing primarily in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">Special Publication 800-63A</a>, detailing the process of verifying an individual’s identity with evidence provided by the applicant. Historically, the methods primarily used include in-person verification against a government-issued document, the user’s ability to convey knowledge-based answers about themselves, or to answer secret questions created at an earlier time with the company.</p> 
<p>Depending on the level of access and privileges of the user, companies may combine multiple steps to further challenge an end user. This is often not user-centric and can lead to significant friction or challenges to reach successful verification.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NIST defines different Identity Assurance Levels (IALs) such as IAL1 for minimal verification and IAL2 and IAL3 for more stringent procedures to be used for more risk-based and privileged access needs.</p> 
<p>Modern identity proofing seeks to consider the user’s privileges and access requirements and provides the seamless ability to challenge the user into providing expected data.</p> 
<p>Orchestrating a user journey through identity proofing should take the user on a path that requires an appropriate and efficient amount of context switching, few or no requirements to download various software or tools to proceed, and should seek to cause minimal disruption to the action which they are then seeking to perform.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Different Types of Modern Identity Proofing Explained  
<p>Organizations typically combine different types of identity proofing since each type offers different levels of trust and security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Identity documents can be stolen, altered, or forged by malicious actors. To mitigate these risks, organizations employ various technologies to digitally verify the validity of a document, such as a government-issued ID passport, driver’s license, or military ID card.&nbsp;</p> 
 Biometric Identity Verification  
<p>Another method of identity proofing is through identifying distinct physical or behavioral characteristics. These can include fingerprints, voice patterns, or facial features, keystroke patterns, or mouse movements.</p> 
<p>Since biometrics are typically more difficult to fake or forge than document verification, their verification delivers a higher level of trust – and are often combined with other <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-verification-vs-authentication">identity verification methods</a> such as document verification.&nbsp;</p> 
 Video Verification  
<p>Video verification is executed through a live video conference and involves prompts and actions aimed at verifying a user's liveness while identifying any signs of spoofing or coercion. It may also include document verification to confirm that the person in the government-issued ID is the same as the one in the video.&nbsp;</p> 
 Knowledge-Based Verification (KBV)  
<p>Knowledge-based verification involves asking an individual personal information that only they can potentially answer, such as where they went to high school, the name of a pet, or a 2FA code.&nbsp;</p> 
 Familiarity-Based Verification (FBV)  
<p>Familiarity-based verification is the act in which a user is further verified by their administrators through familiarity in interaction. In the case of in-person visitation, seeing an individual they have previously seen before or hearing from a new individual with detailed insight about their common connections and working environment helps to strengthen an administrator's level of trust about an individual seeking verification.</p> 
<p>In a remote environment, the individual, being an existing colleague, may provide helpful clues to FBV. At the same time, in a remote environment, these clues can potentially be false positives that threat actors heavily focus on to build trust.&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Proofing for Customers and the Workforce  
<p>While identity proofing for customers and the workforce share many similarities and methods, there are a few key differences:</p> 
  
  Goal: <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">Workforce identity proofing</a> ensures that access to sensitive data is only granted to authorized individuals. Customer identity proofing typically focuses on the verification of identity to meet compliance and prevent fraud.&nbsp;  
  Compliance: Workforce and customer identity proofing are governed by different regulations. For example, KYE and NIST guidelines pertain primarily to employee verification. On the other hand, KYC and AML rules apply to customer identity proofing.  
  Frequency: Workforce identity proofing should be continuous to ensure it defends against risk throughout the identity lifecycle. Customer identity proofing is typically executed at a particular point in time, such as account creation.&nbsp;  
  
 Lessons from Real-World Applications  
<p>The risks from insufficient identity proofing are widespread and growing, yet underscore its importance and need at all stages of the employee lifecycle. &nbsp;<br><br>Recent examples include:&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The MGM Attack</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">recent MGM attack</a> is a prime example of how attackers impersonated an employee, convinced help desk personnel to reset account credentials, and eventually gained full access to IT systems, exfiltrating highly sensitive data. The attack cost the resort group over $100 million and disrupted operations for days.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fake IT hires from North Korea.</p> 
<p>The FBI has issued multiple warnings about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-weapons-program-it-workers-f3df7c120522b0581db5c0b9682ebc9b">fake IT workers from North Korea</a> posing as U.S.-based contract workers. Thousands have been hired by U.S. companies, sending their paychecks to North Korea to fund its ballistic missile programs.</p> 
<p>They were able to fake their identities using a combination of forged documents, social media profiles, third parties, and proxy servers. Most recently, the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123">FBI warned</a> that such imposters are exfiltrating data and proprietary code and extorting victim companies to pay a ransom.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Remote workers that fail identity verification.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">HYPR uncovered its own version of a fake IT worke</a>r when a contractor hired through an IT service firm failed identity verification during his onboarding. First, a location check did not match the information he had provided.</p> 
<p>Second, discrepancies were found between the passport photo and the face scan during the biometric verification. Finally, the new hire refused to turn on his camera for the video verification, claiming technical issues. The candidate then abruptly ceased contact and informed the contracting firm that he had found another position.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The last example illustrates the importance of a multi-layered approach to identity proofing during both the hiring and onboarding processes. This comprehensive approach may help mitigate North Korean IT worker scams as well. A trigger requiring additional identity verification for escalated privileges may have mitigated the MGM attack.&nbsp;</p> 
 
   
    
    
    
  
  
 How Identity Proofing Delivers Tangible ROI for Your Organization  
<p>The rise of hybrid and remote work, cloud and AI technology demands that organizations turn to identity proofing to secure their data and IT infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Other benefits of identity proofing include:</p> 
  
  Reduce financial losses from fraud and breaches that often lead to reputational damage and a loss in customer trust.  
  Lower compliance costs by meeting regulatory requirements.  
  Enhance operational efficiency with automated identity proofing  
  Improve customer trust and retention with secure onboarding and remote ID proofing.&nbsp;  
  Accelerate employee productivity with user-friendly verification and an easy user experience. &nbsp;  
  
 Compliance Considerations for Secure Identity Verification  
<p>Identity proofing helps organizations meet a wide range of standards and regulations, including:</p> 
  
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines. NIST SP 800-63 establishes a framework for the process of digital identity that includes digital proofing and authentication. It defines three different Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) based on the identity proofing process and level of risk.&nbsp;  
  Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). KYC offers a comprehensive framework for verifying customers’ identities and is required by financial institutions. The goal of these regulations is to ensure that the source of funding is legitimate and does not originate from illegal means.  
  Know Your Employee (KYE). <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-to-strengthen-know-your-employee-kye">KYE is a process</a> that includes identity verification, background checks, and employment authorization verification. It helps ensure employee identity not only during the hiring and onboarding process but throughout the employee’s tenure.  
  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA identity verification ensures an individual has legal access to personal health information (PHI) through in-person, telephone, or electronic methods. It does not, however, prescribe a specific method for identity verification.&nbsp;  
  Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The FFIEC requires financial institutions to establish a specific process for identity verification. This approach includes risk-based authentication methods, multi-factor authentication (MFA), customer authentication and identity proofing, and compliance with other regulations related to fraud prevention and identity management such as the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and the Customer Identification Program (CIP).  
  Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF sets global standards for identity proofing in the context of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF), using NIST’s risk-based approach to define assurance levels for identity proofing. It also requires financial institutions to implement comprehensive customer due diligence (CDD) and includes guidance on digital identity systems for this purpose.&nbsp;  
  Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). <a href="https://sarbanes-oxley-act.com/">SOX is a federal law</a> that regulates financial reporting and auditing for public companies in the United States. Elements of Sarbanes-Oxley also cover authentication and identity proofing with respect to the need for companies to have robust security measures in place to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive financial data.&nbsp;  
  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=dae06fbd-00af-4edd-bff8-a4548b253843&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Implementing Identity Proofing: Mapping Out Your Use Cases&nbsp;  
<p>A multi-layered approach to identity proofing allows organizations to implement different user identification methods based on the use case and level of risk. Different use cases may also require adhering to different regulations or standards, depending on the industry.&nbsp;</p> 
 Balancing UX with Risk&nbsp;  
<p>Avoid an overly strict approach that rejects legitimate candidates or employees who gained more responsibility and access to sensitive data. At the same time, an approach that is too loose allows fraudulent users to slip through and pose a risk to your organization.</p> 
<p>For example, a multi-layered approach allows you to combine documentation verification with biometric verification to reduce friction as much as possible while at the same time allowing stronger verification for use cases that present higher risk situations.&nbsp;</p> 
 Integrate and Test with Existing Systems and Processes  
<p>After mapping your existing systems, identify any security gaps or weaknesses. Run through different user scenarios to understand where you need identity proofing in the user journey (e.g., at login for a bank account, before continuing the interview process for an employee).</p> 
<p>Run extensive pilot tests to evaluate the integration’s ability to deliver a seamless and frictionless experience while ensuring security. Mapping existing systems and testing integrations helps to ensure that the identity proofing implementation strategy you choose is the one that aligns with your organization’s operational needs.</p> 
 Educate Your Stakeholders  
<p>Offer adequate support and training to employees to ensure that the identity proofing process is used effectively and how it specifically ensures the organization adheres to different legal and industrial regulations.</p> 
<p>Make sure stakeholders clearly understand the benefit that identity proofing can bring to the organization, such as a reduced risk of cybersecurity attacks and subsequent monetary fines, increased operational efficiency, and a faster, more secure employee interview or onboarding process.&nbsp;</p> 
 Monitor and Adapt Over Time  
<p>As threats evolve, the identity proofing process will change to meet the increasing security demands. Organizations must continuously adapt to changing technology, emerging threats, and updated compliance requirements on how identity proofing can help them defend against these threats and help them adhere to the latest regulations.&nbsp;</p> 
 How to Choose an Identity Proofing Solution  
<p>When considering implementing an identity proofing solution, your organization should ensure that it:</p> 
  
  Offers automated, continuous identity verification in real-time.  
  Validates the identity of the person, not just the user, by integrating multiple verification factors dynamically and contextually throughout the user session.  
  Focuses on a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/user-experience">frictionless user experience </a>without compromising security.  
  Helps you adhere to the latest compliance requirements such as KYC, AML, and KYE and avoid monetary penalties.  
  Can be used for remote employees.  
  Monitors and updates its processes and security regularly to meet evolving threats, changing technology, and the dynamic regulatory landscape.&nbsp;

<p>Formal Verification: Move supports formal verification, allowing developers to mathematically prove the correctness of their smart contracts. This enhances the reliability and security of payment processing applications4.</p>
 
 
<p>Parallel Execution: Move is designed to support parallel execution, enabling Sui to process multiple transactions concurrently. This significantly improves throughput and reduces latency, leading to faster payment processing5.</p>
 
 
<p>Flexibility and Composability: Move allows developers to define custom data structures and create complex interactions between smart contracts. This flexibility enables the development of innovative payment solutions tailored to specific needs6.</p>
 
 
<p>Security and Safety: Move incorporates strong security features to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks and unauthorized access to funds. This enhances the security of payment transactions and protects user assets5.</p>
 
 
 Traditional Payment Processing Compute Resources and Sui Blockchain Mapping 



Traditional Resource
Sui Equivalent
Move Contract Potential




Point of Sale (POS) System
Sui Wallet, dApps
Smart contracts can facilitate secure and instant payment processing at the POS, integrating with existing POS systems or creating new decentralized POS solutions. For example, a retail store could use a Sui-based POS system to accept payments directly from customers' Sui Wallets, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction fees7.


Encryption Layer
Sui's cryptography primitives
Move's security features and Sui's object-centric model can be leveraged to create secure encryption layers for protecting sensitive payment data. Smart contracts can be used to encrypt payment information before it is transmitted, ensuring confidentiality and preventing unauthorized access8.


Payment Gateway
Sui-based payment gateways
Smart contracts can be used to build decentralized payment gateways that facilitate secure and efficient routing of payments across different platforms. These gateways can automate payment authorization, settlement, and reconciliation processes, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency9.


Decryption Layer
Sui's cryptography primitives
Similar to the encryption layer, Move smart contracts can be used to create secure decryption layers for authorized access to payment data. This ensures that only authorized parties, such as the merchant or the acquiring bank, can decrypt and access the payment information10.


Fraud Monitoring &amp; Detection System
On-chain fraud detection modules
Smart contracts can be designed to analyze transaction patterns and identify potentially fraudulent activities in real-time. By monitoring transaction data for anomalies, such as unusual spending patterns or suspicious account activity, these modules can help prevent fraud and protect users11.


Payment Processor

<p>Written by Charlene Migwe — Director of the Mastercard Foundation Partnership at Caribou, Emmanuel Khisa — Africa Director at CDPI, Diana Sang — Regional Director for Africa at DIAL, Linet Kwamboka — Senior Program Manager at&nbsp;GPSDD</p><p>Digital public infrastructure (DPI) is transforming service delivery, economic participation, and governance across&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>But without well-designed governance frameworks, these systems risk reinforcing exclusion, limiting public trust, and failing to deliver true public&nbsp;value.</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://conference.openinstitute.africa/">East Africa Data Governance conference</a>, Caribou — in collaboration with <a href="https://dial.global/">Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL)</a>, <a href="https://cdpi.dev/">Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure (CDPI)</a> and the <a href="https://www.data4sdgs.org/">Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD)</a> — hosted the panel “Governance by design for impact: Putting society at the center of digital public infrastructure and data exchange.” The panel explored strategies to prevent DPI and data exchange from causing widespread structural exclusion, emphasizing the need for effective governance to maximize public benefit. Discussions also covered practical approaches for developing metrics to assess and ensure the positive impact of DPI on people’s&nbsp;lives.</p><blockquote>“The emphasis should be on technology for the good of society, rather than technology for the benefit of the government or revenue generation. Benefit to government such as improved revenue should be dividends of a citizen centred technology”<br>Emmanuel&nbsp;Khisa</blockquote> Key takeaways  Practical ways to prevent structural exclusion <p>To prevent structural exclusion in digital systems, it is crucial to include all stakeholders, not just those at the implementation level. A key example is the open data platform in Kenya, which initially focused on data supply from the government but missed involving those who would use the data, such as developers, technologists, and researchers. A conscious decision to involve civil society organizations led to steady growth and community involvement. This highlights the importance of understanding stakeholder roles and ensuring stakeholders’ active participation.</p>  Design should be with the citizen in mind, focusing on value from and to citizens. It’s crucial to balance governmental institutional value, such as efficiency and improved revenue, with public value and citizen engagement. The emphasis should be on technology for the good of society rather than society for the benefit of the government or revenue generation. This ensures that DPI initiatives genuinely serve the public interest and contribute to societal well-being.  Keep digital public interest top of mind. Digital infrastructure should be viewed from a digital public interest lens, rather than from the perspective of an individual organization or government. Standardizing processes and policies ensures efficiency, interoperability, and equal access. Shared infrastructure is essential, with a whole-of-government approach. By adopting this perspective, resources can be used more efficiently and redundancy can be minimized.  Engagement should occur at every level, working through civil society and community-based organizations. While public policymaking processes ideally involve people at all levels, being truly people-centric is challenging. It involves cost, time, workforce communication, and reach implications. Special attention should be given to marginalized groups, including those without written languages. Explaining concepts like consent requires addressing varying levels of digital and data literacy.  Trust is the currency for data exchange and flow. From the outset, DPI design, implementation, and governance, especially in data exchange platforms, must prioritize trust. Governance should be integrated from the beginning to ensure proper mechanisms are in place and systemic risks are prevented. This proactive approach is essential for building and maintaining public confidence in digital&nbsp;systems.   AI and&nbsp;DPI <p>As AI continues to advance, DPI must be at the center of its growth to support its development while ensuring responsible data governance and user-centric design and architecture. Lessons from the <a href="https://ict.go.ke/sites/default/files/2025-01/Kenya%20National%20AI%20Strategy%20(Draft)%20for%20Public%20Validation%20%20%5B14-01-2025%5D.pdf">Kenya National AI Strategy 2025–2030</a> drafting process highlight the importance of inclusive policymaking, where key stakeholders — including telecommunications companies, multinationals, civil society, and academia — collaborate to shape AI strategies. For AI to serve diverse communities effectively, DPI must provide a robust foundation, enabling secure data access, interoperability, and shared infrastructure. Standardized governance processes are essential to guide AI innovation while safeguarding privacy, promoting ethical AI use, and ensuring that technological advancements deliver real public value without reinforcing structural exclusions.</p> Measuring impact <p>When evaluating the impact of DPI, the key question should be: Is it extractive, or does it genuinely benefit citizens? Measuring the impact of DPI should be viewed through the lens of the people it is intended to serve. Instead of measuring success based on outputs such as the number of IDs issued or accounts opened, the focus should shift to how DPI is transforming lives, expanding rights, and enabling citizens to achieve their aspirations and driving economic and social progress. To effectively measure DPI’s impact, several critical areas should be considered:</p><p>✅ Trust and governance — Strong data protection policies, public awareness, and transparent data control are key indicators of a DPI system that prioritizes citizen&nbsp;rights.</p><p>✅ Inclusion and accessibility — Are citizens able to connect and meaningfully engage with services? Metrics like broadband access and mobile penetration help assess whether DPI is reaching the people it intends to&nbsp;serve.</p><p>✅ Economic and social impact — DPI should fuel entrepreneurship and innovation. Measuring how many businesses have launched or scaled, who the businesses serve, and how these impact citizens due to integrated government data platforms can reveal DPI’s broader economic&nbsp;value.</p><p>For DPI measurement to be meaningful, stakeholders must develop a common terminology and shared understanding of impact metrics, much like how the mobile industry universally uses, for example, “average revenue per user.” The African context must guide the creation of relevant and people-centered metrics that truly reflect DPI’s success in empowering communities — for example, evaluating digital identity with metrics that are recognized across different regions and countries. It is important to define metrics that are impactful and relevant to the African context, ensuring that the metrics used reflect what impact really means to the&nbsp;people.</p> Conclusion <p>Building inclusive and effective DPI requires a multi-stakeholder approach that prioritizes public value, trust, and accessibility. Structural exclusion can be prevented by actively engaging civil society, the private sector, and marginalized communities, ensuring that digital systems serve diverse needs rather than reinforce inequalities. This goes hand in hand with measuring DPI’s success to determine impact, which should go beyond numbers to reflect real-life impact, from economic empowerment to expanded rights and opportunities. By fostering collaboration, transparency, and shared understanding of impact, DPI can drive meaningful digital transformation that benefits all citizens.</p><p>Authors:</p>  Emmanuel Khisa — Africa Director, Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure  Linet Kwamboka — Senior Manager–Data4Now, Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data  Diana Sang — Africa Director, Digital Impact&nbsp;Alliance  Charlene Migwe, Director of the Mastercard Foundation Learning Partnership, Caribou   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/governing-digital-infrastructure-for-impact-key-lessons-and-future-directions-e9b32d87e2de">Governing Digital Public Infrastructure for Impact: Key Lessons and Future directions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this 4-part series, we are introducing our work on multi-capital models. The overall aim is to develop a tangible framework to connect contextual knowledge and value flows to systemic finance and decision making cycles. That might sound slightly abstract at first but this work is refreshingly tangible and grounded in placed-based partnerships. To bring the concept to life, we have divided this publication into four sections, tracing the journey of our work from an exploratory study in the city of Amsterdam through to our current strategic focus.</p>  In Part 1 we look at the net value created via different approaches to climate adaptation in the city of Amsterdam, in the context of systemic financing.  In Part 2 we will unpack some of the challenges, questions and opportunities that repeatedly surface in relation to multi-capital models, across the wider portfolio of our&nbsp;work.  Part 3 will explore the city specific challenges and opportunities that we are engaging with in diverse contexts. This includes emerging insights from supporting cities across Europe with their financing plans (such as those in the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral Cities by 2030) and the nature-as-infrastructure pilots that we have collaborated on in Stuttgart and&nbsp;Glasgow.  Finally, in part 4 we will shift to look at our emerging work with the Bioregional Community and how the earlier learnings are weaving with this&nbsp;context.   Part 1 — Towards multi-capital models: embedding an integrated approach into climate adaptation financing <blockquote>“The real news is that we are now leaving a state of permanent denial — pretending that everybody will respect the Paris Agreement — to listening to what experts, climate specialists, the UN, the IPCC say” — <a href="https://www.edelmanglobaladvisory.com/insights/france-plans-for-4C-warming-by-2100">Christophe Béchu</a>, Minister for Ecological Transition France</blockquote><p>A +4 degree future is now being widely considered as a possible scenario. Weather and climate related economic damages are estimated at EUR 738 billion in the period 1980–2023, whilst less than 20% were privately insured¹. These costs are expected to quadruple under a mid-range climate scenario by 2050². In short, climate adaptation (whilst continuing to drive mitigation efforts) is critical and the longer we wait the more devastating and costly the consequences will be. Unfortunately there is a growing recognition that the integration of mitigation and adaptation measures is extremely difficult to achieve in practice. We all know the headline issues and we talk about needing an integrated response. But are we actually working in that way? In our work with Mission cities (the focus of Blog 3 in this series), it is evident that mitigation and adaptation are often handled by different municipal teams working to discrete budgets, funding streams, priorities, timelines and metrics. What would an integrated approach mean in tangible terms? What kind of holistic political mandate and governance shifts would be required? Given that this is a whole-of society challenge it requires looking beyond municipalities to a multi-actor approach: what contracts, financial instruments and collaborations would be required? How would we assess the distribution of risks or negotiate sharing liabilities? Who should pay for the costs of systemic coordination?</p><p>There are pioneering examples of cities striving to embed responses to these (and many other) questions into their institutional infrastructure. For example, the Climate City Capital Hub instigated by the NetZeroCities consortium and European Investment Bank³, the Viable Cities Transition Lab in Sweden⁴ and the Global Center on Adaptation in the Netherlands⁵. In parallel to these efforts, we also recognise a high demand for practical, grounded methodologies that can be customised and embedded into everyday practices. In our view, expansive dialogues are important, but until we put numbers on the elements that we are discussing, it will be extremely difficult to act decisively.</p><p>In collaboration with the Municipality of Amsterdam and <a href="https://stipo.nl/?lang=en">Stipo</a>, we set out to explore the challenges outlined above using a hypothetical case study district in the city of Amsterdam. This is a new field with few precedents but the urgency of the response requires bold, innovative action. Doing nothing no longer exists as a low risk option. We would emphasise that this is not an exact science and we are learning and iterating our approach along the way. It is important to highlight that this work extends across many strands of our ecosystem, weaving the contextual expertise of colleagues from our City Transitions, Material Zero and Nature as Infrastructure Arcs with the financial and economic capabilities of our Next Economics and Capital Systems Labs. We are sharing the outputs of this work with the aspiration of inspiring compound learning and collaborative action. Who or what is already out there that we can learn from? Are there robust examples of scalable, multi-stakeholder climate adaptation efforts? If you have ideas for how multi-capital approaches can be uplifted and accelerated, we invite you to add your comments here so that the conversation and connections are visible to all interested partners. We will expand on the theme of multi-capital models, including how we are using them in practice and why we think they are so critical, in the next blog in this&nbsp;series.</p> Developing a speculative case study area based on an archetypal district of Amsterdam <p>Global costs of climate damage are estimated to be €16m per hour. That equates to approximately £267k since you started reading this article. This sounds worrying but what does it mean in relation to a street or local business? Can you imagine what would happen if the city you live in or know best was subject to extreme heat, flooding or drought? What services or conveniences that you currently take for granted would be lost? Who would be most vulnerable and what might happen to them? It’s very difficult to ground our understanding of risk and costs without talking about real contexts⁶. In response to this disconnect, we decided to develop a case study based on a hypothetical area of Amsterdam, to illustrate the likely risks, costs and potential opportunities.</p>Developing a hypothetical case study&nbsp;area<p>Although the scenario is speculative, the forecast social and economic costs that it portrays are very real. In the years ahead Amsterdam faces a set of complex adaptation challenges and the potential consequences of inaction are alarming. Based on an archetypal area of 0.27km2 we used publicly available data to map and analyse the expected buildings, infrastructure and demographics within it. As the area is approximately 1/800th of Amsterdam’s spatial footprint we can roughly consider any impact as being magnified by 800 in relation to the whole City. We then used geospatial mapping, climate scenario models, probability risk distributions, hazard maps and economic statistics to develop a base case and a number of climate related scenarios. As an overview the key drivers for the calculations were as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>(a) Specific&nbsp;threats:</p><p>We looked at specific threats caused by extreme weather, mapping the probability and scale of impact in relation to different activities, infrastructures and&nbsp;people:</p>  Extreme heat waves: Can lead to discomfort, heat-related health issues, and increased energy consumption for cooling, particularly in densely populated neighbourhoods⁷. Extreme heat disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions.  Extreme dry season: Lack of rainfall combined with the extraction of groundwater for various purposes, including drinking water and industrial use, contributes to land subsidence in Amsterdam. This gradual sinking of the land not only poses risks to infrastructure stability but also exacerbates the city’s vulnerability to flooding, especially during heavy rains and storm&nbsp;surges.  Flood and extreme rainfall events: Amsterdam frequently experiences localised flooding during heavy rainfall due to its low-lying topography and the inability of the current drainage systems to handle intense downpours. This results in property damage, transportation disruptions, and inconvenience for residents.  Identifying the likely risk exposure, damage categories and economic&nbsp;impact<p>(b) Climate severity trajectories:</p><p>We also considered two headline scenarios in the years to 2050 taking into account climate severity forecasts⁸:</p>  Scenario A — Base Case: this scenario considers a trajectory where the overall climate remains stable until 2050. We consider this unlikely but it provides a useful baseline.  Scenario B — High Impact: this scenario was based on a high impact change in the overall climate trajectory. The underlying climate parameters reflect the WH Scenario from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, considering an average temperature rise of between 2.3 and 3.7 degrees⁹.  <p>(c) Adaptation measures:</p><p>Costings were developed for adaptation measures relating to interventions for flooding (e.g. smart roads, water permeable paving, water storage), heat (e.g. planting trees, green roofs) and drought (e.g. groundwater regulation and wooden pile reinforcement). For heat and flood costs we used blended cost figures per hectare and applied the medium value from the range¹⁰. As there were no comparable datasets available for drought adaptation measures, we looked at the average cost of installing groundwater recharge systems and applied this to the percentage of buildings with likely exposure¹¹.</p> The costs of inaction Vs the net benefits of different adaptation approaches <p>The next stage of our analysis involved applying an economic cost-benefit methodology, but using an extended basis for the types of value being considered. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is typically used for project appraisals where a number of options are being considered, providing a comparative view on the likely net outcomes (the value of overall benefits less the costs incurred to achieve them). Using the baseline scenarios we looked at the costs and net benefits of four possible approaches to climate adaptation:</p>  Do nothing;  Implement climate adaptation measures using a business as usual approach;  Implement climate adaptation measures using a coordinated approach;  Implement climate adaptation measures using an integrated approach.  Applying a multi-capital lens to value discovery<p>Under each approach we used a multi-capital lens to identify the benefits being created at different levels of the system. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Social Capital: looking at the experiential / intangible level we considered benefits to aspects such as mental health and improved air&nbsp;quality.  Human Capital: here we looked at how people interact with the system, for example transport, housing and business activities.  Built Capital: this is the most obvious area for adaptation benefits due to reduced damage costs to physical buildings, roads, sewers,&nbsp;etc.  Natural Capital: in this category we considered benefits being realised at the ecological baselayer, including elements such as improved soil and plant health and higher water&nbsp;quality.  <p>Approach 1: Do&nbsp;Nothing</p><p>If no action is taken, we estimate that the direct cumulative costs to 2050 will range from EUR 10.3m to EUR 17.7m (under Base Case and High Impact weather scenarios). Extrapolated to the city scale this equates to EUR8.3bn and EUR14.2bn respectively.</p>Risk exposure and costs of doing nothing under two climate scenarios<p>These costs consider the likely damage and economic impacts of a wide range of value flows. For example, looking at extreme precipitation the impacts span from direct damage to buildings to traffic disruption leading to loss of productive working time. Land subsidence after an extreme dry spell can cause damage to sewer systems and wooden pile foundations to rot after exposure to the air¹². Extreme heat can result in buckling tram lines, increased hospital admissions and somewhat bizarrely lead to a proliferation of poisonous caterpillars causing severe allergies¹³.</p>Flood related costs under different climate change scenarios<p>Approach 2: Implement climate adaptation measures using a business as usual&nbsp;approach</p><p>In this scenario we compared the costs of implementing climate adaptation measures with the avoided damage costs. For the case study area the total estimated costs for adaptation were EUR5.9m. This estimation assumed that the work would be undertaken by existing departments without any systemic coordination. This is a reality that we consistently observe in our work on the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral Cities by 2030 with the NetZeroCities consortium: it is very hard for many municipalities to break through departmental silos, let alone doing sophisticated coordination in planning with other stakeholders, such as utility providers, private land or building owners. We also included a level of unavoidable residual costs in the calculations. We found the direct savings due to the avoided damage costs of applying no adaptation measures to be significant, with the net benefit of implementation estimated at EUR8.8m, representing a 56% saving.¹⁴ ¹⁵</p><p>Approach 3: Implement climate adaptation measures using a coordinated approach and consider the co-benefits being&nbsp;created</p><p>In this approach we considered the potential savings and benefits generated if interventions are planned and implemented in tandem, thus creating synergies and increased efficiencies. For example, we factored in project overlap efficiencies (e.g. shared project managers), reduced disruption time (e.g. less time with streets being under construction) and faster adaptation outcomes (e.g. reduced overall exposure to flood and heat&nbsp;risks).</p>Potential benefits of applying a coordinated approach<p>Building on these benefits we also mapped a spread of potential co-benefits that would be likely to occur as indirect outcomes associated with the adaptation work. These benefits are clearly subjective, but if anything we would consider them to be a vast underestimation of the entangled value being created. For example, groundwater regulation benefits spill over into improved anxiety levels and tree health outcomes, resulting in lower mental health and tree maintenance costs. Or, roads being downgraded due to flood interventions, resulting in reduced traffic, improved air quality and reduced healthcare costs. This last point has been looked at in detail by the European Commission who concluded that the annual GDP impact of reducing PM2.5 levels to 5 µg/m3 would be 0.44%. To put this into perspective, although achieving this level of air quality improvements would take significant effort, it would equate to a EUR0.7bn annual uplift if applied to the GDP of Amsterdam.¹⁶ ¹⁷</p>Potential co-benefits arising from adapation interventions<p>Approach 4: Implement climate adaptation measures using a coordinated approach</p><p>Finally, we looked at the benefits of taking a fully integrated approach where interventions are intentionally combined to meet multiple objectives. In this case the value creation is diverse, significant and often unforeseen. For example, if residents come together to implement shared groundwater regulation measures (a practice that is becoming more common in Amsterdam) their collaborative efforts can increase social cohesion. When these initiatives are magnified by other behavioural changes, such as the development and uptake of e-mobility sharing schemes, the overall impact on social trust can result in reduced crime.¹⁸ Or, if intergenerational daytime spaces are created to reduce overall heating and cooling demand, multiple benefits accrue in both healthcare outcomes and work productivity opportunities stemming from alternative childcare options¹⁹.</p>The stacked benefits of moving towards a fully integrated approach to adaptation<p>In total, we identified potential savings of EUR 13.4m in relation to the coordinated / co-benefits approach and a further EUR 31.6m if this was translated into a broad integrated approach. When combined with the direct savings, the total estimated net benefit is EUR 53.8m. Extrapolating these results to the scale of Amsterdam the potential net benefits are EUR43 billion, representing a non-discounted cost-benefit ratio of 9. To be clear, these figures are based on a series of assumptions that can be adjusted depending on the user’s own judgement of different likelihoods and error margins. In the model that sits beneath this analysis all input assumptions are clearly laid out and annotated with their basis, to enable transparent interrogation and adjustment. An extract from the base cost assumptions input tab is shown below as an&nbsp;example.</p>Extract from adjustable model assumption drivers Bridging the gap between quantified benefits and tangible, integrated financing pathways <blockquote>“Every city needs to invest billions to respond to the climate emergency and build a resilient and sustainable future. To mobilise at this scope and scale, each city needs a tool to understand and communicate the economic case for the investments they must figure out how to make” — <a href="https://materialeconomics.com/eit-climate-kic-healthy-clean-cities-understanding-the-economic-case-for-decarbonising-cities.pdf?cms_fileid=bd49619c8f9dbb6f5616fa72737bcd56">Thomas Osdoba</a>, Senior Cities Advisor, EIT Climate-KIC</blockquote><p>Many of us will have sat in meetings where we discuss shared risks and liabilities. But how many of us have seen those conversations converting into collaborative investment commitments? Imagine a situation where stakeholders from a city municipality would like to work with investors, private real estate developers, a healthcare provider and utility companies to climate proof a hospital and its surroundings in an integrated manner. This would require local renewables, shared mobility schemes and a comprehensive approach to climate adaptation. Who should bear the costs of the initial planning and scoping to create alignment and trust across these parties, each of which are working to very different incentive structures and timelines? How to oversee the ongoing coordination between these actors, recognising their different appetite, priorities and capacity for investment? How to create agreements not just for the initial capital outlay but also for ongoing costs of maintenance? Common sense tells us that an integrated approach would yield greater real world returns, but that logic doesn’t correlate to mainstream investment models. The question therefore becomes: how can we coordinate between individual actors and de-risk portfolio investments in a complex, interconnected and resource-constrained world? There is little point proposing investment strategies that block engagement from the majority of capital and public budget holders. Instead, can we find ways to work with the existing structures and provide on-ramps for a phased transition?</p><p>In conversations across multiple cities, we have observed patterns that present leverage points for stimulating inter-stakeholder action. For example, if we think about an integrated approach to adaptation policy making, there are significant opportunities to create compound value flows. In parallel to driving adaptation and mitigation efforts, such policies can support more holistic spatial planning and underpin ecological and social programmes. In turn, these benefits spillover to diverse beneficiaries such as net zero commitment holders, the business community and healthcare providers.</p>Integrated policy&nbsp;benefits<p>Based on our analysis, we are exploring a phase instrument approach as a new class of integrated investment. Many stakeholders are currently restricted by singular focus budgets and requirements for financial returns, but we think this could be addressed with a pay-it-forwards strategy. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Stage 1 — BASELINE approach: in the early stages of adaptation planning, a city could create a fund that multiple stakeholders contribute a percentage of their budget into. This would involve a broad range of actors including different municipal departments, insurers, housing providers, utility companies and local pension funds. This will lay the foundations for the next&nbsp;stage.  Stage 2 — COORDINATED approach: the capital from the stage one investment fund could be used to finance the coordination and planning of implementing a coordinated adaptation approach. Cost savings would accrue directly to different stakeholders in their operating budgets. In addition, a percentage of the collective savings could be allocated to a forward fund to drive the early stage Integrated Stage investments.  Stage 3 — INTEGRATED approach: initially integrated adaptation projects would be financed from the savings made in Stage 2. However, as the integrated benefits become more established and validated they will become an asset class of their own, with the returns being used to grow the integrated infrastructure of the&nbsp;city.  Using a multi-capital economic case to underpin a new integrated investment instrument<p>Currently, this is a speculative proposal but elements of it are already in play in different contexts. Our mid-term aspiration is to partner with a pioneer city to bring the full instrument into reality. In the meantime, we are continuing to refine and iterate the multi-capital model framework to support local city teams to develop their own cases. We fully recognise that financial instruments are social contracts, requiring high levels of shared understanding and inter-actor trust as prerequisites. This demands dedicated time, patience and sensitive orchestration. However, we also observe that having quantified proposals to discuss, probe, disagree with and iterate is a strong catalyst for more action orientated agreements. We are very interested to hear experiences and examples from others and will continue to share our emerging learning in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>The Amsterdam case study was undertaken as part of a collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and Stipo, supported by the City of Amsterdam.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs.org) and Joost Beunderman (joost@darkmatterlabs.org).

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar: You’re finally taking that long-awaited Caribbean holiday. Got your passport? Check. Better keep it handy, because you’ll need to show it eleven times before you hit the beach. Oh, and don’t forget your username and password to your work computer while you’re away on vacation—nothing like spending your first day back sitting on hold with IT trying to resent your password and trying to log back in.</p>
<p>Or this: You’re out to dinner with an old friend when an urgent text pops up — a high-value customer has locked themselves out and needs your help getting back in. Again. Then an email from legal pops up: data regulations changed (again), and there’s been yet another authentication factor added to your systems. Seriously, how is MFA still not enough?</p>
<p>Managing digital identity is a time-sucking, money-burning nightmare. Businesses pour billions into KYC and IDV, only to end up with more friction, more delays, and more CAPTCHA clicks.</p>
<p>There’s a better way. Stop wasting money—start making it.</p>
<p>Here are three ways your digital identity decisions are costing you big — and how Indicio Proven helps you flip the script.</p>
 1. You’re spending too much on identity verification (and it’s still a mess) 
<p>Let’s be real — making a purchase or opening a new account online can be a nightmare. Businesses spend millions every year on KYC checks, manually verifying documents, and waiting on IDV providers to confirm someone is who they say they are. Meanwhile, you are stuck jumping through hoops, uploading selfies, scanning IDs, and refreshing inboxes, hoping for that magical “You’re Verified” email.</p>
<p>Every minute a business waits is money lost. Cart abandonments, incomplete sign-ups, and frustrated users means money is wasted on a process that actively drives customers away.</p>
<p>How Indicio Proven fixes this:</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> transforms identity verification into a revenue-generating asset with <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity</a>. With Verifiable Credentials, you can verify your identity once and reuse that verification anywhere. Instead of waiting days for KYC approval, just present a digital credential that proves your identity information — instantly. No need to fill out more paperwork, do repeated checks, or pay extra fees to IDV providers. More importantly, no more lost customers due to frustration.</p>
<p>It’s like getting an express pass at an amusement park — straight to the fun (or in your case, straight to becoming a paying customer).</p>
 2. You’re paying for compliance over and over again 
<p>Compliance isn’t optional. <a href="https://indicio.tech/get-ready-for-eidas-2-0-with-openid/">Regulations like eIDAS</a> 2.0, GDPR, CCPA, and various financial compliance laws mean businesses have to verify identities, minimize personal data storage and purpose and maximize security, and try to meet some level of industry standards. And that costs money — a lot of money.</p>
<p>The problem? Every time you need to verify identity at a different touchpoint, the business essentially pays for compliance all over again. Whether it’s opening an account, making a large transaction, or accessing a new service, the same process is repeated over and over.</p>
<p>How Indicio Proven fixes this:</p>
<p>With decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, compliance becomes portable. Instead of verifying your identity from scratch every time, you rely on credentials derived from information that has already been issued and verified.</p>
<p>You control your data, meaning you don’t have to hand over your personal data anymore for another business to store and secure in order to authenticate who you are the next time you visit. This reduces your risk (of a data breach) and the cost of data compliance and security to the business.</p>
<p>Think of it like a digital passport: Once issued, it works everywhere; but unlike a paper booklet, you can send a verifiable digital passport electronically, anywhere.</p>
 3. You’re missing out on the opportunity to make money from identity 
<p>Here’s the kicker for businesses: Identity verification isn’t just a cost—it can be a revenue stream.</p>
<p>Right now, companies spend billions verifying identities but don’t make a dime off that effort. Once you verify a customer, the process ends, and you’re left with nothing but an invoice at the end of the month from the IDV you happen to be using at the moment.</p>
<p>But what if you could turn identity verification into a business model and free yourself from expensive IDV bills? What if, after you go through the effort of verifying someone, you could issue a credential that they can use elsewhere—and YOU get paid for it?</p>
<p>How Indicio Proven fixes this:</p>
<p>With Indicio Proven, you don’t just verify users—you issue Verifiable Credentials that other businesses can trust. That means you can build trust networks, where other companies rely on your verified credentials instead of doing their own KYC from scratch. And guess what? They’ll pay you for it.</p>
<p>Think of it as TSA PreCheck. You’ve already proven you’re a trusted traveler, so you don’t have to go through security every time. Now imagine if TSA got paid every time another airline used that verification. That’s the model businesses can tap into with Verifiable Credentials.</p>
 The bottom line: Stop losing money and start making it 
<p>Picture this: instead of spending time proving you’re a human and jumping through endless verification hoops, you get your information verified once and can use that credential everywhere.</p>
<p>Instead of pouring your budget into more layers of software in hopes you’ll meet some magic threshold of compliance for managing customer data, you have a secure, privacy-preserving system that does the heavy lifting for you.</p>
<p>Instead of identity being a burden, it becomes a business advantage.</p>
<p>This isn’t some distant future — it’s possible right now. The companies that are embracing verifiable credentials today are the ones that will be leading the industry tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to stop wasting money and start making identity work for you? The future of digital identity isn’t just about compliance—it’s about opportunity.</p>
<p>And with Indicio Proven, you can finally seize it!</p>

<p>Governments often face challenges in fully delivering on their commitments to enhancing both freedom and safety for their residents, as balancing the two can be very complex. <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Utah’s new State Bill 260</a> introduces principles for a state-endorsed digital identity that puts Utahns in control of their identities and includes a suite of guaranteed freedoms and protections to increase user choice, prevent surveillance, and respect privacy.</p><p>The Lehi, Utah-based civil libertarian Libertas Institute<a href="https://libertas.institute/bill/sb-260-updating-ids-in-the-digital-age?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> describes the bill</a> as “an ambitious policy prescription of privacy protection, individual autonomy protection, and anonymity.” This bill comes at an important time to combat the rise of <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/ai-is-the-final-blow-for-an-id-system-whose-time-has-passed/">AI-enabled fraud</a>, address violations of <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-secures-14-billion-settlement-meta-over-its-unauthorized-capture?ref=blog.spruceid.com">privacy practices</a>, and growth in the <a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/implementation-tracker-map/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">adoption of digital IDs</a> in the US. New technologies such as <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Digital Credentials</a> (VDCs) would now make the bill implementable. Most importantly, it offers an opportunity for major advances in autonomy, privacy, and security of individuals in the digital world, creating a bulwark for the next era of <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/why-advancing-digital-identity-is-critical-to-u-s-national-security/">U.S. cybersecurity</a> and cyberfreedoms.</p><p>Technology's privacy strengths can only reach their full potential if legislation supports and protects them. Utah SB260 strongly supports this goal by banning surveillance, enforcing selective disclosure, keeping digital identity fully optional, and notably preventing government officials from demanding “device handover.” These elements of SB260 can create a strong baseline for digital ID within Utah and even for other states.</p> The State Does Not Establish an Individual's Identity <p>Clearly stated in § 63A-16-1202(1)(b)/(c), “the state does not establish an individual’s identity” and “the state may, in certain circumstances, recognize and endorse an individual's identity.”</p><p>This is fundamentally different from programs where a government authority defines someone’s ability to be recognized and exist. Instead, it recognizes that human beings already exist in their own right and that the state’s role is to provide assistance to humans, so they can be recognized and have the ability to manage the state endorsement in the ways prescribed by the code.</p> Prohibiting Digital Surveillance and Data-sharing <p>The code further requires that when a state-endorsed digital identity is presented, any data from the interaction is only used for the reason intended by the document’s owner. The validator accepting the document, whether a bartender, law enforcement officer or TSA agent, can’t share data about the contents of an ID or the time or context in which it was presented for validation. That includes prohibiting data-sharing with private companies that might want to use it for marketing or other purposes.</p><p>The provision also prohibits “surveillance, visibility, tracking, or monitoring” by any government agency or other person who accepts a digital ID. This is important because, while the digital signatures that validate digital credentials can be confirmed “locally” by some validators–that is, without sending a message to a central server–some validators will need to query a server or database, which if not implemented with the proper safeguards can create <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">“phone home”</a> surveillance. The anti-surveillance provision of SB260 bans using those queries as a source of surveillance data.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the bill’s broader privacy demands incentivize the building of ID systems with anti-surveillance mechanisms, such as<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/"> private information retrieval</a>.</p> Selective Disclosure Protects Sensitive Personal Information <p>SB260 enshrines selective disclosure as a principle of privacy protection. Selective disclosure is a unique advantage of digital identity documents. A physical ID means handing over every bit of information to a validator, even irrelevant and risky data like your address. However, when a digital ID is presented, the user can select exactly what information they wish to share.</p><p>For example, SB260 specifies that a digital ID user must be able to “verify that the individual's age satisfies an age requirement without revealing the individual's age or date of birth.” This is particularly important because a birth date is so-called “personal identifying information,” or PII, that can be leveraged for cyberattacks. Keeping it and other sensitive information private when it’s not truly necessary to share helps keep users safe and in control.</p> No Forced Device Handover <p>Utah’s proposed bill also ensures that “a governmental entity or a person may not require an individual to surrender the individual's mobile communication device to verify the individual's identity.” That is, a user has the right to keep their phone when they are presenting a digital ID for scanning.</p><p>This is particularly important when it comes to law enforcement because privacy laws defining police access to phone data are still<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/24/21133600/police-fbi-phone-search-protests-password-rights?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> an ambiguous patchwork</a>. Depending on many factors, it may be legal for a police officer in physical possession of a phone to access data the user didn’t intend to share, creating major privacy and security risks. This provision makes clear that Utahns have the right to refuse any such request from a police officer or any other government official.</p> Digital Identity is Optional <p>A final key provision of SB260 is that digital identity tools will remain entirely optional–no government entity can require a digital ID to provide benefits or provide any “material benefit” as an incentive for the use of a digital ID. This is important for accessibility and equity reasons since many residents may face challenges transitioning to new technologies, and others may simply choose not to use a smartphone.</p><p>However, overall public trust is also at stake here: nothing is more likely to make Americans suspicious of a digital tool than being forced to use it by the government. By keeping digital ID optional, while enforcing the core benefits that make it appealing to users, SB260 creates the best possible conditions for trust and adoption of a tool that will benefit users most of all.</p> A Defining Moment for User-Controlled Digital IDs <p>Digital IDs are here to stay. The rapid growth of digital ID programs in New York, California, and <a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/implementation-tracker-map/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">11 other US states</a> is not slowing down, and as digital IDs can be used over the internet, it will unlock a myriad of new use cases and mass adoption. That’s why it’s so critical that legislation and technology work together to convey a user-first approach at this moment. We believe that SB260 has the right stock for this, and many of its elements could be adopted in other states and even countries.</p><p></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

									  Summer Trenches Beat Winter Ones   <p>The crypto influencer event at the White House was a nothing burger, the strategic digital asset reserve is over-hyped, and markets are lingering at relative lows.&nbsp;In other words, it may be warming up outside, but it’s starting to feel a lot like crypto winter in here.</p>  <p><a href="https://goldbroker.com/news/united-states-huge-debt-refinancing-remains-2025-biggest-challenge-3483?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight#:~:text=By%202025,%20the%20US%20Treasury,deficit,%20already%20at%20critical%20levels.">Sometime this year</a>, the U.S. Treasury will likely refinance the country’s debt. With trade wars raging and the equities market looking too hot to touch (not to mention overweighted by a handful of companies whose entire value is based off of things junior product managers can vibe-code into existence over a weekend and give away for free) the markets are wrecked.</p>  <p>According to some&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/roger_cerqua/status/1899329005360152704?s=46&amp;t=oUwPNRaxuquKUazpKDAqNw&amp;utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">fringe theorists</a>&nbsp;on X, that could be a good thing for taxpayers in the form of the interest that’s paid on the government’s debt. Illuminati master plan aside, it does stand to reason that a weakened equities market means a stronger bonds market, and also usually means that the Treasury can refinance at better rates. So there’s no reason for Trump to change up his strategy for the moment, especially while it’s playing lip service to the crypto supporters and fed haters.</p>  <p>What does it mean for the rest of us?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Well, I’m no financial expert, but I’d buckle up for a fair amount of volatility until the end of September and beginning of October. There’s may still be money in day-trading or swing-trading, but I’m a degen, not a gambler. Personally, I’ll just keep on diamond-handing, and scooping up Solana&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SOL.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">SOL.X ( ▼ 1.4% )</a>&nbsp;at discount bargains.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In my eyes, the ecosystem is still taking meaningful steps forward at a sustainable pace. Jump Crypto just released a new validator client for Solana,&nbsp;<a href="https://jumpcrypto.com/writing/firedancer/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">Firedancer</a>. And although adoption currently sits at less than 2%, the demonstrated increased throughput means a higher yield TPS on the network. In short, Solana is only getting faster. And this could reasonably increase to 10% by this summer; many validator clients are run by large projects that will likely make their own competitive upgrades.</p>  <p>Elsewhere, communities are applying tried and tested use cases to Bitcoin and other tokens as an alternative payment processing and collection system for their businesses. Some friends of ours stayed at a BitcoinBNB over their trip to SXSW this year. Mass adoption in action.</p>  <p>What I’m trying to say is, the house only wins if you sell. Don’t play with leverage, accumulate daily or weekly, and expect to keep going sideways for at least the next 6 months. Hodl on.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

And what better way to relieve the pressure than by hitting a ball with a big stick?</p>  <p>In one of the most practical endorsements of the diamond hand strategy I’ve seen in my years covering crypto, LinksDAO — which we&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/culture-h0r/pro-viral/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">first covered</a>&nbsp;more than two years ago in the spiritual predecessor to this newsletter — has emerged from the sand trap to provide holders some long-awaited utility.</p>  <p>The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) first came together in 2021 to “democratize the country club membership experience”. In the years since, it has purchased just two clubs — one in Scotland, and now, one in our backyard.</p>  <p>LinksDAO just bought up the shuttered Hillcrest Country Club, situated in our heartland home base, Kansas City, MO. It won’t open for another year at least, but it admittedly marks a big step toward the DAO’s theoretical leisure ecosystem, a network of courses and clubs run on its token&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/LINKS.NFT?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">LINKS.NFT ( 0.0% )</a>.</p>  <p>Now, as with most DAOs, its vision isn’t exactly the most straightforward or accessible crypto use case. The organization blew up at the same time as other blue-chip relics of the NFT era. (Evinced by its partnerships with the likes of Bored Ape Yacht Club, Doodles, and Pudgy Penguins.) And while it still sells NFTs, they don’t quite function as the all-access pass once-promised. Its&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ETH.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">ETH.X ( ▼ 0.88% )</a>&nbsp;based passes run somewhere from $200 to $700 and merely provide a discount to a full membership, which can still run upwards of $10,000.</p>  <p>So long-term hodlers may not have lucked into becoming full-blown trust fund bunnies, but hey. It’s cool to see a major DeFi player try to follow through on a promise. With golf’s growing popularity, particularly among younger, more tech-savvy generations, the time is ripe for a change in how the sport is experienced and enjoyed. Through the power of blockchain, LinksDAO offers its members more than just a place to play — it allows them to help shape and expand the future of the sport, and maybe, just maybe, make it a modicum more accessible.<br><br>Anyway, if you’re wondering if we bought a LinksDAO NFT, yes, of course we did. Who wouldn’t want to own a piece of the future, even if it’s a deeply silly one.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>From <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/13/understanding-nhis-key-differences-between-human-and-non-human-identities/">NHI</a> to AI to Shared Signals, even in CIAM it comes back to standards versus reality.</p>



<p>Identity standards paint a perfect future: passwordless logins, verifiable credentials, and seamless trust. I love that picture; I want to frame it. Alas, legacy IAM, tight budgets, and a business case that still boils down to ‘but will customers complain?’ prevent us from getting there from here. </p>



<p>Nowhere is this tension more visible than in Consumer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). The security vs. usability tradeoff has always been a knife fight, and now we’re throwing in regulatory compliance, the rising costs of fraud, and the ever-present specter of “but our customers will complain.” So, let’s talk about what standards assume, where reality kicks in, and how organizations can actually make progress.</p>



 The Issue: Standards Define a Destination, But Legacy Systems Control the Journey 



<p>Standards bodies like NIST, ISO, and ETSI (under eIDAS2) have done their job: They’ve painted a picture of where we should be. The problem is that standards assume a level of infrastructure readiness that simply doesn’t exist in many organizations.</p>



<p>From a security perspective: Passwords are an outdated, high-risk authentication method. We should be moving toward passwordless logins, strong authentication, and identity federation. But if you’re running a legacy IAM system that predates modern best practices, you’re not just flipping a switch to make that happen.</p>



<p>From a business perspective: The cost of migration is non-trivial. Budgets are tight, and while security teams may want to modernize, getting executive buy-in requires proving a return on investment. “It’s more secure” is not a compelling business case, especially when ripping out legacy authentication systems means overhauling customer login experiences.</p>



<p>From a user perspective: Legacy authentication methods, for all their flaws, are familiar. Customers know how to enter a password (even if it’s “password123”). Introducing new login methods, such as passkeys, decentralized identity wallets, and multi-factor authentication, can introduce friction, and friction equals drop-off.</p>



 



<p>Standards define where we want to go—but legacy systems decide how fast we can get there. If your team is working through what’s actually feasible—or trying to stay ahead of standards while managing existing infrastructure—I can help you make sense of the trade-offs.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">See how I work</a> or <a>Let’s talk</a>.</p>



 



 The Challenge in CIAM: Modernization Without Losing Customers 



<p>CIAM isn’t just a backend challenge, it’s a user experience challenge. Security teams might dream of a world where everyone uses phishing-resistant authentication, but if that world means adding too much friction, users will revolt.</p>



<p>Consider some of the “solutions” proposed:</p>



 
 Passwordless authentication: Great in theory, but if customers aren’t ready for passkeys, you’re not solving a problem—you’re creating one. 



 Decentralized identity: It might be the future, but consumers don’t want to manage DID documents or cryptographic keys. 



 Verifiable credentials: Wonderful for privacy and security, but adoption is painfully slow outside of niche use cases. 
 



<p>Users hate complexity, and CIAM modernization efforts must balance security with the absolute necessity of seamless customer experience.</p>



 Standards vs. Reality: What Do They Assume? 



Standards BodyFocus AreaRegulatory BackingWhat It AssumesReality CheckNIST (SP 800-63, etc.)Digital identity guidelines, authentication assuranceU.S. federal agencies must follow; widely referenced globallyOrganizations can implement strong authentication (MFA, passkeys, federation)Many consumer apps still struggle with basic 2FA adoptionISO/IEC (24760, 29115, etc.)Identity management, authentication assurance frameworksTreaty-based; adopted by national governments and industryStandardized identity assurance will improve security across sectorsAdoption varies; private sector uptake is slow outside compliance-driven industriesETSI (EN 319 411, etc.)Trust services, digital identity regulations (especially in the EU)Required for EU digital identity initiatives like eIDASInteroperability between EU countries will streamline identity verificationEach country implements differently, causing fragmentation and complexityW3C (Verifiable Credentials, DID Core, etc.)Decentralized identity, privacy-enhancing authenticationNo regulatory backing; industry-drivenA privacy-first, user-controlled identity future is achievableAdoption is niche and fragmented; industry buy-in is inconsistentIETF (SD-JWT, OAuth, etc.)Selective disclosure, token-based authenticationNo regulatory requirement but widely adopted in industryPrivacy-preserving JWTs will improve data minimization without breaking compatibilityAdoption is early-stage; requires infrastructure most orgs don’t yet have



 How Do We Bridge the Gap? Migration Strategies for Legacy Systems 



<p>It’s easy to say “just modernize,” but for organizations dealing with decades of <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/6/technical-debt-explained-plain-english">technical debt</a>, it’s not so simple. Here’s what is more likely to work:</p>



 Instead of a risky rip-and-replace, introduce new authentication methods alongside legacy systems: 



 
 Enable passkeys as an optional login method first, rather than forcing a switch overnight. 



 Allow progressive adoption of MFA, requiring it only for high-risk activities before making it universal. 



 Deploy verifiable credentials in controlled, low-risk scenarios, such as employee logins, before scaling to customers. 
 



 Hybrid IAM: Layer Modern Authentication on Top of Legacy Systems 



<p>Most organizations can’t replace their IAM stack overnight, so extend it instead:</p>



 
 Use federation (OIDC, SAML) to bridge old and new identity providers, enabling secure single sign-on (SSO). 



 Introduce adaptive authentication that steps up security dynamically, rather than disrupting all users at once. 



 Leverage external identity providers (e.g., social login, IDPs) where appropriate to offload identity management. 
 



 Use Regulatory Compliance as a Modernization Lever 



<p>Regulations often force organizations to upgrade security; use them to drive investment:</p>



 
 Prioritize upgrades that align with eIDAS2, NIST, or ISO mandates to future-proof your IAM. 



 If budgets are tight, look for grants or incentives that support compliance-driven security improvements. 



 Advocate for clearer timelines on deprecating outdated authentication methods so you can plan ahead. 
 



 Design for Customers, Not Just Security 



<p>Users resist change—modernization efforts need to be seamless, not disruptive:</p>



 
 Reduce friction by keeping familiar login options (passwords) available while transitioning to stronger authentication. 



 Offer clear, user-friendly messaging explaining why new login options improve security without making things harder. 



 Give users control over delegation (e.g., letting caregivers access accounts securely rather than sharing passwords). 
 



 Final Thoughts: Standards Are Great for Tomorrow, But Reality Wins Today 



<p>Standards define the future. But businesses don’t live in the future—they live in budget cycles, tech debt, and customer expectations. Modernizing CIAM isn’t about ‘just implementing passwordless’—it’s about navigating the messy in-between. The real challenge? Making progress without breaking what still (sort of) works.</p>



<p>So, next time someone says, “just implement passwordless authentication,” remind them: standards define where we want to go, but legacy systems dictate how fast we can get there.</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain technology among financial services grows, so does the regulatory scrutiny around digital asset transactions. One of the most pressing regulatory frameworks that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must comply with is the FATF Travel Rule, a.k.a. the “Crypto Travel Rule”, which mandates the collection and exchange of originator and beneficiary information for transactions above a certain threshold. While compliance is already a challenge for Layer 1 blockchains, the rise of Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, presents new complexities that demand innovative compliance solutions.</p>
<p>This article explores the challenges of Travel Rule compliance on Layer 2 solutions, the risks associated with non-compliance, and how iComply enables VASPs to meet regulatory requirements without compromising on efficiency or privacy.</p>
 Understanding the “Crypto Travel Rule” and Its Challenges on Layer 2 
<p>The FATF Travel Rule, first introduced in 2019, requires VASPs (such as exchanges, custodians, and payment providers) to share sender and recipient information when handling virtual asset transfers above a regulatory threshold (typically $1,000 USD or equivalent – or more recently $200 USD for businesses operating within certain ZIP codes along the southern border of the US).</p>
<p>For Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this is already a challenge, as transactions are pseudonymous, requiring VASPs to implement KYC/KYB measures to track user activity. However, the problem becomes even more complex on Layer 2 networks, where transactions occur off-chain and are often structured to maximize privacy and efficiency.</p>
 Key Challenges of Travel Rule Compliance on Layer 2 Solutions 
 
 Onion-Routed Transactions – Networks like the Lightning Network use multi-hop, onion-routed payments, where transactions pass through multiple intermediary nodes, making it difficult to determine the true origin and destination. 
 Off-Chain Nature – Unlike Layer 1 transactions that are recorded on a public ledger, Layer 2 transactions are ephemeral and only settle on-chain periodically, making transaction tracing more complex. 
 No Centralized Counterparty – Many Lightning Network transactions occur directly between peers without an exchange or custodian involved, leading to a lack of intermediaries who would traditionally enforce Travel Rule compliance. 
 Regulatory Uncertainty – Governments and regulatory bodies are still grappling with how to apply AML laws to Layer 2 solutions, leaving VASPs uncertain about how to proceed. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Sunrise Problem: A Barrier to Travel Rule Compliance 
<p>One of the biggest compliance hurdles for VASPs is the “Sunrise Problem.” This occurs when some jurisdictions enforce the Travel Rule while others do not, creating gaps in regulatory coverage and making it difficult for VASPs to exchange compliance information across different regions.</p>
<p>For Layer 2 solutions, the Sunrise Problem is even more pronounced because:</p>
 
 VASPs may operate in jurisdictions where compliance obligations differ. 
 Layer 2 transactions can involve multiple jurisdictions in a single transaction, increasing complexity. 
 Lack of standardized compliance protocols across different VASPs and Layer 2 nodes leads to operational challenges. 
 
<p>Without a global, interoperable solution, VASPs risk falling into non-compliance or limiting their services to regions with clear Travel Rule mandates, reducing market opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How iComply Helps VASPs Achieve Layer 2 Travel Rule Compliance 
<p>As a leader in holistic KYB, KYC, and AML compliance software, iComply provides the tools necessary for VASPs to comply with Travel Rule regulations—even on Layer 2 networks.</p>
 1. Identity Verification for Lightning Network Users 
 
 iComply enables pre-transaction verification, ensuring that users interacting with regulated Lightning nodes or VASPs offering Layer 2 services undergo proper KYC/KYB checks. 
 This solution is particularly useful for businesses and financial institutions integrating Lightning payments while needing regulatory approval. 
 
 2. Off-Chain Transaction Monitoring &amp; Risk-Based Analytics 
 
 Since Lightning transactions settle on-chain eventually, iComply’s patented and proprietary blockchain transaction monitoring solutions can be utilized to track:
 
 Channel funding transactions (when users open a payment channel). 
 Final settlement transactions (when channels are closed and funds return to the blockchain). 
 
 
 Pattern analysis and AI-driven risk scoring detect suspicious behaviour in Layer 2 payment activity. 
 
 3. Compliance-Enabled Lightning Nodes for VASPs 
 
 VASPs operating Lightning nodes can integrate iComply’s solutions to:
 
 Require KYC/KYB for users (originators) opening channels. 
 Enable the collection and verification of KYC/KYB for beneficiaries in real time with the transaction. 
 Implement Travel Rule-compliant information exchange between regulated entities (i.e. VASPs – Virtual Asset Service Providers).. 
 Use privacy-preserving edge computing to detect illicit activities without revealing sensitive customer data to bad actors or on-chain surveillance companies. 
 
 
 
 4. Edge Computing &amp; Privacy-Preserving Compliance 
 
 iComply’s edge computing technology ensures that all sensitive user data is capture, authenticate, validated, verified, and encrypted before it leaves the user’s device, preventing unauthorized access, on-chain surveillance,&nbsp;or third-party data exposure. 
 Decentralized compliance attestations and privacy centric digital identity solutions&nbsp;allow users to prove they are verified without revealing personal information. 
 
 5. Interoperability to Solve the Sunrise Problem 
 
 iComply supports multi-jurisdictional compliance frameworks, allowing VASPs to exchange Travel Rule data across different regulatory environments. 
 iComply’s patented technology allows multiple and diverse compliance frameworks to be applied to the same transaction, such as when the originator and beneficiary reside in or are subject to regulatory thresholds from different jurisdictions. 
 By integrating global AML compliance standards, iComply ensures that Layer 2 transactions meet regulatory expectations, regardless of where the parties are located. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Travel Rule Compliance for Layer 2 VASPs is Possible with iComply 
<p>Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network offer incredible benefits for scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness, but their design introduces serious compliance challenges for VASPs. The FATF Travel Rule, combined with the Sunrise Problem, creates barriers to global compliance—but iComply is uniquely positioned to help VASPs navigate these challenges.</p>
<p>With identity verification, AI-driven transaction monitoring, compliance-ready Lightning nodes, privacy-preserving solutions, and global interoperability, iComply enables VASPs to embrace Layer 2 networks while staying Travel Rule-compliant.</p>
<p>By adopting iComply’s holistic compliance framework, VASPs can confidently integrate Lightning Network payments and other Layer 2 solutions without regulatory roadblocks.</p>
 Next Steps 
<p>If you’re a VASP looking to integrate Layer 2 solutions while maintaining Travel Rule compliance, reach out to iComply today.</p>

<p>For years, proving your age online has long been a frustrating process. Users upload a government-issued ID, wait for approval, and hope the system—or a human reviewer—doesn’t flag it for further checks. Not only is this slow and intrusive, but it’s also easy to bypass with borrowed or fake documents.</p>



<p>AI is changing that. Instead of relying on easily manipulated paperwork, today’s online identity verification systems use biometric and behavioral data to confirm whether someone is old enough to access age-restricted content. AI makes verification faster, smarter, and more secure while reducing friction for legitimate users.</p>



<p>But AI isn’t a silver bullet. While it slows deepfakes, synthetic identities, and document fraud, businesses need to balance privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and evolving regulations. The challenge isn’t just making age assurance more effective—it’s ensuring it remains fair, secure, and privacy-conscious.</p>



<p>So, how exactly is AI reshaping the landscape? And what should companies consider when adopting these technologies?</p>



 







 



 What Is Age Assurance? 



<p>At its core, <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8">age assurance</a> is about determining whether a user meets the minimum age for certain content, services, or products. It’s critical for protecting minors, preventing fraud, and staying compliant with laws like <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa">COPPA (U.S.)</a>, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/childrens-information/childrens-code-guidance-and-resources/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/">AADC (EU)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50">Online Safety Act (UK)</a>.</p>



<p>There are two main approaches:</p>



 
 <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/ink-index-for-age-verification-2025/">Age verification</a> confirms a user’s exact age using government-issued IDs, credit card records, or mobile carrier data. 



 <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/link-index-for-age-estimation-2025/">Age estimation</a> uses AI-driven biometric and behavioral analysis to predict a user’s likely age without requiring official documentation. 
 



 



<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8"></a><a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8">From Liminal’s Market &amp; Buyer’s Guide for Age Assurance, Page 16</a>



 



<p>AI-driven models are not just replacing traditional document checks; they are enabling real-time, adaptive verification, reducing friction while increasing security and fraud resistance.</p>



 



 Traditional Methods vs. AI-Powered Solutions 



<p>Manual ID checks were once the go-to method for age verification. Users uploaded a government-issued ID or other documents, which were then cross-checked against ID manuals and data sets. Over time, automation was introduced to streamline parts of this process, but fundamental issues remained:</p>



<p>This process came with serious flaws:</p>



 
 Slow &amp; Frustrating → Lengthy processing times frustrate users. 



 Privacy Risks → Storing IDs increases exposure to fraud. 



 Easy to Cheat → Minors can use borrowed or fake documents. 



 Not Scalable → Manual reviews can’t handle millions of users efficiently. 
 



<p>AI-powered solutions remove these pain points. Instead of relying on easily manipulated documents, AI uses facial recognition, behavioral signals, and liveness detection to verify users in real time—without storing excessive personal data.</p>



 



 The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Age Assurance 



<p>Instead of just checking a document, AI-powered age assurance takes a more dynamic approach by analyzing a person’s unique traits. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6548ff02f648f1f9e7a3ab3f">Facial recognition technology</a> can estimate whether a user is underage without storing personal details, making the process both efficient and privacy-conscious. At the same time,<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/65ea250d296006bc61b9b431"> behavioral analytics</a> monitor how users interact with a platform, flagging patterns that suggest they may be younger than they claim.</p>



<p>Beyond these methods,<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/65b929b26bb0a84854c0ecbd"> deepfake detection</a> plays a critical role in preventing fraud, ensuring that AI-generated videos or manipulated images can’t be used to bypass verification. Meanwhile, AI-driven document authentication is improving online identity verification by catching subtle forgeries that human reviewers might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>For businesses, this shift leads to fewer manual checks, faster processing, and a smoother experience for legitimate users—without creating new loopholes for fraudsters to exploit.</p>



 



 AI-Powered Fraud Prevention in Age Assurance 



<p>Fraudsters are always evolving, but AI is making it harder for them to cheat the system. Two of the most challenging fraud tactics today are synthetic identities and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/65b929b26bb0a84854c0ecbd">deepfake fraud</a>, both of which have become harder to detect and cheaper to execute.</p>



 



 Stopping Synthetic Identity Fraud 



<p>Synthetic identities are like digital chameleons—fraudsters blend real and fake details to create entirely new (but convincing) personas. These identities can slip past traditional verification methods because they look legitimate on the surface. But AI-powered defenses are catching up fast. Here’s how:</p>



 
 Behavioral Analysis → AI watches how users interact over time—how they type, move through a site, and even make payments. Fraudsters tend to behave differently than real users, and AI picks up on those subtle differences. 



 Cross-Checking Data → Instead of verifying just one piece of information, AI cross-references multiple sources—credit histories, public records, and known fraud databases—to spot mismatches that give away synthetic identities. 



 Machine Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition → AI learns from past fraud cases, continuously improving its ability to detect fake profiles by identifying patterns that human reviewers might miss. 



 AI-Powered Document Checks → Even when fraudsters submit “official-looking” IDs, AI scans for subtle signs of tampering—like mismatched fonts, odd lighting, or altered personal details. 
 



<p>These tools, combined with real-time risk assessments, make it significantly harder for fraudsters to create and use synthetic identities successfully.</p>



 



 Preventing Deepfake Fraud 



<p>Deepfake technology has made it scarily easy to create hyper-realistic fake images and videos, allowing fraudsters to impersonate real people. The good news is that AI can fight AI:</p>



 
 Liveness Detection → Ever noticed how people naturally blink, shift their expressions, or adjust their posture? Deepfakes struggle with these real-life nuances. AI-powered liveness detection can analyze micro-expressions, eye movement, and facial depth to confirm a person is actually present. 



 Advanced Facial Recognition → AI compares user-submitted selfies or videos with previously verified images to catch even the slightest inconsistencies that signal a deepfake. 



 Image &amp; Video Forensics → AI can break down visual elements—like unnatural lighting, weird pixel patterns, or facial distortions—to detect manipulated media before it fools the system. 



 Challenge-Response Tests → Asking users to complete real-time actions—like turning their head, smiling, or speaking a phrase—adds an extra layer of security that deepfakes struggle to replicate convincingly. 
 



<p>By combining these techniques, AI-powered verification systems can shut down deepfake attempts before they get past the first checkpoint.</p>

 Enhancing Secure Access Control Through AI 



<p>In industries where verifying a user’s age is critical—like alcohol and tobacco sales, online gambling, and adult content platforms—businesses need stronger, more adaptable verification methods. AI-powered access control allows companies to layer multiple verification techniques, ensuring that only legitimate users get through.</p>



<p>For higher-risk scenarios, businesses can combine selfie-based authentication with document scans for extra security. Instead of relying on one-time ID checks, AI continuously monitors risk in real time, flagging suspicious activity as it happens. This is especially useful in cases where users might try to borrow an ID, create a fake profile, or use manipulated images to bypass restrictions.</p>



<p>By making access control dynamic and responsive, AI helps businesses enforce age restrictions and regulatory compliance without frustrating legitimate users. Whether it’s a quick facial scan, behavioral analysis, or cross-referencing multiple data points, AI ensures the right people get access—while keeping fraudsters out.</p>



 



 Real-World Applications of AI in Age Assurance 



<p>New laws are forcing companies to rethink age verification systems, and AI is already playing a major role in compliance.</p>



 



 Age Verification Texas: Pornhub Compliance Challenges 



<p>The<a href="https://versustexas.com/blog/age-verification-law-texas/"> Pornhub age verification laws in Texas</a> require adult platforms to implement stricter age verification measures. Initially, these regulations relied on manual ID-based checks, but platforms quickly faced backlash over privacy concerns and user friction. To comply while maintaining user trust, many are turning to AI-driven facial recognition, which verifies age without storing personal documents. This approach helps businesses meet regulatory requirements while reducing fraud risks and improving user experience.</p>



<p>Google’s AI-Powered Age Assurance</p>



<p>Google has taken a proactive approach to age assurance across its platforms, leveraging AI to make verification more accurate and user-friendly. One major example is <a href="https://www.itp.net/edge/digital-culture/youtubes-new-ai-tools-are-protecting-creators-from-unauthorised-use-heres-how">YouTube’s AI Verification System</a>, which was introduced after self-reported birthdates proved unreliable for restricting access to age-sensitive content. Instead of relying on document uploads, YouTube’s system uses Google’s broader AI-driven verification methods to dynamically assess whether a user meets the required age criteria.</p>



<p>Beyond YouTube, Google applies these AI-powered techniques across its ecosystem, ensuring that minors are restricted from accessing age-sensitive services while keeping verification seamless for legitimate users. Similarly, other tech giants like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/meta-announces-new-age-checking-measures-for-young-instagram-users">Meta</a> are implementing AI-driven age assurance to balance compliance, fraud prevention, and user convenience, reflecting a broader industry move toward smarter, more adaptable verification methods that protect minors without creating unnecessary barriers for real users.</p>

 Industries Leveraging AI for Age Estimation and Verification 



 Gaming &amp; Dating Sites 



<p>Online gaming and dating sites are increasingly adopting AI to ensure user authenticity and safety. For instance, gaming platforms utilize age estimation and behavioral tracking to prevent minors from accessing mature content. Similarly, dating apps employ facial recognition to verify that new users meet age requirements, fostering a safer environment for all participants.</p>



 Fintech, Banking, and Gambling&nbsp; 



<p>In regulated sectors like fintech, banking, and gambling, accurate and scalable age verification is crucial to prevent fraud and comply with legal standards. AI-driven solutions detect fake IDs, synthetic identities, and document tampering, thereby reducing onboarding delays while maintaining high-security levels. This approach ensures that services are accessible only to eligible individuals, safeguarding both the institutions and their clients.</p>



 Alcohol and Tobacco Sales 



<p>Retailers and e-commerce platforms selling alcohol and tobacco <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/age-check-legislation-to-prevent-youth-alcohol-tobacco-sales-expanding-globally">face strict age restrictions</a> and growing pressure to prevent underage purchases. AI-powered age assurance solutions help these businesses verify customer age in real-time by using document authentication, facial recognition, and behavioral analysis. Whether self-checkout kiosks scan IDs or online stores verify buyer credentials, AI ensures compliance while streamlining the purchasing process for legal customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6744feebc0a25d54cc2e59c9">(From Liminal’s White Paper: The Age-Verified Internet – Strategies for Safer Online Experiences, Page 5)</a></p>



 



 Evaluating Age Assurance Systems 



<p>Implementing AI-driven verification is just one piece of the puzzle—businesses also need to ensure that these systems actually work as intended. The best solutions find the right balance between accuracy, speed, user experience, and fraud prevention while staying compliant with regulations.</p>



<p>To compare different approaches, companies turn to <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/05/nist-reports-first-results-age-estimation-software-evaluation">age-assured program reviews</a>, which assess how well these systems perform in real-world scenarios. These reviews help answer critical questions: How often does the system mistakenly approve underage users? How many legitimate users get unfairly blocked? How fast and smooth is the verification process?</p>



<p>By understanding these factors, businesses can choose a system that doesn’t just check a compliance box but actually makes verification secure, efficient, and frustration-free for real users.</p>



 



 Key Metrics for Effectiveness 



<p>According to our<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8"> Market and Buyer’s Guide for Age Assurance</a>, decision-makers prioritize accuracy, completion speed, and user experience when selecting an age verification system. Key performance indicators include:</p>



 
 Accuracy rates → How well AI determines a user’s age. 



 False acceptance &amp; rejection rates → Are minors mistakenly approved or adults incorrectly denied? 



 Completion &amp; abandonment rates → If users drop off, verification may be too slow or intrusive. 



 Time to completion → How quickly can users verify their age? 
 



<p>The goal is high accuracy with minimal friction—a system that wrongly rejects legitimate users or lets fraudsters through ultimately fails at its job.</p>



 



 Future Trends and Innovations in Age Assurance 



<p>As regulations tighten and fraud tactics become more sophisticated, the future of age assurance will prioritize privacy-first verification, real-time risk assessment, and seamless identity tracking across devices. Businesses need solutions that not only verify age accurately but also protect user privacy and minimize friction.</p>

<p>The push for<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/674dfec1af1383e9afc9fc40"> privacy-first verification</a> is reshaping how companies handle age assurance. Users expect security without overexposing their personal data, and businesses must comply with stricter regulations. The next phase of age assurance will focus on privacy-first verification, real-time risk assessment, and seamless identity tracking across devices.</p>



 
 On-Device Processing reduces reliance on external servers, lowering the risk of data breaches while improving speed. 



 Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow platforms to confirm a user meets age requirements without storing or sharing unnecessary details. 



 Decentralized ID Systems let users verify their age once and carry a reusable digital credential across platforms instead of repeatedly submitting documents. 
 



<p>These advancements strengthen security while putting users in control of their own data.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6744feebc0a25d54cc2e59c9">(From Liminal’s White Paper: The Age-Verified Internet – Strategies for Safer Online Experiences, Page 6)</a></p>



 



 Real-Time Audience Segmentation 



<p>Most age verification happens once at sign-up, but<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6744feebc0a25d54cc2e59c9?"> AI is enabling continuous, real-time adjustments</a> based on user behavior and risk factors.</p>



 
 Platforms can dynamically modify access based on content type, location, or browsing behavior. 



 If an account shows patterns consistent with a minor trying to bypass restrictions, additional verification can be triggered. 
 



<p>This approach helps businesses enforce age-appropriate access without disrupting legitimate users.</p>



 



 Cross-Device Identity Graphing 



<p>Users frequently switch between devices, and traditional verification methods struggle to keep up.<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6793d5a61392f72de1cc2348"> AI-driven identity graphing</a> helps platforms connect identities across multiple devices to ensure consistent age restrictions.</p>



 
 Fraudsters attempting to bypass verification on a new device can be flagged. 



 Minors using multiple accounts to avoid restrictions can be identified. 



 Users can verify their age once and maintain access across all their devices without repeating the process. 
 



<p>By eliminating gaps in identity verification, businesses can maintain security without frustrating legitimate users.</p>



 



 Conclusion 



<p>AI has transformed age verification from a slow, manual process into an instant, automated system that improves security and privacy without increasing friction. Facial recognition, behavioral analysis, and fraud detection tools have made verification faster and more reliable, reducing reliance on outdated document-based checks.</p>



<p>For businesses, this shift isn’t just about convenience. AI-driven solutions help companies stay compliant with evolving regulations, prevent fraud, and protect minors from accessing restricted content. More importantly, they play a critical role in trust and safety, ensuring that platforms can verify users without compromising privacy or creating unnecessary barriers.</p>



<p>The future of digital identity will be privacy-first, with on-device verification, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized credentials allowing users to prove their age without oversharing personal data. The question isn’t if AI will power age assurance but how businesses will use it responsibly and ethically. For businesses that want to stay ahead, the message is clear: Adapt now, or struggle to keep up later.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 We sat down with the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer at Holvi, a leading digital banking service for freelancers and small businesses, to discuss fraud, compliance, and the strategies needed to stay ahead in an evolving financial landscape.  



<p>As an avid sailor, René knows that navigating risks is all about reading the conditions, adjusting course and staying prepared for unpredictable challenges.</p>



<p>“There’s no business without risk – it’s just part of the game,” says René. And in the financial industry, it’s a high-stakes game with ever-changing rules, where the cost of losing is staggering. In fact, <a href="https://www.gasa.org/post/global-state-of-scams-report-2024-1-trillion-stolen-in-12-months-gasa-feedzai">$1.03 trillion was lost to scams globally in 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/">between €715 billion and €1.87 trillion of global GDP</a> is tainted by money laundering each year – an amount so massive it rivals the economy of entire countries like Italy or Switzerland.</p>



<p>The risk is not just a challenge, but an existential threat that can erode customer trust, destroy businesses and fuel further crime. Every laundered euro is not just a loss on a balance sheet, but also in human lives, as it funds human trafficking, terrorism, drug trade and more, devastating real lives of entire communities.</p>



<p>Plus, the opponents are relentless – always innovative, mastering the art of exploiting vulnerable individuals through psychological manipulation and constantly finding new attack techniques – even as regulations tighten. “In this era, new fraud patterns arise and disappear faster than static processes and systems can evolve,” René explain. Traditional fraud prevention simply can’t keep up. Especially now with the rise of AI-driven fraud and synthetic identities, it’s like racing against a fleet of expert sailors in ever-changing winds. The right strategy isn’t just about reacting to sudden gusts, but about reading the conditions, adjusting sails early, and maintaining an edge to stay ahead of the competition. For René, the only way forward is to fight fire with fire, with “detection and analysis capabilities needing to make use for the same technology” in order to keep pace and eventually overtake malicious actors.</p>



<p>For René, the key to success isn’t eliminating risk – it’s managing it. “You need to see the full picture, not just individual threats. Some risks are worth taking, while others need to be mitigated.” </p>



<p>Just as in a regatta, where a sailor may take a longer route to catch the best wind or make tactical manoeuvres to gain an advantage, navigating risk in finance means knowing when to hold steady and when to change course. So, there’s always a trade-off: security versus customer experience, compliance versus agility; “Balancing security with a smooth customer experience is always a challenge, especially in a regulated industry,” René acknowledges. </p>



<blockquote><p>Some friction is unavoidable, but what matters is how we handle it – making sure it’s transparent and makes sense to the customer.</p>René Hofer, Chief Risk and Compliance Officer at Holvi.</blockquote>



<p>In fact, friction can sometimes be positive, as it can reassure customers that the process is thorough. And<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/can-friction-improve-your-customers-experiences/"> research shows that when friction enables decisions</a>, customer satisfaction can improve. Ultimately, this approach ensures that the balance between efficiency and trust is maintained. “At the end of the day, safety comes first. There’s no way around that,” says René.</p>



<p>This challenge is further complicated by a fragmented regulatory landscape. Even within the European Union there are countries like Germany enforcing strict regulatory measures under the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/aml-compliance-2024-amld6/">GDPR and AML directives</a> while other countries such as Ireland offer more flexible interpretations of these rules. “Honestly, it’s frustrating,” René admits. “Identity verification should be standardized, but it’s not – so we work with flexible solutions that adapt to local requirements without adding unnecessary complexity for customers.”</p>



<p>Staying ahead of evolving regulations is like sailing in unpredictable waters – you don’t always know when the wind will shift, but you must be ready to adjust your sails. Only those who anticipate changes and prepare accordingly will keep moving forward instead of being caught adrift. “It’s about being informed and ready to adapt,” says René. “You can’t predict every regulatory change, but you can build a system that adapts. That means staying ahead of trends, designing flexible processes, and making compliance part of everyday decision-making.”</p>



<p>Businesses must leverage technology and the expertise behind it, with software providers acting as key teammates in staying connected with regulatory bodies for timely product updates. “We rely on tech, strong data sources, and – most importantly – people who know how to interpret and act on that information. Regulations will always change, so the best approach is to embed flexibility into how we operate rather than treating compliance as something we “catch up on” later.”</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, René remains optimistic. The financial industry, regulators and businesses all share the same mission: securing a trustworthy financial ecosystem. The key is collaboration. “If you demand adaptability, show that you’re willing to adapt, too,” he advises. “Engage early, share insights and build relationships based on transparency.”</p>



<p>The challenge of risk and compliance is never over, and the conditions will always shift. But as René puts it, the real question isn’t whether businesses can avoid rough seas – it’s whether they’re charting a course for success or just trying to stay afloat.</p>

 The State of Digital ID — DICE 2025&nbsp;(Zurich) <p>Digital wallets remain the cutting edge of innovation in the field of digital identity — and Europe is leading the way in terms of policy development, technical innovation, and ecosystem building. On Tuesday the European Commission released the latest draft of the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/architecture-and-reference-framework-main/">Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a>, the technical guidance for the standards and protocols that European digital wallets (EUDI) are expected to follow. But the ARF is not legislation, which creates complications — and opportunities — for policymakers, developers, and issue advocates.</p><p>At the <a href="https://lu.ma/DICEecosystems?coupon=RWX2NO">Digital unConference Europe</a> (DICE), the conversations and sessions were dominated by the EU wallet and its implications. The conference’s focus on building “ecosystems” is an important reminder that <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-difference-between-digital-identity-identification-and-id-41580bbb7563">digital ID is not a thing or a consumable product</a>, but a tool people use to achieve transaction goals. The key to the value of a digital ID scheme is what you can do with it. And key to what you can do with a digital wallet is who will trust its credentials and rely on it as proof of the claim that you make (that you are who you say you are and can do what you say you can do). This tripartite structure of issuers, holders, and relying parties is the core of an identification ecosystem.</p><p>Privacy and security: The EU efforts to develop a digital wallet offer one of the most cutting-edge efforts to implement societal scale digital identity systems — and importantly, one that aims to put users in control of their data. Yet the EUDI is far from perfect, and the tension between political imperatives and technical design remains. The reliance on government-issued personal identification data as the EUDI’s foundational credential has raised concerns about the potential for surveillance through linking usage of the credentials, and thus revealing the identity and/or behaviors of the holder. For example, usage of the credential to prove age might reveal a taste for alcohol, or specific bar or alcohol preferences. As DICE participants noted, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viky-manaila-%F0%9F%92%AF-0690aa1_arf-eidas-digitalwallet-activity-7302800180255350784-4egH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAACNrMoBVJwvORPlthLv_lXtpRTGBvHXfK8">the ARF 1.6 has measures on privacy</a>, but has not yet resolved the issue if unlinkability and this traceability.</p><p>The exclusion of cryptographic technologies such as Zero Knowledge Proofs (excluded because they are not (yet) included in the list of approved electronic signature technologies) also means that the current specification for the wallet exclude the use of technologies that could mitigate these concerns — an exclusion that persists in the latest ARF. These specifications are critical in determining how user-centric and protective the EUDI wallet will be. They are also going to be significant in their wider adoption and interoperability — the Swiss specification requires the possibility for unlinkability, for example..</p><p>Governance vs. technology: One significant theme of the conference was the tension between relying on governance and regulation versus technological solutions, particularly in regard to privacy and protection. The current ARF limits the use of advanced cryptographic technologies, and so relies on regulation to prevent issuers encoding trackers into credentials. This is a weak form of protection. What happens if those rules are no longer followed? Also, what happens when the wallet is adopted in places where the rule of law is weak or authorities surveil&nbsp;users?</p><p>Cross-border ecosystems: The question of ecosystem and standards is also significant when thinking about the EUDI in the context of cross-border usage and as part of a global ecosystem of digital identification. The EUDI wallet is currently designed for European citizens and legal residents. While a core use case is intra-European travel, the wallet’s potential is far broader than that. There has already been discussion about its potential to <a href="https://ecdpm.org/work/tech-sovereignty-and-new-eu-foreign-economic-policy">complement European foreign policy</a> and for it to hold <a href="https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/19/09/2024/digital-public-infrastructure-sovereignty-what-european-approach-dpi-might-look">an infrastructural “Brussels effect.” </a>This is not just idle speculation — <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/georgia-seeks-candidates-to-build-digital-id-wallet">Georgia is already developing its own digital identity wallet using the European framework</a>. But for the European wallet to really function as part of a global ecosystem will require thinking through how to answer cross-border and migration questions such&nbsp;as:</p>  How would a European hospital trust a digital credential claiming medical expertise when hiring a doctor from outside the&nbsp;EU?  How would a university trust digital educational credentials issued from a non-European academic institution?  <p>Currently, these verifications are often manual processes — a phone call is made to the issuing medical institution or university, or the individual has to pass national tests to requalify. Digitalizing this broader ecosystem could enable easier migration and access to employment and education.</p><p>Digital identity is an ecosystem, one in which issuers, holders, and verifiers are the core actors. Building out these trust frameworks is key to realizing the potential — and mitigating the risks — of innovation in digital identification. If the EUDI wallet is to be an enabler of cross-border movement, and supporter of the migration and expertise that Europe needs, these challenges must be addressed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-state-of-digital-id-dice-2025-zurich-0f35491a2e5d">The State of Digital ID — DICE 2025 (Zurich)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  AI-generated job applications are flooding the hiring process—can verifiable digital credentials restore trust in employment records?

<p>Getting job seekers into the right roles and incentivizing residents to develop skills both have huge implications for a region's economic productivity and residents' happiness. Online networking and application platforms have made hiring <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/647831/recruitment-process-digital-ever.aspx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">far more effective</a> in the 21st century, but the use of artificial intelligence by job applicants threatens to undermine that progress.</p><p>Now, Verifiable Digital Credentials supporting Digital Learning and Employment Records, or LERs, are being used across the U.S. in hopes of rescuing the hiring process while making it easier than ever to reliably connect skilled workers with employers who need them. LERs are digital documents controlled by the holder and verifiable with an issuer’s cryptographic signature.&nbsp;</p><p>That means employers can trust that a diploma, certification, or past employment record is trustworthy without the shockingly laborious process of verifying it directly with the issuer — even when the credential is presented online. The possibilities for making hiring more efficient and effective are hard to overstate — but trustworthy credentials are bigger than that. Their adoption would make skills-based training courses more significant in the hiring process, incentivizing more lifelong learning and ultimately creating a more skilled workforce and vibrant economy.</p> A New Foundation for Digital Trust <p>Digital Education and Learning Credentials can now take the form of Verifiable Digital Credentials, or VDCs. VDCs are an innovation that uses cryptography to create trustworthy and non-duplicable digital documents whose source and authenticity are confirmed by cryptographic signatures that can be verified in person or online. VDC technology is already used to secure Mobile Driver's Licenses (mDL), which are being <a href="https://www.aamva.org/jurisdiction-data-maps?ref=blog.spruceid.com#anchorformdlmap">rapidly adopted</a> in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>These trustworthy digital documents are beginning to be used to record and verify educational and employment credentials, from one-off training workshops to certifications to advanced degrees. Systems using LERs to connect job seekers to employers are in the very early stages, but they’re being piloted in collaboration with employers and educators, such as by <a href="https://workshift.org/alabama-bets-big-on-a-talent-marketplace/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Alabama’s Credential Registry</a> and the <a href="https://workshift.org/in-push-for-skills-based-hiring-colorado-invests-in-new-tech-and-a-new-language-of-learning/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Colorado Workforce Development Council</a>.&nbsp;</p> Fighting Credential Fraud <p>The first problem that LERs can help solve is one perhaps as old as civilization itself. As much as we would love to trust our fellow human beings, the fact is that job searchers, to put it politely, embellish credentials and experience at an alarming rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on which study you read, anywhere <a href="https://www.pcma.org/hiring-resume-liar?ref=blog.spruceid.com">from 25%</a> to a shocking <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2023/11/05/70-of-workers-lie-on-resumes-new-study-shows/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">70% of job applicants</a> admit to lying on a resume. Surprisingly, according to a survey by ResumeLab, candidates with more credentials, like a Masters degree or a PhD, are significantly more likely to lie.</p><p>Actively rooting out such deceptions is unsustainably time-consuming – one medical firm surveyed for our Colorado project reported using <a href="https://workshift.org/in-push-for-skills-based-hiring-colorado-invests-in-new-tech-and-a-new-language-of-learning/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">17 different systems to vet applicants</a>. Advice for recruiters trying to detect fraud reflects the hopelessness of the situation, leaning heavily on nostrums like <a href="https://www.pcma.org/hiring-resume-liar/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">“trust your gut.”</a></p><p>Quite obviously, that’s not good enough. Hiring the wrong person is <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9066-cost-of-bad-hire.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">very costly</a>, wasteful, and disruptive for any given firm - and it happens all the time, adding headwinds to entire economies.</p> The Recruiting AI-Pocalypse <p>The appearance of powerful “large language models” like ChatGPT in the past two years has added even more challenges to the job search and recruiting process. By making it easier to create materials like cover letters and resumes, LLMs have unleashed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/30a032dd-bdaa-4aee-bc51-754867abbde0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">a flood of applications</a>. According to recruiters and firms, as many as half of all job applicants are using AI for cover letters or other elements of their job materials.</p><p>The disjointed or odd output of many LLMs makes these AI applications relatively easy to detect (and reject) when a human reviews them. However, application spam is severely disrupting the work of recruiters seeking top-quality candidates and even increasing the risk of deceptive job applications since LLMs have a tendency to “hallucinate” data, even if an applicant had no intention to deceive.</p><p>“We’re definitely seeing higher volume and lower quality, which means it is harder to sift through [applications],” recruiting firm CEO Khyati Sundaram recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/facac60f-dbe7-4889-b76a-7ec1dc1f2e2c?ref=blog.spruceid.com">told the Financial Times</a>. By making it even harder and slower to fill open roles, AI spam adds another drag on innovation, profits, and growth.</p><p>In some jurisdictions, AI can be used to screen and categorize applications (ironically helping to address the problem that it has created). In others, including the entire European Union, automating job application processing is <a href="https://knowledge.dlapiper.com/dlapiperknowledge/globalemploymentlatestdevelopments/2024/eu-ai-act-to-enter-into-force-implications-for-employers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tightly restricted</a>.</p><p>However, under either circumstance, recruiters should aim to apply nuanced human judgment as often and carefully as possible. LERs help maximize human choice by making it much easier to confirm that the information an applicant submits is actually accurate.</p> How do Digital Credentials Work? <p>LERs and other Verifiable Digital Credentials are <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">digital records with cryptographic “seals”</a> that affirm their authenticity and prevent them from being copied or stolen. VDCs are stored and managed by digital wallet software similar to Apple Pay and can be presented over the internet, either sent as part of an application or integrated into a job marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, a chef or server could attach a trustworthy food handler’s license as part of an application to a restaurant without the restaurant having to verify its validity separately. Digital credentials can also contain detailed information, such as an applicant’s performance in a course, making selecting between applicants easier than relying on self-reported claims. This combination of speed, reach, and trustworthiness means recruiters can reliably find the best applications without worrying if they’re misleading.&nbsp;</p><p>But LERs also stand to increase the quality of the talent pool itself over time, by making training more transparent and actionable. “What gets measured, gets managed” is a truism often attributed to management guru Peter Drucker, and it applies to individuals as much as organizations: a certification is more appealing to learners if it leads to a permanent, detailed, shareable record likely to have a real impact on their future.</p><p>Like many systems, LER adoption for job credentials has something of a chicken-and-egg problem: both credential issuance and credential acceptance have to be in place for either one to be effective. That’s a major reason states are leading the way: they’re in a position to push forward both sides of the market.&nbsp;</p> Building Better Job Markets <p>The path to fully implementing verifiable digital work and education credentials for job searchers may be a long one—coordinating educators, employers, and systems will be challenging. But LERs are based on existing <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/relevant-standards-and-implementation-guidelines?ref=blog.spruceid.com">open and interoperable technical standards</a>, meaning there are already agreed-on “rails” for building them, and first movers won’t risk being left behind by future progress.</p><p>The trust created by better credentialing systems will help recruiters fight AI spam, put workers in the right jobs, and maximize the benefit of education. Early movers, such as the most innovative states, universities, and employers, stand to pull ahead of competitors who follow - both in shaping the future of these systems and in reaping their benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re interested in exploring the possibilities, <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">please reach out: SpruceID is ready to help</a>.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Strict. Expensive. Complex. Is the German online gaming market even worth entering? IDnow’s VP of Global Gaming joins other industry experts to explore the state of play in what could be the European country with the most untapped potential. 



<p>When compared to other European countries, Germany’s online gambling market is in its infancy, still taking its first steps. In fact, it was just July 2021 when the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielstaatsvertrag</a>&nbsp; (German Interstate Treaty on Gambling) came into effect, which effectively legalized and regulated it across all 16 states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four years later, the industry is worth about <a href="https://sigma.world/news/the-german-gaming-market-could-reach-e5-14-billion-in-2024/">€3 billion per annum</a>. Although certainly a decent amount, when compared to more mature markets like the UK, which generates around €<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/industry-statistics-november-2024-official-statistics">8.3 billion of annual income</a>, it is rather underwhelming, especially considering there are 15 million more people in Germany than the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/02/germanys-2024-gambling-tax-revenue-holds-steady-at-e2-49-billion">Reasons for Germany’s sluggish growth</a> in the online gaming market range from low deposit limits, heavy advertising restrictions, major compliance burdens, and, of course, the struggle to tempt players away from the black market, which still remains incredibly popular in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested in how Germany is attempting to tackle unregulated gambling, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany’ blog</a>.</p>



<p>In February 2025, to explore the challenges facing operators, and share strategies on how to capitalize on the complex but lucrative market, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, VP of Global Gaming at IDnow attended a webinar with Dimitry Voelkle, Managing Director at Zelda Consulting GmbH and Faruk Aydin, Chief Revenue Officer at the <a href="https://revpanda.com">Revpanda Group</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Missed it? Don’t worry – here are our top 3 takeaways:</p>



 1. Strict regulations can be both a blessing and a curse. 



<p>If you want to become a major player in Europe, it’s essential to have a presence in Germany. However, it’s safe to say that that won’t be easy. In fact, there are many German regulations and requirements that could put operators, especially international operators, off.</p>



<blockquote><p>I always say that regulation is good if the regulation is good. The fact remains that <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2023/11/14/german-atlas-cites-disorder/">in 2007, 55% of the German population</a> gambled but that figure dropped to 30% in 2021 following the introduction of regulations. The German regulator must ask itself why this happened.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, VP of Global Gaming at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>There is a long list of requirements that operators must follow to become a licensed gaming operator in Germany. For example, besides ensuring onboarding and registration processes comply with strict BaFin AML directives, operators must also obtain an annual ISO 27001 security audit certificate. Further requirements include needing to be headquartered in Germany and have German language proficiency to fill out license applications in the native language. Other potentially off-putting stipulations include:</p>



<p>Deposit limits: Players are only able to deposit a maximum of €1,000 per month across all licensed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stake limits: Players can bet a maximum of €1 per spin on slots and must wait 5 seconds between spins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Game restrictions: German players that have migrated from unlicensed platforms – of which there are still millions – may find their favorite game unavailable as live casino games, progressive jackpots and live bets are all prohibited on regulated platforms. Not being able to offer players their favorite game is, of course, an additional challenge for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advertising: Operators are subject to very narrow windows within which to advertise. No ads can be broadcast between 6am-9pm on TV, radio or any other medium. Influencer marketing is also prohibited, as are ads that target minors or other vulnerable groups.</p>

 2. Money’s too vast to [not] mention. 



<p>There is one thing that prospective operators need in abundance before they begin their German gaming journey (besides patience!): money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After paying a non-refundable application fee of €185,000 to the Gemeinsame Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (GGL), operators can gain a license, which is typically valid for 5 years, but can be renewed for 7. However, the financial outlay doesn’t stop there. German gaming operators are also required to pay a so-called ‘security deposit,’ which acts as a bank guarantee to protect player funds. Based on the operator’s projected monthly turnover, this can range from the minimum of €5 million to €50 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t stop there. Alongside the <a href="https://www.affiversemedia.com/tripling-cost-of-player-acquisition-in-igaming-builds-stronger-focus-for-retention/">tripling cost of player acquisition</a>, there are annual supervisory fees, which operators must pay to cover GGL’s regulatory oversight and additional compliance costs like connecting to the ‘limit control database’ to enforce the €1,000 monthly deposit limit, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, operators are subject to quite high taxes, with a 5.3% stake tax applied to every single euro wagered. In a bid to offset these costs, many resort to lowering the ‘return-to-player’ percentage (the amount paid back to players).&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, with a population of over 84 million and vast numbers of the public still using black market platforms, there is clearly opportunity for those that a) have the patience and money to enter and b) can tempt black market players to the regulated environment. But how exactly can operators do that?</p>



 3. Always room for something new and novel. 



<p>There are still opportunities in the German online gaming market, especially for those that can offer something different to underserved demographics, such as the younger (20-30 years of age), multicultural generation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is because much of the current marketing – and available games – cater to an older audience. So, if operators can offer the games that people want to play (e.g. Book of Ra), and a simplified, compliant user experience then there are valuable opportunities to capture the attention of a new generation of Germans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At IDnow, we see compliance as an enabler not a burden. One of the major reasons we offer player feedback surveys after every verification is to discover what players value, which then informs the tweaks we make to the user experience and subsequent player education. Through player feedback, we learn whether more instructions are required and gather opinions and issues with the design and UX etc,” said Roger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Germany is such a comparatively young market, creating an environment that is attractive to the players, operators and the regulator requires open and transparent dialogue about how to take the market forward.</p>

It lets conversations continue, while helping to make pattern recognition and emotional intelligence possible for AI assistants.</p><p>However, designing an effective memory system is much harder than it might seem. It’s actually one of the biggest challenges facing the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> industry right now.</p> <p>I’m Simon Westh Henriksen, Co-Founder of <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>. As CTO, I’m dedicated to making Kin the most personal, private, and trustworthy AI assistant we can - all while showing why this technology is cutting-edge along the way.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd61ef68-2503-4874-a8ad-7d02cbb6d1af_997x997.jpeg">   </a> <p><a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/simonhenriksen">Follow me on LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kinpersonalai">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://x.com/simonhenriksen">X</a> - or join Kin’s <a href="https://discord.gg/PYMyz6uRct">Discord</a></p> <p>That’s because, at the end of the day, AI chatbots are at their most intuitive when they can be spoken to like a human. But the natural adaptiveness, selectivity, and overall power of the human memory is easy to take for granted - especially when you’re building an AI’s memory from scratch to support it.</p><p>AI memory must be intentionally designed to balance a number of things humans naturally handle, like:</p>  <p>recall</p>  <p>forgetting (yes, really)</p>  <p>contextual awareness</p>  <p>ethical considerations</p>  <p>All so it can feel natural to talk to, while still serving as a reliable and private data store.</p><p>So, let’s talk about what makes that so difficult - that’ll let us home in on particular problems (and Kin’s solutions) in our next articles.</p> Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">personal AI</a> needs to be (slightly) forgetful <p>Human memory, as we all know, cannot perfectly recall everything. Instead, memories our brains deem ‘less significant’ often fade away unless they are refreshed - following a pattern mapped out by scientific models like the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.<a>1</a></p><p>A personal AI needs to do something similar - remembering what matters, while allowing irrelevant or outdated information to fade away.</p><p>However, it’s not that simple. Given the AI’s role to support human memory, and its artificial nature as an AI chatbot, things can get complicated.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Remembering too much information leads to cluttered storage and outdated facts, which can cause inefficient memory processing.</p>  <p>Forgetting too much risks losing essential context, leading to unnatural and frustrating interactions.</p>  <p>Should AI memory decay naturally over time? Or would it be more helpful remembering every important memory, and just filtering out trivial facts?</p>  <p>How can AI determine the importance of a memory? A user saying “I just had lunch” should not be treated the same as “I just got married” - but either one could be important in conversations.</p>   (Some) facts evolve, and your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companion</a> needs to know that <p>As humans, we constantly update our beliefs and opinions based on new experiences. And sometimes, they change for no reason at all.</p><p>When this information changes, it’s often easy for us to update our memories without a second thought. We know when new changes must replace old information (“I got a new job”), and when multiple things can be true at once (“I have a dog (but also a cat)”).</p><p>However, when building an AI’s memory, we have to decide how it does that.</p><p>Personal AI needs to manage this systematically, efficiently, and transparently - all while staying smooth and intuitive for users. That creates the following problems.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>If a user first says, "my favorite color is red," and later says, "my favorite color is blue," does the AI replace the old fact or track how preferences evolve?</p>  <p>If a user states, "I work at Company A," and later, "I work at Company B," should the AI assume a job change, or does the user have multiple jobs? Should it ask?</p>  <p>Some facts naturally expire and evolve (“I live in Paris” can change with a move). How should AI track and update evolving facts?</p>  <p>If a user mentions “Karen” multiple times, but refers to different people, how does AI differentiate between them without mistakes or constant questioning?</p>   How you understand context needs to be taught to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> <p>Human memory doesn’t just store facts - it also stores context around them. We remember details differently based on emotional importance, sensory input, and relevance, to name a few.</p><p>You may recognise a pattern here: this is yet another thing we do subconsciously that an AI’s memory needs to be designed to do across different languages and cultures. These are some of the issues that come with that.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>How much detail should be stored? Should it capture every word of a conversation, or extract key themes? How are misinterpretations prevented?</p>  <p>How should AI determine relevance? Should it weigh emotionally significant moments more heavily? Or is it more situational than that?</p>  <p>Can AI dynamically adjust memory depth, summarizing older interactions while keeping recent ones detailed? Where is the cut-off point for ‘older’?</p>  <p>How should AI group memories into episodes? For instance, an event like “My wedding” consists of multiple related memories - how does AI cluster them into a coherent narrative?</p>   <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistants</a> work with many types of data <p>Memory for personal AI isn’t limited to conversational interactions.</p><p>Users may share <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/anxiety-journaling-complete-guide">Journal entries</a>, images, documents, health data, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/the-kinside-scoop-2">calendar events</a>, and external articles, to name a few.</p><p>A truly personal AI must not only learn from anything that is shared with it, but also understand why the user shared it, then make and record the appropriate insights.</p><p>Here’s an idea of the unique challenges each data type comes with.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Conversational Memory: Correctly interpreting and recording tone, intent, and context.</p>  <p>External Media: Determining the user’s interest, concern, or agreement with shared content, and its relevance to any current conversations.</p>  <p>Journals and Notes: Balancing privacy with deep learning insights.</p>  <p>Health Data: Processing trends and ensuring understanding while ensuring user privacy.</p>  <p>Calendar Data: Aligning memory with real-world commitments and priorities.</p>  <p>Events as entities: Recognizing events like “TechCrunch 2025”, and understanding them as time-sensitive memories.</p>   Time is even more confusing for <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a> than it is for you <p>Human memory naturally organizes events in a time-based sequence - but even we often struggle with ambiguous time frames like ‘soon’ or ‘next year.’</p><p>For natural conversation, an AI must interpret these vague and contextual words correctly most of the time - and do so across all the languages it supports. Otherwise, it’ll be much harder to discuss things like <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management</a> with it.</p><p>Developing the robust temporal models to track these kinds of evolving user interactions comes with many difficulties, including the following.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>"I’m fixing my bike soon" vs. "I’m having a baby soon" - the meaning of "soon" changes drastically with context.</p>  <p>Should an AI prioritize recent memories over older ones when making decisions?</p>  <p>How should an AI handle evolving plans, such as tracking a trip from early planning to completion?</p>  <p>How should an AI handle memories with varying levels of time specificity (year, year+month, exact date)? Would a ‘time-tree’ structure help?</p>   Your personal AI doesn’t know how memories should be strengthened <p>Certain memories stick with us more than others due to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-build-emotional-intelligence">emotional significance</a>, repetition, and personal importance.</p><p>An AI must mimic this selective reinforcement well enough for its memory to allow useful and natural conversations to take place, like <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations">preparing for a difficult conversation at work.</a></p><p>Predictably, that means we run into a few important questions as we figure out exactly what methods should be used to do this.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Should an AI reinforce memories based on repetition, emotional markers, or explicit user signals? If it should be a mix, what percentage of each should be used?</p>  <p>Should an AI infer importance based on user engagement, such as frequent references to a topic?</p>  <p>How can an AI mimic human-like recall, where some memories are instantly accessible while others require effort to retrieve? Should it even try?</p>  <p>Can an AI store emotions related to memories, and recognize that emotionally-charged experiences often have stronger retention?</p>   AI assistants don’t have human brains (for memory storage) like you <p>The human brain is a sophisticated memory storage and retrieval system - one an AI can’t take advantage of directly.</p><p>Instead, an AI memory requires structured storage techniques to be designed and implemented into it by hand.</p><p>Creating the right data model for efficient retrieval is critical to ensuring relevant, accurate interactions - and of course, isn’t straightforward.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Should an AI use a fixed data schema (structure), or an adaptive format that evolves over time?</p>  <p>How can an AI efficiently retrieve relevant parts of past interactions, without overwhelming users with unnecessary details?</p>  <p>Vector databases can allow for information like memories to be searched for through understanding a search’s meaning and intent, rather than just its keywords (semantic search). But how should an AI ensure it doesn’t under- or over-interpret the search, and skew the results?</p>  <p>Graph-based memory can help track relationships - but does it make recollection too complex?</p>  <p>Hybrid models combine structured and unstructured data, but balancing them effectively requires careful design. Is it worth the effort?</p>  <p>How can an AI dynamically prioritize the most relevant memories, outside of choosing the most recent or most-frequently discussed/recalled?</p>  <p>Should an AI generate memories based on data inferences (e.g. “User seems to enjoy hiking based on this discussion about it”)? How do we distinguish inferred knowledge from explicit facts?</p>   <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> only has the morality and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> we give it <p>As personal AI becomes more trusted and more effective with its memory, the ethical questions of what it will do with its user’s personal data, and how it will protect the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a> of it, will only grow.</p><p>For an AI to reach its full potential as a personal assistant, its users must fully trust that their data is handled responsibly and transparently. Otherwise, the AI will never be told everything it needs to provide an individual and insightful service.</p><p>The privacy and security of AI data is already one of the most-discussed issues in the industry, but developing a memory system also brings additional challenges.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>How can developers ensure an AI’s memory will be secure and respect sensitive user data?</p>  <p>Users should be able to view and edit what the AI remembers easily. How can this be made robust and intuitive?</p>  <p>AI must avoid reinforcing harmful biases through selective memory retention. How can this be reduced, and the AI taught to recognise and repair it if it happens?</p>  <p>Who controls the AI’s memories—the user or the platform?

<p>Ethereum DAOs are changing the game in the world of blockchain, and they’re definitely worth paying attention to. If you’re into DAO Ethereum, you’re witnessing the next evolution of decentralization. These organizations are built on Ethereum’s blockchain and give power back to the community, making decisions together in a transparent, fair, and automated way. Let’s break it down and see why this is the future.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/discover-what-an-ethereum-etf-is/">Discover What an Ethereum ETF Is</a> </p>



 What Is a DAO Ethereum? 



<p>A DAO Ethereum is an organization that’s run by its community and operates without any central authority. Instead of one person or group calling the shots, DAO Ethereum is powered by its members. Decisions are made through proposals, which are voted on by token holders. Everything is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, which means it’s fully transparent, and everyone can see the process in action.</p>



<p>In simple terms, DAO Ethereum is an organization that runs on code. Smart contracts take care of all the decision-making, making it more automated, secure, and trustworthy than traditional models. If you hold governance tokens, you have a say in how things run. It’s about collective control and participation.</p>


 
 


 Why DAO Ethereum is Gaining Popularity 



<p>DAOs are exciting because they’re shifting the power dynamic. Instead of relying on a small group of people to make decisions, DAO Ethereum puts control in the hands of the community. Whether it’s a DeFi project, an NFT marketplace, or a community fund, DAO Ethereum gives everyone a chance to get involved and contribute to the organization’s growth.</p>



<p>Ethereum DAOs are also game-changers because they offer complete transparency. Every decision made, every vote cast, is available for anyone to review on the blockchain. It’s decentralized, autonomous, and open for anyone to join. This kind of accountability and transparency simply doesn’t exist in traditional organizations.</p>

 The Rise of Ethereum DAOs 



<p>Ethereum DAOs have come a long way since the infamous The DAO hack in 2016. Back then, The DAO was a groundbreaking project designed to create a decentralized venture fund, but it was hacked and lost millions of dollars. It was a tough lesson for the Ethereum community, but it led to major improvements in Ethereum’s security.</p>



<p>Since then, Ethereum DAOs have evolved significantly. DAO Ethereum projects today are more secure, better structured, and have a much stronger community. As Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to grow, DAO Ethereum is becoming an essential part of how we govern decentralized projects, especially in DeFi and NFTs.</p>



 4 Key Features of DAO Ethereum 



<p>Here’s the thing—DAO Ethereum isn’t just a cool idea, it’s a functional way to run organizations. Here’s what makes it stand out:</p>



 
 Decentralization: No single person or group controls the decisions. It’s all about the community and the collective power of its members. 



 Transparency: Every decision, vote, and action is recorded on the blockchain. You can literally see everything happen in real-time. 



 Autonomy: Smart contracts handle the operations. No need for middlemen, no delays, everything happens automatically. 



 Inclusivity: Anyone with tokens can participate. It’s an open system where your voice matters, whether you’re a whale or a small holder. 
 


 
 


 Ethereum DAOs and Their Role in DeFi and NFTs 



<p>Ethereum DAOs have become integral to the world of DeFi. Projects like MakerDAO, Uniswap, and Compound rely on DAO Ethereum governance to make important decisions about protocol changes, fees, and more. Without DAO Ethereum, there’s no community-driven development in DeFi.</p>



<p>But it’s not just DeFi that’s benefiting from Ethereum DAOs. The NFT world is also getting a taste of decentralized governance. Projects like ConstitutionDAO showed that DAOs could be used to pool resources and make collective decisions about assets. Whether it’s creating NFTs or managing a collection, DAO Ethereum provides a framework for governance and decision-making.</p>



 The Challenges Ethereum DAOs Face 



<p>Of course, DAO Ethereum isn’t without its challenges. Here are some hurdles they need to overcome:</p>



 
 Security: Smart contracts can be exploited, and while Ethereum DAOs are improving, they’re still vulnerable to hacks. 



 Centralization: In some DAOs, a few people hold a lot of the governance tokens, which can create a power imbalance. 



 Legal Uncertainty: DAOs exist in a legal grey area. There’s no clear legal framework for DAOs yet, which could be problematic for participants. 



 Slow Decision-Making: Because decisions require voting, it can take time for DAOs to react to fast-moving changes. This delay could be an issue during market crashes or urgent situations. 
 


 
 


 The Future of Ethereum DAOs: Scaling and Overcoming Limitations 



<p>The future of DAO Ethereum is all about scaling. As Ethereum 2.0 rolls out, DAO Ethereum will become more efficient and secure, handling larger volumes of transactions and governance proposals. Ethereum is evolving to support DAOs on a much larger scale, and with Layer 2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups, the experience will be smoother than ever.</p>



<p>DAOs will continue to grow, and as they scale, the governance models will become more sophisticated. DAO Ethereum could soon be the go-to governance model for all kinds of decentralized organizations, from financial protocols to digital art projects. It’s an exciting time to be part of the DAO Ethereum movement.</p>



 How to Get Involved in Ethereum DAOs 



<p>Getting involved in a DAO Ethereum is easier than you think. Here’s how you can join the fun:</p>



 
 Buy Governance Tokens: Most DAOs require you to hold their governance tokens to participate. Buy some tokens on an exchange or from the DAO itself. 



 Join the Community: Participate in the DAO’s discussions. This is where you can vote on proposals, suggest changes, and make your voice heard. 



 Engage with Proposals: Proposals are the heart of DAO governance. If you have an idea for improving the DAO, submit a proposal for the community to vote on. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Ethereum DAOs are leading the way in decentralized governance. They’re transparent, community-driven, and operate with smart contracts, making them more efficient than traditional systems. While there are challenges to overcome, DAO Ethereum has already proven that decentralization can work. As Ethereum grows and evolves, DAO Ethereum will be at the heart of the decentralized future.</p>

<p>Every lawyer knows the drill: a new client comes in, and compliance kicks off. You need their ID, proof of address, maybe a video call, and before you know it, the process becomes a series of emails, follow-ups, and frustration.</p>



<p>Your client starts questioning the experience, and honestly—so does your team. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>



<p>Let’s rethink compliance as an opportunity to build trust, not add friction.</p>



 



 Smooth, Secure, and Stress-Free 



<p>The key to compliance isn’t more steps—it’s the right system to handle everything efficiently. Here’s how:</p>



 
 Real-Time Risk Assessments: Sanctions and PEP screenings happen in seconds, not hours. 



 Simple Document Collection: Clients upload IDs securely, and iComply validates them instantly—no more chasing files. 



 Seamless Video Verification: Whether you prefer live peer-to-peer calls or automated verification, your client’s time is respected. 
 



<p>The result? A white-glove onboarding process that protects your firm and makes clients feel secure.</p>



 



 No More Patchwork Systems 



<p>Many firms juggle multiple tools for KYC, AML, and document management—leading to wasted time and missed details. iComply brings everything into one platform:</p>



 
 A custom-branded portal for clients. 



 Automatic alerts when you need follow-ups. 



 One-click compliance reports for audits. 
 



<p>Less juggling. More peace of mind.</p>



 



 Why This Matters 



<p>With regulators like FinCEN increasing scrutiny, law firms face mounting pressure to stay compliant. But those who streamline now get a competitive edge—faster client engagements, fewer errors, and more time for billable work.</p>



 



 The Bottom Line 



<p>When compliance works with you, not against you, it strengthens client relationships from day one. With iComply, your firm can provide a seamless, secure experience—and show clients you’re as efficient as you are trustworthy.</p>



<p>Let’s make compliance the easiest part of your client journey. Ready to see how? Reach out today.</p>

<p>Team process: A big thing that’s currently missing for Holochain is an accessible and accurate road-map displaying our progress in an easy way to understand.&nbsp; In moving toward this, one of the team’s practices since the beginning of 2025 has been discipline in estimating issues from our back-log as we work through them.&nbsp; This is allowing us to track our burn-down rate which enables us to start making predictions about when features will be completed.&nbsp; If you’ve been following these Dev Pulses, you will have seen me pointing to Github repos where you can see this work, but I know it’s quite hard to make sense of that information, especially in terms of making projections of when a given release will land.</p><p>So, our goal is to end up with a roadmap that shows the following:</p>  What features and functionality will be in upcoming Holochain releases and related tools  When these releases are to be expected  How many github issues are involved, and what’s the total story-point estimates for them  A projection based on the last 2 months story-point burn-down for weeks till completion  <p>To start with, this road-map will be updated manually on a weekly basis based on the data from our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11?ref=blog.holochain.org">github project</a>, and later we’ll get it automated.&nbsp; The tooling for getting the work done up on the website is in progress, but just as a demonstration of that, I can report that our current burn-down average is 19.3 story-points per week, and, as of the end of February there are 101 remaining story-points toward the Holochain 0.5 release, which puts that release at about 5 weeks out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a preview of how this may look on the website:&nbsp; </p><p>The point of working this way isn’t to promise a delivery date, it’s to make as transparent to the world what we know about ourselves. &nbsp; We can’t promise that other un-estimated work will get added between now and release,&nbsp; and we might also decide that we can move some of the estimated work into our 0.6 release plan.&nbsp; But we will be able to make visible where we are in the current plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain Core &amp; Networking:&nbsp;Kitsune 2 integration into Holochain core is going full steam and is about 40% done (15 estimation points out of 41).&nbsp; I’m particularly excited that included in this work are some initial scenarios to run Kitsune 2 on our Wind Tunnel testing framework.</p><p>Runtimes: Launcher is in the process of being updated to Holochain 0.4.1. We are testing release candidates with and some of our sample apps <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/kando?ref=blog.holochain.org">KanDo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">TalkingStickies</a> plus <a href="https://mewsfeed.social/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mewsfeed</a> have been published to its app library for folks to play with. Our work on the next version of the Android runtime that will be used on the Volla phone for both the messaging and backup app is moving along smoothly.</p><p>Dev Tooling: scaffolding We keep steadily working on the scaffolding tool, both doing bug fixes and updates on the 0.4 &amp; 0.5 lines.&nbsp; This includes fixes to the Lit &amp; Vue templates, upgrading Vue to the default Composition API, improvements to custom handlebars templates, dependency updates, etc.&nbsp; Our intent here is to make sure that when 0.5 is released, the scaffolding will be fully ready at the same time.</p><p>Dev Docs: These last two weeks have provided a bumper crop of developer build guides: </p>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/happs/?ref=blog.holochain.org">hApps</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/dnas?ref=blog.holochain.org#use-dna-properties">DNA Properties</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/connecting-the-parts/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Connecting the Parts</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/connecting-a-front-end/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Connecting a Front End</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/calling-zome-functions?ref=blog.holochain.org">Calling Zome Functions</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/signals?ref=blog.holochain.org">Signals</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/validation/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Validation</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/capabilties/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Capabilities</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/querying-source-chains/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Querying Source Chains</a>  <p>Additional Components: We have started work on a simple tool that will be used by Holo and can be used in other contexts too, which provides connection for HTTP requests through a very simple web-gateway to a running Holochain application.&nbsp; You can track the progress of this work here: https://github.com/holochain/hc-http-gw.</p>

<p>Financial institutions face mounting risks from cyber threats, system failures, and third-party vulnerabilities. To help address these challenges, in 2023 the European Union introduced the&nbsp;<a title="Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)" href="https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en">Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</a>, a landmark regulation designed to strengthen the financial sector’s ability to withstand ICT (Information and Communication Technology) related disruptions. As the compliance deadline of January 2025 has now passed, businesses must prioritise operational resilience, and at the heart of this mandate lies the crucial need for trustworthy and reliable organisational identity.</p>
 What is DORA? 
<p>DORA was enacted on 16 January 2023 and became fully applicable on 17 January 2025. It establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital operational resilience in the EU financial sector, standardising how institutions manage ICT risks, respond to incidents, and oversee third-party service providers.</p>
<p>The regulation applies to banks, insurers, investment firms, and a broad range of financial entities, requiring them to:</p>
 
 Implement rigorous&nbsp;ICT risk management&nbsp;measures. 
 Report major ICT-related incidents in a timely manner. 
 Conduct&nbsp;digital operational resilience testing&nbsp;to identify vulnerabilities. 
 Manage risks posed by&nbsp;third-party ICT service providers. 
 Foster&nbsp;information sharing&nbsp;on cyber threats and best practices. 
 
<p>DORA seeks to ensure that financial institutions and their third-party providers maintain strong security postures to mitigate operational risks. This is particularly critical as institutions increasingly rely on third-party service providers, including cloud computing and cybersecurity service providers, for their day-to-day operations. The regulation acknowledges the growing interconnectedness of the modern financial ecosystem.</p>
 Understanding ICT in the Context of DORA 
<p>ICT, or&nbsp;Information and Communication Technology, refers to the broad range of technologies and services used to store, process, and transmit data. In the context of DORA, ICT encompasses everything from cloud computing services and data centres to cybersecurity solutions and network infrastructure. Given the increasing reliance on third-party ICT providers, ensuring their resilience and accountability is crucial for the financial sector’s stability.</p>
 The Role of Organisational Identity 
<p>One of DORA’s key provisions is the requirement for financial institutions to maintain an up-to-date register of all third-party ICT providers that support critical functions. To ensure transparency and regulatory compliance, these providers must be uniquely identifiable via an organisational identity.</p>
 LEI vs. EUID: Identifying Third-Party Providers 
<p>DORA specifies two possible organisational identifiers for third-party ICT service providers: the&nbsp;Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;European Unique Identifier (EUID).</p>
 
 LEI (Legal Entity Identifier): A globally recognised, 20-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities involved in financial transactions. The LEI enhances transparency by providing a standardised, internationally accepted means of identification. 
 EUID (European Unique Identifier): A European-based identifier primarily used within the EU’s business registry system. While useful within Europe, it lacks the global scope and interoperability of the LEI. 
 
<p>Using identifiers like the LEI or EUID can significantly improve the ability of regulators and financial institutions to track third-party ICT providers, mitigating risks associated with outsourcing and reliance on external vendors. The unique identification of ICT providers ensures accountability and supports better decision-making in operational risk management.</p>
 Why the LEI is the Stronger Choice 
<p>While both identifiers serve the purpose of organisation recognition, the LEI is the&nbsp;only&nbsp;global&nbsp;organisational identifier. Its adoption under DORA could facilitate broader compliance efforts, streamline reporting, and reduce operational risks across international supply chains. By requiring ICT service providers to register and maintain an LEI, financial institutions can ensure better data consistency, regulatory alignment with the 300+ regulations that require LEIs, and protect more effectively against identity fraud.</p>
<p>The benefits of the LEI extend beyond regulatory compliance. Because it is a universally recognised identifier, providing a live record public record of “who is who?” and “who owns whom?” it adds significant efficiency and anti-fraud value to cross-border transactions by enhancing the transparency in the global financial system. For financial institutions operating with complex group structures and across different jurisdictions, the LEI provides a reliable and globally standardised means of identifying business partners and third-party providers, with a goal of reducing the complexity of compliance across different regulatory regimes.</p>
<p>In contrast, while the EUID serves a valuable role within the EU, it is clearly designed for European residents and organisations. For example, only EU-based organisations can issue compatible digital wallets and digital credentials. This limitation makes it a partial solution at best for financial institutions engaged in global operations, where third-party providers may be based in different countries. In addition, the technical and legal specifications for organisational identities under EUID are still under heavy development and subject to change – as is the cost. Therefore, LEI arguably performs as the more versatile, readily adoptable and future-proof option for meeting DORA’s requirements.</p>
 Statistics – the impact of DORA 
<p>Although it is still early days since DORA was enacted, the Global LEI System (GLEIS) is already seeing positive impact. Since DORA went live, the LEI universe has seen substantial growth across Europe, Asia, and the Americas in key regions supporting the EU finance industry with ICT services. Comparing new LEI issuance in January 2024 to January 2025, year-on-year growth rates stand at 30% in Europe, 45% in the Americas, and 75% in Asia. While not all of this growth can be attributed solely to DORA, given the influence of over 300 other regulations requiring LEI, the immediate effect should not be overlooked.</p>

 Next steps for Financial Institutions 
<p>With the DORA compliance deadline already passed, financial institutions must act swiftly to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements. Organisations should begin by assessing their current third-party risk management frameworks and ensuring that all third-party ICT providers are properly identified using an LEI or EUID.</p>

 Data-driven Product Launch — Onfido&nbsp;Studio <p>Over the past 3 years at Onfido I’ve been involved in multiple product launches, watching their development from an idea to an MVP, to a product serving hundreds of customers and millions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Throughout the journey, very limited resources were available online, so I decided to share my own experience here.</p> Product Discovery <p>At Onfido, we use AI to automate digital identity verification for thousands of businesses worldwide. Our proprietary AI has been built over ten years by a dedicated team of hundreds of researchers, engineers and data scientists to make our analysis fair, fast and accurate. In our standard product, the verification is done using a photo of a government-issued document and matching it with facial biometrics.</p><p>We wanted to develop a new, customisable product that would fit more of our customers’ use cases and enable our customers to create their user journeys. What we wanted to achieve was a no-code product, where a customer could combine different verifications — biometric, data, fraud signals — with custom logic. This would allow our customers to trigger the right experience for every end user and respond to changing market conditions while also navigating KYC and AML compliance.</p><p>For instance, for one client receiving the same end user’s document multiple times can be a sign of fraud, while for others it can be part of their legitimate use case — reverification. A typical example of reverification is when an already onboarded user verifies themselves to make a bank transfer or recovering their account after having lost a passport. Some customers accept expired documents from specific regions. This rule can be customised using a logical condition to accommodate their requirements.</p><p>A customer can create their own verification workflow from scratch combining verification methods, configuring necessary capture steps, adding conditions and defining outcomes. A basic example of an onboarding workflow can be the following:</p>Onboarding workflow in Studio workflow&nbsp;builder<p>First, the user is asked to submit their personal information, including their first name, last name, and date of birth. In the next step, they upload a photo of their document, which is used for document verification. After that, they take a selfie for biometric verification. If both the document and selfie pass verification with no signs of fraud, the applicant is approved. If any issues are detected, the application is flagged for further&nbsp;review.</p><p>At this stage there is no data available specifically related to this product yet, however a data scientist can validate that there’s potential value by aiding market research. Could this product fill any potential gaps in the market? Could it solve some customer pain points? Does it have potential to bring&nbsp;value?</p><p>We can run different simulations on existing customer data and see how adopting Studio impact the main metrics. We can estimate how many more users can succeed the verification if we allow expired documents from certain geographies. We can calculate the average time we save for the end user if we introduce a parallel verification execution.</p> Data Strategy  Measuring Success <p>Defining metrics before a product launch is crucial for ensuring the success and scalability of the product. Metrics serve as a guiding framework to measure performance, track goals, and make informed decisions from day&nbsp;one.</p><p>While many frameworks are available, we found that none offered an out-of-the-box solution for a highly customisable B2B product. As a result, we adapted some metrics from our standard product and developed new ones to track adoption and other product-specific aspects.</p><p>High level:</p>  Usage e.g. The number of daily&nbsp;users  Outcomes e.g. The number of successful verifications, the number of fraudsters caught  <p>Adoption:</p>  The number of clients using the&nbsp;product  The number of workflows per&nbsp;client  <p>Product stability:</p>  Drop off e.g. the number of users not completing the&nbsp;workflow  Flow duration e.g. the median time it takes to complete the&nbsp;workflow  Error rate e.g. the percentage of workflows that have&nbsp;errors   Efficient Data&nbsp;Model <p>To track these metrics, the data has to be structured in a way that facilitates efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis. We started from an event based raw data which was a product requirement. The goal was to create a pivotable, aggregated and insightful data model from these events, that is simpler and faster for querying.</p><p>For the first iteration, we’ve identified the necessary event payloads based on the key metrics and product sketches. We began with the minimum viable requirements while ensuring the design remains scalable as the product evolves. We’ve established the key entities and their relationships:</p>  User (user_id, client_id)  Workflow (workflow_id, client_id, node_id)  Event (event_id, user_id, event_type, workflow_id, node_id, timestamp)  <p>An Event is associated with a User and a Workflow.</p>Brainstorming data requirements<p>We could’ve stored everything in one event table and for some use cases that would be enough. For instance, to calculate the number of document captures or to calculate how often the customers are using logical conditions.</p><p>However, often the questions we’re interested in are more complicated than that. How many users with a French ID have fraudulent selfies? To calculate this, we need to have the result of document classification from the document report node, and we need to combine that with facial similarity report result. To recap the computational steps&nbsp;needed:</p>  Group events by&nbsp;users  For each user, identify their document&nbsp;type  For each user, identify facial similarity report&nbsp;result  Aggregate users who have a French ID and fraudulent facial similarity report&nbsp;result  <p>When working with event data, our primary goal is to analyse user journeys, which consist of sequences of events. To do this effectively, we need to aggregate events within these journeys to create structured representations, on a different level such as workflow level or user level, which serve as higher-order units of analysis.</p><p>We defined tables based on the identified levels of granularity:</p>  Raw events table — the source table with raw events emitted by the Studio&nbsp;service.  <p>| Event ID | User ID | Event Type | Workflow ID | Node ID |Timestamp |</p>  We created an aggregated workflow&nbsp;table:  <p>| Workflow ID | Client ID | User ID | Result | Duration | Workflow Start Time | Workflow End Time | Document Type | Document Report Result | Bio Report Result&nbsp;|</p><p>The workflow table aggregates the event-level data down to an individual workflow level, where an example workflow starts with a user submitting their personal information and ends with either approval or review. The aggregated table contains information on the overall result as well as different verification results. It contains information on when the workflow started, when it was completed, what duration it&nbsp;had.</p><p>This modelled data is easy to work with, we can easily answer the question above with the following query:</p> SELECT COUNT(workflow_id)<br>FROM workflow_table<br>WHERE document_type = 'FRA_ID'<br>AND result = 'Abandoned' <p>This table is also of lower volume (contains fewer rows) than the raw event one, so it’s faster to query. While the raw events are typically immutable, the modelled data can change depending on business logic, resulting in adding more columns or modifying the existing&nbsp;ones.</p> Observability <p>Creating the first dashboard before a product launch was crucial for several&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Building a dashboard sometimes reveals overlooked details — such as missing event properties or gaps in the data model that make certain metrics difficult to track (a special mention to our favourite challenge: symmetric aggregates with percentiles).  Having a dashboard allows tracking key metrics from day one. It ensures that there’s a baseline we can measure our performance against.  Without dashboards, detecting and diagnosing issues can take longer. With proper monitoring in place, we can quickly spot bugs, performance bottlenecks and other unexpected behaviour during the testing&nbsp;phase.  Dashboards give stakeholders — product managers, engineers, leaders — immediate visibility into product performance.  Finally, dashboards offer real-time insights into user behaviour, engagement, and adoption. This allows for data-driven adjustments to the product, marketing strategies, and onboarding processes based on actual usage patterns.  <p>We kicked off with a team exercise to translate product requirements and key metrics into a dashboard sketch. We began by listing the questions we wanted to answer and identifying the necessary metrics, grouping them into categories such as high-level outcomes, product performance, and user behaviour.</p><p>Next, we sketched out the top-priority metrics, selecting the most suitable chart types for each. We also considered filters and interactivity — ensuring we can later refine data by date, region, SDK type, and other relevant factors. This sketching process helped us quickly align on expectations and avoid unnecessary revisions later.</p>Brainstorming the first dashboard<p>It also helped us discover missing event payloads and necessary changes to the data&nbsp;model.</p> First Beta&nbsp;Clients <p>As we finished the internal testing phase, we started offering Studio in beta to the first customers. Two good data science practices at this stage&nbsp;are:</p>  Choosing the Minimum Viable Audience wisely — these first clients were the ones who can benefit from Studio the most, the ones that needed the flexibility of creating custom workflows  Gradual Rollout allows to fix unexpected issues before they affect a lot of users. Another benefit is that simulations often don’t reflect real performance of the system, gradual rollout helps test the system under actual conditions, ensuring performance stability.  <p>The main challenge, however, wasn’t related to data science — it was ensuring we had enough table stake features to get customers adopting it. Moreover, we discovered that due to different sources for customer data we couldn’t properly track who’s interested in adopting studio and anticipate the increasing volumes.</p><p>Having dashboards provided great quantitative insights into different workflows our customers created for their use cases, however having their direct feedback was crucial. It highlighted gaps in our monitoring that we hadn’t initially considered. For example, we weren’t tracking how often customers modified their workflows, which often had an impact on SDK versions and overall outcomes.</p><p>We initially provided customers with a basic dashboard, but we quickly realised it likely won’t be sufficient for them to dive deeper into the reasons behind&nbsp;metrics.</p>Internal testing account dashboard<p>For example, customers wanted the ability to investigate whether users abandoning verification was linked to specific devices, SDK versions, or regions to improve their performance.</p><p>A highly customisable product requires providing customers with detailed insights as they navigate translating their use cases to workflows. They need the ability to optimise and fine-tune their workflows. This was the challenge we set out to solve for general availability release.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/data-driven-product-launch-onfido-studio-85cd825877be">Data-driven product launch — Onfido Studio</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What if fraud prevention was, you know, a shared effort? That’s where the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework</a> (SSF) comes in! The idea behind shared signals is simple: instead of each company detecting threats on its own, organizations (or systems within an organization) can share security events—like compromised credentials or suspicious logins—in real-time. The SSF, developed by the OpenID Foundation, is designed to make this happen, enabling faster fraud response, better risk assessment, and improved user security across platforms.</p>



<p>The promise of shared signals is real-time fraud detection and better security. But here’s the catch—every signal costs money. And in a world where cloud services charge per API call, this ‘stronger security’ might come with a hefty price tag. So, who actually pays for all this? And is it worth it?</p>



<p>Over the next few weeks, I’ll be diving deeper into the consumer identity and access management (CIAM) space, exploring which standards are—or should be—most influential. It may seem like a bit of a jump from where I started the year, but it makes sense in my head. I started by focusing on Non-Human Identity (NHI); that was a continuation from last year. But that led me to AgenticAI and whether we can differentiate online between AI’s and humans. It’s just a hop, skip, and a jump from there right into AI-enabled fraud, which is solidly in the sphere of CIAM. But thinking about fraud, authentication, and so on, is what leads to to today’s focus: how to effectively signal when something has gone horribly wrong.</p>



<p>And that’s where the SSF comes in.</p>



 What Is the Shared Signals Framework (SSF)? 



<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">S</a>SF is an emerging standard from the <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a> designed to facilitate real-time sharing of security events between organizations. Instead of each service defending against threats in isolation, SSF enables collaborative security—a switchboard where different organizations share security events to build a stronger defense against fraud and cyber threats.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html">Continuous Access Evaluation Profile</a> (CAEP), part of SSF, takes this a step further. It allows organizations to continuously assess access permissions in real-time, responding to changes like credential compromise or session revocation without waiting for a traditional token expiration.</p>



 



<p>Shared Signals is one of the more interesting standards to watch in Consumer IAM—but where is it actually gaining traction? If you’re keeping an eye on vendor adoption or wondering how the standards process could shape its future, I can help you make sense of what’s happening.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">See how I work</a> or <a>Let’s talk</a>.</p>



 



<p>If you’d like to learn more about SSF and CAEP, the <a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/">Identity Defined Security Alliance</a> has a <a href="https://youtu.be/qakOw0g2mZ8?si=lOLa-apXPS7v4DOF">great video</a> for you.</p>



 The Cost-Security Dilemma in CIAM 



<p>While SSF promises improved security, there’s a major challenge: cost. In a cloud-based CIAM model, every API call costs money. Implementing SSF and CAEP means a significant increase in API calls, leading to higher cloud service expenses. Organizations must balance these costs against the need for robust security, which is no small feat.</p>



FactorStronger Security (Shared Signals)Lower Cost (Traditional CIAM)Threat DetectionImmediate, real-time responsesDelayed, batch-based reviewsFraud PreventionHigh (shared risk signals)Lower (limited to local detection)API CostsHigh (constant event updates)Lower (fewer real-time calls)Privacy ConcernsMore data sharingLess cross-platform exposureAdoption BarrierExpensive for smaller orgsMore affordable, but riskier



 Why This Matters for CIAM 



<p>SSF and CAEP offer real benefits for consumer IAM, but they also raise some tough questions:</p>



 
 Stronger Security: Real-time event sharing means faster responses to security threats. If a user’s credentials are compromised on one platform, other connected services can take action immediately. 



 Better User Experience: CAEP reduces the need for frequent re-authentication while maintaining security. 



 Alignment with Zero Trust: These protocols ensure that access decisions are always based on the latest security signals. 
 



<p>However, there are also real concerns:</p>



 
 Skyrocketing API Costs: The more signals you share, the more you pay. 



 Data Privacy &amp; Compliance: Sharing security events involves sensitive user data, requiring strict privacy controls. 



 Trust Issues: Why should one organization trust another’s signals? What if bad actors inject false signals into the system? 
 



 Potential Solutions for CIAM 



<p>So how do we keep the security benefits without the runaway costs? A few approaches might help:</p>



 
 Prioritize filtering high-risk events to reduce unnecessary API costs. 



 Implement machine learning-driven fraud detection to reduce unnecessary security event generation, ensuring Shared Signals are only triggered for high-risk activities. 



 Move away from centralized cloud services in order to distribute the load and reduce costs. 



 Explore cost-sharing with industry consortiums to lower API expenses.. 
 



 Can CIAM Trust Shared Signals? 



<p>One of the biggest concerns with real-time event sharing is trust. Imagine an attacker compromises a user’s account on Platform A. If Platform A sends an immediate “compromised account” signal to Platform B, Platform B could block access before damage is done. Yay! But what if attackers send fake signals to lock out legitimate users? Or flood the system with false alerts to create chaos? This is why trust—and verification—are critical in Shared Signals adoption.</p>



<p>To prevent abuse, SSF includes security measures like:</p>



 
 Authentication &amp; Authorization: Using OAuth to ensure only trusted entities can send or receive events. 



 Event Verification: Security Event Tokens (SETs) are digitally signed JWTs, allowing receivers to verify authenticity. 



 Stream Management: Organizations control which signals they subscribe to, reducing exposure to irrelevant or malicious events. 



 Mutual Agreements: Organizations define rules and expectations for shared events, limiting abuse potential. 
 



 The Future of SSF and CAEP 



<p>Right now, SSF is still in an implementer’s draft stage, meaning there’s room for improvement before it becomes a full standard. The OpenID Foundation’s working group continues to refine the framework, considering real-world challenges like API costs and error handling.</p>



<p>For CIAM providers, the key takeaway is this: SSF and CAEP are powerful tools, but they come with trade-offs. Finding the right balance between security, cost, and trust will determine whether these standards become game-changers or just another expensive security upgrade.</p>



<p>What do you think—should companies embrace real-time shared signals, or do the risks outweigh the benefits?</p>

									  Mr. Meme Goes To Washington   <p>In the short history of this publication, we’ve probably leaned a little too heavily on the phrase, “Memecoins have gone mainstream.” After all, memes are, damn near by definition, mainstream. But they’ve taken another meaningful step toward the seat of cultural and political power, moving beyond the acronymic in-joke of the extrajudicially-created DOGE to become the topic of a bonafide US policy proposal.<br><br>The proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91286681/new-bill-aims-make-presidential-meme-coins-illegal?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">MEME Act</a>&nbsp;was recently introduced by US Representative Sam Liccardo (D-CA), a Silicon-Valley-elected candidate looking to restrict politicians from launching or promoting memecoins. This comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s launch of his own memecoin ahead of his inauguration, $TRUMP, which reportedly raked in some $100M in trading fees — much of which was no doubt contributed by foreign actors looking to curry favor.<br><br>While I love the sentiment of preventing politicians from leveraging their positions of power to accept not-so-anonymous bribes and manipulate public financial markets for their own gain, the alleged poster child for some of those nefarious activities hilariously lives down the street from the freshman congressman. I’m talking of course about the legendary trader, Nancy Pelosi, whose investments are the subject of<a href="https://x.com/PelosiTracker_?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">&nbsp;many Twitter accounts</a>&nbsp;and automated trading strategies, given her suspiciously consistent track record as one of the world’s top investors. I only pick on her, because she and Liccardo play for the same team, and this legislation simply targets emerging technologies, not the root corruption at play.</p>  <p>But the sector moves so fast that this topic, chosen at our weekly planning meeting on Thursday, is no longer the biggest news story of the week. On Sunday, Trump announced a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” including not just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also XRP, Cardano, and, yes, Solana.</p>  <p>(No $mother yet, but at this rate, just give it a few days.)<br><br>But back to Solana, our namesake. The main critique I’ve seen of its inclusion in this strategic asset reserve is that it’s not… American enough? The argument came from Byron Gilliam in a&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.blockworks.com/p/weekday-month-day-ad9c42b48a496ce4?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">Blockworks Daily op-ed</a>, who pointed out that the Solana Foundation is based in Switzerland, blithely ignoring the “decentralized” in “DeFi”. He then proceeded to, in this writer’s humble opinion, further undermine his credibility by positing Ripple as a more legitimate inclusion, given its Delaware Corporation status, and despite being a centralized banking Ponzi.</p>  <p>Here’s what Gilliam — and seemingly so many others I speak to on a regular basis — continue to misunderstand. Cryptographic technology promises a future where everything to the smallest fragment of data coming off an application system’s streaming exhaust is logged on-chain for some AI agent to analyze and use to make predictions. That’s a lot transactions. The token with the ability to transact on this network most efficiently will become the most valuable, regardless of its market cap.<br><br>(Non-technical folks may have an antiquated understanding of the term transaction. To tech nerds, it means interacting with a database, and that happens with every keystroke I type, and retype these words with.)<br><br>That’s still the big picture view, to be clear. The larger macro-economic state of things due to Trump Tariffs, Europe’s consequential isolationist turn, and the downturn in risk behavior evinced by&nbsp;<a href="https://dune.com/_d3f4ult/pumpdotfun?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">Pump.Fun’s fall</a>&nbsp;from 300k daily active gamblers down to 150k suggests we could be heading for a bear market in the near-term.<br><br>But I’m no bear. We previously remarked on how the the distance from the Bitcoin halving to Pete Davidson’s “What’s an NFT?” SNL sketch was around 9 months. The crypto market is now approaching the dreaded Pete Davidson period. And there’s always resistance at the previous / new highs before it really breaks away for the cycle. The question is, what’s going to spark the movement?</p>  <p>—El Prof</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
							 
			
						
		 
						 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         Render Unto Caesar   <p><a href="https://rendernetwork.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">Render Network</a>&nbsp;is a game-changer, and it’s already transforming the way creatives handle one of the most demanding tasks in their workflow: rendering.</p>  <p>(A word which here, in the context of digital visual arts, means the process of generating a final image or animation from a 3D model or scene, using software to simulate lighting, textures, and effects. It transforms the computer-generated data into a realistic or stylized visual output, such as a still image or a video sequence.)</p>  <p>At first glance, decentralized GPU rendering might seem a bit unconventional. Rendering is a heavy computational task, after all. But Render Network is already providing real-time rendering across thousands of GPUs worldwide, offering creators near-limitless scalability with unprecedented affordability.</p>  <p>Traditional rendering methods have been deeply centralized — tied to expensive render farms or the raw power of high-end workstations. But Render Network is tearing down those silos, creating a decentralized, blockchain-powered system that taps into a global pool of idle GPU power.</p>  <p>Here’s where it gets most interesting for us. Render Network doesn’t just offer a cheaper, more scalable solution&nbsp;— it also gives creators full control over their data and projects. With Render Network, you can store your data securely and manage your workflow on your terms without worrying about being locked into centralized systems.</p>  <p>Render Network is yet another example of our favorite crypto use case, as a secure store of data to be strategically and lucratively deployed. Render Network creates an ecosystem where users can not only take advantage of global rendering power but also contribute to it. Individuals with unused GPU resources can monetize their hardware, creating a truly decentralized market for rendering power. It’s a system where everyone benefits — from the creator who needs rendering capacity to the provider who can profit from idle hardware.</p>  <p>With the continued growth of decentralized technologies, Render Network is positioned at the forefront of a much larger movement. As more creatives, developers, and organizations adopt the platform, we’ll see this model extend beyond rendering into other areas of creative production, ultimately unlocking new opportunities for digital work that were previously inaccessible.</p>  <p>With Render Network, the next stage in the creative cycle is not only about speed and cost — it’s about embracing a new way of working. A way that puts control in the hands of the creator and makes powerful resources available to everyone, everywhere.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

             February 2025   
	 
		 
			 Memecoins Are Crashing, Hackers Are Cashing In, Where Are Smart Investors Moving Next? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Over the past month, we’ve attended key events across the U.S., Europe, and now in Hong Kong. One thing is clear: RWA tokenization dominates conversations at institutional and retail events. Investors are looking for real-value backed onchain assets.</p>
 The Memecoin Bubble Is Bursting 
<p>The wild speculation around memecoins is collapsing, leaving investors with massive losses. Trump Token, which once surged by 800%, has crashed over 80% from its peak. Similarly, Libra, a memecoin promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei, experienced a rapid rise before plummeting over 95% within hours.</p>
<p>The damage is widespread. Over $38.91 billion has been wiped out from the memecoin market in the past one month, according to the data from Coinmarketcap.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Bybit Hackers Used Memecoins for Money Laundering 
<p>Memecoins are not just trapping investors in financial losses, they are also being used for money laundering and cybercrime. The Bybit hack, where the Lazarus Group stole $1.5 billion, revealed how hackers exploit memecoins to wash illicit funds.</p>
<p>According to blockchain analyst Atlas, the hackers first sent 60 SOL to an anonymous wallet and used Solana’s PumpFun platform to launch a fake memecoin called QinShihuang.</p>
<p>They manipulated trading activity, buying and selling the token among themselves to create the illusion of high demand. This practice, known as wash trading, generated $42 million in fake trading volume, making it harder for investigators to trace the stolen assets.</p>
<p>To further cover their tracks, the hackers attracted real investors, mixing their stolen funds with legitimate transactions. Many traders, seeing the hype around QinShihuang, unknowingly jumped in, only for the hackers to cash out, leaving them with worthless tokens.</p>
 RWA Tokens: The Market’s Answer 
<p>With memecoin speculation collapsing and money laundering concerns escalating, investors are searching for a safer and more sustainable path. Tokenized RWA is the answer. It’s the bridge between crypto infrastructure and institutional finance, bringing real asset-backed value on-chain.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing this shift with large tokenized money market funds and trendy RWA blockchains like the upcoming ONDO chain, Mantra, and Plume gaining momentum. But what’s next to make the transition of the whole financial system a reality? Which RWA project will take the spotlight by building a massive supply of qualitative assets on-chain?</p>
<p>We might have found the answer. Stay tuned!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, Heroes &amp; Heroines!</p>



<p>February has been a whirlwind of progress and community spirit, and we’re excited to share all the highlights with you. Building on the momentum from January, we’ve focused on refining our platform and strengthening our community bonds. Your enthusiasm and support are the driving forces behind our achievements, and we’re committed to delivering an even better Herond experience.</p>







 Product Updates 



<p>We’ve been hard at work addressing your feedback and enhancing our platform’s performance. Our latest Android update, Version 2.1.2, tackles two key issues:</p>



 
 Reduced App Size: We’ve fixed a bug of increasing app UI on certain devices. 



 Stabilized Tab Groups: Fix the bug of closing a tab leading to app crash if the tab is in a tab group. 
 



<p>We’re dedicated to continuous improvement, so keep your feedback coming!</p>



 Community and Events 



<p>February was a month of vibrant community engagement, highlighted by our ongoing partnership with Voltix AI and the launch of new initiatives:</p>



 Herond Browser X Voltix Partnership 



<p>Our newest partner is Voltix AI. They help you turn idle CPUs into power for AI &amp; DePIN solutions. This collaboration sparked immense interest, with over 90,000 entries in our 1.3X multiplier campaign!</p>

<p>February also saw the launch of “<a href="https://x.com/HerondBrowser/status/1887063734302163154">Action Surge</a>“, a program designed to reward engagement on both Discord and Twitter. Participants earned points by interacting with our posts, which could then be exchanged for various rewards.

We will continue to provide more opportunities to earn points and claim rewards in the future, with Season 2 starting this March 4th.</p>

									 <p>We are sending on the last day of the month again, whoops.

So we thought we’d our latest pitch deck with you.</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>*if you need a refresher, we’ve been on a mission to build a smart wallet for digital identity since October 2020, because, especially in the age of AI, we believe people should have full ownership over their data &amp; digital breadcrumb trail.</p>

									<p>The internet is changing really quickly. Be it AI, web3, quantum, or security encryptions. Organizations of all sizes are going to have to contend with changes to their infrastructure yet again, and speed will be much more crucial for survival.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Fortunately, our company playhaus has a plan to address this opportunity. And everything from our market entry in AdTech, and our focus on a consumer friendly interface, will give us the out of left field appearance as we tackle the next generation of digital asset management.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Changes in legislation are creating an operating differential between those businesses that have their data operations under control, and those who don’t. Passing on higher advertising (and surely other) costs in exchange for the disorder.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Which is why we are operating as an advertising agency, to offer our services to the 9/10 businesses without this critical infrastructure in place; offering our SaaS tool as an exclusive part of our offering. Developing a true, organic PMF iterating on the early product with some close customers.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>This approach has allowed us to become an integrated technology partner with one of our customers to assist in the build out of their audiobook marketplace and streaming platform, as well as local partnerships with groups with working on KC’s hosting of the World Cup next summer.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>We operate as an Agency, so our retainer &amp; White Label SaaS pricing look very similar. Our intent is to scale as a white label product to other agencies &amp; community portals started by industry KOLs.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>We know there’s no true competition to us in the “traditional wallet” space since everyone is focused on offering financial products. Which is why we are focused on positioning ourselves as a business support product for our identity, and not web3 first.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Our team is well versed in Advertising, Data Science, and web3 Technologies</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Our most significant achievement to date is the launch of our software at the end of January 2025.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Whether or not we raise any funding in the next few weeks, our plan is to continue to acquire customers for our agency, leveraging the software to service them.

Known for her sharp insights and warm, positive energy, she’s the kind of person who can light up a room while keeping a clear, strategic mind. She thrives on learning, mentoring, and leading with empathy, and she’s always looking for ways to refine her approach—whether that means testing new AI tools or finding better ways to navigate team dynamics.</p> <p>Managing a team means making decisions, not just about projects, but about communication, how to guide conversations, how to give feedback, and how to handle inevitable moments of friction. </p><p>For her, addressing conflict isn’t about avoiding it, it’s about making sure she approaches it thoughtfully, considering both perspectives and potential impact. </p><p>And sometimes, before stepping into those conversations, she just needs a space to think.</p><p>That’s where Kin comes in.</p> A thought partner for tough conversations   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e65285-3718-49b8-858d-0f79cfe5d309_6847x4565.jpeg">          </a>Talking things through with KIN <p>Martha didn’t start using Kin with work in mind. </p><p>At first, it was just an experiment, something she played around with as part of her creative hobbies. </p><p>She wanted to see how different AI tools could help with writing, especially for brainstorming character dialogues. </p><p>At the time, Kin felt different from other AI assistants. </p><p>It wasn’t just about providing generic answers, it had a certain energy, a personality that sometimes surprised her.</p><p>“I found that Kin was pretty good at brainstorming character dialogue and running character simulations,” she shared. </p><p>“It would always have this ‘girl boss’ energy, encouraging my characters to stand up for themselves, even when that wasn’t what I was going for in the story.”</p><p>What started as a tool for writing slowly became something more. </p><p>Without even realizing it, Martha began turning to Kin to process her thoughts about work.</p><p>“I started sharing thoughts about my team with Kin casually, even before you made the pivot,” she said.</p><p>It wasn’t something she consciously planned, it just felt natural to test out how Kin would respond to different workplace situations she was thinking through.</p> Clarity before action <p>Some workplace challenges aren’t just about what to do, but how to do it…</p><p>While understanding how you feel.</p><p>For Martha, Kin became a way to work through thoughts before bringing them into real conversations. </p><p>She didn’t need Kin to tell her what to do, but she found it useful in helping her organize her thoughts, identify potential blind spots, and check her own biases before making decisions.</p><p>“Sometimes I’d observe something on my team and ask Kin, ‘Is this interaction ethical? Is it unbiased? Is there bias I should be aware of?’” she explained.</p><p>Kin didn’t replace real conversations with her team. It didn’t take the place of a mentor, a therapist, or a manager. </p><p>But it gave her a space to process situations before stepping into them, helping her articulate her thoughts more clearly and recognize things she might not have otherwise.</p><p>And in one case, Kin’s insights made her rethink an entire career decision.</p> A career-altering perspective  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ebd1d0f-de3f-4287-a231-e6ebf8013b9a_2330x1554.png">          </a>Reflecting with Kin <p>Martha was wrestling with an issue she witnessed on her team and was unsure of how to feel about it or what (if anything) she should do. </p><p>When she brought it to Kin, she wasn’t expecting a concrete answer, but Kin offered an observation that stuck with her.</p><p>“Kin pointed out that there were a few ethical concerns and suggested I keep an eye on how similar situations were being handled elsewhere. It wasn’t pushing me in a direction, just offering perspective,” she said.</p><p>At first, she didn’t think much of it. But as time passed, and the situation evolved, she started to see things more clearly.</p><p>“A little time passed, and I realized Kin was absolutely right. I ended up making the decision to switch teams and change direction,” she shared.</p><p>Martha is clear about what Kin is and what it isn’t. She doesn’t treat it as a coworker or someone replacing real human input. </p><p>But it’s a tool she’s learned to use in a way that feels natural to her.</p><p>“I understand that Kin is safe because I’ve been to some of Volodya’s talks…he’s very explicit about privacy and security,” she said.</p><blockquote> “As a product manager and someone who manages a dev team, I know that Kin is actually more secure than GPT or other OpenAI systems.” </blockquote><p><br>Still, she acknowledges that AI is an evolving space, and people are still figuring out what role it plays in their workflows.</p><p>“There’s a part of us that gets entertained by AI, and that’s valid too,” she reflected. </p><p>“But until everyone figures out their own relationship with Kin, no amount of streaks or incentives will change how people use it.”</p><p>For Martha, Kin is useful, but not in the way a coworker would be. </p><p>She doesn’t see it as part of her team, but rather as something that helps her think before she steps into conversations that matter.</p><p>“If Kin made it clearer that it’s not a team member, that you don’t have to put on a work facade, that it’s just ready to talk about work-related things without being work itself, I think that would be really helpful,” she said.</p> Final thoughts <p>Workplace conflict is uncomfortable. </p><p>It’s also inevitable.</p><p>It’s part of showing up fully in your career, even when it feels easier to stay quiet. </p><p>Martha doesn’t use Kin to escape difficult conversations, she uses it to prepare for them, to refine her thoughts, and to enter them feeling more sure of herself.</p><p>“At the end of the day, AI won’t solve workplace conflict for you,” she said. </p><p>“But it can help you feel more prepared, more self-aware, and more confident in how you handle it.”</p><p>And sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.</p><p></p>   <p>The user approved this article beforehand and gave consent for her story to be shared.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading KIN!

<p>Chegg Files Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google Over AI Search Summaries</p>



<p>Chegg has filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Google, claiming its AI-generated search summaries reduce traffic to Chegg’s site and impact revenue. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., alleges Google’s “AI Overviews” unfairly use Chegg’s content while limiting visibility for competitors, violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. CEO Nathan Shultz argues this reinforces Google’s monopoly, while Google denies the claims, asserting its AI benefits users and broadens site traffic distribution. <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/business/chegg-accuses-google-of-using-ai-to-crush-traffic-revenue-in-antitrust-lawsuit-harmful-and-unsustainable/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8xT2HDCTQJqyQ7oWgbwANiqgvILK7XIZa5ifkuXoFR1ZzsIYMqlsw_LAQMy0SjktMGW1ff">(Source)</a></p>

<p>UK Government Shuts Down One Login Inclusion and Privacy Advisory Group</p>



<p>The UK Government Digital Service (GDS) has closed the One Login Inclusion and Privacy Advisory Group (OLIPAG), formed in 2023 to advise on privacy, inclusion, and accessibility. The 20-member group met from November 2023 to May 2024, affirming existing identity assurance principles, which GDS has updated in its documentation. GDS plans to form a new advisory group with a broader scope, though details remain unclear. Uncertainty also surrounds DSIT’s role in digital identity initiatives like the mobile driver’s license and <a href="http://gov.uk/">Gov.uk</a> digital wallet. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/uk-shuts-down-privacy-and-inclusion-advisory-group-for-one-login?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xjDl9uYpeiI1mvrp3S9c19CZQOQ04c1YdAojLUqx6trvm2FICERvGZPpQereuc58rwYn0">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Critical Vulnerability in Enterphone MESH Allows Unauthorized Access to Buildings Across U.S. and Canada</p>



<p>The Enterphone MESH door access system by Hirsch has a critical vulnerability due to an unchanged default password, allowing remote access to doors and elevators in multiple U.S. and Canadian buildings. Hirsch refuses to fix it, claiming it’s “by design” and that customers should have changed the password. Security researcher Eric Daigle found 71 exposed systems using default credentials, granting access to building controls. Rated 10/10 in severity, the flaw is easily exploitable with publicly available credentials. Despite the risk, Hirsch has only advised customers to follow setup instructions without committing to a fix. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/a-single-default-password-exposes-access-to-dozens-of-apartment-buildings/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SbWoPXUzaW9VZ_FODZViWz9K7-6-_hBua9T1AbmHgGit_KgEyutHAIpUVJ7_w6_O0GVMq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Australia Bans Kaspersky on Government Systems Over National Security Concerns</p>



<p>Australia has banned Kaspersky security software on government systems due to national security concerns over foreign interference, espionage, and sabotage. A Department of Home Affairs risk assessment highlighted potential misuse of user data. Government agencies must remove Kaspersky by April 1, 2025, though exemptions may apply with safeguards. The ban also covers critical infrastructure and aligns with the U.S. ban in mid-2024 on Kaspersky sales and updates. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/australia-bans-kaspersky-software-over.html?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SbWoPXUzaW9VZ_FODZViWz9K7-6-_hBua9T1AbmHgGit_KgEyutHAIpUVJ7_w6_O0GVMq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Health Net Federal Services Settles Cybersecurity Compliance Allegations for $11.25 Million</p>



<p>Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) and parent company Centene Corporation will pay $11.25 million to settle allegations of falsely certifying cybersecurity compliance under their Defense Health Agency (DHA) TRICARE contract. The DOJ claims that between 2015 and 2018, HNFS failed to implement required security measures but still submitted false compliance certifications. While HNFS and Centene deny wrongdoing, they agreed to the settlement, which does not protect them from future legal actions if new evidence arises. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-healthcare-org-pays-11m-settlement-over-alleged-cybersecurity-lapses/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y5NMkXI5osTwlI-DfzQ_wz5co0vzFSTTOqUY1zbHnqtrtSDRvl9r9YF_1Jn5P5nku9fy2">(Source)</a></p>

<p>When you stake your ETH on Coinbase, you’re helping secure the Ethereum network and earning rewards. But what happens when you need to access your staked funds? In this guide, we’ll show you how to unstake ETH on Coinbase, so you can withdraw your coins whenever you choose. Whether you’re adjusting your strategy or need funds for other investments, understanding the process is essential.</p>

 Why Stake Your ETH in the First Place? 



<p>Staking ETH is an excellent way to earn rewards while contributing to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. When you stake your ETH, you essentially lock it into the network, and in return, you earn ETH as rewards. By staking your ETH, you’re helping to secure the network, store data, and validate transactions. This process is known as Proof of Stake (PoS).</p>



<p>But why would you ever want to unstake ETH? Well, there are a few reasons. You might want to access your funds for other investments, or perhaps you feel that staking is no longer the right strategy for you. No matter the reason, knowing how to unstake ETH on Coinbase is crucial for those moments when you need liquidity or flexibility in your investments.</p>

 The Pre-Unstaking Checklist Before Untasking&nbsp; 



<p>Before you can successfully unstake your ETH on Coinbase, there are a few important conditions you must meet to ensure a smooth process.</p>



 Verified Identity (VI) 



<p>Your Coinbase account needs to be fully verified before you can unstake your ETH. This is to ensure your account is secure and complies with all regulatory requirements. If your identity isn’t verified yet, you may need to submit identification documents such as a government-issued ID or proof of address. Completing this step ensures that your funds are protected and that Coinbase can verify the legitimacy of your account.</p>



 Minimum Balance and Eligibility 



<p>Coinbase may require you to meet specific balance thresholds to unstake ETH. Check the current staking protocol’s minimum requirements to ensure you meet these criteria. Some protocols may only allow unstaking once a minimum amount of ETH has been staked, while others may have different rules based on the amount staked. Make sure your staked ETH qualifies for unstaking before beginning the process.</p>



 Eligibility Criteria 



<p>Coinbase may have additional eligibility requirements depending on your location or the staking conditions. These criteria may vary based on regulatory restrictions or other platform-specific policies. It’s important to check whether your region allows unstaking or if there are any restrictions that could affect your ability to withdraw your ETH.</p>


 
 


 How to Unstake ETH on Coinbase: Step-by-Step Guide 



<p>Ready to unstake your ETH? Here’s how to do it on Coinbase.</p>



<p>Step 1: Log In to Coinbase<br>Use your credentials to log in to your Coinbase account. If you’re using the mobile app, ensure it’s up to date for the best experience.</p>



<p>Step 2: Navigate to “My Assets”<br>Once logged in, go to the “My Assets” section. This is where you’ll see all your crypto holdings, including your staked ETH.</p>



<p>Step 3: Select the ETH You Want to Unstake<br>Find the Ethereum (ETH) asset that you’ve staked. Click on it to see detailed information about your balance and staking rewards.</p>



<p>Step 4: Click on “Unstake”<br>Look for the “Unstake” button. It might be labeled slightly differently depending on updates, but it will be clear. Click this option to begin the unstaking process.</p>



<p>Step 5: Enter the Amount to Unstake<br>Next, you’ll be prompted to enter the amount of ETH you wish to unstake. Double-check the amount to avoid any errors.</p>



<p>Step 6: Review the Transaction<br>Before finalizing, you’ll be able to review the transaction. This is your chance to ensure everything looks good.</p>



<p>Step 7: Confirm with Two-Factor Authentication<br>For extra security, Coinbase may ask for two-factor authentication (2FA). Follow the prompts to confirm your unstake request.</p>



<p>Step 8: Wait for the Process to Complete<br>After confirming, your unstaking request will be processed. Keep in mind that the time it takes for ETH to be unstaked can vary depending on network traffic and Coinbase’s processing time.</p>


 
 


 3 Common Issues When Unstaking ETH 



<p>While unstaking ETH on Coinbase is generally simple, users may encounter a few common issues. Here are some troubleshooting tips:</p>



<p>1. Verification Problems<br> If you’re facing trouble with identity verification, make sure all your documents are updated and correctly submitted. Double-check that your personal info matches Coinbase’s records. If issues persist, contact Coinbase support.</p>



<p>2. Unstake Button Not Visible<br> If the unstake button is missing, ensure that your ETH meets the minimum requirements for unstaking and is properly staked. Also, check if you’re eligible based on Coinbase’s rules.</p>



<p>3. Delays in Processing<br> Sometimes, unstaking can take longer due to network congestion or Coinbase’s processing times. If it’s taking longer than expected, keep an eye on your account for updates. If delays persist, contact Coinbase support for help.</p>



<p>By following these tips, you can quickly resolve common issues and successfully unstake your ETH.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Learning how to unstake ETH on Coinbase isn’t difficult, but it’s crucial to understand the steps and conditions involved. By following this guide, you can easily manage your staked ETH and access your funds when needed. Keep in mind the potential penalties for early withdrawal, the impact on rewards, and the delay in trading. Whether you’re adjusting your strategy or need liquidity, knowing how to unstake ETH on Coinbase gives you control over your investments. </p>

<p>Perpetual crypto trading has become one of the most popular ways to invest and trade in the digital asset space. But one crucial element that every trader needs to understand is funding rates. So, how do you get low funding rates on perpetual crypto? Let’s break it down.</p>

 What Are Funding Rates in Perpetual Crypto? 



<p>Funding rates are the periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders on perpetual contracts. Unlike traditional futures, these rates are used to keep the contract price close to the spot price. If funding rates are high, it could be expensive to hold a long position. Conversely, low funding rates make it cheaper to hold a position.</p>



<p>In short, getting low funding rates on perpetual crypto is essential for minimizing costs. Traders with low funding rates will often have a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/understanding-mutual-funds-a-simple-explanation/">Understanding Mutual Funds: A Simple Explanation</a> </p>


 
 


 How Are Funding Rates Calculated? 



<p>Funding rates are calculated based on the interest rate difference between the positions of long and short traders. Factors like market sentiment and the supply-demand imbalance on a specific asset influence these rates. For instance, if a large number of traders are long on a specific crypto, funding rates will typically increase.</p>



<p>The formula used can vary by exchange, but they usually consider the difference in borrowing costs and the price deviation of the perpetual contract. To get low funding rates, understanding how exchanges calculate them is crucial.</p>



 Example of Funding Rate Calculation 



<p>Funding rates are determined by the interest rate difference between long and short traders. If there are more long traders, funding rates for longs will typically rise to balance the market.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you want to trade Bitcoin (BTC) on Binance. If the long traders are paying 0.05% per 8 hours and short traders are paying 0.02%, the funding rate difference is 0.03% (0.05% – 0.02%).</p>



<p>Market sentiment also plays a role. If BTC is rising in price and many traders are going long, the exchange might raise the funding rate to encourage short positions, creating a supply-demand imbalance. Additionally, if the BTC perpetual contract is trading at a 1.5% premium over the spot price, the exchange could increase the funding rate by another 0.01% to keep the contract aligned with the spot price.</p>



<p>Combining these factors, the total funding rate for long positions could be 0.06% every 8 hours (0.03% interest rate difference + 0.02% sentiment factor + 0.01% price deviation).</p>



<p>Understanding how exchanges calculate funding rates helps traders find opportunities for lower costs and better trading strategies.</p>


 
 


 Why Do Funding Rates Fluctuate and How Does This Affect Traders? 



<p>Funding rates fluctuate mainly due to market conditions. If more traders are betting on price increases (longs), funding rates rise, as the market becomes more expensive to enter. Conversely, if more are betting on a price drop (shorts), rates fall.</p>



<p>For traders, fluctuating funding rates mean that timing is everything. If you’re long during a high funding rate period, you might be paying a premium just to hold your position. Therefore, keeping track of the market is key to getting low funding rates on perpetual crypto.</p>

 How to Get Low Funding Rates on Perpetual Crypto 



<p>To get low funding rates on perpetual crypto, following a few smart strategies can save you significant costs. Here’s how:</p>



 Choose the Right Exchange 



<p>Not all exchanges offer the same funding rates. Some platforms, like Binance and Bybit, generally have lower funding rates than others. This is because each exchange calculates funding rates based on its own interest rate models and market conditions. To find the best deal, compare funding rates across various exchanges before making a trade. Tools like FundingRate.io can help you easily track and compare funding rates in real-time.</p>



 Trade in Off-Peak Times 



<p>Funding rates are often influenced by market volatility. During periods of high trading activity, such as when there’s a major news event or price movement, funding rates tend to rise as demand for certain positions increases. To secure lower rates, aim to trade during quieter times, when market sentiment is more stable, and fewer traders are competing for positions. These off-peak times often provide an opportunity to enter positions at a lower cost.</p>



 Position Size and Strategy 



<p>Adjusting your position size can also affect the funding rate you pay. Larger positions often attract higher funding fees, especially when market sentiment is skewed toward one direction. Consider scaling down your positions to minimize the impact of funding fees. Additionally, if you expect funding rates to rise, it might make sense to close positions or hedge them to reduce exposure to high fees.</p>



 Arbitrage 



<p>If you’re experienced, you can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities between exchanges. Sometimes, funding rates differ significantly across platforms. By opening positions on different exchanges and holding them at the same time, you can potentially profit from these discrepancies. However, this requires precision, as the timing of trades and market conditions need to be perfect. But for traders who can master arbitrage, it’s a clever way to reduce funding costs.</p>


 
 


 6 Risks When Dealing with Funding Rates 



<p>Funding rates can lower costs, but they come with risks. Sudden changes and market imbalances can lead to unexpected costs and potential losses. Here are some common risks when dealing with funding rates:</p>



 
 Market Bias and Volatility<br>High funding rates often indicate a strong market bias in one direction (either long or short). Betting against this trend can be risky, as the market may continue to move in the dominant direction, increasing the costs of holding positions. 



 Changes in Exchange Policies<br>Exchanges may periodically adjust their funding rate formulas or policies. These changes could result in unexpected increases in funding rates, which might catch traders off guard and negatively impact their positions. 



 Unexpected Funding Rate Increases<br>A sudden rise in funding rates can lead to unexpected costs, potentially wiping out profits. Traders may not anticipate these rate hikes, especially if market conditions shift abruptly. 



 Market Manipulation and Market Sentiment<br>In periods of extreme sentiment or manipulation (such as pump-and-dump schemes), funding rates can spike unpredictably. Traders who aren’t careful might find themselves paying high rates while the market moves against them. 



 Short-Term Liquidity Risks<br>During high funding rate periods, liquidity can sometimes dry up. If you want to exit your position but can’t do so at a reasonable price, the cost of funding could continue to rise. 



 Overleveraging Risks<br>With high funding rates, traders who are overleveraged face greater risks of liquidation. High rates can drain the margin faster than expected, especially if the market moves against your position. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Getting low funding rates on perpetual crypto requires strategy, timing, and market awareness. Choosing the right exchange, monitoring market conditions, and using smart techniques like arbitrage can make a significant difference.</p>



<p>By understanding how funding rates are calculated and the factors that influence them, you can lower your costs and maximize your profits. So, if you want to thrive in the volatile world of perpetual crypto trading, start by focusing on how to get low funding rates.</p>

 Wakka Wakka Nation Partners with Sovereign Wallet for Digital Financial Sovereignty <p>February 2025 — The Wakka Wakka Nation, a sovereign Indigenous nation in Australia, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sovereign Wallet Co., Ltd. to implement the MetaMUI Digital National Identity and Digital National Currency System. This initiative focuses on guaranteeing the constitutional right to a monetary system free from inflation and with preserved value. It also emphasizes ensuring that Wakka Wakka Bungoo is backed by tangible assets such as gold and&nbsp;silver.</p><p>With this agreement, Wakka Wakka becomes the third Indigenous nation to embrace MetaMUI’s blockchain-powered financial sovereignty model, following the successful adoption by the Yidindji Nation in 2022 and the upcoming implementation in the Birri Gubba Nation. Discussions are actively progressing with multiple Indigenous nations to expand this self-sovereign digital economic model, reinforcing a growing Indigenous financial network across Australia.</p><p>The Wakka Wakka Nation’s adoption of the MetaMUI Digital National Identity and Digital National Currency System will establish a self-governed digital identity framework for its citizens, businesses, and organizations. This system ensures privacy, security, and financial autonomy, reinforcing the nation’s control over its economic future. Alongside this, the Wakka Wakka Digital National Currency will support Indigenous trade, minimize dependence on external financial intermediaries, and maintain financial operations even during emergencies and natural disasters.</p><p>Building on the success of the Sovereign Yidindji Dollar, launched through MetaMUI’s Digital National Currency Cloud Service in 2022, the Wakka Wakka Nation joins Yidindji and Birri Gubba in co-developing the Allodial Unity Digital Dollar (AUDD) — a multi-sovereign digital currency initiative that enables seamless cross-border Indigenous trade. Unlike centralized monetary unions, the AUDD framework allows each participating nation to retain its own sovereign currency while benefiting from a unified digital economic ecosystem.</p><p>Iirragala Radjah Radjah, Minister of Law for Wakka Wakka Nation, highlighted the significance of this initiative: <br>“For generations, we have fought to maintain our sovereignty — our right to govern ourselves, protect our lands, and make our own decisions. This partnership is more than technology; it is about reclaiming what has always been ours. With this new digital financial system, we ensure that our people have the tools to thrive in the modern world while remaining rooted in our traditions.”</p><p>Phantom Seokgu Yun, CEO of Sovereign Wallet Co., Ltd., shared his excitement for this expanding movement: <br>“We are honored to collaborate with the Wakka Wakka Nation in this initiative, ensuring that Indigenous nations lead the way in establishing a monetary system where currency value is preserved, allowing them to have a financial system that guarantees individual wealth and independence.”</p><p>The Wakka Wakka Digital National Identity and Currency System is set to launch in the first half of 2025, marking a major milestone in Indigenous financial sovereignty. This initiative represents a significant step towards a global Indigenous financial network — one where sovereignty is not just recognized but actively lived, strengthened, and protected. <br> <br>About Sovereign Wallet Co.,&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet is committed to delivering financial sovereignty to millions through its identity-based blockchain technology. The company’s flagship product, MetaMUI, revolutionizes digital identity and currency by promoting self-sovereign finance and building sustainable, inclusive economic models. MetaMUI’s hybrid blockchain structure uniquely suits digital national currency, digital stock exchanges, and cross-border payments, reinforcing Sovereign Wallet’s vision of a decentralized, sovereign, and self-sustaining global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>About Wakka Wakka&nbsp;Nation</p><p>The Wakka Wakka Nation is a sovereign Indigenous nation in Australia, committed to self-determination and economic independence. After a 25-year legal battle, the Federal Court recognized their native title claims in southern Queensland in 2022, marking a historic victory. As Queensland’s third-largest Aboriginal group, Wakka Wakka upholds their constitutional rights to self-governance, private ownership, and fair trade. Their vision <br>prioritizes financial sovereignty and a self-sustaining economy, ensuring long-term prosperity. Queensland’s largest Aboriginal community is Yarrabah, home to the Gunggandji and Yidinji&nbsp;peoples.</p><p>#SWN #MetaMUI #SovereignWallet #DigitalIdentity #Decentralization #IndigenousSovereignty #WakkaWakka #IdentityBlockchain #FinancialInclusion #FutureofMoney #ChainedCash #CrossBorderPayments #Sovereignty #IndigenousNation #DigitalNationalCurrency #IndigenousNationalInfrastructure</p><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/MetaMUI_tree">MetaMUI Linktr</a></p>

<p>SMS-based, two-factor authentication (2FA) has long been a staple security measure for many online services, including Gmail. However, as the tech industry shifts towards more secure authentication methods, it has become evident that SMS codes are no longer the ideal solution. In a recent reveal, a Gmail spokesperson has confirmed that Google is planning to phase out SMS codes for authentication, marking a significant change for billions of users worldwide.</p>  
<p>This move by Google validates HYPR's long-held belief that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwords and SMS codes are inherently insecure and susceptible to various attacks</a>. HYPR has been a leader in the passwordless authentication space, advocating for and implementing more secure methods like passkeys and QR codes for years.</p> 
 Drawbacks of SMS-based 2FA  
<p>While SMS-based 2FA has been widely adopted, it comes with several inherent security vulnerabilities that can compromise user accounts:</p> 
  
  Phishing risks: Threat actors can trick users into sharing their SMS codes, granting them unauthorized access to accounts.  
  Reliance on carrier security practices: The security of SMS codes heavily depends on the user's mobile carrier, which may have varying levels of protection against attacks.  
  Accessibility issues: Users may not always have access to the device receiving the SMS codes, making it difficult to authenticate their identity.  
  
<p>Moreover, SMS verification codes have become a target for criminals, who exploit them for various scams.</p> 
 Google's Decision to Move Away from SMS Codes  
<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/02/26/google-confirms-gmail-to-ditch-sms-code-authentication/">Forbes</a>, Gmail spokesperson Ross Richendrfer revealed Google's intention to move past passwords and SMS messages for authentication. According to Richendrfer, Google currently uses SMS verification for two primary purposes:</p> 
  
  Security: Verifying that the service is dealing with the same user as before.  
  Abuse control: Preventing fraudsters from abusing Google's services, such as creating thousands of Gmail accounts to distribute spam and malware.  
  
<p>However, SMS codes present numerous challenges, as outlined by Richendrfer and his colleague Kimberly Samra:</p> 
  
  Phishing risks: Users can be tricked into sharing their SMS codes with threat actors.  
  Accessibility concerns: Users may not always have access to the device receiving the codes.  
  Carrier security practices: The security of SMS codes relies on the user's carrier, which may have varying levels of protection.  
  
<p>Richendrfer emphasized that if a fraudster can easily trick a carrier into obtaining someone's phone number, the security value of SMS is significantly diminished.</p> 
<p>Moreover, SMS verification codes are often at the heart of many criminal operations, such as traffic pumping scams, artificial traffic inflation, and toll fraud. These scams involve fraudsters manipulating online service providers to send large numbers of SMS messages to numbers they control, thereby earning money for each delivered message.</p> 
 Gmail's Transition to QR Codes for Authentication  
<p>To address the security concerns associated with SMS codes, Gmail is set to introduce a new phone number verification process in the coming months. Instead of receiving a 6-digit SMS code, users will be presented with a QR code that they need to scan using their phone's camera app.</p> 
<p>The benefits of QR codes for authentication, as stated by Google, are threefold:</p> 
  
  Reduced phishing risk: Since there are no shareable codes, the risk of users being tricked into sharing their security codes with threat actors is significantly reduced.  
  Decreased reliance on phone carriers: In most cases, Google users will no longer need to rely on their phone carrier for anti-abuse protections.  
  Mitigation of global SMS abuse impact: The transition to QR codes will help reduce the impact of rampant, global SMS abuse.  
  
HYPR applauds Google's move to QR codes, a technology we have been championing for years. We have recognized the inherent limitations and vulnerabilities of SMS codes and have been actively implementing QR code authentication across our platform.
<br> 
 HYPR's Implementation of QR Codes  
<p>At HYPR, we have integrated QR codes into various aspects of our identity assurance platform, including:</p> 
  
  Onboarding: New users can be onboarded seamlessly and securely using QR codes to verify their identity and register their devices.  
  Reprovisioning: If a user loses or replaces their device, they can quickly and easily reprovision their credentials using a QR code.  
  Fallback: In situations where a user's primary authentication method is unavailable, QR codes can serve as a secure fallback option.  
  
  
   
   
   
    
   
   
<p>Demo example of HYPR's QR code implementation</p> 
<p>Our commitment to QR code authentication stems from our understanding of its security benefits. Unlike SMS codes, QR codes are less susceptible to phishing attacks, as they are not shareable codes. Moreover, QR codes do not rely on carrier security practices, making them a more reliable authentication method.</p> 
 Expert Perspective on QR Code Authentication  
<p>While Google's decision to deprecate SMS codes is a positive step, it's important to remember that QR codes are not without their own security considerations. As a relatively new technology for authentication, QR codes may not be viewed with the same level of suspicion as other, more established phishing techniques. This lack of awareness can be exploited by threat actors.</p> 
<p>However, HYPR's CEO, Bojan Simic, emphasizes the importance of context and implementation when evaluating the security of QR codes. "While it's true that QR codes can be exploited in phishing attacks, the context in which they are used significantly impacts their security," says Simic. "When implemented correctly, as part of a comprehensive, passwordless MFA platform, QR codes offer a significant security advantage over SMS codes and passwords."</p> 
<p>Simic further explains, "HYPR's implementation of QR codes leverages device-bound credentials and cryptographic techniques that mitigate the risks associated with phishing and session hijacking. This ensures that even if a user scans a malicious QR code, their credentials remain secure."</p> 
<p>To further enhance security, HYPR's platform incorporates additional layers of protection, such as:</p> 
  
  Risk-based authentication: <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> analyzes various risk signals, such as user behavior, device posture, and location, to assess the risk associated with each authentication attempt. This allows for dynamic adjustments to the authentication process, ensuring that only legitimate users gain access.  
  Identity verification: <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">HYPR Affirm</a> provides a deterministic way to prove a user's identity, preventing account takeover attacks that exploit social engineering and help desk vulnerabilities.  
  By combining QR code authentication with these advanced security measures, HYPR provides an end-to-end secure authentication solution that mitigates the risks associated with both traditional and emerging attack vectors.
<br> 
 Beyond QR Codes: HYPR's Comprehensive Approach to Identity Assurance  
<p>Gmail's plan to phase out SMS codes in favor of QR codes marks a significant security moment for Google and its billions of users worldwide. By addressing the vulnerabilities associated with SMS-based authentication, Google aims to provide a more secure experience for its users. This move aligns with HYPR's mission to deliver passwordless identity assurance by unifying phishing-resistant authentication, adaptive risk mitigation, and automated identity verification.</p> 
<p>HYPR's innovative identity assurance platform empowers organizations to embrace phishing-resistant authentication methods like passkeys, and allow for more secure alternatives like QR codes, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience. As the tech industry continues to evolve, HYPR remains committed to staying ahead of the curve, providing cutting-edge solutions that safeguard digital identities.</p>

<p>Authentication policies in <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-access-management">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> are the bedrock of modern enterprise security. They control who accesses what, safeguarding your organization's crown jewels — its data and systems. But deploying new (or even tweaking existing) policies can feel like navigating a minefield. One misstep can trigger accidental lockouts, open up security gaps or even bring operations to a screeching halt.</p>  
<p>Wouldn't it be great if you could take those policies for a test drive before unleashing them on your users? Now you can. HYPR's Policy Simulation lets you do just that — validate your authentication policies in a safe and controlled environment, so you can be sure they work exactly as intended before they go live. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 Deploy with Confidence, Secure by Design  
<p>Run simulations to see precisely how policy changes will impact user access before they're enforced. This proactive approach eliminates the risk of:</p> 
  
  Accidental Lockouts: No more locking out legitimate users from critical resources. &nbsp; &nbsp;  
  Security Gaps: Prevent unauthorized access and keep your sensitive data locked down tight. &nbsp; &nbsp;  
  Operational Disruptions: Ensure business continuity by preventing access issues that impact productivity. &nbsp; &nbsp;  
  
<p>HYPR Policy Simulation lets you fine-tune your configurations without impacting real users, ensuring a smooth and secure transition for every policy update. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 Test Drive Your Security with Policy Simulation  
<p>The HYPR Policy Simulation feature is accessed through the HYPR Adapt policy engine within the <a href="https://classicdocs.hypr.com/docs/cc/intro-cc#hypr-control-center">HYPR Control Center</a>. From there, you can define a new risk policy, selecting from built-in templates or crafting custom rules tailored to your specific requirements. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once your policy is defined, you can select a real user account from your system to use in the simulation. This allows you to see how the policy would affect an actual user's access without any real-world impact. You can also specify a timeframe for the simulation, determining the period for which you want to analyze real user events. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the user and timeframe selected, HYPR Policy Simulation would process the user's events and evaluate how the policy would impact their access. The results are displayed in an easy-to-understand format, showing whether the policy would have blocked or allowed access based on the user's behavior. &nbsp;<br>This allows you to fine-tune your policies before deployment, ensuring they work exactly as intended. By testing in a simulated environment, you can identify and address any potential issues before they impact real users.</p>

<p>As quantum computing advances, it brings immense potential for innovation, but also profound risks to digital security. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has taken a proactive step in addressing these challenges by releasing three new Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): FIPS 203, 204, and 205. These standards aim to fortify systems against quantum attacks, ensuring the continued protection of sensitive information. For the identity and access management (IAM) industry, understanding and adopting these standards is crucial to maintaining trust and security in an era of quantum uncertainty.</p>

<p>The $DOCK to $CHEQ token migration has been a success!&nbsp;The vast majority of token holders have already migrated their $DOCK tokens to $CHEQ, and the process has been smooth and without delays.</p><p>As we approach the final phase, this is an important reminder:</p><p>The Token Migration Ends on March 15th</p><p>As planned, the migration will officially close on March 15th at 12:01 AM UTC. If you haven’t migrated your tokens yet, the coming weeks will be your last opportunity to do so.</p><p>If you still hold $DOCK tokens, make sure to complete your migration before the deadline to ensure a seamless transition to $CHEQ.</p><p>As of March 15th, the Dock blockchain network will be shut down, and the $DOCK token wallet will no longer be active.</p><p>Important details for stakers and validators:</p><p>Starting March 5th, we’ll reduce the number of active validators, leaving only Dock Labs' validator pool running in preparation for the shutdown.</p>  We advise all validators and stakers to begin <a href="https://docs.truvera.io/dock-token/staking/how-to-unbond-and-rebond?ref=blog.dock.io">unbonding</a> now to ensure their tokens are ready for migration as soon as possible.  The unbonding period is currently 7 days.  Starting March 5th, the unbonding period will be removed, allowing you to unbond your tokens immediately.  If you start unbonding before March 5th, you will still need to complete the full 7-day unbonding period, even after the change.  <p></p> How to migrate your DOCK tokens to CHEQ  Before you start   Ensure you have a compatible wallet for $CHEQ. If you don’t already have one, <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets?ref=blog.dock.io">follow these instructions</a> to set one up. We recommend using the <a href="https://www.leapwallet.io/download?ref=blog.dock.io">Leap wallet</a>, which has a browser extension and a mobile wallet on both Android and iOS, and can be easily connected during the migration process. There is another alternative which is to use the <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets/keplr-setup?ref=blog.dock.io">Keplr wallet</a>.  Update your wallet software to their latest versions. This ensures compatibility with the new system and reduces the likelihood of encountering bugs or issues during migration.  Note that the migration must be done through the <a href="https://fe.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io#/migration">Dock browser-based wallet</a>. If you use the Dock Wallet App or Nova Wallet, you can easily add your account to the Dock browser wallet by <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet?ref=blog.dock.io">following these steps</a>.  Read and understand the migration's terms and conditions. Make sure you are familiar with the terms before proceeding. You can review them <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/migration-terms-and-conditions?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.   Migrating your DOCK tokens   Access the migration page<br>Click <a href="https://fe.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io#/migration">here</a> to visit the migration page and begin the process.  Connect Leap or manually enter your cheqd account<br>Connecting the Leap wallet ensures that the tokens are sent to the cheqd account you control. If you do not see your Leap accounts in the dropdown, <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets/setup-leap-wallet?ref=blog.dock.io">follow these steps</a> to set up your Leap wallet for cheqd.  Select your Dock account<br>If your account isn’t already added, <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet?ref=blog.dock.io">follow these instructions</a> to add it.  Accept the <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/migration-terms-and-conditions?ref=blog.dock.io">Terms &amp; Conditions</a><br>Once you've reviewed the T&amp;Cs, click Submit to confirm your migration request.  <p>The full balance of your Dock account will be migrated in a single transaction, partial amounts are not permitted. Once submitted, your $DOCK tokens will be burnt, and the converted $CHEQ tokens will be sent to your designated cheqd wallet using the swap ratio of 18.5178 $DOCK to 1 $CHEQ.&nbsp;</p><p>The migration process typically takes 1-2 business days, after which your $CHEQ tokens will be available in your cheqd wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Please follow these steps carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team at <a href="mailto:support@dock.io">support@dock.io</a>.</p><p>Note: If you need any transaction reports from the Dock blockchain for tax purposes, make sure to download them from our <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Subscan blockchain explorer</a> before March 15, 2025.</p> The Future of Decentralized ID <p>Dock and cheqd will continue as independent companies serving distinct market sectors in unique ways.

									  ByBit Hack on a Two-Bit Blockchain   <p>The afore-pictured downturn in our favorite token’s value would suggest some major breaking news in the crypto space. Did FTX crash again or something?<br><br>This time around, the truth is not nearly as exciting. That’s a good thing.</p>  <p>There were two big news stories last week. First, on February 20, the SEC ended a number of lawsuits against and/or investigations into major crypto exchanges and slashed the size of its task force from 50 attorneys to 30. Subsequently, $1.5 billion worth of our&nbsp;least&nbsp;favorite token, $ETH, was stolen from Dubai’s ByBit exchange, by far the biggest heist in crypto history.</p>  <p>Coincidence? Yeah, probably.</p>  <p>Despite ample X rumors that it was an inside job, there is little hard evidence that the ByBit situation had anything to do with fraud. Reporting says the money was stolen by a sophisticated hacker group out of North Korea known as the Lazarus Group, acting independently. (No, not our friendly neighborhood&nbsp;<a href="https://lazarusgroup.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=layer-two-bit">fine art printing shop</a>.)</p>  <p>The rumors stem from a supposed social engineering tactic that deceived the participants of ByBit’s multi-signature execution. Crypto natives are convinced that at least one of the seasoned signers in charge of security — and, thus, auditing any transactions —&nbsp;should have noticed the issue.</p>  <p>But regardless of whether or not the major centralized exchanges (predominantly outside of the U.S.) are engaging in practices that defraud their trading customers, there is a real concern about the way in which the ByBit hack was conducted. It laid bare the fragility, not just of Ethereum, but of the core infrastructure underpinning most layer-2 security architectures: the multisig wallet.<br><br>A multi-signature wallet requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. It ensures that no one person can access funds without collaboration, requiring a predefined number of signers, such as 2-of-3, to approve any action. They are incredibly widespread, but evidently, far from foolproof. Multisig wallets can be vulnerable to key loss, hacking, or compromise of multiple signers.</p>  <p>Beyond that specific point of compromise, the hack exposes the downsides of these systems’ complexities. You could argue that complexity creates more barriers for cyber threats to overcome, but it also creates more attack surfaces for hackers to accomplish exactly what Lazurus did.</p>  <p>All in all, it’s just another data point in my advocacy for L1-only solutions to scale a decentralized world computer and empower internet users with privacy and data value rights. This attack is an example on the vulnerability of the systems that currently connect L1s to L2s. What it proves to me is that L2s are just middle-man leech systems, best reserved for the role of dApps, not secure protocol infrastructure.</p>  <p>With ETHDenver&nbsp;— and, consequently, a lot of headline-grabbing L2 announcements — on the horizon, my perspective is an unpopular one. But simply put, ETH is bad for the future of decentralization and empowering the end user. It lends itself to large institutions. And if we’re just going to recreate the Big Tech environment, what is the fucking point of any of this?</p>  <p>Which brings us back to the market side of things. The ByBit hack probably put downward pressure on Ethereum, and contagion runs rampant in the crypto space. (The average Bitcoin buyer probably doesn’t know there’s a difference between L1s and L2s to begin with.) But crypto bull markets are always volatile, and this time around, there isn’t a bubble that can be popped by a few bad actors. We got to the recent all-time highs through steady building and innovation, which I believe will bring us back to and beyond them.<br><br>In 2025, it’s not about the breaking news and bad actors. The technology solves real problems, and the teams focused on those use cases will outlive the charlatans and card houses. The cream always rises to the top.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
							 
			
						
		 
						 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         Pushing the Nvlope   <p>We’re pretty radical about data ownership here in the&nbsp;-land. But we’re rational about it as well.</p>  <p>We know that, despite the privacy concerns and potential monetary benefits, the average person doesn’t give a damn about whether or not Google and its extensive network of third-party advertisers has their birthday, home address, and maybe the odd Social Security number in there too. But there’s one category of information I’d argue each and every one of us don’t want falling into the wrong hands: our medical data.</p>  <p>Now, the definition of “wrong hands” may differ from person to person, but there’s one thing constant for everyone. It’s very rarely in&nbsp;your&nbsp;hands. For decades, patient medical data has been locked away in centralized systems, difficult to access, share, or monetize.</p>  <p>But just as blockchain is transforming finance and&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/38-bond-villain-vibes/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=layer-two-bit">genomics</a>, it’s now revolutionizing healthcare. A web3-powered radiology platform called Nvlope is designed to break down data silos, give patients control over their medical imaging, and create new revenue streams for both individuals and facilities.</p>  <p>With Nvlope, facilities can earn from data monetization even without adopting the software. If a patient monetizes their radiology data, the originating facility automatically receives Radiology Permission Tokens (RPTs) held in escrow, ensuring they benefit from revenue sharing. Over time, this model could lead to free imaging services, offsetting costs through the power of blockchain-based microtransactions.</p>  <p>All that raises the crucial question: Has Elon Musk heard of this? As the government faces growing pressure to reduce federal healthcare spending, web3 could offer a genuine solution to automate processes, open new revenue sources, and ethically integrate AI into medicine.</p>  <p>With Nvlope’s Digital Artifacts, patients can:</p>    <p>Securely store and share imaging records across institutions.</p>  <p>Monetize their bio-assets, creating new value from their medical history.</p>  <p>Compare radiology data with genomics, AI analysis, and interdisciplinary studies to unlock new healthcare insights.</p>    <p>Along with&nbsp;<a href="https://genobank.io/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=layer-two-bit">GenoBank.io</a>, which we spotlighted two weeks ago, Nvlope is building a Proof of Need (PoN) framework, where digital assets across different medical service lines verify real-world demand for decentralized healthcare solutions. By linking genetic and radiology data, patients can participate in research, AI-driven diagnostics, and tokenized health ecosystems—all while maintaining full sovereignty over their data.</p>  <p>With Nvlope, patients reclaim ownership of their radiology records while providers tap into new revenue streams powered by web3. This is more than just a technology shift — it’s a fundamental change in how healthcare data is stored, shared, and valued.</p>  <p>Your doctor is likely no stranger to awkward questions. So why wait? Ask if they can mint your medical records today!</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>At SpruceID, we believe that any successful digital identity program must be open and interoperable, allowing many identity issuers and verifiers to share <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/navigating-the-jungle-of-digital-credential-standards/">standardized technical “rails.”</a> This opens the playing field for competitive innovation, both in technical approaches and business focus, making sure that every possible advantage of digital identity reaches the real world.</p><p>This open-network model fundamentally relies on another kind of openness: open-source code and software. The basic idea of open source is that it can be freely viewed, borrowed, and modified, an ethos that has been fundamental to the progress of digital technology as a whole. It’s sometimes referred to as FOSS, for “free and open source software.”</p><p>Open source can also provide substantive security and interoperability advantages specific to identity systems, particularly for digital wallets. Read on for a concise breakdown of those advantages and why the many new players joining the digital identity ecosystem should seriously consider an open source approach.</p> What is ‘Open Source’? <p>At root, “open source” describes a type of copyright license attached to a published piece of software. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses?ref=blog.spruceid.com">many types of open-source licenses</a>, each with specific permissions and limits on how the software can be borrowed from, transformed, and used. For instance, some FOSS licenses allow reused code to be integrated into copyrighted commercial products, while some do not.</p><p>The goals of open source were first laid out in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">late 1980s by pioneering hacker Richard Stallman</a>, and one major motive was simple efficiency. Many different software packages include very similar modules or functions under the hood, and making those components freely reusable has contributed massively to the success of the software industry. SpruceID is very proud to share its work with identity developers via <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a>, our open-source package of tools for building identity with digital credentials, and on our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid?ref=blog.spruceid.com">extensive Github repository</a> here. (We even just completed a full DevDoc content review &amp; refresh here: https://www.sprucekit.dev.)&nbsp;</p><p>A recent study from the Harvard Business School found that this sort of efficiency amounted to a staggering <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4693148&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">$8.8 trillion in value for technology firms</a>, which would have to spend 3.5 times more on development costs without open source. It’s important to point out that open-source isn’t simply a free lunch, though: if you’re using open-source components in a project, there’s an expectation that you’ll make your own contributions in return. That’s why SpruceID is an active supporter of open source initiatives: we’re a founding member of the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, and we fund initiatives to support open source developers in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p> Open Source Means Trust Assurance <p>The security and trust advantages of open-source software development may be even more significant than the efficiency benefits. Because open-source code is publicly viewable, it has the potential to be vetted by many more developers than would review it within a single organization. Furthermore, code components that are deployed across many software packages have a head start on “real-world” testing.</p><p>This benefit is particularly relevant - perhaps even essential - for wallet software. That’s because many of the security protections of wallet software are deep in the code, particularly including how user data is stored and shared. The ability to review the underlying code is the best way to make sure, for instance, that a wallet is interacting with a device's secure element chip correctly or that it can’t be subverted by a ‘rooted’ operating system.</p><p>It’s important to note that making code publicly viewable should not be a security risk for revealing specific tokens, passwords, or access codes. One might compare it to looking at a diagram of a lock: open source will reveal if the lock’s design is flawed in a way that could be exploited, but it won’t let you create a key that would open any specific lock.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, as with all software, it’s important to apply security precautions. For open source, projects can evolve rapidly, and while the community often identifies vulnerabilities quickly, users must stay vigilant. It’s necessary to regularly update dependencies, review project activity, and verify package integrity. Automated vulnerability scanning and ensuring third-party code aligns with organizational security policies can offer further protection. With thoughtful management, open source can be leveraged confidently without compromising security.</p> Innovation in More Directions <p>Finally, the core advantage of open-source software is that it allows software builders to innovate faster by building on work that has come before. Open source licenses allow code to be freely modified, meaning a developer can borrow something close to what they’re trying to create and then add modifications specific to their goals, which may be quite different than the functionality of the library it’s built upon.&nbsp;</p><p>This “building on the work of others” can be particularly powerful for applications that run on <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/navigating-the-jungle-of-digital-credential-standards/">open data standards</a>, including digital credential wallets. A wallet may integrate preexisting components that handle the underlying standards and then build specific features that expand on that shared foundation for its particular use cases. This could be something as simple as tailoring the aesthetics and layout of a user interface or more nuanced details such as creating more detailed security or adding more sharing options.</p><p>This capacity for innovation then has a positive flipside, which is the freedom to not innovate. Credential wallets, in particular, can be quite basic re-uses of existing code, or experimental forks veering off into new territory. That makes the open source approach particularly appealing for state governments or other entities testing the waters: a project can be tailored to the capacity and experience of staff and constituents as needed. But for those adopters of Open-Source, no matter where the project ends up, you may already be standing on the shoulders of giants.</p> Let’s Build the Future of Digital Identity Together <p>SpruceID is committed to advancing open source solutions that empower individuals and organizations with secure, privacy-preserving digital identity tools.

As a privacy-first startup, our team understands the importance of data <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a> in <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>To help our users, we're starting article series like this one, which will cover not just how we make these elements of personal intelligence work ethically, but why you should care about them at all. As business owners and individuals increasingly adopt AI-powered solutions, from ChatGPT to Copilot, understanding these concepts becomes crucial.</p> <p>I’m Simon Westh Henriksen, Co-Founder of <a href="https://mykin.ai">Kin</a>. As CTO, I’m dedicated to making Kin the most personal, private, and trustworthy AI assistant we can - all while showing why this technology is cutting-edge along the way</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a05201e-5f91-46dd-ab79-e537df0583f4_997x997.jpeg">   </a> <p><a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/simonhenriksen">Follow me on LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kinpersonalai">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://x.com/simonhenriksen">X</a> - or join Kin’s <a href="https://discord.gg/PYMyz6uRct">Discord</a></p> <p>As you probably guessed, this series is on the role of memory technology in personal AI, and why it's essential for improving your experience with AI models and your own AI.</p><p>This article will focus on why you should even care in the first place.</p> Introducing a new relationship: <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> <p>Meeting your AI companion is a little different to meeting a new person - Kin is always available in real-time, infinitely patient, and can be tailored to your specific requirements quite unlike any other technology.</p><p>However, much like any new person you meet, memory is essential to that conversation.</p><p>Without it, your AI assistant would unknowingly ask the same questions over and over, much like one of the many characters talking to Phil Connors (Bill Murray) in Groundhog Day. Just like any other <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbot</a>, it would have absolutely no way to recall previous interactions.</p><p>Imagine meeting that new person, and having to repeat the same conversations every time you meet. Eventually, you would give up. No bond would grow, because as our <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust article series</a> noted, connection relies on shared experiences and understanding. Any effort made to teach the language model about you, or personalize its responses, would be lost.</p><p>So, a personal AI without memory is just another chatbot - useful for basic workflows and automation, but incapable of deep, ongoing support. That's the biggest reason memory is important to you as a user, but not the only one.</p> You need the power of pattern recognition <p>Humans are excellent at recognizing patterns in others, and even in things that don't have them (just Google "paradolia"). However, we can often struggle to see patterns in ourselves.</p><p>This can be as big as a friend noticing that you keep falling into the same toxic relationship patterns before you do - or as small as you not realizing that the only way you remember your keys in the morning is to leave them by the door.</p><p>Recognizing these patterns in ourselves often takes multiple mistakes and years of conscious <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/improve-self-evaluation-professional-growth">self-reflection</a>. Machine learning and AI agents, on the other hand, excel at pattern recognition - when paired with an effective memory system. A well-structured memory allows artificial intelligence to analyze user behaviors over time, so it can point out these things as insights offering and help prevent you from repeating mistakes.</p><p>In this way, AI chat can act as a mirror, reflecting back on past choices, behaviors, and trends in a way that enhances self-awareness and personal <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/growth-mindset-the-power-of-belief">growth</a>.</p><p>And, more importantly, it can do all of this without you pouring over your <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-journal">Journal entries</a> from months ago - if you even wrote any in the first place.</p> Memory makes your conversations fluid <p>Memory isn't just about recalling facts—it's about continuity and natural language understanding. A great memory system allows AI to store, retrieve, and understand a spectrum of information, from minor preferences to significant life events:</p>  <p>The small things: Remembering favorite colors, dietary restrictions, or daily habits.</p>  <p>The big things: Keeping track of important relationships, major life events, and personal growth over time.</p>  <p>Without this nuance, AI might recall your breakfast habits of the last month - but not your life goals. That can make a Sunday-night conversation about what you should do with your life likely to include much more cereal than you were expecting.</p><p>A proper memory depth, then, enables AI to work out its own context and continuity - so you can spend more time talking to it naturally, and less time explaining how there are bigger things in your life than tomorrow's chocolate crunch.</p> Short-term &amp; long-term memory are essential <p>In a similar vein, for AI to be truly personal, it must manage both short-term and long-term memory effectively:</p>  <p>Short-term memory: Retaining details from an ongoing conversation to maintain context.</p>  <p>Long-term memory: Remembering past interactions, user preferences, and historical insights to enhance understanding over time.</p>  <p>Without short-term memory, your personal AI will struggle to craft a coherent and constructive response to each new message.</p><p>But, without long-term memory, your personal AI will be incapable of recalling and analyzing past information - not to mention the personalizations you've made.</p><p>A good AI will have this dual-memory structure so that it can engage in meaningful conversations with thoughtful, personalized responses - not generic answers.</p> <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistants</a> should grow with you <p>You can probably see where this is going. Just like its memory of you can help you grow, a personal AI's understanding of its users and the world should help it grow too.</p><p>A good memory system will allow AI to evolve alongside its user, adjusting and refining its approach based on past interactions, use cases, and user feedback.</p><p>At its core, its this adaptability that makes a personal AI 'personal' in the first place: if it can't tailor its responses to your dislike of the color red, or, say, overly polite feedback - it might as well just be any other AI Chatbot out there.</p><p>However, it goes deeper than that. Memory can help AI with:</p>  <p>Context-Aware prioritization: This is where the AI intelligently adjusts its focus based on the user's current life circumstances and trends, rather than merely following static routines.</p><p>For example, if you're stressed at work, the AI might emphasize stress reduction techniques, provide time management suggestions, or offer strategies to improve productivity. Or, during a period of personal reflection, it could prioritize emotional insights and goal-setting guidance.</p><p>But it needs to remember your current situation (and differentiate it from your "stress" over your cold takeout fries) in order to do that.</p>  <p>Communication style adaptation: Where the AI learns how you like to speak and be spoken to, so you can feel more comfortable and the AI can stop asking you tell it what 'skibidi toilet' means.</p>  <p>Predicting needs: Where the AI proactively suggests actions to you based on your past behavior, like reminding you to buy groceries on your usual shopping day. It needs to be able to recall, understand, and analyze past conversations in order to figure that information out.</p>   Supporting you is everything <p>All of this sets a program up to be an effective personal AI, but to build true rapport, an AI must do more than remember and understand facts - it needs to recognize and respond to the emotional patterns they represent.</p><p>By remembering details about your life, and understanding their relation to your feelings, personal AI can offer more empathetic and context-aware on-demand support than any other AI. This could look like:</p>  <p>Recognizing mood shifts: "You seem to be more stressed than usual. Has something changed at work?"</p>  <p>Understanding emotional triggers: "I'm noticing that you often feel ignored before an argument begins. Would you like to discuss that?"</p>   Kin &amp; the future of your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companions</a> <p>As this article has come to imply, truly personal AI should function as a combination of a friend, a coach, and a mentor. Each plays a distinct role in our lives, but none has complete insight.</p><p>AI, with an advanced memory system, can bridge these gaps.</p><p>Unlike human relationships, where sharing personal information always comes with a degree of uncertainty regarding how it will be received, AI can and should offer a safe space where you have <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-view-and-control-your-data">control over your data and interactions</a>. It's what we built Kin to do.</p><p>By remembering, adapting, and providing insightful feedback, memory-equipped personal AI has the potential to revolutionize how we understand ourselves, make decisions, and interact with the world. This is why memory is not just an enhancement—it is the foundation of a truly intelligent, useful, and personal AI. And that’s why it’s the foundation of Kin.</p><p>So, why is personal AI with a memory system like this so rare? We'll discuss that in our next article.</p>
