<p>This is going to be a small Dev Pulse; I’m just going to update you on the status of three branches of Holochain. If you’re a developer, I hope you’ll find this useful for planning out your upgrade path.</p><p>Don’t miss the bit at the bottom! A scaffolding template for generating React UIs has been contributed by a thoughtful member of our community!</p> Holochain 0.1.x series: Skip 0.1.4, wait for 0.1.5 <p>In an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-matures/#holochain-011-to-014-bug-fixes-and-backports">update last week</a> to Dev Pulse 133, I reported that there were some ‘slightly breaking’ changes which resulted in some issues that broke the Holonix dev environment. The dev team has reverted part of the change, which may still require a tiny bit of code refactoring in your validation functions but will repair the dev environment.</p><p>There are also some database schema changes in 0.1.4. They don’t affect hApp code, but people using 0.1.4 won’t be able to import their hApp data from 0.1.3 and earlier.</p><p>There is an upcoming version, 0.1.5, which will include the fix for the dev environment as well as a migration path for older database versions. There’s already a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.1.5-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">release candidate for 0.1.5</a> which contains some of the fixes; the final version will contain all of them. We recommend you wait until 0.1.5 is released before upgrading your hApp code and asking your users to upgrade their Launcher.</p> Holochain 0.2.x series: Gossip fix in the works, dev tooling expected for 0.2.1 <p>So the <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1651699231583875077?ref=blog.holochain.org">big news</a> last week is that we released <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain 0.2.0</a> on schedule. This release series includes peer blocking and warrants, which form the foundation of Holochain’s immune system. It also comes with a raft of other updates, like a move to end-to-end-encrypted WebRTC for network communications.</p><p>But! While preparing the dev tooling, a gossip issue was discovered which is causing peers to become unable to communicate with each other. The core team is working on the fix for 0.2.1, after which the dev tooling (client libs, Tryorama, <code>hc</code> dev tool, Launcher, and Holonix dev environment) will be fully tested and released.</p><p>So we recommend you wait until then before updating your code for 0.2.x — and remember that you don’t have to if you don’t need the new features yet. Our six-month support promise for 0.1.x is still there.</p><p>When the dev tools are released, I’ll have a big Dev Pulse for you with all the release notes to help you update your code.</p> Holochain 0.3.x series: Moving right along <p>Although each point release comes with a feature freeze, the core dev team hasn’t stopped adding new ones. Holochain 0.3 and the accompanying dev tooling will include these new features:</p>  A conductor can make multiple WebRTC signal server connections, for increased resilience and availability on local and global networks.  DHT storage arcs can be resized, to let resource-constrained devices throttle their resource contributions or let powerful devices take a larger share.  Zero-sized storage arcs don’t participate in gossip, to allow the most resource-constrained devices to opt out completely.  The Holonix dev environment can pull binaries from a trusted cache on the localnet.  Link retrieval can be batched, and just the count of links can be retrieved.  The HoloPort Alpha network will be used to scale-test Holochain with certain hApps.  <p>Most of these features are in service of in-person hackathons, and more immediately, <a href="http://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a>’s <a href="http://dwebcamp.org/tomorrow/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tomorrow</a> event. On this last full day of the camp, the WiFi meshnet’s link to the global internet will be shut off. It’ll be an opportunity for all the participants to use the offline-friendly, local-first technology they’ve brought. Holochain’s offering (in addition to being a sponsor this year!) will be a hApp to help people organise and take notes for <a href="https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Open Space</a> sessions. We intend it as a gift to the DWeb community in keeping with the spirit of cooperation that I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">found so beautiful</a> when I attended last year.</p><p>You can read more about how Holochain plans to get involved this year in this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dweb-camp-discovering-flows/">recent article</a>.</p><p>So… Do you want to be part of dogfooding a real hApp? Do you want to get acquainted with wonderful folks who are trying to use digital technology, so often a cause of degeneration, to birth something new and inspiring?</p><p>There are early bird discounts for families and teams, but they end next Monday, May 8th. We also have a 25% discount code you can use: <code>FRIENDSANDFAMILY</code></p><p>We hope we get to <a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/gatheringsforgood/861532?ref=blog.holochain.org">meet you there</a>, in Navarro, CA, US, from 21 to 25 June!</p> React template for scaffolding <p><a href="https://github.com/nick-stebbings?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nick Stebbings</a>, a developer in the community, has shared a <a href="https://github.com/nick-stebbings/holochain-react-scaffold-template?ref=blog.holochain.org">React UI template</a> for use in the <code>hc scaffold</code> command. You can use it by passing the GitHub URL and template name (there are two templates, <code>app</code> and <code>module</code>):</p> <code>hc scaffold web-app \
    --templates-url https://github.com/nick-stebbings/holochain-react-scaffold-template \
    --template app \
    my-awesome-app</code> <p>It’s pretty great to see contributions like this. It shows the dev community is growing (and generous), and it allows the dev community to grow even more by meeting UI devs where they’re at.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@stefanolombardo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Stefano Lombardo</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/XpZaBZqG_og?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Three of my four grandparents were teachers. Their love of learning and passion for lighting a spark in their students impressed upon me the power that teachers have to change lives and shape the future. As I’m writing this, I am in Jacksonville, Florida, just a few miles from where my grandmother, Rosalie Gordon-Mills, was an educator for over 40 years in the St. John’s County public schools in St. Augustine. Being here reminds me of one of her star students, W.D. McCoy, who with her support and encouragement, grew up to be an engineer and director of a major university’s engineering school.</p>



<p>Teachers play an essential role in helping the next generation of learners develop science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills that will prepare them for the jobs of tomorrow. They inspire innovators and cultivate the creative thinking that will solve the world’s biggest challenges. Through my work with <a href="https://skillsbuild.org/secondary-educators">IBM SkillsBuild®</a>, IBM’s signature global education and skilling program, I am honored to connect with educators, as well as partners and policymakers, who are passionate about helping teachers do what they do best.</p>


<a href="https://skillsbuild.org/secondary-educators">Learn more about IBM SkillsBuild for teachers</a>



 STEM resources enhance student learning 



<p>Teachers have told us about the variety of challenges they face every day, from creating appealing content to keeping up with STEM tools and trends like artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. Teachers need resources and support that are cost-effective and easy to implement. IBM SkillsBuild shares free resources that are developed with input from teachers, and we partner to provide free STEM training to teachers across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Johnna Walker Jackson, a high school teacher at Compton Unified School District, told us about a student who struggled with core curriculum but excelled when given the opportunity to use IBM SkillsBuild to explore content related to her career interests and to work independently at her own pace. This is a great example of why teacher toolkits are key. Teacher-facing resources (including curriculum maps, lesson plans, slide decks, rubrics, student worksheets and hands-on activities) can help teachers create content that’s appealing and resonates with their students. For these toolkits to be truly successful, we also need to provide comprehensive training on technical and programmatic implementation, such as registration and learner management, as well as courses on how to teach topics including cybersecurity, emerging tech, AI and professional skills.</p>



<p>Technology training can transform lives. With most STEM training, learners often <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-02-14-New-IBM-Survey-Reveals-the-Greatest-Perceived-Barrier-to-Professional-or-Technical-Skill-Development-is-that-the-Programs-are-Too-Expensive">don’t know where to start</a> or think it’s too expensive. Topics and tools like cybersecurity and generative AI are making their way into classroom discussions, so we’re helping teachers connect their students with relevant learning journeys. The IBM SkillsBuild <a href="https://skillsbuild.org/students/course-catalog">course catalog</a> helps students and teachers explore the courses and the digital credentials available. It provides background and information about each role, the core skills required and details of the learning journey.</p>



<p>Jennifer Lucia, a former teacher who is now part of my team at IBM, saw firsthand how students sometimes struggle to communicate the value of the skills they have acquired. IBM SkillsBuild helps teachers guide students to relevant online learning and equips them with the language to illustrate their knowledge in real-world settings.</p>



 Training teachers through collaboration 



<p>Another ongoing challenge teachers face is finding training and support that is cost-effective. That’s why we’re excited to be working with the <a href="https://www.tiesteach.org/">Teaching Institute for Excellence in STEM</a> (TIES) to <a href="https://stemecosystems.org/the-common-denominator/">develop a training program</a> to equip hundreds of K-12 teachers with no-cost STEM education and career readiness resources for their students. I’m excited to see the exponential impact that this initiative will have as we reach underrepresented communities in tech.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a teacher, a student, a parent or a job seeker, IBM SkillsBuild provides over 1,000 free courses on technology and professional skills. The <a href="https://bundles.yourlearning.ibm.com/students/teachertoolkit/">IBM SkillsBuild teacher toolkit</a> provides more than 200 teacher-facing resources created with input from teachers, including implementation training. Through IBM SkillsBuild, we continue to progress towards our <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-10-13-IBM-Commits-to-Skill-30-Million-People-Globally-by-2030">commitment</a> to skill 30 million people globally by 2030.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We started off this podcast conversation diving into topics like centralization and decentralization, which we hear so much in our world. I was inspired by a paper I had read earlier in the year called “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization/">Internet Centralization: What can standards do?</a>” (I may have recommended this one a couple of times before!) This paper discusses areas of the internet that are decentralized and centralized, and states that the internet is a global public good because permission is not required to connect to it, deploy an application on it, or use it for a particular purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p>“HTTP is therefore an example of platform centralization. While the protocol itself is not centralized, it facilitates the creation of consolidated services and applications like concentration. Platform centralization is difficult to prevent with protocol design.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It was interesting to have a discussion with Daniel about the trade-offs that one needs to make in protocol design and in any software application design. It’s important to consider the impact that these trade-offs will have downstream.</p>
<p>Daniel had written a very timely blog post before our conversation called “<a href="https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/big-desks-and-little-people-e1b1b9e92d79">Big Desks and Little People</a>,” which I also recommend any listener of this podcast to read. Our conversation moved into that space to discuss how certain architectural models create trade-offs. The client-server architectural model, for example, can lead to some imbalances and skew power dynamics towards the server, which in many interactions in our daily life represents an organization we are interacting with.</p>
<p>The purpose of this podcast episode isn’t to sway people against using client-server architecture for digital identity implementations. Rather, we aim to have a discussion around the trade-offs we make when making these architectural decisions. It’s not that client-server architectures don’t work for certain use cases; they do. In fact, a lot of the things we do online today are based on this model and there’s a lot of good stuff. However, it’s important to also talk about the limitations that certain architectures have.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Who defines the interface for the interaction?”</p></blockquote>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>We talked about these limitations, some great things we can do, and some great things we can’t do, with the ultimate goal to further enhance and humanize our digital interactions. We want to establish equal power dynamic opportunities and allow people to authenticate organizations and other people, moving away from just the unidirectional server-to-client or organization-to-person authentication. By humanizing our digital interactions and incorporating this in the way we design protocols, we’ll be able to develop more personalized and flexible opportunities for people to build digital trust and have similar types of opportunities that a server has towards a client.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><br>
Some of the topics discussed between Daniel and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Centralization vs. Decentralization Continuum and the role of client-server architectures – weighing different forms of centralization and their impact on other architectural goals. 
 Protocol design and its relationship to consolidation – How do we determine trade-offs between centralization and decentralization in various components within a system? 
 Balancing architectural goals – is it more of an art or a science when making these decisions – do trade-offs happen at protocol or application layers? 
 Protocol design for digital identity, digital trust, and user categorization – Achieving self-sovereignty, control, and authenticity – Confidentiality and privacy. 
 How do protocol choices affect power dynamics and trust relationships and interactions between different parties? 
 How can we drive the right standards or protocols for more flexible interactions? Incentives for organizations to support standards that facilitate interactions between individuals – Balancing short-term sacrifices for long-term gains – The role of an ecosystem in driving change. 
 Can all human-driven protocols be codified, and is ‘workflow’ flexibility more important than achieving authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy? The challenge of replicating human interactions in digital protocols – The importance of flexible workflows – Balancing security and privacy with the ability to express nuance and adaptability.

 $5000 in prizes to data scientists that predicted $ETH most accurately <p>Predict-ETH Round 5 just completed. There were 19 submissions. We’re ready to announce the winners — drumroll, please!</p>  First place ($2500 in OCEAN) goes to 0xa6fb159f491ed6f33b077ee6e1d271b53ff2cb8b  Second place ($1500 in OCEAN) goes to 0xa69c12ca709919dc291f3e67fdde42d63b7518a0  Third place ($1000 in OCEAN) goes to 0x49e8ffa2332c63c2811da7cf5ab26f223d468f6a  <p>For this round, we went “full anon” so people don’t have to submit their names. That’s why you see addresses (who sent the txs), and that’s&nbsp;all.</p><p>Winners will be airdropped OCEAN into their addresses on Eth&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Each of the winning predictions showcases how to monetize data successfully using Ocean Protocol’s open source tools for the blockchain. Congratulations to&nbsp;all!</p><p>Predict-ETH is a recurring data challenge to predict the price of ETH and win prize money, using the ocean.py library. Accurately predicting ETH can be a valuable tool in buying and selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming, or DeFi protocol development. If your predictions are consistently on point, then you can sell them as a data feed on Ocean Market, earning you even more&nbsp;income.</p><p>Of course, predicting ETH is no walk in the park. It’s a complex task that requires skill, knowledge, and a bit of luck. But that’s exactly why Ocean Protocol hosts regular Predict-ETH competitions — to help you sharpen your machine learning skills, learn from others, and potentially make some cash along the&nbsp;way.</p> Predict-ETH Round 5&nbsp;Setup <p>Predict-ETH Round 5 was <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predict-eth-round-data-challenge-5-is-live-d42ca8cf6af0">announced</a> on Apr 21, 2023. The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/main5.md">Round 5 README</a> guided contestants how to make their submissions. We held a workshop on Apr 25, 2023 for anyone working on the Predict-ETH challenge who wanted facetime with the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The submission deadline was Wed May 3, 2023, 2023 at 23:59 UTC. Competitors had to make predictions at times: Thu May 4, 2023 at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total).</p> Predict-ETH Round 5 Evaluation <p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or NMSE). That’s all. There is no subjectivity.</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must produce the outcomes that the README guides.

<p>Many of our experiences with social media today are defined by the same constraining dynamics — one private company owns all of our data, populates our feeds with an algorithm of their choice, and we’re unable to take our followers and posts with us to a new home if we ever decide to leave. The AT Protocol, a federated networking model which Bluesky is built upon, changes this.</p>
<p>Soon, we’re launching a sandbox environment to begin the testing phase of federation for the AT Protocol with allow-listed servers. In advance of this launch, we want to share some technical details about our design decisions with you.</p>
<p>At a high level, federation means that anyone can run the parts that make up the AT Protocol themselves, such as their own server. Sandbox mode means that people can start experimenting with federation without interfacing with the actual network — think of it as a test network. If you’d like to run your own server, you’ll be able to do so in the near future.</p>
 Federation Architecture 
<p>The AT Protocol is made up of a bunch of pieces that stack together. (Technically, the lower-level primitives that can get stacked together differently are the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">repositories, lexicons, and DIDs</a>.) This means that the architecture we’re proposing for launching federation is not the only network architecture that’s possible – it’s just what we expect to be the most powerful and robust way of supporting public conversations on a global social network, so we implemented it first.</p>

<p>The three main services of our first federation are personal data servers (PDS), big graph services (BGS), and App Views. Two other roles are in active development: feed generators and labelers.</p>
 
 Personal Data Server (PDS)
 
 A PDS acts as the participant’s agent in the network. This is what hosts your data (like the posts you’ve created) in your <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">repo</a>. It also handles your account &amp; login, manages your repo’s <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview#account-portability">signing key</a>, stores any of your private data (like which accounts you have muted), and handles the services you talk to for any request. 
 
 
 Big Graph Service (BGS)
 
 The BGS handles "big-world" networking.  It crawls the network, gathering as much data as it can, and outputs it in one big stream for other services to use. It’s analogous to a firehose provider or a super-powered relay node. 
 
 
 App Views
 
 An App View is the piece that actually assembles your feed and all the other data you see in the app, and is generally expected to be downstream from a BGS’s firehose of data. This is a highly semantically-aware service that produces aggregations across the network and views over some subset of the network. This is analogous to a prism that takes in the BGS’ raw firehose of data from the network, and outputs views that enable an app to show a curated feed to a user. For example, the BGS might crawl to grab data such as a certain post’s likes and reposts, and the app view will output the count of those metrics.

<p>The federation architecture allows anyone to host a BGS, though it’s a fairly resource-demanding service. In all likelihood, there may be a few large full-network providers, and then a long tail of partial-network providers. Small bespoke BGSs could also service tightly or well-defined slices of the network, like a specific new application or a small community.</p>
<p>There will also be an ecosystem of App Views for each lexicon, or “social mode,” deployed on the network. For example, Bluesky currently supports a micro-blogging mode: the <code>app.bsky</code> lexicon. Developers who create new lexicons would likely deploy a corresponding App View that understands their lexicon to service their users. Other lexicons could include video or long-form blogging, or different ways of organizing like groups and forums. By bootstrapping off of an existing BGS, data collation will already be taken care of for these new applications. They need only provide the indexing behaviors necessary for their application.</p>
 “Big World” Design 
<p>When we were architecting the topology of the AT Protocol, we looked at the web as an example. We see the web as the most successful decentralized system in existence — millions of devices globally connected on an open network — so we’re taking it as a null hypothesis of what works best.</p>
<p>As a result, we opted to architect the protocol in a “big world with small world fallbacks” way. With the web, individual computers upload content to the network, and then all of that content is then broadcasted back to other computers. Similarly, with the AT Protocol, we’re sending messages to a much smaller number of big aggregators, which then broadcast that data to personal data servers across the network. Additionally, we solve the major problems that have surfaced from the web through <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol">self-certifying data, open schematic data and APIs, and account portability</a>.</p>
<p>On a technical level, prioritizing big-world indexing over small world networking has multiple benefits.</p>
 
 It significantly reduces the load on PDSs, making it easier to self-host — you could easily run your own server. 
 It improves discoverability of content outside of your immediate neighbors — people want to use social media to see content from outside of their network. 
 It improves the quality of experience for everyone in the network — fewer dropped messages or out-of-sync metrics. 
 
<p>Given all that, our proposed methodology here of networking through BGSs instead of server-to-server isn’t prescriptive. The protocol is actually explicitly designed to work both ways.</p>
 What’s Next For Us 
<p>We strongly believe that for federation to matter, all the pieces must be easy for you to set up. When we launch our sandbox environment publicly, we’ll provide straightforward instructions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’re working on two more pieces of federation: <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">feed generators</a> and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">labelers</a>. Currently, Bluesky’s App View generates some “opinionated” data (as in, it differentiates between pieces of data, unlike a giant firehose of data), like the feeds that we show users and the labels we use in content moderation. But we’re experimenting with splitting feed generators and labelers out as services of their own, and when that’s complete, anyone may host a feed generator and advertise it to users in the marketplace of algorithms.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, here’s one potential architecture: A feed generator can exist downstream of some BGS and App View, where the feed generator is constrained to offering “candidates” for the feed. Then, the App View presents the actual view of that data to the user.</p>
<p>Similarly, a labeler would also be downstream of a BGS. Its labels would then be ingested by either an App View or a semantically-aware PDS.</p>
 Sandbox Mode 
<p>We will be initially launching federation in sandbox mode with allow-listed servers. This means we’ll be running it in a staging environment that gets reset at least once a week, allowing the network to test it out before going live with all existing user data. Having a sandbox environment is very useful, as it will allow us and all developers in the ecosystem to stress-test and debug the system. The sandbox environment we’ve set up can be used to test out future major protocol changes as well. You can participate in the sandbox as a developer or a user — just be aware that things will break, and your data will get wiped!</p>
<p>The sandbox environment is also useful to us as we finish building out our moderation and curation tooling. Before we open federation entirely, we want to provide other servers with the same toolbox that we’re using to curate a safe social media experience, and developers can also build more moderation tools on top of atproto themselves.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing more soon about moderation, and about how to start experimenting with the sandbox environment.</p>

<p>Webnative is now ODD! Learn why we're renaming our SDK and what you can expect going forward.</p> Why The ODD Name? <p>We decided to rename Webnative to <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD</a> for a couple of reasons. The first was we recognized that there was some confusion between Webnative, the platform, and the Webnative File System protocol. We wanted to distinguish the difference between the two more easily.</p><p>The second reason was that while our SDK is excellent for building web apps, you can also use it to build native apps distributed via an app store, Internet of Things devices...basically, anything communicating over a network with a user interface! ODD SDK is a "learn once, write everywhere" development platform, and potentially even one day, "write once, deploy everywhere." We felt a name change would allow us to share that story more easily.</p><p>We picked ODD for four reasons:</p>  Memorable and Unique: ODD is concise, catchy, and sticks with you, making it easy for you to share with others.   Open Distributed Data: We love backronyms at Fission. The Open Distributed Data explanation fits perfectly as our tech stack fosters openness and collaboration, enabling you to harness the power of distributed data in your applications.   Embracing the Unconventional: Local-first edge computing challenges the status quo. While everyone else is focused on the cloud as the solution for serverless applications, we take the unexpected stand that decentralized tools and systems that inherently respect user privacy, grow with the developer's needs, and don't lock builders or users into expensive walled gardens without a credible exit strategy are the answer.  Platform Agnostic: ODD's broad vision and platform-agnostic approach ensure our stack runs everywhere, adapting to the ever-changing tech landscape.   Distinguishing the SDK from the Underlying Protocols <p>It's important to us to distinguish the ODD SDK platform from the underlying protocols. Not everyone is comfortable working (or needs to work) at the protocol level. We wanted to clarify that when bundled in the SDK, you can access those protocols with additional implementations, templates, and libraries to assist you. &nbsp; </p><p>ODD is a true local-first edge application development platform, empowering you to create innovative, resilient applications using open distributed data. Join us on this exciting journey as we embrace the ODD way and shape the future of software development together!</p>

 Deloitte Integrates KILT Identity Blockchain, Creating New Markets with Reusable Digital Credentials <p>ZÜRICH, SWITZERLAND and BERLIN, GERMANY, 4 May 2023 — BOTLabs GmbH, developer of KILT Protocol, and Deloitte Consulting AG today announced the integration of KILT blockchain technology for issuing reusable digital credentials to support KYC and KYB processes. These credentials have multiple use cases including regulatory compliance for banking and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), age verification for e-commerce, private logins and fundraising.</p><p>The purpose of a Know Your Customer/Know Your Business check is to verify the identity of an individual or the existence of a business. The process is typically inefficient for the verifying entity and repetitive for the individual customer:</p><p>● KYC/KYB certificates are often paper-based, creating extra work to&nbsp;process.</p><p>● Identity verification processes often request multiple data points when only one is needed, such as date of birth or country of residence.</p><p>● Data collection and storage of personal information across multiple platforms and databases put consumer data privacy at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>● The verification check results in a certificate that can only be used once by the verifier and the customer.</p><p>● The customer never receives the certificate.</p><p>Reusable KYB and KYC credentials, generated on KILT’s identity infrastructure, solve many of these challenges while offering control and flexibility to the customer. Credentials are stored in the customer’s wallet on their own device, remaining under their control at all times. The customer can choose with whom they share their credential and which data points of the credential they make available.</p><p>In order for the customer to manage and share their credential, Deloitte is providing a credential wallet in the form of a browser extension. Setting up a wallet is a straightforward, seamless process that doesn’t require any blockchain knowledge by the customer.</p><p>“By offering reusable digital credentials anchored on the KILT blockchain, Deloitte is transforming verification processes for individuals and entities,” said Micha Bitterli, Head of Deloitte Managed Services. “Digital credentials that are convenient, cost-effective and secure have the potential to open new digital marketplaces, from e-commerce and DeFi to gaming. Deloitte has the technology knowledge, reach and trust to issue credentials that are globally accepted.”</p><p>Credentials are digitally signed by Deloitte. Deloitte can revoke credentials using blockchain technology if conditions of the customer have changed after the credential was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>”With streamlined identity solutions “Built on KILT”, customers can use verifiable digital credentials across multiple services, while retaining control over when and where to share their personal information. And as a Polkadot parachain, KILT offers the scale and security needed by enterprise partners”, said Ingo Rübe, CEO of BOTLabs GmbH and founder of KILT Protocol.</p> About Deloitte Managed&nbsp;Services <p>Deloitte Managed Services is a leading European RegTech Provider of end-to-end managed services for KYC and AML.

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Have you ever seriously considered the negative impacts of a data breach? Are you aware of the digital safety risks that lurk around the corners of the internet? And, did you know that cyberattacks may produce life-long consequences?</p>
<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>
 Temporary Shut Down 
<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>
 SelfKey’s visions for a safer digital future 
<p>Recent events have demonstrated the devastating impact that data breaches can have on individuals and organizations. That's why SelfKey is emphasizing the importance of security and privacy when it comes to online interactions and digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By developing decentralized solutions with <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> in mind, SelfKey is using the potential of modern technology in its aim to counteract these breaches. <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-powered proof of individuality</a> is one solution that may fight against maliciously used AI, to prevent identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to raise awareness about data breaches and their potential consequences. To teach individuals and organizations about how to prevent them or how to respond in case one occurs.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In this modern, digital world, we have normalized sharing our personal data online. However, this does not mean that our personal information is necessarily safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, data breaches are becoming more and more common, and the consequences can be severe and irreversible. That's why it's crucial for individuals and organizations to take caution when sharing and storing their personal data.</p>
<p>SelfKey is focused on developing solutions which may prevent data breaches and enable individuals to operate safely in the digital world. At the heart of their approach is a commitment to the idea that privacy is a basic human right that should not be traded for convenience.&nbsp;</p>

  RainbowKit provides an easy and convenient way for users of your dapp to connect any wallet they have so they can Sign-In With Ethereum and get started using it. In this example, we will show you how to quickly create a new dapp that uses RainbowKit and Sign-In with Ethereum with SSX.

<p>RainbowKit provides an easy and convenient way for users of your dapp to connect any wallet they have so they can Sign-In With Ethereum and get started using it. In this tutorial, we will show you how to quickly create a new dapp that uses RainbowKit and Sign-In with Ethereum with SSX. &nbsp;</p><p>This guide will show you how to:</p>  Create a new dapp using SSX's dapp creation tool  Add SSX, wagmi, and RainbowKit dependencies  Run the dapp  <p>Let's get started.</p> Getting Started <p>To get started, we will use SSX’s dapp creation tool. Type the following into your terminal:</p> <code>yarn create @spruceid/ssx-dapp rainbowkit-example
</code> <p>In this tutorial, we are using a project with the following configuration:</p> <code>✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … Yes
✔ Which will be your default provider? › MetaMask
✔ Which features would you like to enable? › None
✔ Provide the SSX enabled server URL (leave blank if none) … </code> <p>After you have created the project, navigate to the <code>rainbowkit-example</code> directory you just created and add dependencies with the following commands:</p> <code>yarn add @spruceid/ssx-react @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi
</code>  Adding RainbowKit, Wagmi, and SSX  <p>Go to <code>src/index.tsx</code> and add the following to wrap your <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code> component with <code>&lt;WagmiConfig /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;RainbowKitProvider/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;SSXProvider/&gt;</code> components, making it look like the following:</p> <code>/** src/index.tsx **/
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { RainbowKitProvider, getDefaultWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { goerli, mainnet, configureChains, createClient, WagmiConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';
import { SSXProvider } from '@spruceid/ssx-react';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

const { chains, provider } = configureChains(
  [mainnet, goerli],
  [publicProvider()]
);

const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: 'SSX Rainbow Kit Example',
  chains,
});

const wagmiClient = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors,
  provider,
});

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);

root.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}&gt;
      &lt;RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}&gt;
        &lt;SSXProvider&gt;
          &lt;App /&gt;
        &lt;/SSXProvider&gt;
      &lt;/RainbowKitProvider&gt;
    &lt;/WagmiConfig&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
);
</code> <p>At <code>src/App.tsx</code> some changes are required to hook SSX and RainbowKit together. Add the following imports and update the App component as the code below:</p> <code>/* src/App.tsx */

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useConnectModal, useAccountModal, ConnectButton } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

    }
  }, [provider]);
  
  const handleClick = () =&gt; {

    if (openConnectModal) {
      openConnectModal();
    }
    /* Triggers the Sign-in hook */

This understanding may be hard-won, but it’s now an expected part of daily tasks ranging from checking email to exploring social media, selling used items, or online dating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we know to tamp down our excitement when we get a message from a Nigerian prince or receive an offer from someone who wants to pay double for our used merchandise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the rising trend of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90829233/deepfakes-get-ready-for-phishing-2-0">deepfakes</a> has disrupted these tasks once more. Learning how to identify and respond to these fraudulent images, video, or audio is now a required skill for anyone who uses the internet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deepfakes have become a valuable tool for scammers, who use them to deceive both individuals and organizations alike. If you’ve fallen for one of these scams before, don’t feel bad. This is a new and emerging technology, and many countries have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/22/business/media/deepfake-regulation-difficulty.html">struggled to respond</a> in a way that protects innocent, honest people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we’ll explore the rising trend of deepfakes and show how Dentity can step in to help protect you from falling victim to these scams. &nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 <p>What is a Deepfake?</p> 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>First, we need to learn as much as possible about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them">deepfakes</a>, so we can figure out how to defend ourselves against them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deepfakes are AI-generated media that uses a technology called deep learning to generate an image, audio, or video file of something fake. Often, they use a person’s actual image or voice and put it in situations that have never happened in real life. However, deepfake technology can also be used to create an entirely fictional persona, including realistic moving video.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Early deepfakes were primarily used for adult content purposes, but since 2019, scammers have learned how to deepfake a voice and this trick has crept slowly into more mainstream online outlets.</p>

							<p>Unfortunately, there are lots of common scams that take advantage of deepfakes and deep learning technology. Here are some of the most prevalent in 2023. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A panicked loved one on the phone</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deepfake scam that uses an AI model to simulate a person’s voice has swindled over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/rising-scams-use-ai-to-mimic-voices-of-loved-ones-in-financial-distress/">$11 million</a> from more than 5,000 victims in 2022 alone. Using just a few sentences of audio, a scammer can use deep learning technology to create a model of a person’s voice that they can then use to say whatever they want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In most situations, this scam is conducted over the phone. The victim will receive a call from what looks like their loved one’s phone number, then hear a voice that sounds exactly like their friend or family member urgently asking for their help. Victims then send money through Bitcoin and gift cards, which is nearly impossible to get back.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Voice phishing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A similar technology can also be used to solicit sensitive information that would otherwise not be disclosed. This is known as voice phishing, or <a href="https://safecomputing.umich.edu/be-aware/phone-scams">vishing</a>. In these situations, the deepfake technology is used to simulate a trusted individual’s voice, which they use to request sensitive information that can be used for identity theft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Typically, in these situations, the scammer isn’t asking for money directly but may seek to learn your credit card number, address, or Social Security number. This information can then be used to access more funds or sold on the dark web.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>How to Ensure You’re Interacting with Real People Online</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>It’s easy to get taken in when you’re getting a call that sounds exactly like someone you know. It makes it so much easier to overlook other red flags that you may have noticed otherwise.</p><p>Don’t blame yourself! To help you stay safe, check out the following tips to ensure you’re always interacting with real people online.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hang up and call back</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s now effortless to fake a caller ID number. If you get a call from someone who says they’re a friend or family member, don’t give into the panic. Hang up and call them back at their real number. If they’re really in distress, they’ll answer again, and you can continue the conversation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be skeptical of anything that seems too good to be true</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deepfake scams often rely on fake videos or audio of individuals saying or doing things they wouldn’t normally do. If something seems out of character for the person you’re talking to, be skeptical. Ask questions about something only the two of you would know to help verify their identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Educate yourself</p><p>A great way to protect yourself from these types of scams is to stay informed about the latest deepfake techniques and trends. By understanding how deepfakes are created and used, you’ll be better equipped to spot them when they appear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Use Dentity for verification</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve received a call from someone you just met online or an individual claiming they represent a trusted institution like a bank, it’s harder to verify their identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In that situation, you can use a safety tool like <a href="https://www.dentity.com/">Dentity</a>.

The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. In writing this specific blog we would like to thank everyone who generously contributed their thoughts and time in providing interviews and resources for our practical research. We welcome all comments, suggestions and feedback so please do get in touch if you have anything to contribute.</p> Blog 3 (of 4) Landscape mapping: identifying innovative actors who are driving a new and equitable economy in Europe’s built environment Mapping innovative actors across&nbsp;Europe Embracing the tensions and contradictions of emergent&nbsp;research <p>In blogs <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">one</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36">two</a> of this series we explored strategies to enable a just transition of Europe’s built environment, from a conceptual viewpoint. This has been a valuable learning experience in terms of understanding the depth and nuances of the transition challenges, but theories can only get us so far. Critically, there is a need to test our assumptions and conclusions in the messy and unpredictable reality of life, if we are to offer anything more than our opinions.</p><p>We might advocate for a low build future in Europe, or for significantly reducing our reliance on traditional construction materials. But what would this look like for an organisation urgently trying to provide shelter to climate refugees? How do we justly share our existing material and land assets and what are the fiscal incentives that could drive this? Actively involving people in the transition decisions that affect them seems essential. However, with the cost-of-living crisis and general political apathy, what kind of citizen engagement processes are appropriate? To start answering these questions we began mapping organisations who are working on the practical aspects of Europe’s decarbonisation and inclusivity challenges. Our intention was to identify and categorise factors such as the differing theories of change, tactics, operational models and collaborative opportunities.</p><p>On the face of it, this seemed like a relatively straightforward task. As a team we are in regular communication with many innovative actors working in this space and have a wide network of contacts to draw on. Interestingly however, our lived experience was less clear-cut and at times frustratingly convoluted. Initially it seemed logical to begin by building on our existing knowledge base, but we were aware of the pitfalls of researcher bias and the comfort of our own echo chamber¹. We also wanted to reach out to unknown corners of Europe to look for sparks of creative innovation, whilst retaining a healthy respect for the infinite potential of Google’s virtual rabbit holes. These kinds of challenges and contradictions will be familiar to anyone who has ever undertaken research, so developing an analytical structure seems like an obvious response. In this case however, we were not so&nbsp;sure.</p><p>Aphanipoiesis is a concept recently defined by the systems scientist Nora Bateson, to explain the way in which ‘life coalesces toward vitality in unseen ways’². It is intuitively easier to name what we can see and then strive to innovate and change it, than to hold a position of open curiosity. In her view however, most of the problems that we can identify and ‘solve’ are in fact already old news. Whilst tantalisingly hazy, Bateson’s framing resonated strongly with our sense of unease; what if by attempting to envision the future based on our understanding of the present, we would in fact dampen the power of emergent possibility? Could structuring our research using respected conceptual tools (such as the IFF’s <a href="https://medium.com/activate-the-future/the-three-horizons-of-innovation-and-culture-change-d9681b0e0b0f">3 Horizons model</a>), in fact fundamentally restrict what we might&nbsp;find?</p><p>After reflecting on these tensions, we settled on a semi-structured approach that built on our earlier analysis (presented in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">Blogs 1</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36">2</a> of this series), to create a loose guide for the types of organisations and pathways we hoped to identify. Our starting point was to look at the physical and structural constraints that we considered to be the most dominant and problematic for the built environment’s transition. From here, we were then able to start thinking about the new types of capabilities that would be vital in addressing them, thus positioning organisations as capability building pathways rather than as standalone innovators.</p> Introducing two groups of innovation actors <blockquote>During the active research phase of this work we were privileged to engage with many profoundly inspiring organisations. We cannot do justice to the depth and spread of these initiatives in a single blog, but we have created <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=share_link">this linked pdf</a> of case studies which we hope other researchers will find useful. For the purpose of this summary, we would like to propose two broad groupings of actors, who we identified as being discrete and yet of equal importance:</blockquote>  Core organisations: this group contains actors who are operating at the intersection of economic, ownership and governance issues, that specifically relate to land and buildings. We see these organisations as providing a central framework for the transition, as they vertically span multiple levels of the system and can provide cohesion and strength to more peripheral activities. Examples include community land trusts³ such as <a href="https://www.cltb.be/what-do-we-do/?lang=en">CLT Brussels</a>, cooperative housing networks such as <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA </a>in Eastern Europe and <a href="https://sostrecivic.coop/?lang=en">Solstre Civic</a> in Spain and cohousing facilitators such as <a href="https://www.housinglab.it/">Housing LAB,</a> Italy and <a href="https://www.syndikat.org/en/">Miethäusersyndikat</a> in&nbsp;Germany.  Adjacent, foundational support organisations: although less obviously linked to inclusive land and building innovations, we see these actors as building the critical foundations and pathways towards scaled transition models. They are generally more focused in a single domain of the system, thus fusing deep expertise with innovative scalability. A good example of this type of actor is <a href="https://www.mobius-reemploi.fr/">Mobius</a> in France, who are improving the reuse of materials in the construction industry by sourcing and supplying reusable construction materials. Another would be the <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/media/wmxlklns/about-gri-brochure-2022.pdf">GRI</a> (Global Reporting Initiative) who are looking at developing a construction industry specific sector standard, as part of their 3-year pipeline.  <p>The two organisational mapping diagrams shown below are available in an interactive format so that you can click directly through to their website. Please <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=share_link">click on this link</a> to access the interactive pdf.</p>Group 1: Core organisations mapped in relation to their scalability (system change Vs transition demonstration) and the extent of focus on decarbonisation.Group 2: Adjacent organisations Collaborative housing: beautiful exceptions or a realistic pathway to scalable housing inclusivity? <p>When you think about collaborative housing models, what comes to mind? Common responses might be that they are member owned, democratically run and designed to meet a common need. In the examples of Solstre Civic and MOBA these values are central, but there are some additional design principles that neatly transcend traditional extractive and speculative real estate models. The first is the idea of collective ownership where the cooperative remains the owner of the property indefinitely, thus making it impossible for members to profit from selling or renting their individual units. The second relates to the concept of the right to use which grants residents a lifetime right to a stable home in exchange for a moderate monthly fee. As the fee is determined by the shared costs of the cooperative rather than by market prices, they remain stable irrespective of real estate market fluctuations.</p><p>These types of organisations present strong alternative models to create affordable housing, with the potential to spread across different countries and to both urban and rural contexts. A bold illustration from Ukraine is Metalab’s <a href="https://www.metalab.space/co-haty-eng">Co-Haty</a> project, which is currently retrofitting and repurposing vacant properties for war refugees, with the longer term goal of developing a cooperative housing network. Despite this potential, our dialogues with actors spanning the European region exposed some interesting challenges to this theory of change. For example, how feasible or attractive is a collaborative living set up if you come from a minority or vulnerable group? How exactly could these types of models be financially scaled in less supportive political or banking contexts? What are the cultural norms that might encourage or impede the uptake of cooperative models in specific countries or&nbsp;regions?</p><blockquote>“In the past 20 years, the cooperatives have been reframed as a kind of tool that we call the economics of the poor………this is a niche where you can stay but if you want to get out into the real economy, people would say: what are you doing? This is not your space, get back to your safe space.” — Jan Zygmuntowski, CoopTechHub</blockquote><p>In a fascinating conversation with <a href="https://www.hub.coop/en/">CoopTechHub</a> from Poland, we began to appreciate how a lack of trust in the general model of cooperativism can be a barrier to their use as a viable economic model. In their view, one reason for this distrust in Poland is the historical context of the country’s communist past and the subsequent transformation to a capitalist market society in the 1990s. In the post war period, cooperatives operated under a central planning model which essentially stripped them of the principles of self-governance. Later, during the years of economic ‘shock therapy’ fiscal disincentives (for example new taxes prevented wage rises in the public and cooperative sectors), further eroded the legitimacy of the cooperative model⁴. In Poland today their experience is that cooperatives are widely viewed as facilitating the “economics of the poor”; social organisations for disadvantaged people rather than active market players. In their work, CoopTechHub are aiming to reframe this narrative and ignite a new model of digital cooperativism in the real economy, through a combination of digitization, research and advocacy. This work is demanding and opaque in terms of tangible outcomes, yet it seems an essential component to any wide scale uptake of cooperative housing models in the&nbsp;region.</p><p>Whilst there are no one size fits all solutions to collaborative housing, the cooperative model does in our view provide a robust, non-extractive alternative to traditional private property ownership patterns. This feels like a solid base to work from but even the strongest core models do not operate in a vacuum. If our goal is to amplify an inclusive and regenerative built environment, then we must also consider the auxiliary functions that make them operationally possible. Finance is an obvious example because it provides the lifeblood for any type of development. In countries with a strong history of collaborative housing, obtaining commercial funding is a viable pathway, but what are the options in less sympathetic environments? Philanthropy could offer a possible route, but the scale of transformation needed makes providing scaled capital support unrealistic. One organisation highlighting and working to address this issue is <a href="https://www.positivemoney.eu/about-us/">Positive Money Europe</a>, who are currently campaigning for banks to play their part in Europe’s green transition. Their core tactics are to repurpose existing institutions and processes (such as the European Central Bank’s low or negative interest refinancing options for commercial banks⁵), to enable wide scale building renovations across the EU. Although the proposed intervention is intended to act on renovation loans it could be scaled to other types of funding, thus creating critical pathways for collaborative models in less supportive political contexts⁶.</p><p>Even if the funding for sustainable renovations can be democratically unlocked, procuring the necessary materials throws up its own set of challenges. When we talk about retrofitting we are generally referring to insulating against the cold, but for many poorer countries in Europe the issue is in fact mitigating against heat. Fuel poverty is a well publicised social problem, but what about the inclusivity of heat regulation? If energy prices remain high whilst temperatures continue to rise, vulnerable communities will need urgent alternatives to air conditioning. One innovative response is being developed by <a href="https://justnatureproject.eu/">JustNature</a> (a collaboration between the University of Malta and the city of Gzira), which is experimenting with green roofs and walls to reduce the summer heat pressure and expedite carbon capture. Another issue affecting both new builds and refurbishments, is the intersection of the deepening global material crisis with the physical destruction of war. The scale of the reconstruction necessary is humbling and whilst there are extraordinary glimmers of hope (such as <a href="https://fundacjabrda.org/en/co-robimy/">Brda</a> in Poland who have been sending used windows to Ukraine and are now creating a registry of reusable materials), the need for an alternative and inclusive material infrastructure is profound.</p> Building a vision: is the current state of our collective imagination both dangerous and regressive? <p>Mark Carney has described the climate crisis as a ‘tragedy of the horizon’. A type of coordination failure on a global scale, that seems equally applicable to the current inadequate trajectory of Europe’s green transition. This is a true tragedy in the literary sense of the word; a disastrous event with mitigations and solutions that we seemingly cannot bring ourselves to enact. The classic example of such a self-induced trap is the tragedy of the commons, which whilst debunked by Elinor Omstrom at a local level, unfortunately still holds true in the global context (carbon emissions, rare mineral mining for batteries, etc.). This has serious implications for a just transition in Europe, because decarbonising individual cities or countries will be ineffectual if these trends continue to play out and we do not foster alternative cultural attractors. If we can’t solve any of the individual problems (e.g. continent-wide retrofitting or repurposing of vacant space) without solving all of the linked problems (e.g. inclusive financing mechanisms), then it is critical that we begin looking for actors who can play meaningful orchestration roles.</p><p>It seems likely that this collective action impasse is closely bound to a failure of the imagination: without a clear and widely appealing vision for a different future, the motivation to push for political change is severely dampened and business as usual prevails. This is a challenge being taken up by the team at<a href="https://www.civocracy.org/"> Civocracy</a> who are supporting cities to develop meaningful citizen engagement processes. Their work is interwoven with many of the barriers and opportunities highlighted above, because in both cases strong local civic support will be needed to shift and repattern entrenched behaviours. A brilliant illustration of this kind of repatterning pathway can be seen in Athens, where <a href="https://curingthelimbo.gr/the-idea-en">Curing the Limbo</a> are creating new models for cities and refugees to coexist and thrive, through the linked provision of language lessons, retraining and affordable housing.</p> The journey&nbsp;ahead <p>To take this work forward we now need to step back and think strategically about the pathways and tools that we have begun to map (both nascent and established), together with those that still need to be built. This will require asking some hard yet essential questions and boldly challenging the landscapes of existing innovation, to highlight the gap that is emerging between even the most inspiring initiatives and society’s future needs.

 Demystifying the FATF Travel Rule: Your Most Googled Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;2   VASPs face multiple challenges in complying with the FATF Travel Rule, such as ensuring data privacy, achieving interoperability, allocating resources, and navigating jurisdictional differences.  To safeguard user privacy and enhance user experience, VASPs must adopt robust security measures, utilize a P2P Travel Rule solution, and maintain transparency with their&nbsp;users.  Managing cross-jurisdictional compliance involves understanding local requirements, establishing clear communication channels, leveraging technology solutions, and seeking professional advice.  <p>After the overwhelming success of our article titled “<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on the FATF Travel Rule Answered</a>,” we are back with Part 2 to address more questions and concerns raised by our readers and the broader crypto community. Let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> Q7: What Challenges Does the FATF Travel Rule Present for&nbsp;VASPs? <p>The FATF Travel Rule presents several challenges for VASPs as they strive to balance regulatory compliance with operational efficiency and user privacy. The most pressing challenges are ensuring data privacy, achieving interoperability, allocating adequate resources, and navigating jurisdictional differences.</p><p>Ensuring Data Privacy: The FATF Travel Rule requires VASPs to exchange sensitive user information, posing a challenge in protecting user privacy. Hence, VASPs must strike a balance between meeting regulatory requirements and safeguarding sensitive user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Achieving Interoperability: VASPs need to ensure compatibility with other platforms and service providers to facilitate seamless data exchange. Adopting standardized protocols and collaborating with industry peers can help address this challenge.</p><p>IVMS101, for instance, has become a prevalent global communication standard for exchanging the essential sender and recipient data between Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Various Travel Rule messaging systems employ IVMS 101 for their data transfer&nbsp;format.</p><p>Allocating Adequate Resources: Implementing the FATF Travel Rule can be resource-intensive. VASPs must allocate sufficient time, money, and human resources to upgrade existing systems, processes, and staff training to meet compliance requirements.</p><p>Navigating Jurisdictional Differences: Different jurisdictions enforce the FATF Travel Rule with varying requirements and thresholds. VASPs must keep abreast of these differences and adapt their compliance efforts accordingly to ensure seamless cross-border transactions.</p> Q8: How can VASPs Share Information to Comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>VASPs can choose from a variety of Travel Rule solutions to share originator and beneficiary information in compliance with the FATF Travel Rule. However, for the benefit of their users, VASPs must only choose those solutions that do not store Travel Rule data on their servers, such as the Shyft Veriscope.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope does not store the data on third-party servers or its own, enabling VASPs to exchange user data in a peer-to-peer mode and comply with the FATF Travel Rule frictionlessly. To learn more about Shyft Veriscope, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Q9: What Happens if VASPs Don’t Comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>Non-compliant VASPs may face several consequences, including:</p><p>Fines and Penalties: Regulatory authorities may impose hefty fines or penalties on non-compliant VASPs, leading to financial strain on the business.</p><p>Loss of Licenses: Non-compliant VASPs risk losing their operating licenses, which may result in a shutdown or severe restrictions on their business activities.</p><p>Reputation Damage: Failure to comply with the FATF Travel Rule can result in a loss of trust among users and potential partners, negatively impacting VASP’s reputation in the industry.</p><p>Legal Action: VASPs may face legal action from authorities or other entities for non-compliance, leading to further financial and reputational damage.</p> Q10: How Can VASPs Ensure Compliance with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>To ensure compliance with the FATF Travel Rule, VASPs can take the following steps:</p><p>Develop a Robust Compliance Framework: VASPs should establish a comprehensive compliance program incorporating FATF Travel Rule requirements. This includes setting up policies and procedures for data collection, verification, storage, and exchange and adopting suitable technology solutions for secure and efficient data exchange.</p><p>Train Staff: VASPs must provide ongoing training to staff on the FATF Travel Rule requirements, ensuring they stay informed about the latest regulatory updates and best practices.

<p>We're making progress on IPVM! Learn more about our project to bring open and decentralized compute to IPFS.</p> What is IPVM? <p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a protocol and P2P file-sharing network that leverages content addressing for file identification and verification. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, is Fission's effort to bring computation to IPFS using Wasm, SPKI, and object capabilities. Furthermore, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p> How Does IPVM Work? <p>Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a>, gave an introductory presentation at IPFS Thing 2022. She explained how content-addressed data yields hashes, known as CIDs. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. This means we can compute over that data without needing a centralized server. And when combined with <a href="https://ghost.fission.codes//Wasm">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm), mobile compute even becomes possible. </p><p>And that's not all. The IPVM structure paves the way for several exciting features, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a>, allowing us to work more efficiently. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> How Does it Differ from Other Decentralized Compute Options? <p>Unlike other VMs, consensus is not required because no two machines running IPVM have to know that the other exists, which tasks they're running, or what the results were. IPVM lets the knowledge of the result of a computation propagate just to the other machines that ask for the results directly (unlike a blockchain where everyone is entirely up to date on all of the data). </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a></p>  Extends IPFS with computation  Runs anywhere, including the edge, locally, and in the browser  No consensus required  Its primary use case is running Wasm and enabling interoperable services  Asynchronous  <p><a href="https://fvm.filecoin.io/">FVM - Filecoin Virtual Machine</a></p>  Runs computations for Filecoin  It’s blockchain-based and runs to consensus  Its primary use case is smart contracts and bringing user programmability to Filecoin  Synchronous  <p><a href="https://fluence.dev/docs/learn/overview">Fluence</a></p>  Serverless platform and computing marketplace  It's blockchain-based  Runs in-browser  Off-chain compute with on-chain validation  It's not designed for large-scale data persistence  Its primary use is for data caching, indexing, processing, and querying  <p><a href="https://docs.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a></p>  Compute over Data using Docker containers and Wasm images as tasks  It's main use case is running compute over large datasets by sending most jobs to providers across the network  Can't run in-browser   What is IPVM's Current Status? <p>Since IPFS Thing 2022, Fission has been hard at work making IPVM a reality. In October of last year, we <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">updated the spec's README</a>. </p><p>In Q1, we focused on research and design and began to develop an MVP. Named <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar</a>, this open-source implementation of IPVM (and an IPVM runtime) is geared toward Wasm execution in Rust and the browser. In February, we also held a three-day in-person IPVM workshop for our working group collaborators. </p><p>Entering Q2, we're working on discovery, first-class effects, and finalizing spec-level interop with several providers. We're also spreading awareness about IPVM at conferences like IPFS Thing, Causal Islands, and CoD Summit^3.</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Speaking of conferences, Brooklyn presented IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World as part of the Decentralized Compute and AI track at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing 2023</a> and Seamless Services for an Open World at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/brooklyn-zelenka">Causal Islands</a> (Fission's first-ever conference!). </p><p>Seamless Services for an Open World (Recording coming soon!)</p><p>The advent of TCP/IP and the web produced an explosion of innovation by radically lowering the barrier to entry to connect over the network. Thanks to new technical and social innovations, we now have the building blocks for the next generation of open services: location-free verifiable data and computation.</p><p>‍Verifiable computation opens the door to content-addressed function invocations, results, and workflows. This radically lowers the complexity of historical architectures (e.g. the LAMP stack), networked, and distributed systems. Not only is this easier to reason about, but it also (paradoxically) enables superlinear scaling: the more it gets used, the more efficient it becomes!</p><p>This talk presents UCAN Invocations and the Interplanetary VM (IPVM). Code in this model can run anywhere (even offline), respects data privacy, and services interoperate seamlessly out of the box without pre-negotiation. Since computation doesn't happen in a vacuum, we will also describe how the workflow planner interacts with existing services and how to lift them into this seamless paradigm.</p><p>Zeeshan Lakhani also presented on Homestar at IPFS Thing. </p><p>Brooklyn and Zeeshan will present at <a href="https://www.codsummit.io/">CoD Summit^3</a> as well, with more details to come. </p> <p>If you are attending these conferences, we look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on IPVM! Can't make it? Don't worry - the talks will be recorded and shared here on the blog. You can also participate in IPVMs development by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM working group</a>. We host monthly <a href="https://lu.ma/ipvm">community calls</a>!</p>

<p>Learn how Fission is making it possible to query decentralized data with RhizomeDB.</p> What is RhizomeDB? <p>RhizomeDB is a protocol that executes a local-first edge database for querying decentralized data. It extends our <a href="https://docs.odd.dev/">ODD SDK</a> with support for concurrent access to structured and unstructured data distributed in content-addressable networks and enables the creation of decentralized, collaborative applications 🤯. </p> How Does RhizomeDB Work? <p>RhizomeDB is built from the ground up for interoperability between applications, with a focus on real-time collaboration. One way of looking at Rhizome is a framework for CRDTs powered by a database engine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a>, or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types, offer eventual consistency without coordination between replicas, algorithmically resolve any inconsistencies, and guarantee that any replicas with different states will eventually converge into the same state. </p><p>RhizomeDB is also a tuple store. There are many <a href="https://www.upgrad.com/blog/list-vs-tuple/">benefits to using tuples</a>, one of which is immutability. Every entry in the system must be entered in a consistent format, thereby vastly decreasing the number of mistakes that can be made that would interfere with the schema-building and querying process. It also makes it very easy to change how you view the data at read-time and even view your data as tables, graphs, columns, time series, etc. </p><p>In addition to the typical entity-attribute-value tuple of many stores, Rhizome includes a "causal" link that points to the data that the entry depends on. Most data don't directly depend on each other, but some, like the output of an analysis that uses other data, do. This causal link has a couple of advantages, including making the structure BFT, or Byzantine Fault Tolerant. It's a way of "showing your work" so to speak, so that if some nodes go down or malicious actors attempt to input false information, the system won't collapse. </p><p>The causal link also allows RhizomeDB to express Operations-based CRDTs, or CmRDTs, which can change operations that don't affect the end result. An added benefit is it can reduce the amount of necessary compute power.</p> What Makes RhizomeDB Special? <p>As far as we're aware, RhizomeDB is the first system that will combine encryption, CRDTs, and local-first database functionality (we're still building out the encryption part). Another way to look at is that RhizomeDB is a CRDT framework built on top of well-understood database tech. This means we can apply lots of optimizations over time, such as incremental view maintenance, precomputing strategies, distributed indexing, and more.</p><p>For developers, RhizomeDB means they no longer need to worry about consistency, synchronization, and data privacy when building apps with decentralized data - a huge win! &nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, developers can interpret data according to their own needs. For example, say you wanted to build your own decentralized social network. RhizomeDB, in a sense, enables a BYOA (Bring Your Own Algorithm) approach to this type of project because it is customizable and prioritizes local-first data. If you wanted your social network to be a community solely focused on 1970s disaster films, you could input the relevant data and use tailored variables to query it. Then as mentioned previously, the CRDTs will use their built-in algorithm to do the rest of the heavy lifting and guarantee consistency. You can also remix and evolve your data over time.</p> RhizomeDB To-Do List Demo <p>Here is a proof-of-concept demo that Applied Researcher Quinn Wilton created.</p><p>Other potential use cases are a CRM, a shared media library...there are so many possibilities! </p> What is RhizomeDB's Current Status? <p>RhizomeDB is still in its early days and is a work in progress. However, it can already do impressive things like query and compute over multiple sources and users in a content-addressed store. It doesn't (directly) help you find the data you're looking for, but you could build an indexer out of RhizomeDB and <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a> to accomplish that.</p> Open-Sourcing RhizomeDB  <p>At Fission, we believe working in public is the quickest way to test, iterate, and build a successful protocol. Therefore, today we are officially open-sourcing RhizomeDB under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache license</a>! If you'd like to explore the code, head to the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">GitHub repo</a> and wade in! Please be advised that there is currently no documentation, the codebase is unfinished, and it is not yet production-ready. All of this will come as soon as it's ready, but if you're intrepid and want to dive right in, have at it!</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Quinn presented RhizomeDB at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing</a> in the Interplanetary Databases track:</p><p>She also gave a talk at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a>, which we will have for you shortly.</p> What's Next for RhizomeDB <p>Building and documentation will be our focus going into the coming months. We also have plans to make RhizomeDB real-time and encrypted!</p><p>You can follow our progress by reading <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/weekly-notes-quinn/3873/4">Quinn's weekly notes</a> and visiting the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">repo</a>.</p>

<p>Fission is roadmapping in public with Starmap, a tool for cross-team planning.</p> What is Starmap? <p><a href="https://starmap.site/">Starmap</a> is an adaptive and flexible tool developed by <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> that renders GitHub issues as a roadmap. It removes the need to make duplicate tasks in a Gantt chart or Excel spreadsheet to track progress.</p><p>Starmap was created with the needs of the Protocol Labs Network in mind. The PLN contains hundreds of companies of varying sizes and project types, and roadmaps can take many forms. Instead of creating a one-size-fits-all tool, the developers intentionally made it adaptable using containers.</p><p>You can create any number of containers you want to fit your specific needs. If you want to work in Epics and user stories, you can. If you’re only using Low-level GitHub issues? No problem. Milestones and low-level issues? Got you covered. All you need to do is create a GitHub issue to use as a container, name it the way you want, and add child issues and an ETA. You’re all set! </p> How to Build a Starmap <p>As shown in the following screenshots, the project architecture at Fission is the following from top to bottom:</p>  Project issue  Milestones  Low-level issues, which are the actual tasks that need to be completed  <p>If you don’t have a roadmap yet, the easiest way to start is by reviewing your spec. </p><p>Identify the features or improvements you'll need to make to ship your MVP or upgrade, and set clear milestones. Then identify the tasks that need to be checked off to hit those milestones.</p><p>During this process, it's important to consider your internal and external dependencies. Do you need to wait for a specific tech update to be released to be able to progress on your milestone? Which of your task needs to be done before the other?</p><p>Estimate your issues, prioritize them, and add the GitHub issue's URL in the body of their respective milestone issue. Add each milestone issue URL in the body of the project issue.</p><p>Finally, paste the project issue (or root node) URL into Starmap, which will render for you immediately.</p> Collaboration is Key <p>At Fission, the process of roadmapping is collaborative and user-driven. Fission's Project Manager, Bastien Dehaynin, knows he cannot build a Starmap alone - he needs to work with the project developers who completely understand the tech. </p><p>Together Bastien and the developers create user stories. &nbsp;They describe the features from the user's perspective and clearly share their needs and expectations, as well as why those features are important to them in the first place. &nbsp;</p><p>Then they break the user stories themselves down into small chunks of work that a single developer can feasibly complete (the low-level GitHub issues). The tasks are then prioritized and organized into milestones. Together they estimate how long each milestone will take to complete and distribute them over a timeline. Then Bastien translates all of this into GitHub and a Starmap.</p> To Infinity and Beyond <p>Fission currently has Starmaps for <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/2?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">WNFS</a>, <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/15?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">Go CAR Mirror</a>, and <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/8?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">IPVM</a>. We are in the process of adding the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/fission-server">Fission Server</a> Rust rewrite project and <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">RhizomeDB</a> as well.</p><p>Fission is also spearheading an effort to increase Starmap adoption across the PLN. Starmap allows all teams involved in a project to add their issues to the same roadmap. Therefore, the more teams build out Starmaps, the greater our awareness of other projects' needs and how we can work together.</p><p>For example, if one team is working on a decentralized app and needs an authorization solution, they might look at the roadmaps of other projects and see that they've used UCANs. Or if one project is working on one half of a problem and another is working on the other, they can team up and ship protocols and an MVP. </p><p>It's also easier to recognize potential bumps in the road and mitigate them. For example, if one of your roadmapped dependencies depends on another tool that is not being actively maintained, that might be something to watch.</p><p>If we all work together, we have the ability to work together to surface hidden needs and opportunities so we can all reach our goals faster. </p> <p>Here's a Starmap demo led by Bastien. </p><p>And here is the IPFS Thing 2023 Starmap demo.</p><p>Want to learn how you can get started with Starmap? Visit the <a href="https://starmap.site/">documentation site</a> or reach out to Bastien on <a href="http://fission.codes/discord">Fission's Discord</a>. He's happy to work with you! </p>

<p>I love the game of chess and was shocked when IBM’s Deep Blue chess-playing machine defeated the world chess champion in 1997. That ground-shaking event divided the world with excitement and trepidation about a future with thinking machines. In this first of two posts, I investigate the anatomy of artificial intelligence and its impact on insurance.</p>



 The fascination of artificial intelligence 



<p>History has shown that the human preoccupation with creating a machine that replicates human thinking had in fact been simmering for centuries. In the late 18th century, The Turk, a chess-playing machine captured the attention of the world. It turned out to be a fraud, with a human player behind the machine. In 1847, George Boole first described a formal language for logic reasoning, and in 1936, Alan Turing described the Turing machine.</p>



<p>Along with the explosion of information technology in the 1950’s, the term ‘<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>’ (AI) was coined by John McCarthy in 1956. After the success of Deep Blue, IBM again made the headlines with IBM Watson, an AI system capable of answering questions posed in natural language, when it won the quiz show Jeopardy against human champions. Continued advancement in AI development has resulted today in a definition of AI that has several categories and characteristics.</p>



<p>The early versions of AI were capable of predictive modelling (e.g., recommending similar Netflix shows based on your previous choices) or robotics (e.g., developing a distance map of objects around a vehicle to enable semi-autonomous driving). Soon after, AI’s capabilities extended to speech and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a>, such as with IBM Watson, and for image recognition, which is now ubiquitously used for unlocking phones and other biometric security. The four categories of predictive modelling, robotics, speech and image recognition are collectively known as algorithm-based AI or Discriminative AI. It represents AI that can sift through data and divide them into classes (of attributes) by learning the boundaries. It is used to return a prediction or result based on conditional probability.</p>



 The emergence of generative AI 



<p>More recently, a new category of AI has emerged to stir the imagination (and fear) of humankind. Generative AI is artificial intelligence that can create new content. It has taken the world by storm. ChatGPT acquired 100M users within two months of launch. Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, and Salesforce release rival products shortly after. Academia is in an uproar over originality of authorship, and governments have even started to outlaw its general use.</p>



<p>Whilst Discriminative AI sought to classify data by its attributes to recognize an object, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI</a> seeks to map the distribution of attributes on examples and manipulate those attributes to create new examples. This ability to manipulate attributes and create new examples has added a new dimension to AI—creativity.</p>



 Artificial intelligence applied to insurance 



<p>The insurance industry has always made extensive use of data and algorithms, such as in the calculation of insurance premiums. The insurance business model itself is predicated on the use of mathematical and statistical methods to process personal and non-personal data to underwrite risks and price insurance policies, to quantify losses, to pay customers’ claims, and to identify and prevent insurance fraud. The impact of AI, both Discriminative and Generative, has immediate and long-term effects on the business of insurance.</p>



<p>The deployment of AI can help insurers in multiple aspects, from underwriting to claims, customer service and fraud prevention. Below are some typical use cases that demonstrate the primary impact on the automation of internal processes and on improved customer service.</p>



 Customer service and conversational AI 



<p>This is an area where insurers are most advanced in their early adoption of AI. Conversational AI, based on natural language processing, can interpret spoken and written human language and respond accordingly. It offers customers and the insurer’s system to interact in a human-like manner. Chatbots and voice assistants are already offering round-the-clock service whilst maintaining quality of service. We will continue to see more advanced and specialised conversational AI developed to handle more complex dialogue, particularly in claims handling. Generative AI will make the conversations more expedient and relevant.</p>



 Claims automation 



<p>AI tools in the claims handling process can expedite the handling of claims and lead to faster settlement. AI’s Image recognition can automatically read, interpret, and process documents and images (e.g., extracting information from medical records, recognizing vehicle types or evaluating damage). By collecting large amounts of historical data, Discriminative AI can be used to make plausibility assessments and ensure quality and uniformity in the adjusting process. Complimentarily, Generative AI will be able to help the adjustor summarise the data and generate a preliminary report.</p>



 Fraud detection 



<p>AI can be used to analyse large amounts of data from multiple sources to spot unusual patterns as an indication of fraud. Pattern recognition on vehicle damage data can be used to detect cases of fraud. It can also detect manipulated images that would raise suspicion.</p>



 Pricing and underwriting 



<p>AI offers new possibilities in the pricing and product design of insurers. With the combination of data, new risk characteristics can be developed to provide more accurate insurance cover. With the willingness and consent to share one’s private data, products can be tailored more precisely for each customer.</p>



<p>For example, the increasing availability of medical data, in combination with medical progress now makes it possible to offer term life insurance for people with serious pre-existing conditions. Leveraging Generative AI’s ability, a unique and personal life insurance policy can be underwritten with contributions from personal medical data. Beyond medical data, other public data such as meteorological data, using AI’s ability to process large data is having an effect on property insurance.</p>



 The road ahead 



<p>The use of AI in the insurance industry today is still nascent. AI is still an emerging technology and the road to implementation will have challenges. However, the use of AI in society is becoming prevalent. Insurers must adopt AI to stay relevant to their customers and draw down on the cost-saving benefits of adopting AI in the near term. Ignoring AI is costly. Take a step towards adopting AI. List down your ideas for how AI can improve the way insurance is managed. In the next post, I will explore the limitations and challenges we face with AI, and how we can mitigate them as we implement and scale our use of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Learn how we set out to build a plugin for musicians and ended up creating a progressive file system that grows with the user's needs.</p> Ditto <p>Our Fissioneers love pushing the boundaries of the <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD SDK</a> to unlock new features and use cases. Recently, engineers Brian and Andy did just that with Ditto. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/ditto">Ditto</a> is a VST delay plugin. Users can create their own delay presets in the app and use the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion</a> web app to share and collect Ditto presets.</p> Elementary <p>Ditto uses <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/">Elementary</a>, a JavaScript framework and high-performance audio engine that makes developing audio plugins using web technologies easier. </p><p>Ditto uses the <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/docs/packages/plugin-renderer"><code>@elemaudio/plugin-renderer</code></a>, which runs a web app in WebView inside of a VST binary. The WebView gives us a browser environment where we can run Webnative. This makes development much more accessible because you don't need to know C++ - only JavaScript.</p><p>Here is the Ditto plugin loaded into Bitwig Studio:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f3036f4dd375f4551bc0fad11ec0a7dc8975c66.jpeg"></a> Preset Manager <p>Audio plugins typically have a system for saving presets, which captures plugin state and metadata about the preset. We implemented presets in Ditto that store plugin state, notes, tags, and favorite status:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/750a2700e7adda90112770ccfc621218141bf319.jpeg"></a><p>The presets interface is organized by categories, including All, Favorites, and categories automatically generated from preset tags.</p> Progressive File System Enhancement <p>Plugin users expect plugins to store presets without signing into an account. To match those expectations, our first experiment with Ditto was to implement a local-only file system that does not require sign-in and an optional synced file system that requires an account. When a user decides to create an account, their presets are copied from the local-only file system to a file system associated with a username and persisted to Fission IPFS nodes.</p><p>Each file system is associated with an app namespace to keep them separate in browser storage. We determine which file system to use by checking whether the user has created an account.</p><p>In application programming, we're often trained to think about how we will serve users now and how we want to serve them down the line. We build the infrastructure to allow us to introduce new planned features without creating more work for us later on. </p><p>This is sensible, but what if, as a developer, you want to ship your minimum viable product now, gather feedback, and then add syncing and sharing later? &nbsp;</p><p>Users are also tired of signing up for endless platforms, not knowing if it will be the right tool for them. Why not give them the option to get hands-on with the tool first, and if/when they decide to access more features, you ask them to make an account (a password-less one, of course!)?</p><p>Building using a progressive file system not only reduces the scope of an MVP, it also removes a common barrier to adoption!</p> Connecting to Ditto Companion <p>When the user is ready to go beyond the local-only file system, they can create an account and connect to the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion app</a>.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/adcd97c9b813df99d7764181ee528fd76c187b82.png"></a><p>First, they create a username and select "connect." Then they are given a QR code and a connection link. </p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/e/eade68717a724783a861afe9a16929749f5d6ca1.png"></a><p>The QR Code and connection link open Ditto Companion and use the AWAKE protocol to begin device-linking.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a3593ae2830f971552ba340092d99d3ee60f0908.jpeg"></a><p>The user enters the code shown in Ditto Companion into Ditto:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4e1c83397d3afb9650b15807a2363befcbef6e71.png"></a><p>After entering the code, Ditto shows the user a message confirming they have connected with Ditto Companion:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/5/55ea0bcdd6e46b7c6917cdddf0b6e922d893cb6a.png"></a><p>The user can connect again later if they would like to connect to another browser or device.</p> Namespaces <p>The Ditto plugin and Ditto Companion use distinct app namespaces. However, by using UCAN authorization and transmitting the user's WNFS encryption key, the Ditto Companion app shares the synced file system with the Ditto plugin.</p><p>Having multiple namespaces also makes it possible for users to work on several apps locally. It used to be that you could only work on one app at a time on <code>localhost:8080</code> for example, but namespacing puts them each in their own box, so to speak, and you can switch from one app to another without thinking about it.</p> Sharing and Collecting Presets <p>As mentioned earlier, Ditto Companion is a web app for sharing and collecting presets.</p><p>We started Ditto Companion from the <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">ODD App Template</a>. Our connect flow is simplified compared to the complete feature set provided in the template - we only link from the plugin to the companion app. This simple model meant we could remove quite a bit from the template for our use case.</p><p>Our second experiment was to implement a lightweight share and collect system in the companion app. Shared presets are stored in the public WNFS tree. Presets that are not shared are in the private tree. Users share presets in the companion app:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3a03525569c3c68a608cf2fb3671291cbac2ce7.png"></a><p>They can also collect shared presets from other users. After selecting the plus button, they enter the username they want to collect from:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7886e573933b43872414af9ef280fbc27fa30653.jpeg"></a><p>Ditto Companion then checks whether a file system exists for the user. If a file system exists, we get a link for the public tree and check for a presets directory.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1488b82f4087b4e340dab4bdca22161489701740.jpeg"></a><p>If presets are found, we add them to the Collect tab:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1367134c2e5dcb7e7ab91dcedc93ba475254f38f.png"></a><p>Users collect presets by checking the Collect checkbox for the preset. Collected presets are copied into the user’s file system, and the user can load them in the plugin after a refresh.</p><p>This sharing mechanism is very exciting because it searches for and scans public IPFS data and saves it to the user's file system, adding a level of interactivity to non-blockchain-based decentralized web apps. And because users can move their data to any Webnative-enabled app, there are many opportunities for collaboration and remixing of data.</p> <p>Here is a full walkthrough of Ditto and Ditto Companion:</p><p>What do you think of Ditto?

   Some tech companies and lawmakers are getting it wrong when it comes to AI. Instead of pausing progress, they should be prioritizing AI ethics. Here's how.

<p>The introduction of <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> systems into the public domain exposed people all over the world to new technological possibilities, implications, and even consequences many had yet to consider. Thanks to systems like ChatGPT, just about anyone can now use advanced AI models that are not only capable of detecting patterns, honing data, and making recommendations as earlier versions of AI would, but also moving beyond that to create new content, develop original chat responses, and more.</p>



 A turning point for AI 



<p>When ethically designed and responsibly brought to market, generative AI capabilities support unprecedented opportunities to benefit business and society. They can help create better customer service and improve healthcare systems and legal services. They also can support and augment human creativity, expedite scientific discoveries, and mobilize more effective ways to address climate challenges.</p>



<p>We are at a critical inflection point in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI’s development, deployment, and use</a>, and its potential to accelerate human progress. However, this huge potential comes with risks, such as the generation of fake content and harmful text, possible privacy leaks, amplification of bias, and a profound lack of transparency into how these systems operate. It is critical, therefore, that we question what AI could mean for the future of the workforce, democracy, creativity, and the overall well-being of humans and our planet.</p>



 The need for new AI ethics standards 



<p>Some tech leaders recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/29/elon-musk-joins-call-for-pause-in-creation-of-giant-ai-digital-minds">called for a six-month pause</a> in the training of more powerful AI systems to allow for the creation of new ethics standards. While the intentions and motivations of the letter were undoubtedly good, it misses a fundamental point: these systems are within our control today, as are the solutions. </p>



<p>Responsible training, together with an ethics by design approach over the whole AI pipeline, supported by a multi-stakeholder collaboration around AI, can make these systems better, not worse. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-policymakers-need-to-know-about-foundation-models/">AI is an ever-evolving technology</a>. Therefore, for both the systems in use today and the systems coming online tomorrow, training must be part of a responsible approach to building AI. We don’t need a pause to prioritize responsible AI.</p>



<p>It’s time to get serious about the AI ethics standards and guardrails all of us must continue adopting and refining. IBM, for its part, established <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/ethics">one of the industry’s first AI Ethics Boards</a> years ago, along with a company-wide AI ethics framework. We constantly strive to strengthen and improve this framework by taking stock of the current and future technological landscape –from our position in industry as well as through a multi-stakeholder approach that prioritizes collaboration with others.</p>



<p>Our Board provides a responsible and centralized governance structure that sets clear policies and drives accountability throughout the AI lifecycle, but is still nimble and flexible to support IBM’s business needs. This is critical and something we have been doing for both traditional and more advanced AI systems. Because, again, we cannot just focus on the risks of future AI systems and ignore the current ones. Value alignment and AI ethics activities are needed now, and they need to continuously evolve as AI evolves.</p>



<p>Alongside collaboration and oversight, the technical approach to building these systems should also be shaped from the outset by ethical considerations. For example, concerns around AI often stem from a lack of understanding of what happens inside the “black box.” That is why IBM developed a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data/ai-governance">governance platform</a> that monitors models for fairness and bias, captures the origins of data used, and can ultimately provide a more transparent, explainable and reliable AI management process. Additionally, IBM’s AI for Enterprises strategy centers on an approach that embeds trust throughout the entire AI lifecycle process. This begins with the creation of the models themselves and extends to the data we train the systems on, and ultimately the application of these models in specific business application domains, rather than open domains.</p>



 All this said – what needs to happen? 



<p>First, we urge others across the private sector to put <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/3-key-reasons-why-your-organization-needs-responsible-ai/">ethics and responsibility at the forefront</a> of their AI agendas. A blanket pause on AI’s training, together with existing trends that seem to be de-prioritizing investment in industry AI ethics efforts, will only lead to additional harm and setbacks.</p>



<p>Second, governments should avoid <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpts-popularity-explodes-us-lawmakers-take-an-interest-2023-02-13/">broadly regulating</a> AI at the technology level. Otherwise, we’ll end up with a whack-a-mole approach that hampers beneficial innovation and is not future-proof. We urge lawmakers worldwide to instead adopt <a href="https://www.ibm.com/policy/ai-precision-regulation/">smart, precision regulation</a> that applies the strongest regulation control to AI use cases with the highest risk of societal harm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, there still is not enough transparency around how companies are protecting the privacy of data that interacts with their AI systems. That’s why we need a consistent, national privacy law in the U.S. An individual’s privacy protections shouldn’t change just because they cross a state line.</p>



<p>The recent focus on AI in our society is a reminder of the old line that with any great power comes great responsibility. Instead of a blanket pause on the development of AI systems, let’s continue to break down barriers to collaboration and work together on advancing responsible AI—from an idea born in a meeting room all the way to its training, development, and deployment in the real world. The stakes are simply too high, and our society deserves nothing less.</p>

<p>Fission has grown from a scrappy startup to a fully-fledged protocol research and development company, and we have a new and improved website and refreshed brand to match. </p> Website <p><a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a> has evolved so much since 2019, and we needed an updated website to reflect our current protocol projects and grow with us as we develop our core product, <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD SDK</a> (formerly known as Webnative SDK).</p><p>We started with our mission: </p><blockquote>"Fission is building identity, data, and compute solutions for the future of the Internet."</blockquote><p>We are a company with one foot in the present and one in the future, and we realized our website should reflect that. As a result, we created options for website visitors to sort by tech that is ready now and tech that will be ready later.</p><p>This will be especially handy as Fission takes on more challenges and continues to develop protocol solutions.</p><p>Next, we took a look at our company's values: </p><blockquote>We prioritize agency.</blockquote><blockquote>We're ecosystem-obsessed.</blockquote><blockquote>We learn in public and share our knowledge freely with others.</blockquote><blockquote>We experiment relentlessly and discover for ourselves which path will lead us to success.</blockquote><p>Starting with agency - we do a lot, and we want you to be able to "choose your own adventure" and find your way quickly to the projects most aligned with your interests. This meant using simple interactions, like radio buttons for filtering by topic, to help direct people to the right places throughout the site.</p><p>Next came our ecosystem obsession. Fission builds open-source protocols, then supports them as they leave the nest. As a result, we lead several working groups and consistently work with external teams adopting these tools into their tech stacks. We are also active in the <a href="https://protocol.ai/join/">PLN</a> and in standards formation (For example, <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">CASA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/secure-design/discussions">Secure/Design</a>). </p><p>The <a href="https://fission.codes/ecosystem/">ecosystem section</a> of our site organizes all of these efforts into four categories according to how involved we are - Our Core Projects, Fission-Led Efforts, Places We Contribute, and Collaborators &amp; Adopters. </p><p>We believe it's critical to learn and work in public. We hope that presenting our relationship to the ecosystem we're engaged in helps people find the best ways to get involved - without overwhelming them.</p><p>We share our knowledge via the Fission blog with twice-weekly blog posts. </p><p>We also wanted the site's back end to be approachable enough that anyone on the Fission team could contribute to it, regardless of their level of technical aptitude. That's why our design team coded up the rebrand themselves! This empowers all of us to experiment and iterate on the site now and in the future.</p><p>Our last big change is a more humane touch - we added our wonderful Fissioneers to the website! We are lucky to have so many talented engineers, designers, creators, and operators on our team - all with their unique skill sets and areas of expertise. We thought it would be nice for our community to get to know the friendly people behind the tech, so we included a <a href="https://fission.codes/team/">team info page</a>.</p> Brand <p>Finally, you may have noticed that we updated the Fission logo and fonts a few months ago. Our designers, Ryan and Bruno, did a stellar job! </p><p>We also want to thank Kasper Nordkvist, the designer of Uncut Sans and steward of the collection of open-source fonts at <a href="https://uncut.wtf/">Uncut.wtf</a>. </p><p>We did this brand refresh in preparation for the new website, but we also took this step knowing we'd be rolling out more brands as we expanded the Fissionverse. <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a>, <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD.DEV</a>, and (coming soon!) Private Set have all received their brand treatments, but the Fission brand must be the central node connecting all the branches. We achieve this synchronicity through consistent color variations, style, and brand voice. </p><p>We hope you are as excited about the <a href="https://fission.codes/">website update</a> and brand refresh as we are. Share your feedback on social media or the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/daDMAjE">Fission Discord</a>!</p>

				  If you are attending the upcoming European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) in Berlin, don’t miss your chance to hear Indicio presenters and panelists discuss governance, the metaverse, and more.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The annual European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) is taking place in Berlin from May 9 to 12. Billed as “the place where the digital identity and cyber community comes together to set the course for the future of digitization,” the focus this year is on Identity governance in our modern world, including how identity will function in a more decentralized or Web3 internet. Several Indicio team members have been selected to participate both as speakers and as panelists.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5372/1">Decentralized Identity in the real world with Decentralized Ecosystem Governance</a></p>
<p>Indicio VP of Communications and Governance, Trevor Butterworth, will explain how Decentralized Ecosystem Governance (DEGov), which was pioneered by Indicio and which is now being developed as a specification at the Decentralized Identity Foundation” manages trust and interaction in a decentralized identity ecosystem. Drawing on Indicio’s experience implementing governance solutions with enterprises and governments, Trevor will discuss the importance of portable trust, automation, updating, and offline functionality, and the importance of decentralizing governance to accountability. .&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5372/2">Digital Trust in the Metaverse &amp; Decentralized Internet of Everything</a></p>
<p>Indicio CEO Heather Dahl and Deputy CTO Sam Curren will be joining a panel to discuss the future of digital trust. Central to the discussion will be the root of many headaches and malicious behaviors online — verification. As a long-time community contributor at Hyperledger and working group leader at Decentralized Identity Foundation, Sam will dive into how digital trust and verification are critically important to the future of online interaction, including decentralized healthcare, finance, the metaverse, and to the interaction of digital objects and non-digital objects in the spatial web—aka, the “Internet of Everything.” One key takeaway from this session will be how you can use a Trusted Data Ecosystems to connect people, machines, companies or any two entities to multiple businesses and jurisdictions without sharing private information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be Indicio’s third year attending EIC and there are always great conversations, connections, and learning opportunities to be had. A highlight from last year was the SITA-Indicio-Aruba team being <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">recognized for the creation of the digital travel credential</a>. If you are attending the conference and would be interested in meeting up with our team please fill out our <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us form</a> and we will see if we can make that happen.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at the conference!</p>

<p>Editor: Michael Shea prepares the Digital Identity from Vienna guest panelists with a brief. This was used for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/digital-identity-from-vienna/events/292993136/">the May 2, 2023 discussion</a> <a href="https://wider.team/2023/04/26/vienna36/">announced here last week</a>. <a href="https://widerteam.notion.site/Vienna-Digital-Identity-36-Thinking-Locally-and-Globally-for-Digital-Wallets-and-Identification-b82c3264cf8044da9aaa08ac14d6558c">More information on the event archive</a>.  </p>







<p>The ability to shift populations and gain (or force) adoption of new public policy positions is linked to the ability of the public sector form of governance.  Over the past 20+ years the potential of truly digital economies and societies have been expounded endlessly but the results have been mixed with a consistent short fall in the meeting of expectations.  High assurant digital identity appears to provide the final missing element to allow full digitalization of society to take place.  </p>



<p>The public sector forms outlined here are generalizations for the purpose of framing a discussion around the design, implementation and adoption of digital wallets and the digital identifiers and credentials stored there-in, and to facilitate a discussion on how interactions would/could work when populations of the different forms interact in a global ecosystem.</p>



<p>In each of the forms, a private sector also operates and attempts to influence (to a greater or lesser degree) the setting public policy.  Motivators of the private sector may be greatly different than that of public policy and as such creates a tension or a ‘force’ that may result in failure to realize expected gains from the policies.  The private sector has also a desire to bring digital identity into practice, but its motivators are highly driven by rent extraction, not public policy or (necessarily) public good.  Additionally, there are very powerful market forces for monopolization and control where those that ‘control’ the source of digital identification can gain very significant rents from society.</p>



 Central authority, strong decentralized authority with wary support of population 



 
 A central authority that constitutionally or legally has constraints on its authority.   



 The central authority typically must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (state or provincial governments) who retain rights that are not granted to the central authority.   



 The populations of this public sector form, can be said to be unruly at times and in recent history inclined to be suspicious of Public Sector forms.   



 English speaking countries are good representative examples of this Form, though even within these there is a spectrum. 
 



 Centralized authority, strong decentralized authority with support of population 



 
 A central authority that is constitutionally or legally has constraints on its authority.   



 The central authority must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (States) who retain rights that may conflict with the Central authority.   



 The populations of this public sector form, while they may have a level of suspicion, concepts of identity cards and papers have long been used.   



 The European Commission and the Member States of the European Union are a good representative example of this Form. 
 



 Strong centralized authority with support of population 



 
 A strong central authority that has the ‘final’ say on direction and policy.   



 This authority may delegate some responsibility to an elected body, but retains the right to overrule policy positions that may be put forward by this body.   



 The population in this form is typically supportive of the form, and moves in accordance with the direction central authority.   



 Examples of this form would be countries that retain a hereditary monarchy in regions such as, the Middle East, Asia and parts of Africa. 
 



 Authoritarian 



 
 A central authority who’s right and power is absolute.   



 This authority sets direction and policy based on its reasoning alone and is not subject to the demands of sharing power with subsidiary authorities.   



 Support (or lack of support) of the population is not considered.  The authority has the coercive power and the willingness to use it to ensure its direction and policies are adhered to. 
 



<p>The desire to realize the benefits of digitalization through the adoption of forms of digital identity has been tried before today, and has seen at best marginal success and at worst total failure resulting in significant outlays of public expenditures (e.g., eIDAS v1, Gov.uk) and political embarrassment. </p>



<p>In this current cycle to realize the digital potential different ‘experiments’ are (or have been) tried.  The Government of British Columbia in Canada started its journey with its Verifiable Organization Network, working with publicly available corporate documentation.  In the European Union, under the eIDAS v2 regulation and European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) efforts are underway with use cases in Education and Travel and Tourism.  The Government of Bhutan will shortly be launching its digital wallet and identity effort having issued its first digital identifier credentials to the Crown Price of Bhutan in March.  Finally, in the US, the Department of Homeland Security is in the fourth year of a five-year process on developing a digital Green Card and Right to Work documentation.  </p>



<p>Each of these programs have necessarily focused within their own ‘borders’ of the public sector form to develop, learn, and prepare.  However, the full realization of digital potential requires interoperability between all jurisdictions.  </p>



<p>In this panel discussion, we have representation from three of the four generalized forms of the public sector.  </p>



 Questions 



<p>In preparation for the discussion please reflect on the following questions:</p>



 
 In your respective public sector forms, how is public policy approaching the motivators of its citizenry and businesses to adopt and use digital wallets and identifiers? 



 It is human nature to only want to share successes, but in reality, the learning and discovery process requires failures and ‘bumps in the road.’  What are the ‘redprints’[1] from your experiences and observations and what are the learnings gained from these? 



 To realize the full potential of digital wallets and identity requires that interoperability between legal jurisdictions of digital credentials.  How is jurisdictional interoperability being addressed within your respective regions?  What programs are in place (or being put in place) to ensure interoperability?

   The newest wave of AI is attributable to what are called foundation models. The benefits are high, but so are the concerns. Here's what policymakers can do.

<p>The last few years—even the last few months—have seen artificial intelligence (AI) breakthroughs come at a dizzying pace. AI that can generate paragraphs of text as well as a human, create realistic imagery and video from text, or perform hundreds of different tasks has captured the public’s attention. People see AI’s high level of performance, creative potential and, in some cases, the ability for anyone to use them with little to no technical expertise. This wave of AI is attributable to what are known as <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models">foundation models</a>.</p>



 What are foundation models? 



<p>As the name suggests, foundation models can be the foundation for many kinds of AI systems. Using machine learning techniques, these models apply information learned about one situation to another situation. While the amount of data required is considerably more than the average person needs to transfer understanding from one task to another, the result is relatively similar. For example, once you spend enough time learning how to cook, without too much effort you can figure out how to cook almost any dish, and even invent new ones.</p>



<p>This wave of AI looks to replace the task-specific models that have dominated the landscape. And the potential benefits of foundation models to the economy and society are vast. For example, identifying candidate molecules for novel drugs or identifying suitable materials for new battery technologies requires sophisticated knowledge about chemistry and time-intensive screening and evaluation of different molecules. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/molecular-transformer-discovery">IBM’s MoLFormer-XL</a>, a foundation model trained on data about 1.1 billion molecules, helps scientists rapidly predict the 3D structure of molecules and infer their physical properties, such as their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. IBM recently <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-and-IBM-to-Explore-Quantum-Computing-and-Generative-AI-for-mRNA-Science/default.aspx">announced</a> a partnership with Moderna to use MoLFormer models to help design better mRNA medicines. IBM also partners <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/nasa-partners-with-ibm-to-build-ai-foundation-models-to-advance-climate-science/">with NASA</a> to analyze geospatial satellite data—to better inform efforts to fight climate change—using foundation models.</p>



<p>However, there are also concerns about their potential to cause harm in new or unforeseen ways. Some risks of using foundation models are like those of other kinds of AI, like risks related to bias. But they can also pose new risks and amplify existing risks, such as hallucination, the capability of generation of false yet plausible-seeming content. These concerns are prompting the public and policymakers to question whether existing regulatory frameworks can protect against these potential harms.</p>



 What should policymakers do? 



<p>Policymakers should take productive steps to address these concerns, recognizing that a risk and context-based <a href="https://www.ibm.com/policy/ai-precision-regulation/">approach to AI regulation</a> remains the most effective strategy to minimize the risks of all AI, including those posed by foundation models.</p>



<p>The best way policymakers can meaningfully address concerns related to foundation models is to ensure any AI policy framework is risk-based and appropriately focused on the deployers of AI systems. Read the IBM Policy Lab’s <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/Whitepaper-A-Policymakers-Guide-to-Foundation-Models">A Policymaker’s Guide to Foundation Models</a>—a new white paper from us, IBM’s Chief Privacy &amp; Trust Officer Christina Montgomery, AI Ethics Global Leader Francesca Rossi, and IBM Policy Lab Senior Fellow Joshua New—to understand why IBM is asking policymakers to:</p>



 
 Promote transparency 



 Leverage flexible approaches 



 Differentiate between different kinds of business models 



 Carefully study emerging risks 
 



<p>Given the incredible benefits of foundation models, effectively protecting the economy and society from its potential risks will help to ensure that the technology is a force for good. Policymakers should swiftly act to better understand and mitigate the risks of foundation models while still ensuring the approach to governing AI remains risk-based and technology neutral.&nbsp;</p>

             April 2023   
	 
		 
			 The EU Regulation Leads the Way in Digital Securities 
<p>As the race to embrace digital securities and the tokenization of assets accelerates, the US seems to be lagging behind the European Union. Despite the appointment of Gary Gensler, a blockchain-savvy Commissioner with a background in teaching blockchain, digital currencies, and financial technology at MIT, the SEC has maintained a conservative stance and resisted change.</p>
<p>Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC has maintained that the “law is clear,” suggesting that existing securities laws are appropriate for regulating digital assets. Consequently,&nbsp;issuers are required to adhere to the same rules as traditional securities, which is not always easy due to the decentralized nature of blockchain.</p>
<p>The lack of a clear regulatory framework in the US for issuers to tokenize their assets and leverage secondary trading solutions has significantly stifled innovation and hindered the adoption of digital securities, putting the country at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>In contrast, the European Union appears to be embracing this technology more proactively by developing a&nbsp;regulatory framework that clarifies the different types of tokens&nbsp;and therefore supports innovation while maintaining strict enforcement of regulations.</p>
<p>In fact, as recently as April 20th this year, the European Parliament officially approved new cryptocurrency regulations, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). MiCA aims to address gaps in existing EU financial services legislation by introducing a unified set of rules for crypto-assets and associated activities and services.&nbsp;MiCA explicitly excludes securities (therefore security tokens are subject to the existing MiFID regulations), defines rules for stablecoins&nbsp;and for crypto asset service providers (CASPs).</p>
<p>In parallel with MiCA, the EU also established recently The Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Pilot Regime, which is a regulatory framework designed to provide a controlled environment for the testing and development of innovative distributed ledger technologies related to digital securities. The regime was introduced with the aim of fostering innovation, increasing market efficiency, and enhancing investor protection in the digital securities sector. Mostly,&nbsp;the DLT Pilot Regime enables exchanges (MTFs) and CSDs to experiment and benefit from blockchains.</p>
<p>Luxembourg stands out as a leading example in Europe, as it has implemented clear regulations for using blockchain to issue native tokenized securities. Many businesses choose to establish entities in Luxembourg to take advantage of its proactive regulatory environment.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, which is headquartered in Luxembourg, we envision a future where digital securities trade on decentralized public blockchain ledgers,&nbsp;making assets and securities globally accessible and tradable by eligible investors, anywhere, in full compliance.</p>
<p>By adopting the open-source ERC3643 standard and ONCHAINID, digital securities can integrate jurisdiction-specific securities laws. This approach ensures compliance for issuers, investors, and jurisdictions while operating in decentralized, resilient and scalable infrastructures.</p>
<p>With clearer legal guidelines in Europe and proven tech solutions, there is ample opportunity to tokenize assets&nbsp;and take advantage of the benefits that blockchain technology offers. Companies should consider these advantages and explore tokenization as a way to streamline processes, enhance transferability, and promote transparency in the market.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has witnessed the rise of several meme coins in recent years, and PEPE is one such memecoin that has experienced a remarkable 244x growth in value within just two weeks of its launch. While the growth is noteworthy, potential investors should be aware of the risks associated with meme coins and the anonymity of their creators.</p>



<p>PEPE’s founders remain anonymous, making it difficult to assess the credibility and intentions of the team behind the project. This can pose risks for investors, as the lack of transparency may lead to potential scams or pump-and-dump schemes. In addition, the rapid growth in value may not be sustainable in the long term, as the price of meme coins can be highly volatile and influenced by market sentiment and social media trends.</p>



<p>Furthermore, a recent analysis by Coinfirm has indicated that 0.2% of the addresses associated with PEPE were related to crime and fraud, while 0.03% were linked to sanctioned addresses. This poses additional risks for investors, as transactions with such addresses may result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties, or even loss of funds.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while PEPE has shown significant growth in a short period, potential investors should carefully consider the risks associated with investing in meme coins, particularly those with anonymous founders and potential connections to illicit activities. As always, thorough research and due diligence are crucial before making any investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>While many organizations have established environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals and made ESG commitments, driven by purpose and emerging regulatory requirements, they face several challenges when making the transition from ambition to action.</p>



<p>A recent IBM study found that global executives cite <a href="https://ibm.co/esg-ultimatum">inadequate data</a> (41%) as the biggest obstacle to their ESG progress, followed by regulatory barriers (39%), inconsistent standards (37%) and inadequate skills (36%). The impacts of data challenges are becoming visible to company stakeholders, with <a href="https://ibm.co/esg-ultimatum">consumers making purchasing — and even employment — decisions</a> based on a company’s progress toward their ESG goals.</p>



<p>Those who have committed to <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/04/9268b27e-6e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html?Campaigncode=CRM-YI23-IMM-2072538">closing the green gap</a> have embraced sustainability-focused processes and are reaping the benefits. If data is a key barrier to success, then companies should consider implementing an environmental strategy that encompasses an all-in organizational commitment to specific targeted outcomes and leverages technology to accelerate and track progress.</p>



<p>Another recent study from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/erp-sustainability">IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) and SAP</a> surveyed 2,125 senior executives involved in their organizations’ environmental sustainability strategies. The study yielded a surprising result: organizations that outperform their competition in both environmental and financial outcomes also boast the most deeply engaged enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.</p>



<p>ERP is the technology of record, touching virtually every organizational business process. It can connect financial and environmental goals, keeping metrics accountable and accessible. When implemented in conjunction with other systems, ERP enables cost transparency and visibility—allowing environmental, regulatory and business-critical decisions to be made with improved consistency and reliability.&nbsp;</p>



 Uncovering hidden possibilities with ERP 



<p>An organization’s sustainability data can be difficult to attain due to siloed business processes, unreliable data and misaligned business priorities. ERP uncovers real-time material information across business functions and gets necessary data into the hands of corporate decision makers and operators for a streamlined user experience. This newfound access to data gives businesses the capability to record, report and act on enterprise wide ESG commitments and help resolve many of the complex challenges and demands of sustainability. With this visibility, people can see the impact of their decisions and trust the results being reported, which can accelerate the cultural change needed to support and accelerate overall sustainable business transformation.</p>



<p>While moving the needle on making progress toward ESG goals can seem nearly impossible for some, there are organizations that have managed to crack the code to greener success. The IBM and SAP study mentioned above found a group of high achieving business leaders (15%)—the Environmental Sustainability Enabled (Enabled)—that actively prioritize environmental sustainability and implement concrete, well-publicized plans to achieve goals at a far higher rate than their peers. The study found that Enabled organizations place environmental sustainability on par with financial performance because they see sustainability fueling financial results.</p>



<p>The recent study also found that the Enabled rely on ERP data structures to address sustainability goals, among other standout findings, including:</p>



 
 Enabled report 47% of sustainability performance data is collected in their ERP, but they expect that to increase to 55% by 2025—a 17% increase. 



 94% more of Enabled believe ERPs are helping manage manufacturing sustainability goals. And 31% more believe the same as relates to labor management. 



 Enabled report accumulating almost 70% of their carbon capture and energy use metrics in their ERP. 



 Enabled organizations use ERP to establish standard environmental measures across ecosystems 39% more often than Reluctant (organizations that do not view environmental sustainability as important to their success). 



 43% more Enabled versus Reluctant organizations use ERP to established shared environmental targets. 
 



<p>All organizations should take note: in an interwoven economy, ERP can help populate and standardize shared sustainability initiatives.</p>



 The time to act is now 



<p>Sustainability and ERP are team sports acting on actuals, and no one team can achieve success on its own. As strategic partners for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">S/4HANA</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability">SAP Sustainability solutions</a>, IBM and SAP bring together technologies and services with enterprise-scale platforms to help companies break down silos and embed solutions across critical business functions and operations. Sustainability continues to be a business imperative and the pressure to change business process will only continue to increase.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/erp-sustainability">Read the full study</a> to learn how we are helping clients leverage ERP to operationalize sustainability. SAP and IBM understand how to help companies move the needle on their ESG commitments, without sacrificing their business needs or profitability. </p>

 Cryptoasset firms, technology companies, and financial institutions were invited to provide feedback on the UK’s answer to MiCA. Here’s what we had to say. 



 



<p>In February 2023, in perhaps the clearest sign to date that the UK government was taking the challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry seriously, HM Treasury released a new consultation paper, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1133404/TR_Privacy_edits_Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_vP.pdf">‘Future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets.’&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>In the Foreword, it states:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“The government’s firm ambition is for the UK to be home to the most open, well-regulated, and technologically advanced capital markets in the world. Delivering on this ambition means taking proactive steps to harness the opportunities of new financial technologies. We believe that crypto technologies can have a profound impact across financial services.”</p>



 Crypto conundrum: To regulate or not to regulate.&nbsp; 



<p>Over recent years, the crypto industry has become increasingly complex as the constantly evolving ecosystem continues to create a myriad of opportunities and associated risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there are currently no comprehensive crypto-related regulations in the UK, the FCA and Bank of England have issued usage guidelines and warnings about the lack of regulatory and monetary protection.&nbsp;The proposed crypto regime aims to address these gaps and loopholes.</p>



<p>In a post-Brexit world, the UK’s crypto conundrum has been further compounded by the EU’s decision to create <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>, one of the world’s first crypto regulatory frameworks. Although MiCA will not apply to UK crypto service providers (or any non-European provider), if UK providers plan on targeting EU investors or offering their services in the EU, then they will need to obtain MiCA authorization and follow <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR requirements</a>, to ensure they are compliant with both UK and EU regulations.</p>



<p>As part of the proposed regulatory regime, the UK intends to introduce its own territorial scope, and providers of crypto asset businesses that market UK consumers within or outside of the UK, must comply with UK rules.&nbsp;</p>



 FTX and the industry-wide wake-up call. 



<p>The collapse of FTX in late 2022 sent shockwaves through the industry, affecting global cryptoasset markets and investors, and forcing regulators to re-examine its timeline for cryptoasset regulation.&nbsp;In January 2023, the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) announced plans to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">form a brand-new division </a>specifically designed to tackle crypto crime. The NCA’s ‘Crypto Cell’ will initially contain just five officers who will be solely responsible for providing support on new and existing crypto-related investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The decision by HM Treasury to release a consultation paper covering a potential regulatory regime for cryptoassets finally addresses the elephant in the room. Timing-wise, the consultation could not have been opened at a more opportune moment. The crypto industry has endured numerous high-profile casualties recently, making the case for crypto regulation that much more palatable.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>The 77-page paper features information on the current regulatory landscape for cryptoassets, definitions of different types of cryptoassets, and geographic scope of cryptoasset activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as more general guidelines regarding cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, the new consultation paper sets out a proposed policy approach to bringing cryptoasset activities into the UK regulatory perimeter. For example, it suggests that most initial coin offerings be considered securities offerings, which would mean the equivalent of client asset segregation requirements be applied to crypto firms. As such, future proposed crypto regulatory requirements would fall under the UK’s <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/contents">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Up until now, the direction of travel for UK cryptoasset regulation has been anything but clear. A balanced and well thought out regulatory framework will likely lay the foundations in support of the UK becoming a major global crypto hub. The latest developments are music to the ears of traditional financial institutions, as clear rules for conducting crypto business in and out of the UK provides a level of certainty not yet demonstrated by the jurisdiction,” said Jason.</p>



 IDnow’s feedback on UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime. 



<p>The consultation paper allows people inside and outside Parliament to provide feedback on policies and legislative proposals contained therein. Our crypto regulatory experts, Rayissa Armata and Jason Tucker-Feltham poured over the consultation paper, submitting feedback, and answering  several of the 52 questions, including:</p>



  Do you agree with the proposed territorial scope of the regime? If not, then please explain why and what alternative you would suggest.  



<p>Financial activities are increasingly becoming more digital and cross border, so crypto activities are within scope. Regulators should consider both national requirements and global standards that aim for interoperable activities and minimize risk.</p>



  What steps can be taken to encourage the development of RegTech to prevent, detect and disrupt market abuse?  



<p>IDnow agrees that there is a need for further collaboration between firms, regulators, and enforcement agencies to develop RegTech solutions that can help detect, prevent and disrupt market abuse. IDnow would encourage sandbox initiatives that can explore ways to enhance remote KYC applications that can be used in both centralized (off chain) and decentralized (on chain) transactions.</p>



  What other best practices exist today within DeFi organisations and infrastructures that should be formalized into industry standards or regulatory obligations?  



<p>On-chain KYC platforms allow for a level of transparency and accountability that had not previously been possible for DeFi platforms. For platforms where there is a significant risk of money-laundering, on-chain KYC could help mitigate this risk.&nbsp;</p>



 Next steps on the UK journey toward crypto regulation.&nbsp; 



<p>Now that the consultation period is over, the next step will be to review contributions before establishing a clear regulatory framework that supports innovation and protects consumers. How closely the final version will resemble the EU’s crypto regulatory framework, MiCA, remains to be seen. What is very unlikely, though, is it coming into force before MiCA does, in 2024.</p>

 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification services for crypto </a>work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including crypto. Whether automated or expert-assisted, its online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

We are driven by a vision of peer-to-peer coordination, accountability, and mutual sovereignty, and we believe that DWeb Camp is an embodiment of this. We are excited to spend a week connecting and collaborating with our closest friends and allies, working towards the collective goal of building a better, decentralized web.</p><p>With a live beta version of Holochain we have been committed to building actionable offerings that support our growing ecosystem. We aren’t just bringing ideas to DWeb, we are bringing tools. Both to support the conference itself, and that can be picked up by others, iterated on, and taken forwards, integrated with other protocols and dreams, building towards a better future. &nbsp;</p>Images courtesy of DWeb Camp We Would Love to See You at DWeb  <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp 2023, June 21–25th,</a> is a gathering of decentralized web enthusiasts in Navarro California, nestled in the hills and redwoods. This year’s theme is “Discovering Flows.” Like the Navarro river which winds through the retreat, flows wind through all of our lives. Making them visible so we can interact with them intentionally is a powerful act, which is why at Holochain we often talk about currencies as “current-sees,” a tool for seeing flows. DWeb camp is focused on four flows and the relationships between them: Nature. Technology. Community. You. </p><p>More than just being a monetary sponsor of the event, we want to support these flows. We are putting time and energy into this event because the people and the values are deeply aligned. Our DNA asks us to develop relationships and communities, and we encourage others to do the same — with apps, with businesses, with social ventures. <a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/gatheringsforgood/861532?ref=blog.holochain.org">We look forward to seeing you there.</a></p> Show Don’t Tell with DWeb <p>The biggest thing we can announce is that DWeb will be shutting off the internet on Saturday June 24th. Or, the connection to the external net at least. </p><p>Throughout the week, DWeb Camp will be running on a local P2P network and on the final full day will be shutting off the connection to the outside. Everyone at camp will be invited to use a conferencing app Holochain built specifically for the purpose of this offline environment at DWeb. With it, we can harness the power of decentralized web tech for local, offline collaboration: discovering, scheduling, connecting, and remembering.</p><p>Distributed protocols are meant to be run local first, and we see this as an opportunity to use the tools we have been building and to live a day in the <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/tomorrow/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tomorrow</a> we dream of.</p>

   For self-managed software and hybrid cloud customers, new enhancements address MFA prompt bombing, enable smooth integrations, and improve user experiences 

<p>Fully 82% of enterprises operate hybrid cloud environments<a>1</a>, meaning they run a mixture of on-premises software and cloud (public and private) services. Indications are that the hybrid cloud model will continue for many years to come. ForgeRock remains committed to helping organizations deliver advanced, unified identity and access management solutions, and to deploy and manage them within whatever environments work best. To that end, we are pleased to announce that the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> 7.3 software is now available.</p>

<p>The 7.3 release is the latest version of ForgeRock software for our self-managed customers. These include enterprises that for a variety of reasons — locus of control or regulatory reasons, for example — prefer to install and run the software themselves. The software can be installed on-premises, with a preferred cloud provider, or in a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid cloud</a> mode. The software offers an abundance of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployment options</a> to meet the needs of customers with the most complex IT environments.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that ForgeRock also offers the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> for customers seeking a turnkey SaaS solution. ForgeRock's "cloud-first" strategy means that many of the features in the 7.3 software discussed below are already available to our cloud customers.</p>

<p>What's new in 7.3? The software covers a lot of ground, spanning four product areas:</p>

  ForgeRock Access Management 7.3, with Web Agent 2023.2 and Java Agent 2023.2 
   ForgeRock Identity Management 7.3 
   ForgeRock Directory Services 7.3 
   ForgeRock Identity Gateway 2023.2 
  New 7.3 features that enhance security and user experience 

<p>One of the most insidious authentication attacks of recent memory is known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>. This social engineering attack relies on inattentive users absentmindedly approving mobile push notifications set off by the bad guys, allowing the attackers to essentially defeat multi-factor authentication (MFA). The 7.3 release includes a push notification with number challenge in which the user validates the sign-in attempt by tapping the number on the mobile device that is shown in the browser sign-in instructions. If the user picks the correct number, the authentication succeeds. Details about where the sign-in attempt originated are provided below the number choices on the mobile authenticator app, providing an additional data point to verify to the user that the authentication attempt is legitimate.</p>

<p>To secure and deliver <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">superior end-user digital experiences</a>, server-side resources need to be aware of client-side data states and be able to take certain actions. In 7.3, a lot of work went into session enhancements that help address these needs. Logout by UserID enables an administrator to logout all users regardless of the session storage or token type. This means that if a bad actor is identified, an administrator can terminate all the compromised user's sessions so the bad guys can't simply jump to another open browser session to continue their attack.</p>

<p>Enhanced session tracking easily follows a client-side session from creation, to upgrade, to termination, giving better visibility to the server-side admins so they can detect and initiate a decision should an action need to be taken (see "Logout by UserID" above!).</p>

<p>Have you ever been engaging with a website, entered some information, and decided to register or log in only to have the information you entered disappear? This creates an intensely negative experience for users and often leads to users abandoning their interactions. Post login data preservation prevents pre-authenticated users from losing data they have already entered before they log in to an application. Data preservation helps to delight users instead of frustrating them and leading them to abandon their sessions.</p>

<p>And there is more:</p>
  Logging out users in stateless client-side sessions 
   Support for OAuth email authentication 
   Group scalability that helps supercharge performance of directory services 
   And dozens of other enhancements, features, and fixes 
 <p>ForgeRock is dedicated to supporting our customers in whatever deployment configuration they prefer: as-a-service, self-managed, or hybrid cloud. You can find out more from the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.3/platform-guide/release-notes.html">Release Notes</a> and the full <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.3">7.3 product documentation</a>, and you can <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/platform/featured">download the software</a>.</p>

<p>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) enables customers to build, manage and deploy modern, scalable applications to achieve digital business success. However, due to its complexity, achieving <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/delivering-value-through-operational-excellence">operational excellence</a> in the cloud is difficult. Fundamentally, as a Cloud Operator, you need to ensure great end-user experiences while staying within budget.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we will review the various methods of GCP cloud cost management, what problems they address and how GCP users can best use them. However, regardless of your cloud cost optimization strategy, achieving operational excellence at scale and taking advantage of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/cloud-elasticity-vs-cloud-scalability">elasticity of the cloud</a> requires software that optimizes your consumption simultaneously for performance and cost—and makes it easy for you to automate it, safely and confidently. Let’s review how IBM Turbonomic helps customers optimize their GCP cloud costs.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">Learn more about IBM Turbonomic.</a>







 Right-sizing instances 



<p>Google Cloud Platform’s operating expense model (OPEX) charges customers for the capacity available for different resources, regardless of whether they are fully utilized or not. GCP users can purchase different instance types and sizes, but often buy the largest instance available to ensure performance. Right-sizing resources is the process of matching instance types and sizes to workload performance and capacity requirements. To operate at the lowest cost, right-sizing resources must be done on a continuous basis. However, cloud operators often right-size reactively—for example, after executing a “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/lift-and-shift">lift and shift</a>” cloud migration or development.</p>



<p>Migrate for Compute Engine is a GCP tool that has a right-sizing feature that recommends instance types for optimized cost and performance. This tool provides two types of right-sizing recommendations. The first is performance-based recommendations that are based on CPU and RAM currently allocated to the on-premises <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machine">virtual machine (VM)</a>. The second is cost-based recommendations that are based on the current CPU and RAM configuration of the on-prem VM and the average usage of the VM during a given period.</p>



 How to use IBM Turbonomic to right-size instances 



<p>Let’s review how IBM Turbonomic GCP users right-size instances through percentile-based scaling. The diagrams below represent the IBM Turbonomic UI. Figure 1 shows the application stack. The supply chain on the left represents the resource relationships that Turbonomic maps out from the business application down to the Cloud Region. It can include other components like container pods, storage volumes, virtual machines and more, depending on the infrastructure that supports the application.</p>



<p>This full-stack understanding is what makes Turbonomic’s recommendations trustworthy and gives cloud engineering and operations the confidence to automate. For this GCP account, Turbonomic has identified 15 pending scaling actions:</p>



Figure 1



<p>After selecting SHOW ALL, customers are brought to Turbonomic’s Action Center, which can be found in Figure 2, below. This image shows all the scaling actions available for this GCP account. By viewing this dashboard, customers can find relevant information like the account name, instance type, discount coverage and on-demand cost. Customers can select different actions and execute them by clicking EXECUTE ACTIONS in the top-right corner:</p>



Figure 2



<p>For customers looking for more details on a particular action, they can select DETAILS and Turbonomic will provide additional information that it considers in its recommendations. As shown below in Figure 3, this instance needs to be scaled down because it has underutilized vCPU. Other information for this action includes the cost impact of executing the action, the resulting CPU utilization and capacity, and net throughput:</p>



Figure 3



 Scaling instances 



<p>Public cloud environments are always changing, and to achieve performance and budget goals, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) users must scale their instances both vertically (right-sizing/scaling up) and horizontally (scaling out). To scale horizontally, GCP customers can observe application load balances and then scale-out instances as load increases from increased demand. Distributing load across multiple instances through horizontal scaling increases performance and reliability, but instances must be scaled back as demand changes to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-scalability-scale-up-vs-scale-out/">Learn more about cloud scalability and scaling up vs. scaling out.</a>



<p>Compute Engine also offers GCP customers autoscaling capabilities by automatically adding or deleting VM instances based on increases or decreases in load. However, this tool scales under the constraint of user-defined policies and only for designated VM instances called managed instance groups (MIGs).</p>



<p>The only way to optimize horizontal scaling is to do it in real-time through automation. IBM Turbonomic continuously generates scaling actions so applications can always perform at the lowest cost. Figure 4 below represents a GCP account that needs to be scaled out:</p>



Figure 4



<p>The horizontal scaling action for this GCP account can be executed in the Action Center under the Provision Actions subcategory found in Figure 5 below. Here, you can find information on the actions and the corresponding workload, such as the container cluster, the namespace and the risk posed to the workload (which, in this case, is transaction congestion):</p>



Figure 5



<p>In Figure 6 below, you can see how Turbonomic provides the rationale behind taking the action. In this case, a VM is experiencing vCPU congestion and needs to be provisioned additional CPU to improve performance. Turbonomic also specifies all the details, including the name, ID, Account and age:</p>



Figure 6



 Suspending instances 



<p>Another significant way to optimize GCP cloud spend is to shut down idle instances. An organization may suspend instances if it is not currently using the instance (such as during non-business hours) but expects to resume use in the near term. When deleting an instance, the instance will be shut down and any data stored on the persistent disk is also deleted.</p>



<p>However, when suspending an instance, customers do not delete the underlying data contained in the attached persistent disk. When starting the instance again, the persistent disk is simply attached to a newly provisioned instance. GCP users can also use Compute Engine to suspend instances. GCP customers cannot suspend instances that use GPU, and suspension must be executed manually through the Google Cloud console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Turbonomic automatically identifies and provides recommendations for suspending instances. To suspend an instance with Turbonomic, customers will need to first select a GCP account with a pending suspension action, as shown in Figure 7 below:</p>



Figure 7



<p>To execute a suspension action, Turbonomic customers need to go to the Action Center, select the corresponding action and execute. Under the Suspend Actions tab of the Action Center, as seen in Figure 8, customers can see the Vmem, VCPU and Vstorage capacity for each instance with a pending action:</p>



Figure 8



<p>If customers need additional details before executing, they can select the DETAILS, as shown in Figure 9 below. The details provided for this action include the reasoning behind the action (in this case, to improve infrastructure efficiency) and the cost impact, age of the instance, the virtual CPU and Memory, and the number of consumers for this instance:</p>



Figure 9



 Leveraging discounted pricing 



<p>Customers can also leverage discounted pricing through optimizing committed-use discount (CUD) coverage and utilization to reduce costs. GCP Compute Engine allows customers to purchase and renew resource-based committed-use contracts or commitments in return for heavily discounted prices for VM usage. GCP users can leverage committed-use discount recommendations that Compute Engine generates through analyzing customers’ VM usage patterns.</p>



<p>IBM Turbonomic’s analytics engine automatically ingests and displays negotiated rates with GCP and then generates specific committed-use discount scaling actions so customers can maximize CUD-to-instance coverage. Figure 10 represents a GCP account that has 15 pending actions to increase CUD utilization and coverage:</p>



Figure 10



<p>Figure 11 represents the scale actions that can be executed in the Action Center to increase CUD coverage. Some important details listed in the Action Center here are the resulting instance type, percent discount coverage and on-demand cost of taking the scaling action.</p>



<p>Figure 12 provides more details for this action, such as the vCPU and vMem utilization, throughput capacity and utilization, and total savings. All this information can again be found in the action’s corresponding DETAILS tab:</p>







Figure 12



 Deleting unattached resources 



<p>Finally, as previously discussed, Google Cloud Platform’s operating expense model (OPEX) charges customers not just for the resources that are actively in use, but also for the entire pool of resources available. As organizations build and deploy new releases into their environment, some resources are left unattached. Unattached resources are when customers create a resource but stop using it entirely.</p>



<p>After development, hundreds of different resource types can be left unattached. Deleting unattached resources can significantly reduce wasted cloud spend. Figure 13 below shows a GCP account that has identified five unattached resources that can be removed. Like suspending idle instances, GCP users can leverage Compute Engine to manually delete unused instances:</p>



Figure 13



<p>The delete actions for this account are listed in the Action Center in Figure 14. The information listed in the Delete category of the Action Center includes the size of the persistent disk, the storage tier, the amount of time it has been unattached and the cost impact of removing it:</p>



Figure 14



<p>For additional insight on the impact of these delete actions, customers can select the DETAILS tab and find more information, as shown in Figure 15. Below, you can see the purpose of this action is to increase savings. Customers can also see additional information like the volume details, whether the action is disruptive and the resource and cost impact:</p>

   You know a data warehouse is essential. Let’s look at why warehouse optimization is key in a data lakehouse strategy, and why it matters for your business.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/challenges-of-todays-monolithic-data-architecture">prior blog</a>, we pointed out that warehouses, known for high-performance data processing for business intelligence, can quickly become expensive for new data and evolving workloads. We also made the case that query and reporting, provided by big data engines such as Presto, need to work with the Spark infrastructure framework to support advanced analytics and complex enterprise data decision-making. To do so, Presto and Spark need to readily work with existing and modern data warehouse infrastructures. Now, let’s chat about why data warehouse optimization is a key value of a data lakehouse strategy.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-to-resolve-todays-data-challenges-with-a-lakehouse-architecture">Read our blog on solving today’s challenges with a lakehouse architecture</a>



 Value of data warehouse optimization 



<p>Since its introduction over a century ago, the gasoline-powered engine has remained largely unchanged. It’s simply been adapted over time to accommodate modern demands such as pollution controls, air conditioning and power steering.</p>



<p>Similarly, the relational database has been the foundation for data warehousing for as long as data warehousing has been around. Relational databases were adapted to accommodate the demands of new workloads, such as the data engineering tasks associated with structured and semi-structured data, and for building machine learning models.</p>



<p>Returning to the analogy, there have been significant changes to how we power cars. We now have gasoline-powered engines, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and hybrid vehicles. An <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2021/08/15/study-confirms-this-upside-for-tesla-evs-over-gas-cars/?sh=649348696048">August 2021 Forbes article</a> referenced a 2021 Department of Energy Argonne National Laboratory publication indicating, “Hybrid electric vehicles (think: Prius) had the lowest total 15-year per-mile cost of driving in the Small SUV category beating BEVs”.</p>



<p>Just as hybrid vehicles help their owners balance the initial purchase price and cost over time, enterprises are attempting to find a balance between high performance and cost-effectiveness for their data and analytics ecosystem. Essentially, they want to run the right workloads in the right environment without having to copy datasets excessively.</p>



 Optimizing your data lakehouse architecture 



<p>Fortunately, the IT landscape is changing thanks to a mix of cloud platforms, open source and traditional software vendors. The rise of cloud object storage has driven the cost of data storage down. Open-data file formats have evolved to support data sharing across multiple data engines, like Presto, Spark and others. Intelligent data caching is improving the performance of data lakehouse infrastructures.</p>



<p>All these innovations are being adapted by software vendors and accepted by their customers. So, what does this mean from a practical perspective? What can enterprises do different from what they are already doing today? Some use case examples will help. To effectively use raw data, it often needs to be curated within a data warehouse. Semi-structured data needs to be reformatted and transformed to be loaded into tables. And ML processes consume an abundance of capacity to build models.</p>



<p>Organizations running these workloads in their data warehouse environment today are paying a high run rate for engineering tasks that add no additional value or insight. Only the outputs from these data-driven models allow an organization to derive additional value. If organizations could execute these engineering tasks at a lower run rate in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enu-EH7RHHM">data lakehouse</a> while making the transformed data available to both the lakehouse and warehouse via open formats, they could deliver the same output value with low-cost processing.</p>



 Benefits of optimizing across your data warehouse and data lakehouse 



<p>Optimizing workloads across a data warehouse and a data lakehouse by sharing data using open formats can reduce costs and complexity. This helps organizations drive a better return on their data strategy and analytics investments while also helping to deliver better data governance and security.</p>



<p>And just as a hybrid car allows car owners to get greater value from their car investment, optimizing workloads across a data warehouse and data lakehouse will allow organizations to get greater value from their data analytics ecosystem.</p>

 Artificial Intelligence and Humanity 
 Humans versus technology 
<p>The advancement in technology for the past several decades has stirred a growing debate of humans versus artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, if AI begins to take over tasks which were traditionally associated with people, what are people left with? Their sense of humanity and individual identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digitalization has impacted every aspect of our lives, making it easier for us to perform our daily tasks. Because of this, we have more or less become dependent on technology in order to operate in the online world.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Overall, the topic of AI is quite controversial. Throughout history, humans have been cautious about accepting new technologies since the dawn of the industrial age. While technology has undoubtedly brought significant improvements to our lives, an important question remains:</p>
 
<p>Will AI ultimately be beneficial or detrimental to our well-being in the long run?</p>
 
<p>We will examine the potential advantages and disadvantages of AI in the following sections.</p>
 The benefits of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>Despite the potential risks and challenges posed by AI, there is no denying that it brings many benefits and advantages for humanity.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Technology has filled our lives with entertainment, efficiency, and enhanced accessibility by eliminating frustrating and time-consuming tasks. Not only that, but it has made performing our daily tasks considerably easier and it has opened doors to an incredible library of information.</p>
 
<p>Let’s briefly explore some of AI’s key benefits:</p>
 
 
 
 Automation. Advanced technology can program AI to do tedious, repetitive mundane jobs, so that humans can focus on more complex and creative tasks. 
 
 
 
 
 Efficiency. AI has the capability to analyze a large amount of data and find patterns and trends that might be hard for humans to see. This can help individuals make better decisions. 
 
 
 Accesibility. Thanks to modern technology, individuals can benefit from applications that make working, studying, and communicating remotely much easier.&nbsp; 
 Accuracy. Under careful supervision, AI can perform tasks with high accuracy, reducing the risk of errors and improving performance tremendously. 
 
 
 The dark side of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>With AI progressing at incredible speeds, technology has raised concerns about privacy and security. One of the biggest concerns nowadays is the threat of AI stealing human identities. There has been an increase in data breaches and cyberattacks, which leads to a growing need for stronger security measures to protect our personal data.</p>
 
<p>Like any other innovation, AI undoubtedly has its drawbacks, which are often overshadowed by its benefits. Basically, AI systems are designed to learn and make decisions based on data. Therefore, if the data used to train these systems is biased or incomplete, it can lead to flawed decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>We can understand the dark side of AI once we examine some of its potential risks and negative impacts:</p>
 
 In the wrong hands, AI systems can be used for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks. 
 Because of this, privacy and security are major concerns when it comes to AI. 
 Data breaches could result in divulging sensitive data, leading to significant consequences, like loss of privacy. 
 Hackers can make use of the leaked data to steal or forge individuals’ digital identities. 
 AI can generate fake identities, which can be used to influence the decision-making or output of a system. 
 
 
<p>As AI systems continue to evolve, it becomes more and more difficult to predict their actions. Consequently, we cannot hold them accountable for their faulty behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do, then? 
<p>Artificial intelligence is currently not a sentient being, it cannot make its own decisions.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>It can either be used for good purposes or for malicious purposes, depending on the intentions of the individuals behind it. And, while humans are not equipped with the accuracy and efficiency of state-of-the-art technology, we can use AI to fight against malicious AI.</p>
 
<p>Thankfully, there is a method which can verify an individual’s identity in a secure, efficient and highly accurate manner.&nbsp;</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality 
 What is Proof of Individuality? 
<p>Proof of individuality (POI) is a protocol that supports the statement that every person is a distinct and unique individual. As a matter of fact, individuality is a core aspect of human existence. It refers to the one-of-a-kind set of characteristics, thoughts, emotions and perspectives that make each person different from one another.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>While digital identities can be stolen and sold, individuality is not something which, at the moment, can be duplicated. At this time, it represents our liveliness as real, tangible, mindful beings.</p>
 Identification in modern times 
<p>Identification is an important aspect of our lives. Above all, it is unique to each and every one of us, and it represents our liveliness. Therefore, as technology makes new, magnificent progress every day, AI-Powered proof of individuality has become an essential part of our daily existence. From accessing bank accounts to opening doors, AI-Powered proof of individuality has revolutionized the way we identify ourselves.</p>
 
<p>Some of the most common AI-Powered proof of individuality methods are:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 Facial recognition 
 Iris scans 
 
 
<p>These biometric identification methods are highly accurate and reliable, making them the go-to method for identification in many industries.</p>
 How can AI-Powered Proof of Individuality benefit us? 
<p>Overall, AI-Powered proof of individuality has many advantages. Particularly:</p>
 
 Speed 
 Accuracy 
 Remote identification 
 
 Speed 
 
 The traditional methods of identification, such as presenting a physical paper for verification can cause delays. 
 Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are much quicker. For example, using a fingerprint scanner can take only a few seconds. 
 As a result, Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are efficient in situations where time is of the essence. 
 
 Accuracy 
 
 Biometric methods such as facial recognition and iris scans are highly accurate. 
 In such a case, the chance of false positives or false negatives is minimal. 
 This level of accuracy is ideal for high-security situations, such as airport security or government buildings. 
 
 Remote identification 
 
 AI-Powered proof of individuality made it possible to identify individuals remotely. 
 With the use of online identification tools, individuals can verify the authenticity of each other’s identities. 
 There is no need to meet in person anymore. Therefore, physical distance is no longer an obstacle. 
 
 How does AI-Powered Proof of Individuality work? 
 A brief description 
<p>AI-Powered proof of individuality uses artificial intelligence to verify an individual’s identity based on their biometric features and behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>As mentioned previously, biometric features are fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Some of the behavior patterns this technology analyzes are:</p>
 
 Typing speed and style. How a person types on a keyboard, how long they pause between keystrokes, and how hard they press the keys. 
 Mouse movements. How a person moves the cursor on a screen, the direction and speed of their movements. 
 Voice patterns. The way a person talks, their pitch, tone and accent. 
 Smartphone usage. The way a person holds or uses their smartphone, the angle of how they hold their device, or how they swipe and tap on the screen. 
 
 All in the benefit of the individual 
<p>The idea that our devices check our behavior patterns might be anxiety-inducing. Without a doubt, it can be scary thinking how technology knows us better than we know ourselves. However, in this case, AI is programmed to keep our individuality safe from malicious, bad players.</p>
 
<p>This way, organizations can improve security and prevent identity fraud. Furthermore, AI-Powered proof of individuality is more convenient to access digital services without the need for passwords or tangible identification cards. Passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised.</p>
 
<p>Consequently, AI-Powered proof of individuality has the potential to positively transform how we verify our identities in the digital age.</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality and Selfkey 
<p>Our goal at SelfKey is to offer individuals a secure means of verifying their identity through AI-Powered proof of individuality methods.&nbsp;</p>
 Guidelines for users: 
 
 The user will first have to perform a KYC check.&nbsp; 
 
 
 KYC stands for Know Your Customer, and it is a mandatory process of identifying and verifying an individual’s identity. It is done to ensure that the user is genuinely who they claim to be. 
 
 
 
 The user will then obtain the SelfKey iD SBT.&nbsp; 
 
 
 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">SBT</a> stands for Soulbound Tokens. They are non-transferrable, verifiable, digital tokens that can show an individual’s accreditations, work experience, work history, and past records. 
 
 
 
 After this, the user onboards to SelfKey DAO. 
 
 
 DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is governed by a community of individuals on a decentralized blockchain network.&nbsp; 
 The rules of a DAO are transparent to all members in order to create equality between users. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>After the user completes all of the steps above, SelfKey will require an AI-Powered selfie check. This modern method of verifying an individual’s identity uses facial recognition technology.</p>
 
<p>For instance, here’s what happens during an AI-Powered selfie check:</p>
 
 The user will take a selfie and submit it to an AI-Powered system. 
 The AI-Powered system will check the photo against a vast collection of pre-verified images. 
 The system will use algorithms to identify unique facial features, like:&nbsp; 
 
 
 distance between the eyes 
 &nbsp;the shape of the jawline 
 &nbsp;the position of the nose 
 
 
 If the user passes the check, they will receive a POI (proof of identity) credential, which they can stake KEY on. 
 If the user does not pass the check, they will not be allowed to continue. 
 In the case of a false negative, the user will have the possibility to contact support. 
 
 
<p>These AI-Powered selfie checks will be made periodically, each time a user performs important actions within SelfKey DAO.</p>
 How does this benefit us? 
<p>This method is widely used by online platforms and organizations that require a high level of trust and security in their user authentication process. Firstly, it is a quick, convenient, and reliable method. Secondly, and most importantly, AI-powered checks will prevent identity fraud in the online world.</p>
 
<p>For instance, AI-Powered proof of individuality will efficiently and accurately check that:</p>
 
 The user’s selfie is not forged by another individual. 
 The user’s selfie is not AI-generated or fake. 
 The user is a real person. 
 The user’s selfie matches the original selfie they submitted during the KYC check. 
 
 Anti-Sybil technology 
<p>Did you know that there is a term for “identity fraud” in the digital world? In the context of online security and identity verification, “Sybil” refers to the act of creating multiple fake identities or accounts.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>A single, malicious individual or a group can do that, with the intention of manipulating or deceiving the system. Alarmingly, it can carry out spam attacks, manipulate voting in online polls for elections, even inflate the popularity of a website or social media.</p>
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks is a crucial challenge in the design of many online systems. Thankfully, SelfKey’s AI-Powered proof of individuality methods can fight against that.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Even though technology has posed challenges throughout the decades, it has an immense potential to make society better. AI-Powered Proof of Individuality has become a part of our daily lives, helping us identify ourselves in a quick and efficient manner. The advantages modern identification methods bring are undeniable.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>In spite of that, having concerns about privacy and security is normal, especially when it comes to our individuality. However, SelfKey is continuously working on developing methods to combat those who use cutting-edge technology for malicious purposes.</p>
 
<p>Finally, as technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more complex methods of identification in the future. But, it is vital to remember that we are supposed to use technology to enhance our lives, our work, rather than replace them. The solution is to find a balance between technology and humanity.</p>
<p>Together with SelfKey we can achieve that balance.&nbsp;</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>The rise of technology has made a great impact all around the world. It changed the way we communicate, work, and study. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), most of our daily tasks are made considerably easier, and access to information has never been more effortless. However, in order to benefit from all the wonders of AI, we have to become part of its world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of our private information had to evolve from physical papers to digital identities, which are stored in centralized systems. But while traditional, centralized systems are convenient, they put our private data in danger due to their weak security measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, solutions are being developed to change the way we authenticate ourselves online and the way we perform individuality-based activities on Web3. Technology can help protect our private information, just as much as it can be used to compromise it. The key is to remember that we can use AI for our benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will thoroughly elaborate on DAOs, SelfKey’s DAO (including specific terms like KEY, SELF, and NFTs), and how user engagement in the DAO will be beneficial for individuals in the long run.</p>

 Humans and Digital Identity 
 How we operate in the online world 
<p>Nowadays, we operate in the online world in many ways. We use various tools and platforms to connect, communicate, and collaborate with one another across the globe. For instance social media, messaging apps, online forums, and video conferencing. The web has opened up endless opportunities for people to share information, ideas, and experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as with any aspect of human behavior, there are also challenges and risks associated with operating in the online world. One of the biggest concerns is the safety of our personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The risks we take when performing individuality-based activities online 
<p>When we engage in individuality-based activities online that involve sharing personal information, we expose ourselves to a variety of potential risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, personal information shared online can be accessed either by AI or human identity thieves, putting our privacy and security at risk. Even seemingly small details such as our names, birthdates, or email addresses can be used to compromise our security. This can lead to AI attempting to create fake identities using our leaked personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do to avoid those risks? 
<p>Being cautious about what we share online and keeping our privacy safe is very important. However, it is equally important to make sure that the individuals we engage with are not fake, AI-generated entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols within a DAO can be the most secure means of verifying that individuals are genuine, real persons. Not only that, but within a DAO, there is no single entity to govern and control our personal data. What a DAO strives to achieve is equality and fairness among its users, as well as maintain the security of their individuality.</p>
 DAOs vs centralized systems 
 A brief description of DAO&nbsp; 
<p>A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a type of organization that usually operates using blockchain technology. This facilitates decentralized decision-making and transparent governance without the need for a centralized authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs are typically run by a group of individuals who hold tokens or cryptocurrency. Individuals can also vote on decisions related to the organization's operations. For instance: funding proposals or changes to the organization's rules.&nbsp;</p>
 How DAOs are revolutionizing individuality-based operations 
<p>DAOs&nbsp; are changing the way individuals operate by innovating the concept of decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In traditional organizations, individuals cannot materialize their ideas or concerns, due to the centralized systems based on hierarchies. DAOs, on the other hand, allow members to participate in decision-making processes and contribute to the organization's goals through decentralized governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>By using blockchain technology, DAOs enable trustless collaboration and eliminate the need for intermediaries. This method makes it easier for members to join and participate in collective decision-making. Additionally, it creates a more inclusive and democratic environment where each member can have an equal say and contribute to the organization's success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, DAOs are empowering individuals to come together, build communities, and work towards common goals, without sacrificing their individuality or autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
 DAOs and individuals 
 DAOs suffer from lack of user participation 
<p>Despite their potential benefits, DAOs can suffer from a lack of user participation. Because DAOs rely on decentralized decision-making, they require active participation from members to ensure that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner.</p>
 How will user participation help DAOs “stay alive” 
<p>User participation is critical to the success and sustainability of DAOs. Without active participation from members, DAOs may struggle to make decisions, coordinate actions, and achieve their goals. Moreover, low participation can lead to apathy or disengagement. In turn, this can weaken the community and reduce the value of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, active user participation can help DAOs stay alive by:</p>
 
 Promoting engagement. 
 Building a strong community. 
 Ensuring that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, user participation is essential for DAOs to remain viable and achieve their goals over the long term.</p>
 The benefits of participating in DAOs 
<p>Participating in DAOs offers numerous advantages for individuals looking to collaborate and contribute to a community-driven effort. It provides opportunities for innovation and community building while offering financial incentives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits include:</p>
 
 Democratic decision-making 
 Rewards 
 Increased security 
 Unique contributions 
 Transparency 
 
 SelfKey’s DAO 
<p>After explaining the general concept of DAOs, let's examine SelfKey’s DAO objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuality is a vital aspect that the SelfKey DAO is focused on. In SelfKey’s Protocol, every member’s uniqueness is valued in order to help protect their digital identity from theft and forgery. We aim to create a safe environment with the help of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a>, where valued members can operate using trustless and secure methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selkey’s DAO aims to provide secure and private digital identity solutions. With strong credentials in cryptography and blockchain technology, Selkey’s DAO’s goals include protecting users' privacy and giving them control over their data. Credentials are lacking in the crypto industry, and they’re a need in order to keep users’ information safe from being doxxed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, SelfKey’s goal is to develop a method for individuals to engage with one another in a decentralized, trustless environment, while their private data and individuality remain safe and secure.</p>
 Important Terminology in SelfKey’s DAO 
 What is KEY? 
<p>The KEY <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-a-utility-token/">utility token</a> is the centerpiece of the SelfKey Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has several uses, such as:</p>
 
 Being a means of payment for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Being used to stake credentials on. 
 Being utilized to govern and empower members of the SelfKey DAO. 
 Providing the necessary tools for users to take control of their digital identity and secure their privacy. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more individuals join the SelfKey Protocol, the potential uses of KEY will only continue to expand, further cementing its importance as a vital component of the decentralized digital identity revolution.</p>
 What is SELF? 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to stake on credentials, SelfKey has proposed SELF tokens in order to help an individual keep track of what they have staked and for what period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of SELF’s attributes:</p>
 
 SELF tokens can be minted by individuals who properly staked on a real identity. 
 Essentially, SELF can be used as a sort of measurement of reputation. 
 SELF tokens have utility as a reputation signal - they should strengthen legitimate credentials and they may help weed out illegitimate credentials. 
 They are issued by users themselves. 
 They do not have any intrinsic value. 
 SELF tokens may also have utility as a governance mechanism. Those who use, accrue reputation, or are acting as a sort of “identity mining” to secure the platform will receive governance influence. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as the user will stake on a credential which is valid, the user will accumulate reputation to said credential in the form of tokens.</p>
 SelfKey’s NFTs 
<p>At SelfKey, active members have the opportunity to earn NFTs by participating in the community and contributing to the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the unique features of SelfKey's NFTs is that they are highly customizable. This means that individuals can tailor their NFTs to their specific needs and preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey places a great emphasis on individuality, recognizing that each person has their own unique identity and set of circumstances. It is a platform that truly values individuality, and is dedicated to helping people take control of their own identity and data. This is reflected in the customizability of its tokens and the overall design of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>Participating in the SelfKey DAO and earning tokens offers many benefits, such as:</p>
 
 The ability to have a say in the project's direction. 
 Voting rights on proposals. 
 Access to exclusive community events. 
 The opportunity to earn rewards through active participation in the DAO. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO provides a platform for community members to be more engaged and invested in the success of the SelfKey Protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to do it:</p>
 
 First, a user must perform a KYC check in order to properly authenticate themselves as a real person and the person whom they claim to be. Afterwards, they will join the DAO. 
 The user will then be able to stake KEY tokens on their KYC credentials. Afterwards, they will be able to start accumulating SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens can be used to purchase NFT packs with particular customizations. 
 Alternatively, the user can mint their SELF tokens and use them for whatever purpose they find useful and fit. 
 Finally, users can contribute to the SelfKey DAO by performing tasks based on grants issued by the ecosystem. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, active participation and engagement in the SelfKey DAO can bring significant benefits to the SelfKey Protocol and its members. By being actively involved in the decision-making process, members can help shape the direction of the project, making sure that it aligns with their interests and needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, engagement can help build a stronger sense of community among SelfKey users, fostering a supportive environment for learning and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, a thriving SelfKey DAO requires active participation from its members, and those who are willing to engage will reap the benefits of a more robust and inclusive ecosystem.</p>
 Conclusions:&nbsp; 
<p>Unfortunately, most people still rely on centralized systems. However, efforts are being made to empower them to take charge of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO aims to assist individuals in gaining full control of their private data, enabling them to safely engage in Web3 transactions based on their individuality. Despite being a small ecosystem at present, it is secure and has the potential to reach new heights with the help of user participation and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the SelfKey DAO develops, users will derive more benefits from it. Ultimately, it is user contribution that will enable SelfKey to achieve its long-term goals.</p>

Striking a balance between safeguarding market participants’ interests and encouraging innovation will be crucial for fostering wider adoption and long-term growth in South Korea’s crypto&nbsp;sector.  As the digital currency landscape in South Korea continues to develop, open communication and collaboration between regulators, businesses, and users will be essential for cultivating a thriving and secure crypto ecosystem.  <p>The recent passing of the cryptocurrency bill by South Korea’s National Assembly represents a significant step towards regulating the country’s largely unregulated crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>Now the bill will move to the Legislation and Judiciary Committee must for approval.

Just this week, South Korean authorities indicted Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with nine others for illegal&nbsp;trading.</p><p>Now with the bill’s provisions, the authorities aim to create a safer and more secure trading environment for investors while also preventing money laundering and other illicit activities that may have been taking place in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>One notable provision in the bill is the mandate for crypto service providers to maintain user assets and deposits separately from their own assets, have insurance, hold reserves for contingencies such as system failures or hacks, and record all transactions.</p><blockquote>Any co-mingling of users’ funds with providers’ funds is discouraged by the&nbsp;bill.</blockquote><p>Businesses and individuals participating in the sector will further be required to self-report irregularities to maintain compliance.</p> Serious Consequences of Non-compliance <p>The <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/australias-latest-crypto-bill-explained">crypto bill</a> includes severe consequences for failing to comply with necessary disclosures, engaging in price manipulation, or promoting crypto assets falsely, which is deemed&nbsp;illegal.</p><p>If found guilty, offenders face up to a year in prison or fines up to five times the amount of illegally earned profits. The penalties escalate to five years to life imprisonment for causing losses of over 5 billion Korean won (around US$3.73 million) to consumers.</p> The Impact on Crypto Users &amp; Ecosystem <p>The impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem will be multifaceted. On the one hand, increased regulation will provide a clearer framework for users and businesses to operate within, instilling confidence and trust in the industry. On the other hand, critics argue that such regulations may stifle innovation and growth, potentially hindering the sector’s progress.</p><p>Moreover, compliance with the new regulations may prove challenging for some crypto businesses, potentially leading to market consolidation as smaller entities struggle to adapt. This, in turn, may alter the competitive landscape and affect the diversity of offerings available to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Ultimately, the effectiveness of these regulations in preventing illicit activities and safeguarding investors’ interests remains to be seen. As South Korea’s crypto market evolves, it is essential for regulators, businesses, and users to work collaboratively in order to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring a secure, transparent, and stable digital currency ecosystem.</p> Final Note <p>As South Korea’s National Assembly approves the first phase of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">cryptocurrency regulations</a>, the country’s crypto ecosystem is entering a critical transition. These initial regulations allow for better oversight of digital asset businesses and require service providers to report suspicious activities. It’s important for crypto users and businesses to understand and follow these new rules to avoid legal&nbsp;issues.</p><p>While there are concerns about the impact of these regulations on the industry, this first phase also offers more certainty and protection for investors. Finding the right balance between protecting the interests of market participants and encouraging innovation will be crucial for broader adoption and long-term growth in the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of this initial phase of regulations remains to be seen, given the fast-paced and ever-changing nature of the cryptocurrency market. As South Korea’s digital currency landscape evolves and more regulatory phases are introduced, open communication between regulators, businesses, and users will be essential for a thriving and secure crypto ecosystem.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  Using a domain as your handle helps with account identity, verification, and portability. Here's how to set your domain as your handle.

The official account for the AT Protocol with a custom domain.
 What’s a custom domain? 
<p>A custom domain is a unique name that identifies a website on the internet. For example, Bluesky’s domain is <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code>.</p>
<p>Every device that connects to the internet has a unique IP address that identifies it. But it’s much easier to remember <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code> instead of a series of numbers. The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like a phonebook for the internet and points a domain like <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code> to its IP address, so we don’t have to remember the numbers ourselves.</p>
<p>Domains can be further divided into subdomains. For example, if your domain was <code>example.com</code> but you had a blog hosted at <code>blog.example.com</code>, then <code>blog</code> is the subdomain.</p>
 Why does Bluesky use domains as handles, and why would I want to use a domain as my handle? 
<p>Technically, it’s the AT Protocol that lets you use domains as handles. Bluesky is a client application built on top of the protocol, so it will also use domains as handles.</p>
<p>The AT Protocol was designed to use domains for multiple reasons:</p>
 
 
<p>Identity: Bluesky is just one application built on top of the AT Protocol. Let’s say you set your handle to <code>example.com</code> on Bluesky. You’ll be able to use that same handle across all applications built on the AT Protocol (and there’s a growing number!). Now, you no longer have to list five different usernames based on what was available at the time you signed up for an app — just use your domain!</p>
 
 
<p>Verification: Websites have a long history of verification already, so using domains borrows their authority. For example, a newsroom like NPR could set their handle to be <code>@npr.org</code>. Then, any journalists that NPR wants to verify could use subdomains to set their handles to be <code>@name.npr.org</code>. Brand accounts could set their handle to be their domain as well, which companies like Vercel and Tailscale have already done.</p>

 
 
<p>Portability: Maybe you want to switch to a different server. Then, there’s no need to switch your handle from something server-specific if you’re using your domain as your handle.</p>
 
 
<p>Read our previously published blog post on domain names as handles <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">here</a> for more information.</p>
 I’m convinced! How do I acquire a custom domain? 
<p>If you don’t have a custom domain already, you can purchase one from any ICANN-accredited domain registrar or reseller. Note that this isn’t required to join Bluesky; you could use our server’s off-the-shelf naming (in the format of <code>@name.bsky.social</code>) if you prefer.</p>
<p>You can use services like Namecheap or Google Domains to register your domain of choice. Domains are unique, so you must choose one that hasn’t already been registered by someone else. During registration, you’ll likely pay an annual fee and provide personal information.</p>
<p>Your personal information is used to populate the WHOIS directory, which is a searchable database that holds information on domain ownership. You might prefer to keep your information private for various reasons — in that case, most domain registrars offer WHOIS privacy protection as a service.</p>
 How do I set this custom domain as my handle? 
<p>Let’s use the Bluesky team’s <code>@atproto.com</code> account as an example. Note that the account uses the handle <code>@atproto.com</code>, which verifies its identity because it owns the website <a href="https://atproto.com/">atproto.com</a>.
</p>
<p>Note: if you change your default Bluesky username (with the <code>.bsky.social</code> suffix) to a custom domain, your old username will be available for someone else to use. However, any tags or mentions with your old handle will still point to your account.</p>
<p>The screenshots below will show you how to set your custom domain as your handle in your mobile app, but similar steps apply to the desktop version.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the left side menu by clicking your profile picture thumbnail. Click “Settings” and scroll down to the “Advanced” section. Click “Change my handle.”</p>
  
 
 
<p>On the “Change my handle” screen, click “I have my own domain.”</p>
  
 
 
<p>Now, you’ll have a screen that looks like this. This includes information that you will need to add to your domain registrar.</p>
  
 
 
<p>Navigate back to your domain registrar, which is the company you bought your domain from (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.). The specific steps here depend on which company you used, but you’ll want to navigate to DNS management for your domain. This might be under an “Advanced DNS” tab.</p>
 
 
<p>Advanced: If you're using a hosting company other than the registrar, for example Cloudflare, navigate there to add your TXT record, not your original registrar.</p>
  
 
 
<p>We want to add a TXT (text) record to your domain. Step 3 above contains all of the information you’ll need to add to your domain. The DID value is public and not sensitive information. (Read more about DIDs <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/did-plc">here</a>.)</p>
 
 Set the domain: <code>_atproto</code> 
 Set the type: TXT 
 Set the value field (also sometimes called “data”), except use your own DID value: <code>did=did:plc:[your value here]</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After you add the TXT record, wait a couple of minutes for the change to propagate across the internet. Then, just click “Verify DNS Record.” You’re done! Check your Bluesky profile to see if it has updated. Remember, DNS propagation might take some time.</p>
 
 
<p>Congratulations, you have a custom domain as your handle now!</p>

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, most individuals operate in a digital environment where transactions and communication are made online. As a result, digital identity verification has become a very important aspect of online security and compliance.</p>
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is one of the most widely used methods for verifying the identities of users and clients. While KYC has been effective in assuring security and regulatory compliance, it has some significant drawbacks. KYC can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult for users, potentially resulting in losing customers and missing business opportunities.</p>
<p>SelfKey addresses this issue by proposing a potential solution to these issues with SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is a revolutionary approach to identity verification that could be faster, more secure, and less costly than traditional KYC methods. It uses the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts to potentially offer a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process. This can possibly eliminate many of the issues associated with traditional KYC methods.</p>

 KYC: Potential Issues to Consider 
<p>Even though KYC has become a commonly used procedure in many industries, it has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Here as some examples:</p>
 
 The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for KYC purposes comes with legal responsibilities and storage costs, which can take a toll on companies.&nbsp; 
 Users have a tendency to dislike KYC checks, finding them intrusive and time-consuming. This can lead to lower conversion rates and a negative first impression for potential customers.&nbsp; 
 Implementing KYC can be a difficult and expensive process, further adding to its disadvantages.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Perhaps the time to explore alternative ways of verifying customer identities has come. With SelfKey iD, you can explore methods that are less tedious for all parties involved.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD 
<p>As stated above, KYC processes can be inconvenient for both companies and customers alike. However, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Ai-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> method along with SelfKey iD can potentially become a better alternative to KYC.</p>
<p>Here are some of SelfKey.iD’s benefits:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The overall process is easier and less costly, making it more accessible for users.&nbsp; 
 The onboarding process is quick. 
 Ongoing monitoring makes sure that customer data remains accurate. 
 Existing KYC checks are reused, thus the need to collect and store PII repeatedly is no longer an issue. 
 Costs for companies are reduced, but also improves customer privacy and security. 
 It provides powerful compliance tools, ensuring that companies remain in compliance with regulations and laws.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can streamline their KYC processes, reducing costs, enhancing customer privacy, and improving compliance. Ultimately, this results in a better experience for customers and a more efficient and secure system for companies.</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss some of SelfKey iDs benefits more in depth.</p>
 High-Level Flow 
<p>SelfKey iD enables zero-knowledge interactions between individuals, making sure that users' data is kept private and secure. With SelfKey iD, the user's data does not reach your server. This adds to user privacy and prevents potential data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the onboarding process is quick and simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user with a SelfKey iD visits your server, they are checked to determine if they match your filter. If they do, they can be onboarded instantly, simplifying the process and reducing the time and resources required.</p>
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can provide a secure and efficient onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security. The zero-knowledge interactions and instant onboarding features make it a better alternative to traditional KYC processes.</p>
 Quick Relying Party Onboarding 
<p>To streamline the onboarding process, the following steps are required:</p>
 
 Sign up at SelfKey iD to create your user filters. 
 Add these filters to your smart contracts. 
 When a user attempts to run your smart contract function, the system will check if they have a SelfKey iD NFT. If they do not have one, they will be prompted to get one. 
 If the issuer has a SelfKey iD NFT, they will then be able to verify whether the user matches the filter that you have set for the transaction. If they do, the user will be granted access to your server. If not, the user will be denied access. 
 
<p>Following these steps, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system ensures that only authorized users are given access to the company's services. This reduces the risk of relying parties allowing access to unauthorized individuals to their services.</p>
 The Issuance: SelfKey iD NFT User Flow 
<p>The issuance process for SelfKey iD is outlined below:</p>
 
 The user visits your project and is redirected to SelfKey iD, in case they do not already have one. 
 The user pays for the verification check. 
 The user goes through the verification process, and the issuer stores their data. Ongoing monitoring of the account begins. 
 If the user passes the checks, the issuer releases a credential that verifies the user's humanity, uniqueness in the database, and verified data. 
 The user then mints their own SelfKey iD NFT. 
 
<p>By following these steps, users can obtain a SelfKey iD NFT that verifies their identity and potentially provides access to various projects that use the SelfKey iD platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verification process ensures that only authorized users are granted access, providing enhanced security and privacy for both users and companies.</p>
<p>Enhanced security offers several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Anti-bot security. This measure prevents automated attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious or malicious bot traffic. 
 Fraud protection. Bots are often used for fraudulent activities like creating fake accounts or generating false clicks to generate revenue. Implementing anti-bot security measures helps to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities, keeping the business and customers safe. 
 Improved user experience. Bots can significantly hinder the user experience by slowing down websites or making it difficult for users to access information. Anti-bot security measures ensure that legitimate users can access the website or service without interruptions or delays. 
 
 The Verification: SelfKey iD User Onboarding 
<p>The onboarding process for SelfKey.iD is as follows:</p>
 
 A user with a SelfKey iD visits your project. 
 You request that the SelfKey iD issuer checks the user's information. 
 The issuer verifies whether the user's data matches your filters. 
 The issuer sends a signed message confirming the user's status.&nbsp; 
 If the user is verified, they can be onboarded, and the signed message can be used to authorize transactions. 
 The relying party (issuer) is billed for the verification check. 
 
<p>Through this process, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding method that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system makes sure that only authorized users are granted access to the company's services. The use of a signed message adds an extra layer of security, offering further assurance that the user's data has been verified by the relying party.</p>
 Reusable KYC and SelfKey iD 
<p>The benefits of using reusable KYC with SelfKey iD are as follows:</p>
 
 Your project subscribes to SelfKey iD. 
 Your project can be featured on the SelfKey iD website. 
 A user with a SelfKey iD NFT visits the SelfKey iD website. 
 The user scrolls through the list of projects that support SelfKey iD. 
 The user can potentially choose your project from the list. 
 The user quickly onboards to your project using their existing SelfKey iD NFT. 
 Your project profits from the seamless onboarding experience. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's reusable KYC system could provide companies with a more streamlined onboarding experience for users. Users can easily access multiple projects without having to go through the time-consuming and costly process of verifying their identity each time.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies benefit from increased user adoption and loyalty, as the reusable KYC system encourages users to choose projects that support SelfKey iD. Overall, this system offers a win-win situation for both companies and users alike.</p>
 SelfKey iD New Project Setup 
<p>Setting up a new project with SelfKey iD is quite easy. Below, we will detail a few steps which you need to consider.</p>
 The project onboarding process is as follows:&nbsp; 
 
 Go to the SelfKey iD website. 
 Register for a new account. 
 Add your company privacy policy to your account. 
 Choose a subscription pack that suits your needs. 
 Set up filters to verify your users' identity. 
 Your project is now ready to implement the filters into your system. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's easy-to-use platform could offer companies a quick and efficient way to set up their project's identity verification process. The platform provides a range of subscription plans to choose from, depending on your business's specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ability to customize filters for your users, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, enhancing security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, SelfKey iD's new project setup process offers a simple and effective solution for individuals looking to integrate identity verification into their systems</p>
 The Library Implementation 
<p>To implement SelfKey iD into your project's system, follow these simple steps:</p>
 
 Implement the backend library onto your server. 
 Prepare the front-end to handle calls for authorization. 
 Implement the SelfKey iD smart contract into your own smart contract. 
 Your project is now ready to onboard users. 
 
<p>By following these steps, you can integrate SelfKey iD into your project's system and take advantage of its powerful identity verification capabilities. With the backend library in place, your server will be able to communicate with SelfKey iD to authorize user access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By integrating the smart contract into your own contract, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, boosting security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD's library implementation process offers a robust solution for businesses looking to enhance their identity verification capabilities.</p>
 How the Profile Builder Functions: 
<p>SelfKey iD's Profile Builder is a tool that allows you to create customizable filters for your project. These filters could be used to sort and manage users based on specific criteria.</p>
<p>The Profile Builder allows you to create multiple filters, which can be implemented separately on your project. This means that you can have different filters applied to different sections of your app or website, depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 You could create a filter that accepts citizens of Country A for one section of your app, but another filter for the same project that excludes citizens of Country A from another section.&nbsp; 
 This level of detailed filtering allows you to match regulatory requirements while also boosting the benefits of your app. 
 
<p>To set up the Profile Builder, you would first define the standards you want to filter by, such as citizenship, age, or profession. You can then apply rules and conditions to each filter to create a customized sorting system.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Profile Builder in SelfKey iD could provide a flexible and powerful tool for managing user data and creating a tailored experience for your app's users.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey aims to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the needs of both businesses and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of SelfKey iD could include efficient, secure, and cost-effective KYC checks, streamlined onboarding, and better conversion rates. Additionally, SelfKey iD's approach to privacy ensures legal compliance and reduces costs associated with PII storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, with a user-friendly one-time KYC process and access to multiple projects on the website, SelfKey iD offers convenience and ease of use for users. SelfKey iD's project features and powerful user filtering tools could enable businesses to match rules and increase profitability.&nbsp;</p>

 Summary 
<p>Traditional domain names have been in use for decades and are widely recognized. However, they come with certain limitations due to their centralized nature. Organizations that registered these domains are usually the ones who own them, which means that individuals have no control over them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized alternative to traditional domain names that offers additional functionalities. It represents a significant change in the way we think about and use domain names on the internet. ENS provides users with more control over their domain names, making it a powerful tool for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>Given these options, SelfKey aims to provide subdomains with self-sovereign identity in mind. With SelfKey's ENS subdomains, individuals may enjoy all the benefits of owning a regular ENS domain on the Ethereum Mainnet without the recurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering greater control and flexibility, SelfKey’s ENS subdomains may enable users to better manage their digital identities and online presence. And this may make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a presence on the internet.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the benefits of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) over DNS (Domain Name System), as well as the advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomains.&nbsp;</p>

 The Basics of DNS 
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) is a traditional system that facilitates the translation of human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address, which represents a unique numerical identifier.</p>
<p>This process is necessary because while people can easily remember and recognize domain names, computers and other devices require IP addresses to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure and is utilized in a variety of applications, including website hosting, email communication, online gaming, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without DNS, users would have to memorize the IP addresses of every website they wish to visit, which would be highly impractical and inconvenient.</p>
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 A brief description 
<p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/what-is-ens">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names, similar to how traditional DNS works, but with added features and benefits.</p>
<p>With ENS, users can register domain names in the form of "name.eth" instead of the traditional "www.example.com" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that these domain names are unique, one can use them to identify various Ethereum-based resources, such as wallets, contracts, and decentralized applications.</p>
 ENS and individuals 
<p>One of the main advantages of ENS is that it is decentralized. This means that no single entity or authority owns or controls it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Even more, resistance to censorship is boosted and individuals are allowed to have more control over their online identities and assets by being decentralized.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it is interoperable, meaning it can be used across different applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help create a more seamless and integrated user experience.</p>
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
<p>Both ENS and DNS are used for assigning user-friendly names to machine-readable addresses on the internet. However, there are several key differences between them, namely:</p>
 
 Centralization 
 Ownership 
 Security 
 Functionality 
 
<p>Below, we will discuss these important aspects more in depth.</p>
 Centralization 
<p>The traditional DNS system is centralized, with domain names being registered and managed by a single authority, ICANN. On the other hand, ENS is a decentralized system that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As a decentralized system, ENS is not controlled by a single entity, which gives individuals the freedom to manage their very own domain. This liberty allows users to express themselves and utilize their domains to their personal needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENS users may stand out more if they are not attached to a centralized giant. And this, in turn, may give them the opportunity to attract and engage with other individuals. All in all, having the freedom to manage their own domain in the online world comes with a large number of chances for users to show off their services or skills.</p>
 Ownership 
<p>Ownership is another key difference between ENS and traditional DNS. With traditional DNS, the organization that register domain names typically own them. ENS allows individuals to own their domain names directly, without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that individuals can have complete control over their domain names, which can be particularly useful for businesses and individuals who value their online presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owning an ENS domain that matches their business or brand name may help individuals build brand recognition and increase trust among customers.</p>
 Security 
<p>Security is another major advantage of ENS over traditional DNS. Most centralized systems have weak security, which often leads to data breaches. Those whose data was compromised might suffer dire consequences as a result of this.&nbsp;Being a centralized system, DNS might be quite risky in this sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ENS's decentralized architecture makes it highly effective in preventing security threats. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same cryptographic standards as Ethereum, providing an additional layer of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature makes it very difficult for bad players to compromise the system or steal user data. It may also make the systems more resilient to hacking or domain hijacking. As a result, ENS offers a much higher level of security.</p>
 Functionality 
<p>ENS provides unique functionality compared to traditional DNS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such feature is the ability to link multiple addresses, including cryptocurrency wallets, to a single domain name. This capability makes identity management more simple for users and it enables seamless interaction with decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it allows users to build their online identity and streamline their transactions. On the opposite side, traditional DNS only offers basic domain name resolution. This added functionality is another reason why ENS is becoming a more and more popular choice for those seeking a more flexible and user-friendly domain name resolution system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, ENS and traditional DNS serve the same purpose, but they differ significantly in terms of centralization, ownership, security, and functionality. And all of these aspects are highly important to take into account as society becomes more digitized.</p>
<p>With these possibilities in mind, SelfKey is aiming to create a subdomain that offers the same benefits as the current ENS, along with additional features that may enhance accessibility for individuals.</p>
 SelfKey ENS subdomain: Definition and Benefits 
<p>When developing new technologies, SelfKey prioritizes the concept of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity (SSID)</a>, and the SelfKey ENS subdomain is a prime example of this approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the creation of a subdomain, SelfKey is aiming to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. This technology is centered on empowering users and it may provide them with greater control over their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey’s goal is to bring a positive change to the way people operate in the digital world. To make it more secure and accessible for everyone.</p>
 What is SelfKey ENS subdomain 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is an innovative subdomain that aims to provide a more accessible and user-friendly domain name resolution system. Given this, users might not have to pay recurring fees for their subdomain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is likely to be a subdomain of key.eth. This means that users may register their preferred subdomain by adding their name or any other word of their choosing, such as yourname.key.eth. This naming convention is similar to email addresses. And, by providing an easier way to identify and interact with Ethereum addresses, it may bring self-sovereign identity closer to mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as DNS made the internet more accessible to the masses by providing a simpler way to access websites than using IP addresses, key.eth may do the same for Ethereum addresses. It replaces long, complex addresses with a human-readable format that is easy to remember and share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may improve the ease of use of the blockchain and help resolve one of the challenges to widespread adoption. Because of this, key.eth may be a step towards a more user-friendly and accessible blockchain ecosystem.</p>
 What are the benefits of SelfKey ENS 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is designed to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. By putting user accesibility first, SelfKey is aiming to create a more inclusive domain name resolution system that builds on the strengths of ENS while adding to its advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach might make SelfKey ENS subdomain a compelling choice for anyone who values privacy and security, and wants a more user-friendly way to manage their digital identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain provides several benefits to its users:</p>
 
 One of the primary advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that every verified SelfKey iD holder may receive a free key.eth subdomain on the Ethereum Mainnet that is longer than seven characters. This free subdomain may allow users to experiment with SelfKey ENS subdomain and explore its features without having to make extra financial commitment. 
 Once users have their free subdomain, they may buy more subdomains using any of the supported tokens. Users may utilize these subdomains for various purposes, such as getting payments or creating aliases for use in games. Users may buy as many subdomains as they like and use them to streamline their online activities. 
 Another significant benefit of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that users may sell their subdomains.&nbsp; Any marketplace that supports ENS trading, such as OpenSea, is a good place to start. This feature may offer users the freedom to experiment with different subdomains. And, if they decide to change their online identity or activities, they may sell them. 
 
<p>Overall, SelfKey ENS subdomain may provide great benefits to its users. It may enable individuals to not only manage and own their domains, but also boost their visibility online. These features might make SelfKey ENS an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their online identity and activities.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that people have become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy and ownership of personal data. However, the traditional centralized systems we rely on for managing our digital assets and domains may compromise these rights. This is where the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in as part of an ideal decentralized future.</p>
<p>ENS allows individuals to own and manage their own domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, which is decentralized and secure. This means that no central authority has control over the domain name. A feature which gives individuals complete ownership and control over their online identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS may be one such solution that offers individuals the opportunity to manage and own their own domain names without the limitations of traditional domain names. This may not only give users more control over their online presence but also provide greater privacy and security.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are becoming more and more popular due to the many benefits they offer. These include creating a safe environment for individuals to interact with one another. as well as equality and transparency among its members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the potential of DAOs, however, many struggle with a lack of user participation. Without active engagement from its members, decision-making and growth can be delayed, and the DAO's decentralized structure can decline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> is addressing this issue by developing an engagement system that aims to keep its members active and involved. By motivating participants to regularly engage within the DAO, the DAO itself will become more active and successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the SelfKey DAO engagement system, its benefits, and how members can participate in the DAO in order to mint tokens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the SelfKey DAO Incentive System is a powerful asset for creating a strong, joint community of participants who are committed to the success of the DAO. The long-term goal of the DAO is to be able to build a space for innovation and creativity, while also driving growth and adoption of its services.</p>
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>To fully benefit from the platform's incentive system, users need to participate actively in the DAO's general governance and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are specific tasks which participants of a DAO can do in order to mint work tokens and help maintain the DAO.</p>
 How to keep the SelfKey DAO active and mint work tokens 
<p>Member engagement is a key necessity in order to benefit from an active platform. Aside from contributing to the overall well functioning of the SelfKey DAO, active members have the opportunity to mint work tokens by completing certain tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, there are some essential activities that participants can perform to help SelfKey DAO in achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
 
 Invite Friends. 
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system. 
 Engage with the official Selfkey SM posts. 
 Be active in the official discord channel. 
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system. 
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants. 
 Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions. 
 
 Invite Friends 
<p>Inviting friends to join SelfKey DAO can increase the membership and participation of the platform. This could offer more resources for the system, as friends could potentially bring in new skills and connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If more people join SelfKey DAO, the network security of the SelfKey ecosystem can grow. The benefit of this is that it can potentially result in greater visibility, influence, and impact within the larger community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, a constant flow of new participants to the DAO can be a valuable strategy for expanding and strengthening it. It can increase its resources and capabilities, and build a more powerful sense of community and collaboration among its members.</p>
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system 
<p>It’s highly important for members to actively post SM messages generated by the system in order to boost the visibility of SelfKey DAO and its activities. This way, participants can help expand the SelfKey network by bringing awareness to the platform and its goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using system-generated Social Media messages, SelfKey DAO can make sure that its content is consistent and on-brand. This can help create credibility and build trust among the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another benefit of SM messages generated by the system is that it can be more efficient than manually creating and posting each message. This can save time and resources, allowing members of the DAO to focus on other important activities.</p>
 Engage with official Selfkey SM posts 
<p>Engaging with official SelfKey SM posts could help members stay informed with the latest official news and connect with others participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows members to make informed decisions, increase their visibility, and potentially attract new business opportunities. Participants can also give constructive feedback, which can lead to platform upgrades that could benefit the entire community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, by engaging with official SelfKey SM posts, active members can gain access to exclusive content or benefits that are not available anywhere else.</p>
 Be active in the official Discord channel 
<p>The SelfKey Discord channel is a community hub where users can connect with other members of the SelfKey community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants who stay active in the channel can engage with other individuals, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. Even more, active members can quickly get answers to their questions and find solutions to almost any problems they may encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ft2U7DKg4X">official discord channel</a> is often the place where SelfKey DAO announces and hosts various events and activities. Therefore, keeping up with the channel and actively participating in discussions, members can stay up-to-date with important news and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By showing drive and creativity, active members can help develop new ideas and solutions that will help the DAO grow. This can be anything from suggesting new features for the DAO's platform to proposing fresh methods for community governance.</p>
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system 
<p>By certifying that members have a deep-rooted interest in keeping their own credentials safe, the overall security of the system can be enhanced. This can also minimize the risk of credentials being lost or stolen, as well as help keep participants safe from identity theft or other security breaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another advantage of staking is that it can increase the credibility of the system by motivating participants to make sure that their credentials are valid and up-to-date. This way, errors or mistakes in the data can be prevented, reducing delays or issues when using the platform.</p>
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants 
<p>One of the key benefits of offering a grant within SelfKey DAO is that members can mint tokens for their contributions to building the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helping with developer and designer tickets can improve the overall quality of the platform. By addressing technical issues and making improvements to the design, the platform can become more user-friendly, efficient, and effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can aid in attracting new users and retaining existing ones, as well as drive the growth of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way that members can contribute to the DAO is by delivering on development, design, and QA bounties based on grants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bounties encourage members to tackle specific tasks that have to do with the development, design, and testing of the DAO's software. Participants can work together or individually to deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of the DAO and its community.</p>
 The Benefits and Uses of Work Tokens 
<p>As stated previously, SelfKey DAO facilitates benefits for active members, such as being able to mint tokens. We’ve elaborated on the activities active members can perform. Now, let us focus more thoroughly on how participants can make use of the work tokens they mint.</p>
 Work tokens can be exchanged for NFT packs 
<p>SelfKey’s NFTs are called Normies, and they can be customizable to fit the user’s personal preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some advantages Normies bring to members:</p>
 
 they allow users to express their unique creativity and personality by creating one-of-a-kind digital assets.&nbsp; 
 they can increase the originality of the asset, as it becomes more exclusive and personalized.&nbsp; 
 they enable members to have greater control over their digital assets. 
 they allow members to modify or add additional content to their NFT. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT packs that members can obtain by exchanging work tokens can be used in several ways.</p>
 
 To customize Normies around a specific theme or concept, such as a particular genre or event, such as: fandoms, movies, games, music, etc. 
 To customize Normies by choosing the background, outfits, hair styles, skin color and texture, or additional details. 
 To create different levels of rarity among the NFTs contained within them. For example, a pack could contain one or more ultra-rare, limited-edition wearables. 
 To build a collection of related or complementary NFTs. This can motivate members to collect multiple packs in order to complete the entire set. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, SelfKey’s NFT packs can include unlockable content, such as additional media or exclusive access to events.</p>
 Work tokens can be used to participate in DAO Governance 
<p>DAO governance is ideal for members because:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Decisions are made through a decentralized voting system that takes every participant’s opinion into consideration. 
 It represents a more fair and open method of organization that aims to benefit every active member. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>Centralized systems are based on pyramid structures, where the majority have to follow the rules and authority of the few. Typically, in this kind of structure, individuals have no way of voicing their needs, let alone have them met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs, on the other hand, can be shaped by the participants’ direct involvement. This is why it is important to keep DAOs active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO is working on developing the most efficient incentive system to make sure that active members are constantly involved with the development of the DAO. It’s likely to become the ideal space in which individuals can safely engage and have their needs heard and met.&nbsp;</p>

 Online Safety 
 Digital revolution: both a blessing and a curse 
<p>In the past several decades, mankind has shown magnificent progress in computer science. So much so that society quickly became accustomed to using Information and Communication Technologies on a daily basis. Whether it is for recreational purposes, communication, work or education, mundane tasks are made significantly easier with the help of cutting-edge technology and wireless systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of performing convenient assignments, such as reading, generating, integrating, and theorizing information. However, it is also heading dangerously fast towards mimicking a trait which, up until now, has been uniquely human: identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is leaked, AI can potentially make use of that information to steal or forge human identities. Thankfully, the future will also bring ways to prevent that. A Self-Sovereign Identity solution is being developed to protect our data from being stolen and sold.</p>
 How safe is it really out there? 
<p>Using technology and having a digital presence has become so common nowadays that many people don’t think twice about the security of their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although they are within the safety of their homes, their data is still potentially visible to millions of users online. Among those millions, there are many individuals with bad intentions, who look for ways to use other people’s private data for their own personal benefit.</p>
<p>More often than not, however, it is entities that individuals are supposed to trust who end up selling or divulging their personal information to other parties. And those parties, whether willingly or not, will put that personal information at risk of being unlawfully used by bad players.</p>
<p>At the moment, unfortunately, people have come to depend on centralized systems in order to benefit from online services to perform their daily tasks. Without those online services, it would be impossible for individuals to function in the present day society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more of an obligation rather than a choice,and it has become so normal that we simply go with the flow. Otherwise, we will not be able to keep up with the fast-paced changes in the way we work, study, and communicate.</p>
 Our digital identities 
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) belonging to individuals, firms or organizations is being stored online in the form of digital data. This collection of digital data is then used to build our digital identity.</p>
<p>A digital identity is used to facilitate access to services that make it easy for computers to efficiently mediate transactions between two or more individuals. The web provides us with a quick way of performing these transactions. However, it is not the safest place to store our private information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> happen on a daily basis without our knowledge. Through data breaches, important and valuable information can be stolen and sold, including our very own digital identities.</p>
<p>Ideally, individuals should be able to make use of the advanced, modern day technology without the risk of their private data ending up in the wrong hands. In order for that to happen, individuals need to have more control over how their information is stored and who has access to view or share it, at all times.</p>
 The illusion of choice 
<p>Nowadays, control seems less impactful on our lives, because the deception of freedom is given to us through choices. However, when access to necessary modern applications is being restricted unless personal data is consensually shared, choice becomes an illusion.</p>
<p>With the choice to opt in being enforced, people have grown used to accepting the privacy policies of applications without a second thought. These policies, that we barely even bother to read, do mention how data is shared with third parties. However, we cannot do anything but blindly trust that service providers will not abuse or mishandle our data.</p>
<p>At the moment there is only the illusion of consent, of trust, all in the detriment of the individual. Because of this deceitful way of forcing users to consent to their data being used, trust between individuals is becoming more and more difficult to establish.</p>
<p>SSID aims to dispel these illusions and bring authentic consent and trust to the mainstream.</p>
 Seeking safety in a digital world 
<p>Sadly, Big Tech often profits off of individuals at the expense of the latter’s safety, which may lead up to identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many users are unaware of the unlawful incidents happening underneath the brightly colored backgrounds of websites and applications as they perform their daily online tasks. Living under the impression that, as long as there is no malware alert on their devices, they have nothing to be concerned about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alarming truth, however, is that security violations occur on a daily basis. These cumulative cyber attacks can potentially cause millions of dollars in damages to the individuals whose data was involved.</p>
 How will Self Sovereign Identity improve our online activities? 
<p>Fortunately, a solution to the above-mentioned risks is currently being developed by SelfKey. It will be the sword and shield for individuals to function and perform transactions in the safest way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self sovereign identity not only gives back the freedom of choice, but it also prevents this kind of disaster from happening. SSID users give access only to individuals that they wish to engage with. During this interaction, only a very limited amount of information is shared.</p>
<p>Therefore, sensitive, protected and important data is less likely to be sold to or shared with harmful individuals and organizations. Self sovereign identity was conceived to prevent data leakage in this sense. It gives users the power not only to manage and control, but also to protect what they deem valuable.&nbsp;</p>
 Self Sovereign Identity 
 A brief introduction 
<p>Self sovereign identity (SSID) is a new way of managing digital identities, which aims to put individuals in control of how their accounts and private information are managed. With SSID, individuals have full ownership over their personal data. They no longer need to rely on centralized systems that might share their data with unknown parties for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can store their private information into their devices and present it for validation when it is specifically needed. This way, the risk of having their data compromised is considerably reduced. Individuals are in complete control over how their information is used and stored, at all times.</p>
 How self sovereign identity is currently being implemented 
<p>Once Self Sovereign Identity users store their private data on their devices, they can quickly take the opportunity to interact with trusted partners. In order to benefit from the services offered by these trusted partners, users need to accept the processing of their information by the partners. This is declared by the relying party once the user attempts to onboard into their services.</p>
 Issues with the current implementation of Self Sovereign Identity 
 Adoption and Convenience 
<p>At the moment, SSID users must store their data on their private device instead of the traditional central database. This method allows the users to have full control of their personal data. On the down side, the flow by which users interact with the system is less convenient than centralized alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storing data on one private device makes it difficult for it to be accessed by the user’s other devices. Individuals have to manually introduce their information into devices they want to use, which can become time consuming and frustrating.</p>
 Scalability 
<p>Currently, users can only exercise their self sovereign rights with partners within the SSID environment. More so, individuals need to trust that the parties they choose to interact&nbsp; with will handle their personal data with respect to their privacy and store it securely.</p>
 How can the current Self Sovereign Identity implementation be improved and scaled? 
 
 Should we use Centralized Systems for convenience? 
<p>Centrally controlled systems are databases in which an individual’s digital identity is stored in one or more servers belonging to a centralized entity. Once personal data is stored in this type of server, an individual has no way of knowing who has access to it, who it is shared with, or where it ends up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is being shared with unknown, third parties, there is a high risk of unintentional information disclosure. This can lead to dire consequences like identity theft or secret information being disclosed to the public, stolen or sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While centralized systems are not necessarily malicious, their security is weak, which leads to data leakage. With AI progressing alarmingly fast, this is a particularly serious concern. As a conclusion, centralized systems can not be used to improve the adoption and scalability of SSID solutions.</p>
 Are Decentralized Systems a better option? 
<p>On the polar opposite of centralized systems are decentralized systems. This type of system stores and verifies information in multiple computers that work together as nodes in a network, popularly known as a blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By transferring the control from a centralized entity to a dispersed group, decentralized systems aim to reach a level of fairness among its users, without one individual having authority over the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way data is stored in a decentralized system makes it very difficult for malicious parties to manipulate it, because it is secured by the blockchain. A decentralized system is perfect for storing public and openly-accessible data, such as a record of transactions.</p>
<p>However, storing personally identifiable information (PII) in a decentralized system is highly unadvised, even if it is encrypted. PII can be anything from full name, phone number, full date of birth, full address, or credit card information.</p>
<p>Once data is made public, it can not be erased or changed, and it is openly accessible to anyone. Therefore, decentralized systems alone are not ideal for storing private information, due to inevitable and permanent loss of privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are part of the solution, though, and we will discuss in the following sections.</p>
 Is there a solution to this dilemma, then? 
<p>At the moment, SelfKey is actively working on and is committed to delivering an ideal solution to increase the adoption of SSID, using cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next segments we will thoroughly discuss SelfKey’s proposed solution, which pertains to:</p>
 
 The Trust Triangle 
 The Three Pillars of self sovereign identity 
 Zero Knowledge Proofs 
 
 The Trust Triangle 
<p>Presently, we are accustomed to the traditional “peer-to-peer” interactions between identity owners and verifiers. To better facilitate the goals of SSI, a three-party system is proposed. In this triangle, two individuals that want to interact securely can rely on a third party to issue and to confirm the authenticity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
 For example: 
 
 We have individual A and individual B, two entities who are about to make an exchange. B has obtained their verifiable credentials (personal data that can be checked for validity) from C, a third, neutral party. C is legally permitted to vouch for B’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 B wants to make a purchase with A, but the services provided by A are age-restricted. Therefore, A must check with C if B legally qualifies to access that kind of service.&nbsp; 
 In this case, there is only one specific inquiry that must be clarified: whether B is a legal adult. That is the only information that C will validate with A. 
 A does not have access to extra information that would otherwise be physically printed on an ID or a passport. This information can be name, full address, full date of birth, social security number, photos, etc. Basically, any identifier that B does not want to share with A or to divulge to the public. 
 This also eliminates the risk of A, if potentially ill-intended, retaining private information from B. There is no visible data for A to read and memorize. There is only C’s confirmation that B qualifies (or not) to purchase a service from A, without giving out specific details. 
 
<p>This applies to any kind of identifier which is needed to validate interactions between persons or companies. The risk of personal data being visible to individuals outside of the trust triangle is eliminated this way. And even within the trust triangle, only the minimum, relevant information will be shown or confirmed.</p>
 Agents of The Trust Triangle 
<p>The issuer is the entity that releases verifiable credentials after verifying the claims given by the holder.&nbsp;</p>
 
 It is typically an institution, an organization or an individual who possesses the legal authority to verify and to vouch for the holder’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 Examples of issuers are governmental institutions; universities, departments, companies, agencies, authorities, training institutions, etc.&nbsp; 
 The issuer is a neutral party whose role is only to validate a claim in a holder-verifier transaction. 
 
<p>The holder (data owner) is the individual, a person, a company or an organization who owns unique, personal data.</p>
 
 The holder earns verifiable credentials after providing proof of authenticity to the issuer.&nbsp; 
 The data owner will use those verifiable credentials to prove authenticity before benefiting from various services, making purchases or transactions. 
 
<p>The verifier (relying party) is the entity which verifies a holder’s verifiable credentials.</p>
 
 The relying party will need to verify only a specific piece of information. Only the bare minimum which is relevant to provide a service to the holder. 
 The verifier checks if the holder’s data is issued by a competent and legally authorized issuer. 
 The verifier makes sure that the holder’s data has not been tampered with, forged, expired or revoked.&nbsp; 
 
 Trust in the digital world 
<p>What makes this triangle work is that the three parties are willing to trust one another. The element of trust is important, especially in a time where information forgery and theft happen quite frequently. But within a trust triangle, the user (or holder), has complete control over the management and visibility of their data.</p>
<p>As stated above, digital identities are the counterparts of physical identities that are verified through paper documents. The way trust works digitally is similar to the real, tangible world. However, the consequences of having personal information exposed to the public digitally are much greater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having to trust a centralized database is more or less forced upon individuals. Otherwise they couldn’t benefit from services required to perform daily transactions, either for personal or professional gain. Within a trust triangle, SSID can facilitate these daily transactions without holders having to concede to “blind trust” and risking the safety of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The Three Pillars of Self Sovereign Identity 
<p>Within the trust-triangle framework, there are three main components, or “pillars”, that enable the realization of the ideal solution SSID is aiming to achieve:</p>
 
 Blockchains 
 Decentralized Identifiers 
 Verifiable Credentials 
 
 Blockchains&nbsp; 
<p>A blockchain is a ledger which is shared across thousands of computers around the world. These computers act like nodes within a network, storing and verifying information in a way that makes it nearly impossible to modify or cheat the system.</p>
<p>Within a blockchain, data is saved like a compilation of records, linked to one another. Each user has a copy of this collection, which makes it particularly difficult for hackers to unlawfully modify the information stored within.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, data is protected using complex cryptography which, at the moment, cannot be deciphered by malignant parties. The blockchain will provide the security layer necessary for users and relying parties to interact within the SSID framework.&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralized Identifiers&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, for short, are the digital counterparts of physical documents, IDs, passports or licenses used to verify one’s identity.</p>
<p>What qualifies as an identifier is any kind of information that proves an individual’s identity and individuality. Traditionally, identifiers are issued and stored by centralized systems, such as governmental institutions and organizations.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers no longer depend on a central system to manage, issue, and store valuable, private information. They ensure that individuals are able to generate their own identifiers with the help of systems that they trust. Individuals can then use cryptographic proof, such as digital signatures, to authenticate their new identifiers as their own.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers are unique. They cannot be forged or stolen, because identity itself is unique and pertaining to only one individual. For example, a digital wallet address can be used as a decentralized identifier.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 
<p>Verifiable credentials are digital versions of physical, paper documents used by persons, businesses, and organizations to identify themselves. Individuals can also use them to prove that they are qualified to access a service or perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are, but not limited to: digital birth certificates, digital education certificates, digital licenses, digital employee identification cards.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are issued in a tamper-evident manner that is respectful of the individual’s privacy. Bad players cannot make any unauthorized attempt to modify or forge digital documents without leaving evidence behind. This is something that a relying party will verify at each check.</p>
<p>In the physical world, a tamper-proof document would be sealed within multiple layers that are locked in a specific manner. If anyone attempts to open them, they cannot rearrange the layers in the original way. There is visible evidence that someone has unsealed and tampered with the document.</p>
<p>Using such a tamper-proof document, holders can present them to issuers and be verified immediately. This makes onboarding even more convenient than what centralized services offer nowadays.</p>
<p>But how do individuals make use of these credentials? We believe that the answer to that question lies within Zero Knowledge flows detailed below.</p>
 Zero Knowledge 
<p>In the current context, the concept of zero knowledge simply means that a relying party (verifier) does not need any additional information, other than the necessary minimum, to confirm whether a data owner (holder) qualifies for the service they provide or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the zero-knowledge proof method within a trust triangle, participants will benefit from secure interactions. This is because their full personal information does not need to be revealed in the majority of interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s revisit our previous example but with ZK in mind:</p>
 
 Holder A wishes to access Verifier B’s services, which are age-restricted. 
 B needs to verify with Issuer C whether A qualifies for said services.&nbsp; 
 C will confirm whether A is of age or not, without revealing the full date of birth, or specific age. Confirmation is expressed in the form of a ZK proof. 
 B will not have access to any kind of additional information, like location, actual date of birth, full name, full address, gender, etc. Likewise, B will not be retaining any data, because there will be no information for B to memorize or share outside of the interaction with A. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>The quick progress of technology is both thrilling and anxiety-inducing. It can be challenging to adapt to these fast-paced changes. However, there will always be ways to combat the threat of being controlled by an ill-intended higher power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self Sovereign Identity is keeping pace with this constant technological uprising, making sure to protect its users. It aims to maintain the ideal that there’s a choice that doesn’t trap individuals in exhausting, exploitative loops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its goal is to continuously certify its users to reach their full professional and personal potential. To restore each individual’s ability to be the sole controller of their PII in their digital lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey is restlessly working towards achieving ways for users to be able to safely engage with partners in an environment that is secure and neutral. At the moment, SSID is an ideal, a work in progress. SelfKey has the potential to become the bridge that will take its users towards a much safer and empowering future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dock CEO, Nick Lambert, and COO, Elina Cadouri, joined the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) on April 18-20, 2023 in California. IIW is a community-driven event that brings together a diverse group of individuals interested in <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.dock.io">digital identity</a>. </p><p>The event has been held since 2005 and attracts a range of participants including technologists, policy makers, and entrepreneurs. Among over 300 participants, Nick and Elina met with government, company, and research representatives from organizations of all sizes.</p><p>“We enjoy participating in IIW because it’s a great way to get a sense of the key trends happening in the industry and meeting people developing the same kind of technology. It’s been wonderful to take focused time to dive deeper into great discussions including use cases and technology standards,” said Nick. </p><p>IIW is not your typical event. It is an “unconference” where the meetings and event structure is largely driven by the participants rather than the organizers to create a collaborative atmosphere. The focus is not to promote products, but more about sharing and learning.</p>COO Elina Cadouri and CEO Nick Lambert at the Internet Identity Workshop in California. Key IIW Discussions That Emerged <p>Governments’ Digital Identity Strategies</p><p>There was a discussion on the growing number of governments that are developing and implementing digital identity strategies. The trend is particularly progressing in the EU, Estonia, parts of Asia, and British Columbia (Canada). </p><p>In the European Union for example, the European Commission has been producing regulation for European Digital Identity, which aims to provide a secure and user-friendly way for EU citizens to access public and private services online. The proposal includes the development of a digital wallet that will enable users to store and manage their identity documents, such as passports and driving licenses, in a secure and convenient way.</p><p>Estonia has been a pioneer in digital identity, having implemented a national digital identity system in 2002. The system, known as ID-card, enables Estonian citizens to access a range of public and private services online, including voting, banking, and healthcare. The ID-card is widely used in Estonia and has been recognized as a model for digital identity systems around the world.</p><p>Product Market Fit</p><p>There is a growing need and demand for <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.dock.io">decentralized identity</a> and <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential technology</a> across a variety of industries including supply chain and education. Dock is continuously getting market feedback from organizations in diverse industries including travel, healthcare, and finance to offer the best possible solutions for each use case.</p><p>We are pleased to report that we are getting early traction and seeing significant interest from organizations adopting digital identity solutions. The feedback helps drive Dock’s product and development roadmap.</p><p>Impact of AI</p><p>Given the fast pace that AI is disrupting many industries and transforming the way businesses operate, the discussion of AI inevitably came up and will likely be a regular topic of discussion at future events. </p><p>Online verification is going to be a growing need as deep fakes become more and more sophisticated to the point where people can’t tell who is real on both images and video, and what information is authentic. In addition to talks about the impacts AI will have on the industry, there were discussions on how organizations can leverage AI in their operations as well.</p>Nick showing participants how Dock's solutions work.<p>Nick and Elina did a demo of the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Certs Web App</a>, our no-code Verifiable Credentials platform, and it was very well received. People asked questions about the tech implementation and use cases. Some people were surprised to see a no-code solution that non-technical people can conveniently use because many of the current solutions are mainly used by developers. </p><p>IIW provided a valuable opportunity for Dock to learn and participate in engaging discussions on digital identity.

<p>Network attacks, while not as common as other typical hacks, still pose a significant threat to a world of always-online business. Specifically, a network snooping attack like Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) can leverage weaknesses in web browsers to steal network communications and spoof user credentials.</p>
 What Is a Man-in-the-Browser Attack? 
<p>A man-in-the-browser attack is a threat where an attacker inserts malware into a victim’s web browser through an infected app, plugin, or extension. The primary goal of this type of attack is to intercept and change the data exchanged between the user’s browser and the websites they visit, typically for financial gain or to steal sensitive information.</p>
<p>These attacks work through the following basic steps:</p>
 
 Infection: The attacker first infects the victim’s computer with some form of malware, typically a trojan, an infected plugin, and/or a file opened by the user via a phishing attack. See the list of prominent MitB trojans below. 
 Monitoring: Once the victim’s computer is infected, the malware is installed and may remain dormant until the user accesses a targeted website (e.g., a bank). Since the malware often integrates with the browser as a plugin or an extension to avoid detection and will not trigger traditional anti-malware software; thus, the user may never know that someone is intercepting data. When the user visits a targeted website, the MitB malware becomes active and monitors the user’s interactions with the website, such as login attempts, form submissions, or transactions. It may also inject malicious code into the web pages to modify their content or behavior. 
 Data Interception: As the user enters sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data, the malware intercepts, stores, or transmits it to the attacker. It can also manipulate the data sent to the website or modify the data received from the website with no one the wiser. 
 Man-in-the-Middle: The malware communicates with the attacker’s server to send intercepted data and receive further instructions. This enables the attacker to adapt the attack as needed, meaning straightforward data interception or, in more advanced cases, spoofing bank requests to steal money from the user’s account. 
 
 Common Trojans Used in Man-in-the-Browser Attacks 
<p>Several common Trojans have been used in man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks. These Trojans are typically designed to target browsers on specific operating systems, like Windows, leveraging common weaknesses to integrate with critical system functionality.<br>
Some of the more notable Trojans include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_(malware)">Zeus</a>: Zeus, aka Zbot is one of the most well-known and widely distributed banking Trojans. It targets Windows-based systems, is designed to steal sensitive data, and includes tools like keystroke loggers and form grabbers. Zeus is highly customizable and has been used as a base for developing other Trojans. 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpyEye">SpyEye</a>: SpyEye is another notorious banking Trojan that targets most major browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox) on Windows systems. It emerged as a competitor to Zeus and is known for its advanced features, like auto-fill credit card tools and the ability to spoof HTTPS access and grab information across FTP and POP3 protocols. 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_(malware)">Citadel</a>: Citadel is a variant of the Zeus trojan that targets password managers. It is equipped with additional features, such as the ability to record video of the victim’s screen and an advanced keylogger. 
 <a href="https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/digital-banking-fraud-how-the-gozi-malware-work">Gozi</a>: Gozi is a banking Trojan that targets Windows systems and is known for its advanced web injection techniques that extend into multiple attack vectors, including banking fraud, eCommerce fraud, ransomware, and compromising Point of Sale (POS) devices. 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpig">Torpig</a>: Torpig is a sophisticated Trojan and botnet that targets Windows-based systems and is designed to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and email account details. 
 
 How Can I Prevent MitB Attacks? 
<p>To defend against MITB attacks, users should practice good cybersecurity habits that apply to most other security concerns.</p>
<p>Preventing man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks requires a combination of good security practices and awareness. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself from MITB attacks:</p>
 
 Update Your Browser and Plugins: Regularly update your web browser and plugins whenever they ask you to. It is convenient to ignore update warnings, but these patches will often fix vulnerabilities that MitB attacks take advantage of. 
 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Out-of-Band (OOB) authentication, or using two communication channels to authenticate, can mitigate MitB attacks. Use 2FA for sensitive accounts, such as online banking and email. 
 Don’t Download Attachments or Click Links: Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links in emails from unknown or suspicious sources in cases where phishing attacks could hijack your browser. In general, you should only download files from trusted sources and never install software from the web on business machines. 
 Review Browser Extensions: Regularly review the extensions and plugins installed in your web browser and remove any that are no longer needed or come from untrusted sources. 
 Adjust Browser Settings: If not necessary, disable JavaScript, Flash, or other plugins on untrusted websites, enable automatic updates, and block pop-up windows. 
 
 What Is the Difference Between Man-in-the-Browser and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks? 
<p>Both man-in-the-browser (MITB) and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are forms of “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/aitm/">adversary-in-the-middle</a>” hacks. They involve intercepting and potentially manipulating data exchanged between two parties. However, they differ in their methods, points of attack, and scope.</p>
 
 Man-in-the-Browser Attack: An MITB attack injects malicious software (malware) into a victim’s web browser. The malware typically exploits vulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins to intercept and manipulate data exchanged between the browser and the websites the user visits. MITB attacks usually focus on specific websites or applications, such as online banking or e-commerce websites. The goal is typically to steal sensitive information (e.g., login credentials and financial data) or manipulate transactions. 
 Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attack: In a MitM attack, the attacker positions themselves between the victim and the server (e.g., a website, an email server, or a Wi-Fi network). The attacker intercepts and potentially modifies the data being exchanged without the knowledge of the victim or the server. MITM attacks can target various network communications, including web browsing, email, instant messaging, and file transfers. The attacker can potentially access or modify any data transmitted between the victim and the server.

				  The biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) has a reputation for bringing the identity community together for passionate discussion. At the most recent meeting, held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, AI, Governance, and use cases in the public sector took center stage. We offer you the Cliff notes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Char Howland &amp; Mike Ebert</p>
<p>The biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) holds a unique position in the identity scene as an “unconference,” meaning anyone is able to attend and lead sessions on topics that they would like to share their findings on or wish to learn more about. With a wide range of skill levels, from beginners to technical experts, it is a place for both collaborative learning and for brainstorming solutions to move identity projects toward completion. Here are our personal highlights from the unconference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government Interests</p>
<p>The US government has been taking notice of digital identity efforts and is currently working on specifications for solutions to be put into widespread use. To do this, it needs public feedback and IIW offers a prime spot to speak with people familiar with the space.</p>
<p>One session, humorously titled “What do you want to tell the government?” led to discussion as to how it should adapt to specifications that are already in place, and how it should decide on new specifications that need to be created.</p>
<p>We had an interesting conversation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on how credentials could be a part of the government’s strategy for managing critical infrastructure, from which we offer two takeaways.</p>
<p>The government is sending people who know what they are talking about and who are extremely interested in implementing these kinds of solutions.</p>
<p>The community needs to be ready to answer these questions and be able to clearly explain both the technology and use cases.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>With artificial intelligence (AI) in the news, it wasn’t a surprise to see several sessions at IIW, including one which we attended titled “How can we have digital trust in the age of ChatGPT?” The best answer is decentralized identity, but how exactly this will look is still open for discussion. Attendees were very excited about this topic and how AI will drive an even greater need for strong identity systems.</p>
<p>Indicio recently published a position paper that highlights how these two technologies can work together, and how decentralized identity will allow for greater uses of AI. You can read a more indepth look <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">here</a> (requires registration).</p>
<p>Trust as an Alignment of Expectations</p>
<p>Another interesting topic was that people trust systems differently based on their expectations of privacy online. Privacy has different meanings for everyone, including the choice of having privacy, how much control the user has, the right to be left alone, and freedom from intrusion</p>
<p>The presenters of this session found that, very often, a “privacy violation” was actually due to a misalignment of expectations. It was interesting to learn that certain trends appeared along generational lines, with older generations tending to assume that they have privacy in their internet interactions unless otherwise specified and younger generations tending to assume that their actions are public unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The takeaway was clear: When creating a system, it is important to clearly outline what is trusted, what is private, and what is not, to avoid misunderstandings and unhappy users.</p>
<p>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nist.gov">National Institute for Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) recently put out its <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, which aim to “present the process and technical requirements for meeting the digital identity management assurance levels specified in each volume.”</p>
<p>This document drove many conversations, and one in particular was the need for applicant representatives and trusted referees. What this means is that in a situation where a person needs translation, can’t access a computer, or is in some sort of crisis, there needs to be some way to digitally trust or vouch for that person. It is a requirement to consider and account for the ways in which disadvantaged populations can access the technology.</p>
<p>To learn more about the most recent IIW you can watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW-Rke9m7VI">daily wrap up series</a> on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>

 Stakers can claim DF34 rewards. DF35 runs Apr 27 — May 04,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 35 is here&nbsp;(DF35).</p><p>DF35 is the 7th week of DF Main, the final phase of DF. This week, users can earn rewards up to 150K OCEAN. In DF Main, weekly rewards will grow to 1M+&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>The article <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“Ocean Data Farming Main is Here”</a> has the full details of DF Main. In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards stakers with OCEAN who allocate voting power to curate data assets with high&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">DF&nbsp;dapp</a>.</p><p>DF34 counting started 12:01am Apr 20, 2023 and ended 12:01am Apr 27. You can claim them at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF35 is live and will conclude on May 04,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>DF Round 35 (DF35) is the 7th week of DF Main. Details of DF Main can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards (section 2), and DF34 overview (section&nbsp;3).</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As a participant, follow these step on how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  Passive and Active Rewards are distributed on Ethereum mainnet. Click “Claim”, sign the tx, and collect your&nbsp;rewards  <p>Rewards accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF35&nbsp;Overview <p>DF35 is part of DF Main, phase 1. This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>For further details, see the “<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#c9d1">DF Reward Function Details”</a> in DF Main Appendix.</p><p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behavior. Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Conclusion <p>DF34 has completed. To claim rewards, go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF35 begins Apr 27, 2023 at 12:01am UTC. It ends May 04, 2023 at 12:01am&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>DF35 is part of DF Main.

<p>AUSTIN, TX, 27 April 2023 — BOTLabs GmbH, developer of KILT Protocol, today announced the Frequency blockchain will integrate KILT’s portable, censorship-resistant identity infrastructure for users of decentralized social networks. Appearing onstage at Consensus by CoinDesk, Harry Evans, CTO of Amplica Labs (the team that was the initial technical contributor to Frequency) and Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT shared their vision of how a universal social graph and digital identity innovations will deliver Web3 utility to the everyday Internet&nbsp;user.</p><p>Frequency delivers essential tooling to enable decentralized social networking at massive scale. KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs), or digital fingerprints, a core element of digital identity. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials, like a passport or driver’s license, to the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Frequency and KILT share a common mission of restoring control of personal data to the individual. Centralized social networking platforms have evolved into identity providers by offering convenient logins across multiple online services, making it difficult for users to understand which personal data was shared between the social network and third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>The advent of Web3 technologies enables people-centric social networking apps that give consumers more control over their data. The Frequency blockchain uses a lightweight “Social Identity” to make it possible for users to be discovered, connect and interact with others on a shared public social network, and a user to leverage their own network of personal connections across&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This Social Identity will be connected to KILT’s Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP), a new Web3 authentication framework users can bring the full functionality of KILT’s solution into their decentralized social experience. Users decide which elements of their identity are exposed, to which audience. With KILT the user owns and controls their data; no company or entity can shut off their access or delete their&nbsp;data.</p><p>“For decentralized social to achieve mass adoption, we need new, interoperable social primitives. This work demonstrates how projects can come together to deliver more value to users and fuel a healthier web,” said Harry Evans, CTO of Amplica&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>“Centralized online services and data-hungry social networks have been the only identity providers available to consumers — until now”, said Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH. “The integration with Frequency will accelerate consumer demand for decentralized identity providers, making KILT’s framework more critical for new verticals within the Polkadot ecosystem and&nbsp;beyond.”</p><p>Frequency and KILT are part of the Polkadot ecosystem, a network of specialized, interoperable blockchains. In a new use case for Polkadot’s innovative Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM), authentication with KILT DIDs will be enabled on Frequency via XCM between the parachains.</p><p>This work is currently in development. Once complete, KILT and Frequency will be testing integration and features on Rococo before deployment to the production parachains.</p> About Frequency <p>Frequency is a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for high-volume use cases that makes it possible for builders to deliver decentralized social applications at massive scale. Blockchains typically have volatile, high transaction costs that become prohibitively expensive at the frequency required for social networking. Frequency solves this problem with a revolutionary pricing model in which builders reserve replenishing transaction capacity at a predictable, low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Frequency is designed to support the scaling of the Social Web, an evolution of the internet in which core social networking functionality is integrated within the web itself. The <a href="https://www.dsnp.org/">Decentralized Social Networking Protocol</a> (DSNP), released by international nonprofit <a href="https://projectliberty.io/">Project Liberty</a> in 2021, is a new open source project that is designed to be a foundational element of the Social Web. By connecting to DSNP over Frequency, applications can cost-effectively deliver Web3 features to large, established user bases while tapping into the compounding network effects of the universal, shared social graph enabled by&nbsp;DSNP.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p>KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world, while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> Press Contacts: <p>For Frequency:<br>media@frequency.xyz</p><p>For KILT Protocol:<br>Christine Mohan<br>christine@kilt.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/frequency-integrates-kilt-to-enrich-identities-for-decentralized-social-network-users-1750ab762a59">Frequency Integrates KILT to Enrich Identities for Decentralized Social Network Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>27 April, Luxembourg –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artory.com/">Artory</a>, a world leader in tokenizing fine art and collectibles, has partnered with the leading tokenization platform, <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, to compliantly unlock liquidity in the traditionally illiquid art market through the market tokenization standard ERC3643.</p>
<p>Leveraging their proven track record in art tokenization, Artory plans to tokenize art investments at scale. Artory’s technology captures trusted asset due diligence information from partner institutions to generate a verified asset token with signed certification. With Artory’s fully-auditable, certified asset token, the artworks can be wrapped in digital financial product offerings, such as funds, and participate in digital markets.</p>
<p>Artory has chosen to expand their tokens with the ERC3643 standard to avoid restriction to one local trading platform and take advantage of the standard’s on-chain compliance thanks to its built-in identity system. Financial instruments tokenized with the standard are interoperable with any other trading venue, centralized or decentralized, that uses the same blockchain network.</p>
<p>Artory and Tokeny align in their visions to create an open, compliant, and transparent ecosystem for art investors through this collaboration. Artory’s proficiency in providing auditable certifications and data-driven valuation for artworks, combined with Tokeny’s ready-to-use tokenization engine for using the ERC3643 standard, provides an all-in-one solution for tokenized art investment and liquidity opportunities.</p>
<p>For centuries, art and rare collectibles have been coveted investments, typically reserved for the affluent due to high barriers to entry. Remarkably, art has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for over 20 years, with fine art values rising more than 71% in the past decade. Furthermore, the Artprice100 index shows that blue-chip art has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 since 2000.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to art’s historically low correlation with traditional markets, investing in art can potentially serve as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. However, art is a complex asset class that requires a comprehensive inspection and appraisal performed by experts before being considered for investment. With Artory’s institutional-grade art tokenization, this asset class now has become increasingly accessible. Artory’s expert certification and data-driven valuation for the underlying artwork assets, together with Tokeny’s compliant infrastructure leveraging the ERC3643 standard , now enable art professionals to seamlessly tokenize trusted physical artworks and access liquidity through the digital ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established in 2016 by Nanne Dekking, who has over 25 years of global expertise and influence in the art market, Artory has focused on certifying and tokenizing art and collectibles by obtaining reliable due diligence information from partner institutions like the prestigious art appraisal and advisory firm, Winston Art Group.</p>
<p>Together, Artory and Tokeny have tackled the two biggest obstacles in this industry – inaccessibility and opaque valuation – while ensuring compliance.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    Indisputable reliability of the data recorded about any piece of artwork and the expertise of the specialists recording that information is the prerequisite for unlocking liquidity in the art market and represents the core of Artory’s mission. After 7 years of working in the art tokenization market, we want to make trusted, tokenized art investments accessible across platforms, rather than in siloed private markets. ERC3643 is a game changer in achieving this goal, providing a complete interoperable ecosystem for liquidity. Tokeny provides the best solution using the standard, and we are excited to be collaborating with them to open up art investment and liquidity opportunities. Our combined expertise will bring unprecedented accessibility to the art industry.  Nanne DekkingFounder &amp; CEO of Artory       Artory has been a trailblazer in the art tokenization market since 2016, and we are thrilled to partner with them to bring even more open, compliant and interoperable innovation to this space. We are excited to see the ERC3643 standard gaining traction and its network effect beginning to show. It is an exciting time for the art market, and we are thrilled to be a part of it.  Daniel CoheurChief Commercial Officer at Tokeny

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dilip Ishara and I am from Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am an internet marketing and communications expert. I have more than 5 years of experience working within the marketing field having started my career working in a digital marketing role in 2015. I would now consider myself one of the leading community managers and digital marketing experts in Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p><p>Aside from my day-to-day job, I’m also a crypto enthusiast and a lover of all things blockchain. This is something I have gotten more involved with in recent years. I have worked with several successful initial coin offering (ICO) projects since 2015 and helped them to achieve a strong stance in the market. I also provide consultancy services to ICO projects, working specifically within the area of marketing, PR, and communications.</p><p>In June 2019, I joined Ontology as a regional community manager and since then, I have been able to build a very fast-growing community that includes some of the most talented individuals across Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>As an Ontology Harbinger, my day-to-day duties include community management, translating content and resources for the Sri Lankan community, and managing events within the community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out is its high-speed network and low-cost transaction fees. We strive to offer our customers the highest levels of convenience and the lowest transaction cost on the&nbsp;market.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I think the most exciting thing about the Ontology project is how accessible the platform is for users. Whether you are completely new to crypto trading or a crypto expert, you can stake with Ontology using its user-friendly stalking mechanism.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>Becoming an Ontology harbinger back in 2020 was one of the most important moments in my career, as I was able to join a project that I am very passionate about.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am excited to see how the Ontology ecosystem develops over the next few years. I know that the team has been working continuously on improving and advancing the project, and establishing Ontology as the leading crypto project in the market — so I am looking forward to witnessing this.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I believe that Web3 will become mainstream within the next five years, becoming even more popular than the internet. I also expect that governments across the world will launch their own cryptocurrencies in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This is something that many governments have already placed on their roadmaps.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-dilip-ishara-8b6e906cce3f">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Dilip Ishara</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What Are the FTC MFA Requirements?&nbsp;  
<p>In October 2021, the FTC announced that it was updating the Safeguards Rule. The Safeguards Rule took effect in 2003 as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and aims to protect U.S.-based consumers from data breaches, cyberattacks and their resultant effects, such as fraud and identity theft.</p> 
<p>The update was deemed necessary due to the much-changed security and threat landscape since the start of the century. One of the most significant changes is an expanded definition of a covered financial institution. Entities such as auto dealers are included if they handle financial consumer data. The updated rule also introduces critical new technology requirements, specifically it mandates <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for all covered companies, no matter their size.</p> 
 Safeguards Rule Overview  
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">updated version of the rule</a> introduces several requirements for relevant firms based around them developing, implementing and maintaining an information security program. The program must contain several administrative, technical and physical safeguards that ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information.</p> 
<p>There are nine specific elements in the updated rule that respond to the new threats facing companies and customer information, including:</p> 
  
  Implementing <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for all users that have access to customer information  
  Conducting risk assessment and data inventories  
  Training staff about threats, responses and security best practices  
  Choosing appropriately skilled service providers  
  Nominating a qualified Individual from among your staff or from a service provider to implement and supervise your company’s information security program  
  Regularly monitoring and testing the effectiveness of these safeguards, such as through performing (at least) annual penetration testing  
  
 When Do the FTC MFA Requirements Take Effect?&nbsp;  
<p>The FTC has recognized the adoption of MFA <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/02/security-principles-addressing-underlying-causes-risk-complex-systems">as a critical security practice</a> as it effectively prevents a single compromised password from opening up a whole system. Though the updated Safeguards Rule was due to come into force in December 2022, parts of the regulation were delayed by six months as the FTC recognized personnel and supply chain issues made it difficult for some firms to achieve compliance. Companies subject to the Safeguard Rule have until <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/11/compliance-deadline-certain-revised-ftc-safeguards-rule-provisions-extended-june-2023">June 9, 2023 to comply</a> with the MFA provision.</p> 
 Who Does the SafeGuards Rule Apply to?  
<p>The rules around customer information protection contained in the updated Safeguards legislation apply to non-banking financial institutions. However, the FTC warns that “financial institutions” covers a broader array of companies in their usage than the common understanding of the term. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-314/section-314.2">These include</a>:</p> 
  
  auto dealers (specifically any that extend credit or lease vehicles)  
  mortgage brokers and lenders  
  payday lenders  
  collection agencies  
  any retailer that extends credit for their products  
  personal or real estate property appraisers  
  check cashers  
  tax preparation firms  
  financial advisors  
  any company that brings together buyers and sellers as a “finder”&nbsp;  
  
<p>The updated FTC MFA requirements and consumer information protection regulations thus affect a wide range of firms, making data protection and information security a major factor in their risk assessments. This means a data breach or poor security practices can result in reputational damage and can open companies to litigation and fines of up to $46,000 per day per breach occurrence.&nbsp;</p> 
 The FTC MFA Requirements: The Details  
<p>As mentioned above, the FTC has stated that MFA is critical for system security and the protection of consumer information. The implementation of the FTC MFA requirements in line with the updated Safeguards rule requires at least two authentication factors from:</p> 
  
  Knowledge factors (i.e., something you know), such as a password or the answer to a secret question  
  Possession factors (i.e., something you have), such as a device or hardware security key.  
  Inherence factors (i.e., something you are), such as a fingerprint, face or retina scan.  
  
<p>The FTC has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/02/security-principles-addressing-underlying-causes-risk-complex-systems">expanded further on its proposals</a> for the adoption of MFA, requiring companies to use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant MFA</a> for their employees. It specifically rules out multi-factor solutions that use SMS, push notifications or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one-time passwords (OTPs)</a>, explaining that "if a user can be tricked into typing in their username and password, they can be tricked into typing a code from their phone."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They also recommend that companies refrain from offering forms of MFA based on providing telephone numbers that subsequently receive messages or phone calls. As stated explicitly in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Chegg-DecisionandOrder.pdf">their case against Chegg</a>, an educational services company that exposed millions of customer records in four separate breaches, the MFA offered to all employees, contractors and affiliates “should not include telephone or SMS-based authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The FTC MFA requirements also suggest that legacy authentication, such as security questions, is inherently unsafe as it gives the attacker data, and much of the data required to get past the challenge is publicly available. Therefore, companies deploying MFA are also advised not to use the data collected for the authentication system anywhere else to increase security and improve consumer trust, knowing that the MFA is not just another data collection exercise.</p> 
 Complying With the FTC MFA Requirements  
<p>The updated FTC Safeguarding rule aims to deliver better security and confidentiality for customer information and protect against threats and unauthorized access. Implementing MFA for anyone who can access customer information is a critical part of this, and, as advised by the FTC, this MFA should be phishing-resistant. This means that any factor or method which can be "phished" or circumvented through social engineering, such as passwords, OTPs or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notifications</a>, should be deprecated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Systems such as hardware security keys or those which use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric identification</a> built on secure protocols and public key infrastructure, deliver the best security and allow companies to meet the FTC MFA requirements. In particular, FIDO-based authentication is named as the gold standard for phishing-resistant MFA by the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> and other regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gagon said security and ease are always top of mind in any type of payment, and best practice for account-based payments involves “making sure that the person who is connecting the bank account has the authority on that account.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The trick with having security and preventing fraud is you don’t want to introduce so much friction that it’s not worth it for a consumer or user to use that payment method or to use that tool. It’s about letting the good guys through, with less friction, and minimizing the challenges that they face,” said Gagon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Part of our continued work at Spruce is to make it easy for developers and the broader Ethereum community to use Sign-In With Ethereum. Sign-In with Ethereum, otherwise known as SIWE or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-4361</a>, describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain services by signing a standard message format. It gives users the power to authenticate with their Ethereum keys in a simple workflow: </p><p><br>You may be thinking, “It’s Sign-In with Ethereum, but can it work with Layer 2 solutions and other EVM-compatible chains?”</p><p>If you are a developer, you might want to enable users of your app to:</p>  Sign-In with Polygon  Sign-In with Avalanche  Sign-In with Optimism  Sign-In with Binance Smart Chain  <p>Fortunately, Sign-In with Ethereum isn’t just for Ethereum. It does, in fact, work with L2s and other EVM-compatible chains, and it’s quite easy to set up with the existing SIWE libraries.</p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Layer 2</a> (L2s) scaling solutions are off-chain scaling networks built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to improve scalability and efficiency and reduce the cost of performing transactions on Ethereum. These networks leverage <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/?ref=blog.spruceid.com#mainnet">Ethereum Mainnet</a>’s security guarantee and technical advancements while affording higher transactional throughput. The L2s are built using various scaling solutions, such as rollups (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ZK-rollups</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">optimistic rollups</a>) and state channels. Some examples of L2s are Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. </p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) is the computational layer that sits on top of the hardware and node network layer for Ethereum. It executes smart contracts and computes the current state of the network, allowing developers to create a wide range of secure and programmable applications. An EVM-compatible chain is a blockchain or a network that has the ability to run and deploy the smart contract code that can be recognized by Ethereum nodes. Some examples of EVM-compatible chains are Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. EVM networks do also include the previously outlined L2s, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. </p><p>How can you use SIWE to enable users to sign in with L2s or other EVM-compatible chains?</p><p>SIWE messages have a set of required fields, one of which is “chainID.” chainID is a unique identifier assigned to each blockchain network. This identifier protects from transactions in one chain being accidentally included in another chain. </p><p>This concept was first introduced in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-155</a> as a means to prevent replay attacks. Replay attacks are exploits in which an attacker intercepts a legitimate transaction and replays it on another network, potentially exploiting a vulnerability or causing damage. There are several ways to prevent replay attacks, such as using a nonce to ensure each transaction is unique or implementing validation checks to verify the legitimacy of the signature and sender’s address. </p><p>A unique chainID assigned to each EVM-compatible chain ensures that transactions created for one chain aren’t replayed on another. </p>A dapp using the Ethereum blockchain, which has a Chain ID of 1.&nbsp;<p>The easiest way to install SIWE (for Ethereum or, as we’ll show here, for L2s or other EVM-compatible chains) into your dapp is with our SSX library. If you’re new to SSX, check out <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">our documentation</a> or our guide on setting up SSX with Next.js: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/tutorial-ssx-and-next-js/">  Tutorial: SSX and Next.js  Next.js provides developers with the right tools to create their latest projects. This guide will show you how to install Sign-In with Ethereum in your Next.js app by using SSX.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>Assuming you have an SSX-enabled dapp, let’s get started.</p> Customizing Fields in the SIWE Message <p>First, you can customize fields, such as the chainID, with the <code>siweConfig</code> option.<br>SSX enables developers to configure the fields of their SIWE message using the <code>siweConfig</code> option. This option allows you to overwrite the fields found in the SIWE message: </p> <code>const signIn = async () =&gt; {
	const ssx = new SSX){
    	siweConfig: {
        	chainId: 1, // set the chainid to your preferred chain
        },
    });
};</code> <p>A dapp developer can change the chainID to any L2 or EVM-compatible chain and let users authenticate using that chain. </p><p>A list of EVM networks and their associated chainID can be found <a href="https://chainlist.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">here</a>. For example, you’d set chainID to 137 if you want to let your users Sign-In with Polygon. Here are a few other examples:</p>  Sign-In with Avalanche, set chainID to 43114  Sign-In with Optimism, set chainID to 10  Sign In with Arbitrum, set chainID to 42161  Sign-In Fantom, set chainID to 250  Sign-In with Binance Smart Chain, set chainID to 56  <p>And you’re done - it’s that simple! Your users can now authenticate with any EVM-compatible chains you want to enable. </p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>Hello folks,</p>



 
 
<p>I am happy to announce the first panel discussion in our series on Digital Wallets –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/digital-identity-from-vienna/events/292993136/">Thinking Locally and Globally for Digital Wallets and Identification</a>. Digital wallets and identification are a critical element of a future digital native world. Around the globe governments are investing and trialing different concepts while defining the public policy around these capabilities.</p>



<p>The ability to shift populations and gain (or force) adoption of new public policy positions is linked to the ability of the public sector form of governance. Over the past 20+ years the potential of truly digital economies and societies have been expounded endlessly but the results have been mixed, with a consistent shortfall in the meeting of expectations. High assurant digital identity appears to provide the final missing element to allow full digitalization of society to take place. </p>



<p>Our panelists are:</p>



 
 Cosanna Preston-Idedia, VP Advisory Services, IDLab Canada 



 Jacques von Benecke, CTO, Druk Holdings &amp; Investments, Bhutan 



 Bjarke Alling, Principal Advisor, D-Seal 
 



<p>I hope you can join us on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Digital+Identity+from+Vienna+%2336&amp;iso=20230502T19">May 2nd at 1900 CET</a> [That’s 6pm UK, 1pm Eastern / 10am Pacific].</p>

<p>IT Managers run into scalability challenges on a regular basis. It is difficult to predict&nbsp;growth rates of applications, storage capacity usage and bandwidth. When a workload reaches capacity limits, how is performance maintained while preserving efficiency to scale?</p>



<p>The ability to use the cloud to scale quickly and handle unexpected rapid growth or seasonal shifts in demand has become a major benefit of public cloud services, but it can also become a liability if not managed properly. Buying access to additional infrastructure within minutes has become quite appealing. However, there are decisions that must be made about what kind of scalability is needed to meet demand and how to accurately track expenditures.</p>



 Scale-up vs. Scale-out 



<p>Infrastructure scalability handles&nbsp;the changing needs of an application&nbsp;by statically adding or removing resources to meet changing application demands, as needed. In most cases, this is handled by scaling up (vertical scaling) and/or scaling out (horizontal scaling). There have been many studies and architecture development around cloud scalability that address many areas of how it works and architecting for emerging <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">native</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native"> applications</a>. In this article, we are going focus first on comparing scale-up vs scale-out.</p>



 What is scale-up (or vertical scaling)? 



<p>Scale-up is done by adding more resources to an existing system to reach a desired state of performance. For example, a database or web server needs additional resources to continue performance at a certain level to meet SLAs. More compute, memory, storage or network can be added to that system to keep the performance at desired levels.</p>



<p>When this is done in the cloud, applications often get moved onto more powerful instances and may even migrate to a different host and retire the server they were on. Of course, this process should be transparent to the customer.</p>



<p>Scaling-up can also be done in software by adding more threads, more connections or, in cases of database applications, increasing cache sizes. These types of scale-up operations have been happening on-premises in data centers for decades. However, the time it takes to procure additional recourses to scale-up a given system could take weeks or months in a traditional on-premises environment, while scaling-up in the cloud can take only minutes.</p>



 What is scale-out (or horizontal scaling)? 



<p>Scale-out is usually associated with distributed architectures. There are two basic forms of scaling out:</p>



 
 Adding additional infrastructure capacity in pre-packaged blocks of infrastructure or nodes (i.e., hyper-converged) 



 Using a distributed service that can retrieve customer information but be independent of applications or services 
 



<p>Both approaches are used in CSPs today, along with vertical scaling for individual components (compute, memory, network, and storage), to drive down costs. Horizontal scaling makes it easy for service providers to offer “pay-as-you-grow” infrastructure and services.</p>



<p>Hyper-converged infrastructure has become increasingly popular for use in private cloud and even tier 2 service providers. This approach is not quite as loosely coupled as other forms of distributed architectures but it does help IT managers that are used to traditional architectures make the transition to horizontal scaling and realize the associated cost benefits.</p>



<p>Loosely coupled distributed architecture allows for the scaling of each part of the architecture independently. This means a group of software products can be created and deployed as independent pieces, even though they work together to manage a complete workflow. Each application is made up of a collection of abstracted services that can function and operate independently. This allows for horizontal scaling at the product level as well as the service level. Even more granular scaling capabilities can be delineated by SLA or customer type (e.g., bronze, silver or gold) or even by API type if there are different levels of demand for certain <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">APIs</a>. This can promote efficient use of scaling within a given infrastructure.</p>



 IBM Turbonomic and the upside of cloud scalability 



<p>The way service providers have designed their infrastructures for maximum performance and efficiency scaling has been and continues to be driven by their customer’s ever-growing and shrinking needs. A good example is AWS auto-scaling. AWS couples scaling with an elastic approach so users can run resources that match what they are actively using and only be charged for that usage. There is a large potential cost savings in this case, but the complex billing makes it hard to tell exactly how much (if anything) is actually saved.</p>



<p>This is where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> can help. It helps you simplify your cloud billing lets you know up front where your expenditures lie and how to make quick educated choices on your scale-up or scale-out decisions to save even more. Turbonomic can also simplify and take the complexity out of how IT management spends their human and capital budgets on on-prem and off-prem infrastructure by providing cost modeling for both environments along with migration plans to ensure all workloads are running where both their performance and efficiency are ensured.</p>



<p>For today’s cloud service providers, loosely coupled distributed architectures are critical to scaling in the cloud, and coupled with cloud automation, this gives customers many options on how to scale vertically or horizontally to best suit their business needs. Turbonomic can help you make sure you’re picking the best options in your cloud journey.</p>

  <p>Jetty is a small, highly-scalable Java-based web server and servlet engine. It supports HTTP/2, WebSockets, and many other protocols. It powers websites and frameworks, both large and small, such as Google AppEngine. Because it is an Eclipse project, its open source project is called Eclipse Jetty. It is standards-compliant and open source, as well as commercially usable. It is the main alternative to Tomcat when hosting Java applications. Like Tomcat, you can use Jetty both embedded and stand-alone.</p>

<p>By default, Spring Boot creates applications with embedded web servers, which means that the server is embedded within the application code itself, so you don’t have to run a separate web server to publish Java web applications. However, with a little configuration, you can also publish a WAR file to a separate Jetty or Tomcat servlet container (old-school application server style). Spring also uses Tomcat by default, but you can easily change this, as you’ll see.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will build a simple web service with Jetty embedded. After that, you will create the same web service in Spring Boot and Jetty. Finally, you’ll add JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization to the web service using method-level security with Okta as the OAuth/OIDC provider.</p>

 Install the prerequisites 

<p>Before you start, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed (or install them now).</p>

 
   <a href="https://adoptium.net/">Java 17</a>: or use <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN!</a> to manage and install multiple versions 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: the Okta command-line interface 
   <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation">Auth0 CLI</a>: the Auth0 command-line interface 
   <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">HTTPie</a>: a simple tool for making HTTP requests from the command line 
 

<p>You will need a free Okta Developer account if you don’t already have one. But you can wait until later in the tutorial and use the Okta CLI to log in or register for a new account.</p>

<p>Start by cloning <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-jetty-example">this tutorial’s GitHub repo</a>:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-jetty-example.git
</code>   

<p>The repository has several projects:</p>

 
   <code>maven-jetty</code>: web service using Maven 
   <code>gradle-jetty</code>: web service using Gradle 
   <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-no-auth</code>: web service using Spring Boot and Maven 
   <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta</code>: web service using Spring Boot and Maven secured with Okta 
   <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-auth0</code>: web service using Spring Boot and Maven secured with Auth0 
 

 Build a simple web service with Java and Jetty 

<p>In the first part of this tutorial, you’re going to create a simple web service using Maven and then Gradle. In the second half, you’ll see how to upgrade this to a Spring Boot-based web service, to which you’ll add JWT-based authentication and authorization using Okta and Auth0 as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC providers.</p>

<p>You should have the files from the GitHub repository. Open the folder <code>maven-jetty</code> in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>First, take a look at the <code>pom.xml</code> file (which is shown below). Notice the Jetty version is set in the properties block. The only project dependency is <code>jakarta.servlet-api</code>. It is scoped as <code>provided</code> because, in deployment, this package will be provided by the server container.</p>

<p>The Servlet API dependency used to be <code>javax-servlet-api</code>, but Java EE is no longer maintained and has been migrated into <code>jakarta.servlet-api</code>. This happened when Java EE moved from Oracle to the Eclipse Foundation and became Jakarta EE. As you’ll see in the servlet code, this package provides the standardized classes and annotations used to build the servlet.</p>

<p>The packaging type for the project is <code>war</code>, not <code>jar</code>, and the Maven War plugin has been included in the build dependencies (<code>maven-war-plugin</code>).</p>

<p>Lastly, the Jetty Maven plugin has also been included. You can peruse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-11/programming-guide/index.html#jetty-maven-plugin">the docs here</a>. It is designed to make the development and testing of Jetty servlets easy by adding Maven goals to run and test the app.</p>

            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;
</code>   

<p>The next file to look at is the <code>AhoyServlet</code> class.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/demo/AhoyServlet.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.demo;

import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

@WebServlet(name = "AhoyServlet", urlPatterns = {"ahoy"}, loadOnStartup = 1)
public class AhoyServlet extends HttpServlet {

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        response.getWriter().print("Ahoy!");
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This file is the most basic, bare-bones web service. In the code, you’re using the <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation to define a web servlet without having to define it in a <code>web.xml</code> file. You can see <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/4.0/apidocs/javax/servlet/annotation/webservlet">the docs here</a> for the annotation.</p>

<p>Run the service from a Bash shell using the following command (run from the <code>jetty-maven</code> project root directory).</p>

   <code>./mvnw jetty:run
</code>   

<p>You should see some output that looks like the following.</p>

   <code>[INFO] Configuring Jetty for project: demo

</code>   

<p>Using HTTPie, test the simple service.</p>

   <code>http :8080/ahoy
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 5
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2023 15:22:24 GMT
Server: Jetty(11.0.15)

Ahoy!
</code>   

<p>That’s the simplest case.</p>

<p>A little side note. The Maven Jetty plugin provides two tasks for running the app without building a WAR: <code>jetty:run</code> and <code>jetty:start</code>. The one you want to use is <code>jetty-run</code>. From the Jetty docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>jetty:run</code> and <code>jetty:start</code> are alike in that they both run an unassembled webapp in Jetty, however <code>jetty:run</code> is designed to be used at the command line, whereas <code>jetty:start</code> is specifically designed to be bound to execution phases in the build lifecycle. <code>jetty:run</code> will pause Maven while Jetty is running, echoing all output to the console, and then stop Maven when Jetty exits. <code>jetty:start</code> will not pause Maven, will write all its output to a file, and will not stop Maven when Jetty exits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now take a look at a more fully-featured web service.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/demo/HikesTodoServlet.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.demo;

import java.io.IOException;

import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@WebServlet(name = "HikesTodoServlet", urlPatterns = {"hikes"}, loadOnStartup = 1)
public class HikesTodoServlet extends HttpServlet {

    // Not synchronized
    private List&lt;String&gt; hikes = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
    }

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        String hike = request.getParameter("hike");
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("Param 'hike' cannot be null.");
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.");
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);
            response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
        }
    }

    protected void doDelete(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        String hike = request.getParameter("hike");
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("Param 'hike' cannot be null.");
        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This is a web app that tracks a list of hikes. It demonstrates how to support POST and DELETE operations, as well as simple GETs and some simple error handling.</p>

<p>If your local Jetty server is still running, you can go ahead and test it. Otherwise, start it again using the <code>./mvnw jetty:run</code> command.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hikes
</code>   
   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
</code>   

<p>POST a new hike:</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

<p>Delete a hike:</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/hikes hike=="South Maroon Peak"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 110
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2023 15:25:26 GMT
Server: Jetty(11.0.15)

Wonderland Trail
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

<p>Now try to delete a hike that doesn’t exist or send an empty value:</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/hikes
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...

Param 'hike' cannot be null.
</code>   

<p>That’s how you can create a web service using Maven and Jetty. To deploy this, you would typically build the packaged WAR file using <code>mvn package</code> and deploy the WAR to your Jetty server.</p>

<p>Stop the Jetty server by pressing <code>Ctrl-C</code> in the terminal window where it’s running.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: this is a very naive implementation of a REST service. It uses an in-memory <code>ArrayList</code> as a data source, which is not synchronized (and thus would run into threading problems in a real web servlet). For anything beyond the scope of this tutorial, you’d need to implement a database backend of some kind. For help on how to do this, see the example blog posts listed at the end of the tutorial. You would typically also add a PUT endpoint and assign each item an ID to use as an index so data can be updated, but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>

 Build a web service with Gradle and Jetty 

<p>Next, you’re going to look at how you can accomplish the same thing you did above, but this time with Gradle instead of Maven. Why? Because some people are allergic to XML and love DSLs instead.</p>

<p>The Gradle-based app is located in the <code>gradle-jetty</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html">Gradle</a> is a Groovy-based build system that uses a custom DSL (domain-specific language) for its build files. Because the build script files are essentially Groovy scripts, the build system is incredibly powerful, thus, very flexible.</p>

<p>To run a Jetty server using Gradle, you’ll use <a href="https://github.com/gretty-gradle-plugin/gretty">the Gretty plugin</a>.</p>

<p>From the Gretty docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gretty is a feature-rich Gradle plugin for running web apps on embedded servlet containers. It supports Jetty versions 10, Tomcat versions 10, multiple web apps, and many more. It wraps servlet  container functions as convenient Gradle tasks and configuration DSL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This project uses Gretty plugin version 4.0.3, which uses Jetty version 11.0.11. Since version 4, Gretty requires <code>jakarta</code> imports over <code>javax</code>. You can use Gretty 3 if you want to support non-Jakarta apps (this is explained on the Gretty GitHub page above).</p>

<p>The two Java servlet classes are the same in both projects. I did find that Gretty and Gradle crashed unless I added an empty <code>src/main/webapp</code> directory (this wasn’t necessary with Maven).</p>

<p>The <code>build.gradle</code> file is analogous to the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</p>

   <code>plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'war'
    id 'org.gretty' version '4.0.3'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    providedCompile 'jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api:6.0.0'
}

gretty {
    contextPath = '/'
}
</code>   

<p>This is about as simple as it gets. The same Jakarta-based servlet API is included as a provided dependency, and the Gretty plugin is included in the <code>plugins</code> block.</p>

<p>The context path is configured to be the root path. If you want to see the other configuration properties, take a look at <a href="https://gretty-gradle-plugin.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-configuration.html">the Gretty configuration docs</a>.</p>

<p>You can also look at the Gradle tasks that the plugin adds <a href="https://gretty-gradle-plugin.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-tasks.html">in the docs</a>.</p>

<p>To run the web app, use the <code>appRun</code> task.</p>

   <code>./gradlew appRun
</code>   

<p>You can test the two endpoints: <code>/hikes</code> and <code>/ahoy</code>.</p>

   <code>$ http :8080/hikes
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge

$ http :8080/ahoy
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Ahoy!

<p>You’ve seen how to build a web service using Jetty in both Gradle and Maven. Next, you’ll build one using Spring Boot and Maven.</p>

 Build a web service with Spring Boot and Jetty 

<p>By default, Spring Boot is configured to use an embedded Tomcat server. However, this is easily configurable. The <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.webserver">Spring Boot docs on embedded web servers</a> is a good resource. To switch to Jetty, you need to do two things:</p>

 
   disable the default embedded Tomcat server 
   enable an embedded Jetty server 
 

<p>This is done in the <code>pom.xml</code> file by these two dependency configuration blocks. The first removes the Tomcat dependency from <code>spring-boot-starter-web-no-auth</code>, and the second adds the <code>spring-boot-starter-jetty</code> dependency.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
        &lt;!-- Exclude the Tomcat dependency --&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/exclusions&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;!-- Use Jetty instead --&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-jetty&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here is the full <code>pom.xml</code>. Notice the Spring Boot version is 3.0.6 and the Jakarta Servlet version is set to 5.0.0. This is because Jetty does not yet support Servlet 6.0.</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;

    &lt;name&gt;SpringBootJetty&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Demo project for Spring Boot&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;java.version&gt;17&lt;/java.version&gt;
        &lt;!-- Required since Jetty 11 does not yet support Servlet 6.0 --&gt;
        &lt;jakarta-servlet.version&gt;5.0.0&lt;/jakarta-servlet.version&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;

    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;exclusions&gt;
                &lt;!-- Exclude the Tomcat dependency --&gt;
                &lt;exclusion&gt;
                    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
                    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;/exclusion&gt;
            &lt;/exclusions&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;!-- Use Jetty instead --&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-jetty&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;

    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;
</code>   

<p>In this case, you’re no longer using the <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation. Instead, you’re using the Spring MVC API. The web controller is contained in a class named <code>WebController</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/demo/WebController.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.demo;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@Controller
@RequestMapping(path = "/hikes")
public class WebController {

    private List&lt;String&gt; hikes = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    @GetMapping()
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexGet() {
        return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
    }

    @PostMapping()
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexPost(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);

        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>To run the Spring Boot app, open a Bash shell and navigate to the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-no-auth</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p>Run the following.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Wait for it to finish initializing.</p>

</code>   

<p>This web service has the same features as the <code>@WebServlet</code> version: GET, POST, and DELETE, but no PUT.</p>

 Deploy the Spring Boot project 

<p>You now have a Spring Boot application that runs on an embedded Jetty container. To deploy it to a production server, build an executable jar file using <code>./mvnw package</code>, copy this jar file (found in the <code>target</code> directory) to the server, and run it using <code>java -jar &lt;your jar file name&gt;.jar</code>. There’s no need for a separate web server since this jar contains an embedded Jetty web server.</p>

<p>For example, for this project. First, build the JAR.</p>

   <code>./mvnw package -DskipTests
</code>   

<p>Now run the JAR.</p>

   <code>java -jar target/SpringBootJetty-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: For a more old-school deployment to an application server with multiple separate applications on the same server, you need to build a war file. <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.traditional-deployment">The Spring docs</a> on how to do this are a great resource. Essentially you need to do two things: 1) add the <code>war</code> plugin to the project dependencies, and 2) change the Jetty or Tomcat dependency to <code>providedRuntime</code> so it’s not included in the packaged war. Then you build a war file and deploy it to the servlet web app path on the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the next section, you will use Spring Security and Okta to protect the POST and DELETE endpoints.</p>

 Use the Okta CLI to create an OIDC application 

<p>The first step to securing the app is configuring an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app on Okta. OpenID Connect is an identity authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization protocol. In short, OIDC is how the app verifies who the user is, and OAuth 2.0 is how the app verifies what the user is allowed to do. Spring Security provides the client-side implementation and, in this example, you’ll be using Okta as the cloud provider.</p>

<p>You need to run the following commands from the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug,http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/,http://localhost:8080/</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: You will use the oidcdebugger.com redirect URI to create an access token you can use from the command line with HTTPie. The second URI is the default redirect URI that Spring Security uses for Okta when using its OAuth login feature.</p>
</blockquote>

 Configure the Spring Boot app for Okta 

<p>The project uses <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the Okta Spring Boot Starter</a> to simplify configure Spring Security. Find the following block in the <code>pom.xml</code> file and uncomment it.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Confirm that your issuer URI, client ID, and client secret were added to the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file.</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId={clientId}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret={clientSecret}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SpringBootJettyApplication</code> class is where the security is configured. It looks like the following. It enables JWT-based OAuth and OIDC security. However, it explicitly allows any request. You are doing this because you are going to use method-level security.</p>

   <code>package com.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootJettyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootJettyApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -&gt; {
            authz.anyRequest().permitAll();
        });
        http.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();

        return http.build();
    }

}
</code>   

 Protect the DELETE and POST endpoints 

<p>The <code>@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")</code> annotation has been added to the <code>indexPost()</code> and <code>indexDelete()</code> methods in the <code>WebController</code> class. This requires that each request to those endpoints be authenticated – that is, a valid user will need to be logged in. Because you are using Okta as your OIDC provider, they will be able to have authenticated with Okta’s servers, typically through a single sign-on.</p>

<p>Update the <code>WebController</code> to the following.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/demo/WebController.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.demo;

import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@Controller
@RequestMapping(path = "/hikes")
public class WebController {

    private List&lt;String&gt; hikes = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    @GetMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexGet() {
        return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
    }

    @PostMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")  // &lt;- ***ADDED***
    public String indexPost(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

    @DeleteMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")  // &lt;- ***ADDED***
    public String indexDelete(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>From the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta</code> subdirectory, open a shell and start the app.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>From a different shell, try to POST a new hike:</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
...

{
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "path": "/hikes",
    "status": 403,
    "timestamp": "2023-04-25T16:17:37.214+00:00"
}
</code>   

 Generate a JWT using the OIDC Debugger 

<p>To access the protected endpoints, you need to generate an access token JWT. An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. Open the site in a new window or tab. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. Select code for the response type and Use PKCE.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down and click Send Request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the access token to your clipboard and store it in a shell variable in the shell window you use to make requests.</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJIb05xb01mNE9jREltWnBGRnBINjZGTkFOM0J... 
</code>   

<p>Now try and POST a new hike and then remove it.</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

   <code>http DELETE :8080/hikes hike=="South Maroon Peak" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

 Secure the Spring Boot app with Auth0 

<p>You can also use Auth0 to secure the Spring Boot application. Look at the project in the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-auth0</code> subdirectory. Similar to the Okta project, this project uses <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the Okta Spring Boot Starter</a> to simplify configuring Spring Security. Find the following block in the <code>pom.xml</code> file and uncomment it.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Support for Auth0 was added in <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/releases/tag/okta-spring-boot-parent-3.0.3">version 3.0.3</a> of the Okta Spring Boot starter.</p>

<p>If you look in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file, you’ll see that there are two properties: the issuer URI and the audience.</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
okta.oauth2.audience=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli">Auth0 CLI</a> and run <code>auth0 login</code> in a terminal.</p>

<p>You need to find your Auth0 domain. One way to do this is to use the following command.</p>

   <code>auth0 tenants list
</code>   

   <code>=== dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com 

  AVAILABLE TENANTS          
  dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com  
</code>   

<p>Take the above domain and replace the placeholder in the <code>okta.oauth2.issuer</code> property in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file. Don’t remove the trailing slash!</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com/
okta.oauth2.audience=https://dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>The app is configured, and you can go ahead and run it.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>To test the app, you need to open a new Bash shell in the same project subdirectory.</p>

<p>Just like with Okta, you can list the hikes without a JWT.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hikes
...
Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
</code>   

<p>However, if you try and add or delete a hike, you’ll need a token.</p>

<p>Use the Auth0 CLI to create a valid access token for testing.</p>

   <code>auth0 test token -a https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>Select the <code>Default App [Generic]</code> to continue.</p>

<p>Save the token in a shell variable.</p>

 <code>TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZ...
</code> 

<p>Add a new hike using the token.</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

<p>That’s it. Auth0 security is working!</p>

 Learn more about Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Security 

<p>In this tutorial, you saw how to make a simple Java servlet service and run it with Jetty.

<p>Zug, Switzerland – April 13, 2023 – <a href="https://getmerit.xyz/?ref=blog.dock.io">Merit Protocol</a>, a platform connecting employers with financial service companies to enable employees to get better access to financial services, announced the integration of <a href="http://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a>’s Verifiable Credential technology. </p><p>Using Verifiable Credentials, Merit Protocol will enable employers to issue fraud-proof and instantly verifiable employment history and income data. It is anticipated that this will reduce the cost of the application process by up to 10X, all while preserving employees' privacy.</p> Problem: Hard for People to Access Small Loans <p></p><p>Merit was built with the mission to make it easier for employees to access good financial products, such as personal loans, based on their work record without compromising their data privacy and security. Right now, it’s hard for tens of millions of people around the world to complete the required documentation to regularly take out personal loans every year to pay for their day-to-day needs, particularly with rising interest rates and higher living costs. </p><p>A major barrier for financial service institutions to provide small loans is not having enough access to quality data on potential borrowers to make a decision on whether or not to provide the loan. It could cost $30 to $60 USD just to get the data from centralized institutions like TransUnion and Equifax and only 40% of signed applications actually lead to the loan getting funded. There are also costs to securing and maintaining the database of personal data.</p><p>So for these institutions, it’s too expensive and high risk to offer small loans up to a few hundred dollars when the costs of getting relevant customer data are so high. In the US, the average small dollar loan is a few hundred dollars, and consumers typically apply for these around eight times a year. These small loans have extremely high fees and interest rates, resulting in borrowers owing two to three times the loan amount. This practice has resulted in a payday loan industry that often takes advantage of these borrowers. </p><p>Many loan applicants also go through a terrible experience filling out long applications and often filling out the same information repeatedly. This adds more stress to an already difficult situation of living paycheck to paycheck.</p> How Dock's Technology Contributes to Merit Protocol’s Employment-Based Lending Solution <p></p><p>Companies need quality data, which many employers already have, to decide whether to provide a loan to a customer. Merit Protocol acts as a bridge between financial institutions and companies and their employees, as they provide access to quality employment data in a way that preserves employee privacy by using Verifiable Credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Technology. Merit Protocol has integrated Dock’s Verifiable Credential and ZKP technology into their platform and is also preparing to launch a digital identity wallet app using Dock’s white label wallet. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential</a> is a fraud-proof and instantly verifiable digital document that proves something about yourself, like your identity or a qualification you have earned, in a secure and trustworthy way. Verifiable Credentials are usually stored in people’s <a href="https://www.dock.io//post/digital-id-wallet?ref=blog.dock.io">digital identity wallet</a> apps rather than a centralized storage location and can be used to present only the minimal amount of information needed to do a transaction in order to preserve customer privacy. </p><p>A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enables you to prove something without revealing the details that support the proof. For example, with ZKP technology, employees can prove that they meet the minimum salary requirement to qualify for a small loan without revealing the actual salary. </p><p>Alex Lyashok, Co-Founder and CEO of Merit Protocol commented on why he chose Dock among many other providers. “We look for alignment on the mission first and foremost. We want to work with an organization that is also making it their business to enable consumers to take control of their data and to reduce reliance on centralized institutions or institutions that potentially engage in predatory behavior. We also looked for a partner that creates a secure, reliable solution that can be made compliant with GDPR and other consumer protection laws. Dock emerged as the one we are aligned with.”</p><p>Dock’s technology solutions will help Merit Protocol to: </p>  Reduce the cost of loan evaluations up to 10x  Infuse financial service products with privacy-preserving technology so the companies can make better products  Provide a much better employee experience to access small loans and give them full control of their data  Enable financial institutions to access quality employee data and reduce fraud  Speed up the application process as data can be verified instantly  <p>"We’re delighted to be partnering with Merit Protocol to bring Verifiable Credential technology to the employment-based lending sector so that employees, employers, and lenders can engage together in a more secure environment. This partnership will improve access to vital financial services products at scale, maintain data integrity for organizations, and give employees total control over their data,” said Nick Lambert, CEO at Dock. </p><p>Using Verifiable Credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proofs reduces the cost of evaluating a loan significantly because it eliminates inefficient data verification processes and removes the cost of storing data because data is not stored in centralized locations.</p><p>About Merit Protocol</p><p>Merit is a privacy software company that helps organizations make better products based on employment record data.</p><p>About Dock Labs</p><p>Dock is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely. Dock enables organizations and individuals to create and share verified data.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Encryption is a crucial part of most security frameworks and a foundational component of data protection across all digital applications. AES encryption, in particular, is a cornerstone of modern data obfuscation.</p>
 What Is AES Encryption? 
<p>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption is an algorithm that was adopted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 as a replacement for the aging Data Encryption Standard (DES) in use at the time.</p>
<p>AES is a symmetric-key block cipher, which uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It operates on fixed-size data blocks of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, each with increasing complexity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there are three primary types of AES encryption in operation today:</p>
 
 AES-128: This version uses a key size of 128 bits and performs ten rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. This algorithm balances security and performance but may need to be more suitable for more advanced security demands. 
 AES-192: This version uses a key size of 192 bits and performs 12 rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. It offers a higher level of security compared to AES-128, with a slight trade-off in performance. 
 AES-256: This version uses a key size of 256 bits and performs 14 rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. It provides the highest level of security among the three types but trades off performance–that is, it takes significantly longer to encrypt and decrypt the same block of text using AES-256 than the previous two. 
 
<p>As a symmetric encryption method, AES does have significant performance benefits over <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/asymmetric-encryption/">asymmetric encryption</a>, with the drawback that it relies on a single key that must remain secret.</p>
 
What Are the Benefits of Using AES Encryption? 
<p>AES is generally considered a secure encryption algorithm appropriate for high-level protection in industrial and government settings. Its security comes from its large key sizes, the (always-increasing) rounds of encryption performed on data blocks, and resistance to known attacks.<br>
Some of the reasons that AES is considered so secure include:</p>
 
 Large Keys: AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. The larger the key, the harder it is to break that key through brute-force attacks (like guessing). For example, AES-256 has 2 to the power of 256, a number that would take modern computers longer than the universe’s age to guess or reverse engineer through <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/brute-force-attack/">brute-force attacks</a>. 
 Multiple Rounds of Encryption: AES performs multiple rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. AES is what is known as a “block cipher,” in which the algorithm performs encryption processes on small chunks, or blocks, of data. Furthermore, stronger forms of AES will encrypt each block several times in what are called “rounds.” Each round includes permutations and mixing of the input data, making it extremely difficult to reverse-engineer the encrypted data or find weaknesses in the encryption process. 
 Resistance to Modern Attacks: AES is a modern standard and has been extensively analyzed by the cryptographic community to resist attacks such as linear and differential cryptanalysis. 
 
<p>However, it’s important to note that the security of AES encryption also depends on factors such as the implementation, key management, and the overall security of the system in which it is used. Secure key generation, storage, and distribution are essential to maintaining the security of any encryption algorithm, including AES.</p>
 How Was AES Developed? 
<p>AES encryption was created to replace DES as a more secure and efficient algorithm. DES had been in operation since the 1970s and started showing vulnerabilities due to advances in computational power and cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>In 1997, NIST initiated a process to develop a new encryption that would provide stronger security for the future. The main objectives were:</p>
 
 Enhanced Security: The new standard needed to offer significantly stronger security than DES and be resistant to known cryptographic attacks. Additionally, it had to support larger key sizes to protect against brute-force attacks that were becoming feasible with increasing computational power. 
 Improved Efficiency: The new encryption algorithm needed to be computationally efficient, allowing for fast encryption and decryption on a wide range of hardware. 
 Provided Flexibility: The new standard had to be adaptable to different security requirements and applications, offering various key sizes and security levels. 
 
<p>AES has since become the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm worldwide, providing strong security and efficient performance across various applications and industries, from telecommunications and finance to government and military.</p>
 In What Applications Is AES Used? 
<p>AES is widely used in various applications and industries due to its efficiency and strong security. Some common use cases for AES encryption include:</p>
 
 Secure Communications: AES encryption is used in secure communication protocols like SSL/TLS and HTTPS to protect data transmitted over networks, including emails, instant messages, and web browsing activities. 
 File and Disk Encryption: AES is used in file and disk encryption software, such as Microsoft’s BitLocker, Apple’s FileVault, and the open-source VeraCrypt, to protect sensitive data stored on computer systems, external storage devices or in the cloud. 
 Wireless Security: In Wi-Fi networks, AES encryption is utilized in the WPA2 and WPA3 security protocols to protect the confidentiality of data transmitted between devices and access points. 
 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): AES encryption is used in VPNs to secure data transmitted between remote users and a private network, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. 
 Payment Systems: Financial institutions and payment systems, such as credit card processing and online banking, rely on AES encryption to protect sensitive data, including account numbers, transaction details, and personal information. 
 Government and Military: AES encryption is approved for use by the U.S. government to protect classified information, and it is widely used in military communications and secure data storage. 
 Cryptocurrencies: Many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, use AES encryption to secure wallet data and maintain privacy in the transaction process. 
 
<p>The algorithm’s versatility, efficiency, and robust security make it an essential tool for protecting sensitive data across various industries and use cases.</p>

 The Shyft Perspective — April&nbsp;2023  The DeFi Catch-22: Navigating the Paradox of Innovation and Accountability <p>DeFi, the decentralized finance movement, has experienced exponential growth and is challenging the stronghold of traditional finance with trustless, peer-to-peer activities like lending, borrowing, and trading, bypassing banks and other intermediaries.</p><p>Although the DeFi revolution fosters accessibility, transparency, and decentralization in finance, it has also become a center of attraction for malicious actors who wish to abuse it for illicit activities, leading to heightened money laundering and terrorist financing risks.</p><p>This expansion necessitates vigilant regulatory oversight and robust measures to combat potential threats, ensuring a secure, trustworthy, and compliant DeFi ecosystem.</p> The Current Regulatory Landscape for&nbsp;DeFi <p>Although DeFi currently operates with limited regulation, recent developments indicate that regulators are preparing to intervene. However, regulatory bodies encounter numerous challenges as they strive to keep up with the industry’s rapid expansion.</p> Regulatory challenges <p>DeFi, a nascent industry with slow-moving regulators, faces a complex landscape due to varying regional regulatory standards, posing a significant challenge.</p><p>Adding to the complexity, DeFi protocols function in a decentralized, borderless environment, which hinders the ability of regulatory bodies to apply traditional frameworks, as countries may enforce conflicting, lenient, or strict regulations.</p><p>This situation exposes DeFi to a regulatory patchwork across jurisdictions, complicating businesses’ navigation and compliance efforts.</p><p>Regulators also grapple with defining and categorizing DeFi platforms and tokens as they significantly differ from conventional financial product definitions, generating uncertainty and hampering businesses’ understanding and compliance with relevant regulations.</p> Key regulatory bodies and guidelines <p>Some key regulatory bodies relevant to the DeFi industry include the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has shown a serious interest in regulating the DeFi space. The current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has argued that DeFi projects offering digital tokens or incentives to participants could fall under SEC regulation.</p><p>On its part, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates the trading of commodity futures and options, has been trying to understand DeFi implications at the international level.</p><p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), operating on an international level, is developing policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and is actively monitoring the developments within the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>According to FATF’s 2021 guidance, nearly all DeFi platforms are considered Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). As such, if a DeFi platform has no central entity managing it, FATF suggests that a VASP could be assigned to oversee it to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</p><p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is another international organization that monitors the global financial system. It is currently investigating whether its proposed policy recommendations for the crypto sector need to be strengthened to account for the unique risks associated with the DeFi&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Besides global regulators, local authorities in various regions also impact DeFi businesses. For instance, within the European Union, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and national securities regulators hold significance, while in Asia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Financial Services Agency of Japan take precedence.</p><p>This means, DeFi businesses must stay informed about the regulations and guidelines issued by these regulatory bodies to ensure they remain compliant and avoid potential legal&nbsp;issues.</p> Enforcement actions and precedents <p>As DeFi continues gaining traction and adoption, several enforcement actions have&nbsp;emerged.</p><p>One notable example is the SEC’s enforcement action in Sept. 2021 against Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain, over how investors market and use the exchange.</p><p>Another example is the 2018 enforcement action by the SEC against EtherDelta, a decentralized exchange. The platform’s founder, Zachary Coburn, was charged with operating an unregistered securities exchange. The SEC’s action signaled&nbsp;that</p><p>decentralized exchanges would not be exempt from regulatory oversight.</p><p>These precedents suggest that regulators are gradually increasing their oversight and enforcement efforts, even for platforms that were previously thought to be immune to regulations due to their decentralized nature.</p> Best Practices for DeFi Compliance <p>As the DeFi industry continues to evolve and face regulatory challenges, businesses need to adopt best practices for compliance. But what does it&nbsp;mean?</p> Legal and regulatory compliance <p>One of the best practices for DeFi compliance is to ensure that the project is legally and regulatory compliant from the outset. This can involve several steps, including legal entity formation and obtaining the necessary licenses and registrations.</p><p>Legal entity formation establishes the legal structure of a business and can impact factors such as liability, taxation, and ownership. Meanwhile, obtaining the necessary licenses and registrations ensures that a business operates within the parameters of the&nbsp;law.</p><p>Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific services offered, businesses may also need to obtain money transmitter or broker-dealer licenses.</p><p>Navigating the licensing and registration process can be complex, and projects may need to engage with legal experts and regulatory authorities to ensure they are meeting all requirements seamlessly. It’s important to note that failure to obtain the necessary licenses and registrations can result in enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage.</p><p>With regulators coming onto DeFi from all sides, legal and regulatory compliance is becoming a crucial component for DeFi protocol operations, which means they must take all necessary steps to meet all regulatory requirements.</p> KYC and AML compliance <p>KYC (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">Know Your Customer</a>) and AML (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">Anti-Money Laundering</a>) compliance are other important considerations for DeFi projects. KYC is the process of verifying the identity of customers to prevent fraud, while AML refers to the measures taken to prevent money laundering.</p><p>Implementing KYC and AML, however, is easier said than done due to the anonymity of blockchain transactions. However, compliance with these regulations is necessary for DeFi projects to attract institutional investors and gain mainstream adoption.</p><p>As regulatory scrutiny grows, KYC/AML tools and solutions like Digital ID and KYC-Chain are emerging to help projects achieve compliance. Some DeFi projects have also implemented identity verification measures through government-issued identification cards.</p><p>However, DeFi projects must balance privacy and compliance. Financial privacy is a fundamental right and an important crypto ethos. Protecting user privacy is essential for building a trustworthy and sustainable DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>With the help of innovative KYC/AML solutions, DeFi projects can implement effective measures to prevent fraudulent activities while ensuring user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Taxation and accounting compliance <p>DeFi transactions can have various tax implications for both platforms and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Users who earn interest on their holdings or receive rewards in the form of tokens are required to report such income on their tax&nbsp;returns.</p><p>In the US and some other countries, this income is subject to federal income tax and may also be subject to state and local taxes. Similarly, capital gains taxes may apply when users sell their DeFi tokens or other&nbsp;assets.</p><p>DeFi platforms may also have tax obligations, such as reporting requirements for interest payments or token rewards issued to users. These platforms must comply with tax laws and regulations in their jurisdiction, which can vary widely depending on the location.</p><p>Various tools and solutions, such as Accointing, CoinTracking, and TokenTax, are available for DeFi projects to facilitate tax compliance. These tools can help platforms and users track transactions, calculate tax liabilities, and generate relevant&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Complying with tax regulations in DeFi, however, requires balancing privacy and reporting requirements. Users value their privacy, but tax authorities require certain information to be reported. DeFi projects need to find innovative ways to preserve user privacy while complying with reporting requirements.</p> The Impact of Compliant DeFi on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>The potential impact of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliant-defi-the-way-out-of-commingling-clean-and-illicit-funds-in-a-decentralized-finance-economy">compliant DeFi</a> on the wider crypto ecosystem is a central theme in the crypto compliance debate. It affects crypto mainstream adoption, improved investor protection, and the emergence of new business opportunities.</p> The ripple effect on other crypto&nbsp;sectors <p>DeFi projects striving to maintain legal and regulatory compliance may spark a domino effect throughout the crypto industry, potentially transforming the operations of exchanges, wallets, and other platforms.</p><p>Users are likely to place greater trust in platforms prioritizing compliance and following regulatory standards, as these platforms foster a secure and transparent environment for crypto transactions. Additionally, by meeting stringent compliance requirements, these platforms may also entice a broader range of institutional investors.</p><p>Such compliant DeFi protocols can significantly impact user behavior and expectations. As more DeFi projects adopt KYC/AML protocols and tax reporting requirements, users may begin viewing these measures as the norm within the DeFi ecosystem. Consequently, the shift could promote more responsible and transparent crypto transactions.</p><p>This shift could create a benchmark for other crypto sectors, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms. Faced with a growing demand for compliance measures, these platforms might need to adapt to appeal to institutional investors and secure mainstream adoption. Ultimately, this could give rise to a movement toward enhanced compliance across the entire crypto industry.</p> Advantages for the crypto ecosystem <p>Adhering to compliance within DeFi can yield multiple benefits for the entire crypto ecosystem. First and foremost, it bolsters trust and credibility among investors and users. Conforming to regulations and standards signals that DeFi platforms and other crypto entities are dedicated to promoting transparency and accountability, which can attract a diverse range of investors and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Compliant DeFi can also expedite the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by offering a degree of assurance and security often absent in non-compliant crypto platforms. Mainstream acceptance can result in augmented liquidity, trading volumes, and overall value for the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>In addition, compliance with regulations and the implementation of risk mitigation strategies to curb fraud can safeguard users. That means reinforcing the reputation and long-term viability of the crypto ecosystem. It can also avert regulatory crackdowns that may adversely affect the industry.</p> Challenges for the crypto ecosystem <p>While compliant DeFi has the potential to bring a range of benefits to the crypto ecosystem, it also poses certain challenges, including balancing innovation and regulation. DeFi has been able to thrive due to its decentralized and permissionless nature, but implementing compliance measures could potentially limit innovation and hinder&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Another challenge is addressing concerns about decentralization and control. DeFi was created to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, but implementing compliance measures could centralize control and undermine the core principles of&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>There is also the issue of regulatory arbitrage, where DeFi projects can easily move to jurisdictions with more favorable regulatory environments, potentially creating an uneven playing field and hindering global standardization of compliance measures.</p><p>Finding a balance between innovation, decentralization, and compliance is a challenge the crypto ecosystem will need to navigate as DeFi matures and&nbsp;evolves.</p> Navigating the Future of DeFi Regulation <p>Looking into the DeFi compliance climate requires exploring the potential future of regulatory frameworks and how DeFi platforms can prepare themselves.</p> Potential regulatory changes and their implications <p>DeFi protocols operate in a largely unregulated environment, leading to concerns about investor protection and financial stability. As a result, regulators in different jurisdictions are exploring ways to regulate DeFi without stifling innovation.</p><p>The US SEC, for instance, has already started issuing enforcement actions against DeFi projects, a trend likely to continue, with regulators becoming more involved in the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>Besides changes in domestic regulatory policies, we could see an increasing international regulatory coordination.</p><p>DeFi is a global phenomenon, and regulators in different countries may take different approaches to regulation.</p><p>Agencies, too, recognize the growing need for international coordination to avoid regulatory arbitrage and ensure that DeFi platforms cannot evade regulation by operating in jurisdictions with less strict regulations.</p><p>As Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said recently, there’s a greater acceptance among G20 member countries that any new crypto regulations need to be globally coordinated.</p><p>According to her, DeFi being borderless requires “significant international collaboration for any specific legislation on these sectors to be fully effective.”</p><p>Additionally, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) can also play an important role in DeFi. Such organizations have successfully developed and enforced industry-wide standards in other industries, such as finance and securities.</p><p>In DeFi, SROs could play a similar role in developing industry best practices and standards while also helping bridge the gap between regulators and DeFi projects.</p><p>Navigating the future of DeFi regulation will be a complex and challenging task. While regulation is essential to safeguard investors and deter fraud, excessive regulation might hinder innovation and obstruct DeFi from realizing its maximum potential.</p><p>As such, finding the right balance between regulation and innovation will be crucial for the future of&nbsp;DeFi.</p> Preparing for future regulatory challenges <p>With regulatory certainty on the horizon, addressing forthcoming DeFi sector challenges becomes even more crucial for the industry’s long-term success and sustainability.</p><p>This can be achieved by developing agile compliance programs that can adapt to changing regulations and compliance requirements. This includes implementing robust KYC/AML processes, transaction monitoring, and reporting mechanisms.</p><p>DeFi projects can also engage with regulators and industry associations to stay updated on regulatory developments and collaborate on compliance standards. By participating in regulatory discussions, DeFi projects can also influence the regulatory framework and ensure that it is tailored to the needs of the industry.</p><p>By collaborating with legal and compliance experts, DeFi projects can further ensure their operations comply with existing and upcoming regulations. Legal and compliance experts can provide guidance on navigating complex regulatory frameworks and developing compliance programs that meet regulatory requirements.</p> Shyft Network: Answer to Compliant DeFi&nbsp;Woes <p>The DeFi ecosystem currently faces significant hurdles, impacting both major liquidity providers and DeFi platforms.</p><p>Regulatory limitations and unclear rules present considerable obstacles for Major Liquidity Providers (LPs) engaging with DeFi. Meanwhile, DeFi platforms fail to reach their full potential due to a limited scope stemming from regulatory compliance issues.</p><p>Regulators, on their part, are left to navigate the DeFi sector with little guidance. At this point, they have no option but to rely on outdated regulatory frameworks to make sense of this rapidly evolving landscape.</p><p>Navigating the complexities of the DeFi ecosystem might seem daunting, but Shyft Network offers a way forward. Through an opt-in framework, Shyft Network provides solutions like identity verification, compliant asset creation, and credit scoring while ensuring secure collection, storage, and sharing of user data when required.</p><p>Moreover, as a trust anchor, Shyft Network bridges the gap between users, DeFi platforms, and centralized organizations, enabling trustless transactions in a decentralized environment while adhering to regulatory compliance.</p><p>By validating personal data and transaction details, and subsequently publishing proof on the blockchain, Shyft simplifies and strengthens interactions within the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p> Final Note <p>In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), navigating the complex regulatory landscape has become crucial. As DeFi projects continue to gain traction, they must focus on compliance and foster a secure, transparent, and compliant ecosystem. Achieving this requires a multi-faceted approach, including legal and regulatory compliance, adherence to KYC/AML procedures, and proper taxation and accounting practices.</p><p>Despite the inherent complexities, maintaining compliance is essential for the growth and success of the DeFi industry. This will not only improve trust and credibility among investors and users but also encourage mainstream adoption. However, striking a balance between innovation, decentralization, and compliance remains a challenge, and finding this equilibrium will be essential as the sector&nbsp;matures.</p><p>In light of this, it is worth pondering: What practical steps can DeFi projects, regulators, and industry stakeholders take to collaboratively create a balanced regulatory environment that nurtures innovation and promotes the true ethos of blockchain and&nbsp;DeFi?</p> Catwoman’s Compliant DeFi Adventure <p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risk management has emerged as a critical aspect of business strategy for companies worldwide.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/R6RO7REX"> A 2023 IBM IBV study</a> showed that organizations that are seen as ESG leaders are 43% more likely to outperform their peers on profitability. However,<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/c-suite-study/ceo"> 57% of CEOs admit that defining and measuring the Return on Investment (ROI) and economic benefits of their sustainability efforts remain a significant challenge</a>. Focusing on ESG Risk Management can help your organization become more profitable, and your organization can start on this journey today.</p>



<p>So how does ESG help the bottom line? Customers have a much greater interest in sustainability and impact then previous generations. 68% of customers say that environmental sustainability is very or extremely important to them, with nearly half paying a premium price for environmentally sustainable or socially responsible products in the last year. IBM has also found that ESG leaders can boost revenue through unexpected channels. An example of this is where IBM worked with a consumer-packaged goods (CPG) brand in Europe to put a QR code on the packaging. The QR code meant that customers could scan the code to learn about the journey of the products, which translated to an 8% rise in sales.</p>



<p>With ESG being so important today, here are some of the best ways of managing your ESG risk and identifying your organization’s gaps:</p>



<p>1. Conduct ESG assessments. Like any risk assessment, this process typically involves a thorough review of the company’s operations and supply chain to identify potential ESG risks and opportunities. It can be conducted with a similar process to a Cyber Security Assessment with a consultant (gathering data, conducting stakeholder interviews, and analyzing existing policies and practices). This process can be accelerated by using technology to analyze benchmark data such as that supplied by <a href="https://www.prevalent.net/">Prevalent</a> (one of IBM’s partners). The resultant assessment should quantify the likelihood of any risk occurring and potential impact of any identified risk.</p>



<p>2. Remediate risks and put together implementation plans. Once an ESG assessment has been completed, the organization should develop and implement strategies to remediate identified ESG risks and opportunities within an agreed upon timeframe. The likelihood of the risk occurring (and the impact should it happen) would inform the prioritization process.</p>



<p>For example, if the assessment identified that environmental risks related to carbon emissions were a priority, the implementation plan might include initiatives to reduce energy consumption, increase renewable energy usage or invest in carbon offset projects.</p>



<p>3. Monitor and track ESG performance. Companies should monitor and track ESG performance, using metrics such as carbon emissions, human rights violations and labor practices. This can involve using technology solutions such as <a href="https://www.prevalent.net/">Prevalent</a> to collect and analyze data, and then engaging with suppliers to improve performance.</p>



<p>4. Collaborate with suppliers.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/R6RO7REX"> The 2023 IBM IBV study</a> found only 20% of organizations are integrating ESG metrics into supply chain operations. Companies should collaborate with their suppliers to improve ESG performance and sustainability by agreeing on clear ESG goals and standards, as well as providing them with the necessary education and support to meet these standards. For example, companies can provide their suppliers with ESG training on how to improve their labor practices, environmental management and governance. Furthermore, companies could incentivize their suppliers by offering long-term contracts or bonuses should they reach a certain ESG standard or score.</p>



<p>In conclusion, managing ESG risk in the supply chain is crucial for businesses to mitigate financial and reputational risks, comply with regulations and drive better financial performance. ESG risk can be managed in a similar way to any other type of risk in the business. Board members are increasingly prioritizing ESG, and adapting existing methods and techniques can ensure that high-quality risk assessments can be conducted.</p>

				<p>We’ve released the latest version of the Trinsic SDK—version 1.11.0. In this release, we’ve made two important product updates that make building with Trinsic easier and more accessible. The updates include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Deprecating the Account API (potential for breaking changes)  Adding React Native &amp; Flutter support  <p>Below, we’ll dive deeper into these improvements and discuss what it means for you as a product builder.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Deprecating the Account API 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>This product update is particularly relevant for those who already have integrations with Trinsic. We decided to deprecate the Account API, making it easier for developers to create and interact with wallets. All the capabilities that were found in the Account API can now be found in the Wallet API; however, they are done differently, so updating to the latest SDK may cause breaking changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, we have prepared a migration guide on <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/resources/migrate-account/">how to migrate from the Account API to the Wallet API</a> in our documentation. Always feel free to reach out to the Trinsic team over <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/trinsiccommunity/shared_invite/zt-pcsdy7kn-h4vtdPEpqQUlmirU8FFzSQ">Slack</a> or <a href="mailto:support@trinsic.id">email</a> if you get stuck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, If you are not wanting to make these changes now and want to keep using the current SDK version, we are continuing to support the backend for it. However, as soon as you do update to the newest SDK, you will need to migrate the methods in the Account API to the Wallet API.</p>

				<p>We also made the decision to remove the authentication tokens using Oberon. This means developers no longer need to set up the native library linking, which caused a lot of friction when working with certain languages or environments like Go or Android. Now, we use simple bearer tokens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, this change allows us to provide some additional platform support. We are excited to announce that we support React Native with the <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/web/">Typescript SDK</a>.

<p>The quantum threat is out there. And it’s not a matter of “if”, but a matter of “when”. While the specific “when” is unknown, it’s generally accepted that in anywhere from 7-10 years a quantum computer will be capable of breaking the traditional public key cryptography in use today.</p>
<p>While that might seem pretty far out, we do know that the steps to get ready and then ultimately migrate to post quantum (PQ) cryptography will take several years. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">We’re not talking about a crypto refresh cycle here.</a> We’re talking about something an order of magnitude more involved and challenging than anything that’s been done before. That’s why we are of the position that the time to prepare for post quantum is now. And we are not alone in that thinking.</p>
<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the news, I’m sure you’ve noticed the uptick in government action that’s been taking place around PQ lately. And this has been happening at a global level. What’s nice about some of these directives is that they are providing (or in our case validating) the blueprint for what needs to be done in order to prepare for post quantum.</p>
<p>This past September the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/the-nsa-releases-a-post-quantum-preparedness-timeline-that-begins-immediately/">NSA released the CNSA 2.0 Timeline</a> which advised that algorithms for software and firmware signing, should begin transitioning immediately. The algorithms they recommend implementing are based on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">NIST round 3 finalist algorithms</a>, which were announced last summer. They’re not trying to get ahead of the process by publishing these requirements ahead of the final selections for standardization, but rather hoping that it will generate awareness of what needs to be done and allow time to “plan and budget for the expected transition”.</p>
<p>Last spring and prior to the NSA announcement, the White House had issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/">“National Security Memorandum on Promoting United States Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems”.</a> It then followed up with <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf">another memo</a> in November 2022 which provided additional direction and some clear actions to federal agencies in preparing for the migration to PQC. The first two steps were:</p>
 
 Designate a lead. The memo stated that within 30 days (which brought us to December 28, 2022), agencies needed to designate a lead for collecting cryptographic information systems. This should be the first step for any organization in order to ensure there is central ownership and oversight over the strategy and transition. 
 Perform a cryptographic inventory. The memo then clearly requires agencies to inventory cryptographic hardware and software systems by May 4, 2023. Whether ensuring you have the right technology in place to support the requirements of PQC, or ensuring visibility into all your cryptographic assets (keys, certificates, etc.), this will likely be one of the more challenging and time consuming tasks. It will also help determine if you’re <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/">crypto agile</a> which will be key when it comes to implementing PQC. 
 
<p>While final implementation direction and migration strategies are still to come, the memo also suggests that agencies should be working with their vendors to identify post quantum cryptography testing opportunities within their networks. This will be critical universally as standards (when they come) are one thing, but approved working deployments are another. And the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7535">“Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act”</a> indicates that agencies will need to quickly migrate to quantum resistant systems once those standards are identified.</p>
<p>So, all eyes will remain on the NIST PQC Competition to see what the final recommendations for standardization are, but in the meantime, there is much to do. And it really is time to get going.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/usa">RSA Conference</a> is one of the seminal cybersecurity conferences globally, providing a unique opportunity to learn, network, and share ideas with experts and peers in the field. The majority of the event is taken up by the exhibition hall, where vendors from around the world showcase their latest cybersecurity products and services. This is a key event for Entrust and we are always looking for new ways to drive exceptional experiences for our customers that are true to our brand.</p>
<p>We have often, like many other attending organizations, used small gifts or “swag” to thank visitors for coming by our booth. This year Entrust is taking a different approach: We have decided to align more closely to our corporate values and brand by replacing swag with charitable donations. We have a corporate initiative called “Entrust Cares,” which is our global giving and volunteer program where we give back to the community, and we felt this was a great opportunity to further it.</p>
<p>We trialled the “demo for donation” concept at an event in Barcelona at the beginning of 2023 with encouraging feedback from customers, partners, and the community. This year the RSAC 2023 theme, “Stronger Together,” spurred us on to do it again. To borrow from the RSA event messaging: “We are a community of many. No one goes it alone; we build on each other’s diverse knowledge to create the next breakthrough.” We see this initiative as a small way of delivering on that vision.</p>
<p>We have chosen organizations that make an impact by helping the next generation of tech superstars, ensuring they have the resources to reach their full potential, regardless of their gender, race, or economic background. We’ve decided that for every visitor that engages with us at our booth, we will donate $10 to one of these charities.</p>
<p>The charities we have selected for this event are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://everychildonline.co.uk/">Every Child Online</a> – A charity that provides refurbished PCs, laptops, and tablets to underprivileged children for free. The charity’s goal is to help close the digital divide and improve the quality of digital education offered in schools. 
 <a href="https://code.org/">CODE</a> – An education innovation nonprofit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education. 
 <a href="https://www.technovation.org/about/">Technovation Girls</a>&nbsp;– A global charity that equips young women to become tech entrepreneurs and leaders. With the support of volunteer mentors and parents, girls work in teams to code mobile apps that address real-world problems. 
 
<p>As well as feeling good about helping support one of these fantastic charities, visitors will receive a unique thank you card that includes details of the chosen charity and website.</p>
<p>Be sure to visit us at RSAC April 24-26 at booth #6445 North to support one of these great causes.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

<p>Coinfirm is proud to announce its support for a new stablecoin, the EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), launched by Societe Generale-FORGE, a fully integrated and regulated subsidiary of Societe Generale group dedicated to digital assets. This innovative stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value and is deployed in Euro denomination on the Ethereum public<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain.</a></p>



<p>The EUR CoinVertible is an<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/erc-20/"> ERC-20 </a>based institutional euro stablecoin, with a maximum total supply of 10,000,000 EURCV. As a stablecoin, it is designed to maintain a stable value against the Euro, with its market capitalization also equaling 10,000,000 Euro. This project is a pioneering effort by Societe Generale, a major European bank, which demonstrates the growing importance and acceptance of digital assets in the financial sector.</p>



<p>This stablecoin aims to provide a robust settlement asset for on-chain transactions, innovative solutions for corporate treasury, cash management and cash pooling activities, on-chain liquidity funding and refinancing solutions, and a solution for intra-day liquidity needs, such as margin calls. EUR CoinVertible is backed by stringent collateral eligibility criteria, ensuring the complete segregation of the collateral assets held to back the value of the stablecoins from the issuer.</p>



<p>The launch of the EUR CoinVertible by Societe Generale-FORGE signifies the increasing adoption of digital assets by traditional financial institutions, bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem. </p>



<p>Coinfirm, as a blockchain analytics platform, supports and covers the stablecoin by providing analytics and insights from a security and compliance perspective.</p>



<p>The inclusion of the EUR CoinVertible on Coinfirm’s platform is an important development as it helps to enhance the stablecoin’s transparency, security, and adherence to relevant regulations. Coinfirm’s expertise in blockchain analytics plays a vital role in monitoring and analyzing the stablecoin’s activities, further bolstering investor confidence in this innovative<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset.</a></p>

 Introducing Dynamic NAV Updates For Open-Ended Subscriptions 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in April 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We are excited to unveil our latest&nbsp;Open-Ended Subscription&nbsp;solution for the subscription module. It enables tokenization of open-ended investments by allowing issuers to dynamically update the valuation of tokenized securities for their offerings.</p>
 What is the&nbsp;Open-Ended Subscription&nbsp;solution? 
<p>The&nbsp;Open-Ended Subscription&nbsp;is a primary market solution tailored for securities that are continuously available for investors to acquire. These securities are subject to periodic fluctuations in share prices, typically on a daily basis for UCITS or REITs, thereby enabling investors to redeem their shares directly from the issuer upon exiting.</p>
<p>The solution provides issuers with the ability to update prices for tokenized shares using our compliant, blockchain-based infrastructure. As a result, open-ended financial instruments can offer investors an e-commerce-like experience.</p>
<p>We have listed a few benefits below:</p>
 
 Direct Distribution:&nbsp;Investors can directly visit the investment offering website, complete qualification, and place orders. This reduces distribution fees by avoiding intermediaries between the issuer and the end distributor. 
 24/7 Subscriptions:&nbsp;Investors can seamlessly invest in tokenized securities whenever they please on the platform. 
 Digital Experience:&nbsp;The subscription process is fully digital, encompassing document signing and payment processing. Back-office automation facilitates seamless management of subscriptions for thousands of investors, eliminating operational hassles. 
 Real-time Allocation:&nbsp;Once the new valuation is set, investors receive their tokenized securities directly minted into their wallets. 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 What are the use cases and ultimate benefits? 
<p>This solution is ideally suited for open-ended investment offerings, such as UCITS, REITs, mutual funds, hedge funds, and ETFs. In most instances, these open-ended funds require updating the NAVs of shares to accurately represent the value of the fund’s underlying securities at the close of each trading day.</p>
<p>The new solution empowers fund managers to execute NAV updates directly on their tokenization platform. While the traditional financial industry has already well-established processes for NAV updates,&nbsp;the true advantage resides in the digital, transparent, and real-time experience provided to investors throughout the subscription process. Furthermore, the advantages extend post issuance, allowing investors not only to use these tokenized assets in DeFi as collateral for borrowing, but also to deposit them in a liquidity pool for earning extra yield.</p>
<p>Moreover, this solution serves as a crucial facilitator for tokenizing open-ended funds or other assets that necessitate frequent NAV updates during primary offerings. In doing so, it enables access to global investors, reduces costs, and enhances liquidity.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) recently released <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/governance/shared/files/ecb.degov230424_progress.en.pdf">the third progress report</a> on the digital euro, presenting design and distribution options endorsed by the Governing Council, and a study detailing the views of people on the features of a potential digital wallet. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the key findings of both publications and their implications for the digital euro project.</p>



 Key Insights: 



  Digital euro accessibility: Initially, the digital euro would be available to euro area residents, merchants, and governments, with potential cross-currency functionalities with other central bank digital currencies outside the euro area. The report states that “non-resident euro area citizens might also have access, provided that they held an account with a euro area-based payment services provider (PSP).” 



 Distribution via PSPs: The Governing Council proposes that the digital euro could be distributed via PSPs, as defined in the Payment Services Directive (PSD2). It could be made available to euro area residents via existing banking apps or via an app provided by the Eurosystem offering a harmonized entry point for basic payment functionalities provided by PSPs. 



 Core and additional services: Supervised intermediaries (e.g., banks distributing digital euro) would be required to provide a set of mandatory core services to end-users and could offer additional services, such as conditional payments or splitting person-to-person payments among multiple parties. 



 Digital wallet features: The study commissioned by the ECB found that most participants were interested in trying some of the digital wallet features presented. The concrete findings are relevant to the design features of a possible digital euro. 
 <blockquote>
<p></p>
Executive Board member Fabio Panetta said, “We value the views and needs of our fellow Europeans very highly. We listen to them. The digital euro project is for the people of Europe.”</blockquote>



 Digital Euro Timeline 



<p>Digital Euro Timeline. Source: www.ecb.europa.eu</p>



 Key Findings from the Study: 



  Person-to-person transfers: The study shows that person-to-person money transfers across the euro area are considered an essential feature for a digital wallet. 



 Offline payments: Participants valued offline payments, which are currently not widely available, as a useful feature when, for example, someone has limited connectivity. 



 Budget management tools and conditional payments: Participants also valued budget management tools and conditional payments, including payment on delivery and pay-per-use. 
  Next Steps:  



<p>In autumn 2023, the Governing Council will review the outcome of the investigation phase and decide whether to move on to a subsequent project phase, in which the necessary technical solutions and business arrangements to provide a digital euro could be developed and tested. The decision on the possible issuance of a digital euro will depend on legislative developments with regard to a regulation to establish and govern essential aspects of the digital euro, which would be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, following a proposal by the European Commission. The ECB will accommodate any necessary adjustments that may emerge from legislative deliberations in the design of the digital euro.</p>

 Introducing Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) — The Revolutionary Layer 0/1 Protocol Launches its Most Anticipated Mainnet&nbsp;Upgrade  After years of hard work and dedication, on the fifth anniversary, the worldwide Verus community is excited to announce the launch of the highly anticipated mainnet upgrade on May 21. The Public Blockchains as a Service release marks a major milestone for Verus and the entire cryptocurrency industry.  ⏱️ PBaaS activation: block height 2,546,600 (Sunday 21 May&nbsp;2023) <p>Upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 21, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. <a href="http://www.verus.io/wallet">Download here</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Testnet release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Turning the Crypto Industry on its&nbsp;Head <p>The wide cryptocurrency industry will see how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for true decentralization in cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.</p><p>Once PBaaS is live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all&nbsp;kinds.</p> Core Capabilities <p>The core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here’s a partial&nbsp;list):</p> Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) — Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol <p>To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we’ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for&nbsp;years.</p> VerusID Content Multimaps — Unlimited Provable Data for Every&nbsp;VerusID <p>Of course this upgrade retains all of the groundbreaking capabilities already available with VerusID, including multisig options, separate revocation and recovery authorities for maximum security to prevent theft of identity or funds, and the ability to timelock your ID, enabling you to even thwart attempts to access your funds after someone compromised your secret&nbsp;keys.</p><p>With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs also gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This data can be encrypted or published in the clear and used for any purpose or application, whether social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don’t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in&nbsp;history.</p> Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency&nbsp;Launches <p>Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum’s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain</p><p>Verus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched&nbsp;it.</p><p>All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>Verus also enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.</p> Decentralized Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called “vETH” on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:</p>  Auto conversion of fees from Verus &lt;-&gt; Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket  Permissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a “mapped currency”, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a&nbsp;gateway.  Decentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of ½ the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum.   The Verus Fee Pool and&nbsp;Rewards <p>Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain “fee pool”, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block&nbsp;rewards.</p> To know more about Verus PBaaS capabilities <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-announces-new-multicurrency-multichain-defi-protocols-and-immediate-public-availability-of-f1868f259ce5">read this article</a>&nbsp;🔗  A Historic Move&nbsp;Forward <p>For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusVision.pdf">Verus Vision Paper</a>, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen’s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path&nbsp;forward.</p><p>As a community, we do not promise, we describe a shared vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases described in the first vision paper together, it is time for each of us to also consider what we might personally want to build or be part of building over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (<a href="https://www.valu.earth">Valu/Arkeytyp</a>, <a href="https://chips.cash">CHIPS</a>, vDEX, <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a>, <a href="https://cragslist.hopto.org">cragslist</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joefromthehills/status/1635769270708649988?s=20">Electricty Supply Board of Ireland</a> and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we’ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2,546,600.</p> Join the community.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — April 17th to April&nbsp;23rd <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, where we spotlight key regulatory shifts and their potential influence on the digital world. This week, we examine the UK’s plan to introduce specific crypto regulations within the next year, the EU’s approval of the MiCA legislation, Abu Dhabi seeks feedback on their proposed DLT structure, and the implementation of anti-money laundering guidelines for Indian crypto exchanges.</p><p>Dive in with us as we explore these vital developments shaping the future of the crypto landscape.</p> UK to Introduce Crypto Regulations Within a&nbsp;Year <p>The UK government plans to introduce specific cryptocurrency regulations within the next year, according to Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the UK Treasury.</p><p>The consultation period for proposed regulations ends on 30&nbsp;April.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1648380373632532493?s=20">Image Source</a><p>Griffith said the UK could use existing regulations and new ones to regulate crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>“Wherever possible, we want to see the same asset, the same transaction regulated in the same way. But there are some additional opportunities in the crypto asset or distributed ledger space, and we want to take advantage of that,” said Griffith.</p><p>The aim is to position the UK as a crypto-friendly location for firms to set up&nbsp;shop.</p><p>The Financial Services and Markets Bill is currently passing through Parliament and includes provisions for asset-backed stablecoins.</p> EU Approves&nbsp;MiCA <p>The European Parliament has approved the Market in Crypto-assets (MiCA), a regulatory framework that seeks to establish clear standards for the cryptocurrency industry.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1649018863298703361?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The new crypto licensing policy got approved with a vote of 517–38 in&nbsp;favor.</p><p>Legislators insist that MiCA will prevent incidents like the collapse of FTX and other scandals that plagued the industry last&nbsp;year.</p><p>The legislation on stablecoins will reportedly come into effect in July 2024, while the broader rules on crypto providers will come live in January&nbsp;2025.</p> Abu Dhabi Seeks Feedback on Proposed DLT Framework <p>The ADGM Registration Authority is currently seeking input on its proposed legislative framework that focuses on disclosures, liquidation, and governance structures for distributed ledger technology (DLT).</p><p>The consultation paper, titled “DLT Foundations Regulations 2023,” aims to create a tailored legislative framework that considers the features that might be attractive to developers of DLT projects, including DAOs.</p><p>The proposed regulations are focused on service type and governance matters and include provisions for reporting, disclosure, publication, insolvency, and liquidation measures. Comments on the proposed framework must be submitted by May&nbsp;12.</p><p>The UAE has been working on establishing regulations to attract blockchain and crypto firms to the region, with Dubai enacting a crypto regulatory framework earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Just last week, the UAE introduced federal licensing requirements for&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Anti-Money Laundering Rules For Indian Crypto Exchanges <p>India’s financial sector watchdog, the Financial Intelligence Unit, has shared a set of suggested rules with Indian crypto exchanges to tighten controls over crypto&nbsp;trading.</p><p>The rules are likely to be formalized by April 21 and cover proper KYC checks for customers, transaction monitoring, staff training on money laundering prevention, and risk review of products.</p><p>They also require compliance with the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule and cover storage of crypto assets in cold wallets and donations made to non-governmental organizations using digital tokens. These rules will also cover asset tokenization firms operating in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Indian cryptocurrency exchanges are also in talks with the government to establish formal regulations for reporting and monitoring illicit transactions, such as those related to money laundering.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU Parliament Greenflags MiCA: Potential Impact on the Crypto Landscape</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/us-congress-at-odds-over-stablecoin-regulation">US Congress at Odds Over Stablecoin Regulation</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1649781648156753920?s=20">Australia’s AML/CTF Laws Undergo Major&nbsp;Reforms</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Jabil isn’t just a manufacturer, they are experts on global supply chain, logistics, automation, product design and engineering solutions. They are also interested and involved in the holistic application of emerging technologies like additive manufacturing, autonomous technologies, and artificial intelligence. They are a technologically motivated enterprise, so it’s no surprise that they would apply this forward-thinking view to their finance reporting as well.</p>



<p>Jabil is a sizable operation with over 260,000 employees across 100 locations in 30 countries. The world’s leading brands rely on Jabil’s unmatched breadth and depth of end-market experience, technical and design capabilities, manufacturing know-how, supply chain insights and global product management expertise. When you add to that the diverse needs of their clients and partners in healthcare, aerospace, telecommunications, and consumer industries, you can see why they would be interested in continuing to enhance financial reporting.</p>



 Efficient management of an incredibly complex supply chain 



<p>Jabil is a longtime partner and IBM Business Analytics (BA) portfolio user. The portfolio contributes to the efficient management of their incredibly complex supply chain.</p>



<p>Switching to IBM Business Analytics gave Jabil the ability to gather and structure data in a centralized approach for management. The integrated solution plays a role in reporting, analysis, planning and forecasting.</p>



<p>IBM Cognos Controller offers Jabil a simplified automated consolidation process that management can use to steer business performance. The solution shifts time spent away from gathering data and report creation and allows for increased focus on understanding insights and acting on them.</p>



<p>Using IBM’s Business Analytics portfolio, Jabil was able to streamline the financial reporting process. With the ability to “steer the ship” in real time, Jabil can easily bring in new business. Since the solutions are scalable, new customers are efficiently onboarded and integrated into Jabil’s finance reporting.</p>



<p>All of this provides leadership with the ability to see trends across their customer base and physical plants. Leaders can develop effective best practices, working practices and drill down on data to respond effectively, providing Jabil with total business analytics throughout their organization.</p>



 Keeping it small, keeping it connected 



<p>The first tools Jabil implemented were Cognos Controller and TM1 (now rebranded as Planning Analytics with Watson) as part of an overall finance transformation. They were interested in powerful tools that could handle a variety of use cases outside of management reporting, like tax provisioning, treasury cash forecasting, reporting, and modeling for finance. Cognos Controller and Planning Analytics proved to be durable, scalable, and sufficiently powerful.</p>



<p>In most organizations when an IT team finishes a project, they move on to another project and a support team takes over the finished project. At Jabil, the developers that build a project own it for the duration. From a skills point of view, developers are the ideal support staff to keep applications up and running.</p>



<p>“We can bring in more investments and the IT team can handle it. We’re working in a weeks and months timeframe where others are taking months and years. We can’t even see where the bar used to be.” —Patrick Patterson, Senior Director Finance Digital Transformation, Jabil</p>



 Knowledgeable partners drive success 



<p>For 15 years, IBM and Jabil have been integrating successful solutions with Cognos. No tool is perfect, and the leaders at Jabil understood that they would need a dedicated partner for the duration. A partner ready to invest in the tool and help with solutions and troubleshooting. IBM has been that partner.</p>



<p>“Data security, accuracy and the ability to adapt to change with speed, puts Cognos Analytics and Planning Analytics ahead of many other solutions.” —Patrick Patterson, Senior Director Finance Digital Transformation, Jabil</p>

<p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer">Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide</a>, and the use of chemotherapy drugs is a critical component of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), the availability of high-quality, effective chemotherapy medicine is limited due to the prevalence of substandard or falsified drugs. These drugs not only fail to treat cancer effectively but can also cause severe side effects, leading to patient harm and loss of life.</p>
 The high cost of fake cancer drugs&nbsp; 
<p>The problem of substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs in LMICs is multi-faceted, with many underlying causes. One of the primary reasons for the problem is in many cases the limited capacity within regulatory agencies to detect and remove these drugs from circulation. This is changing as more resources are directed to the issue, which ARTiFACTS is proud to support (more on that below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to the problem is the cost of legitimate chemotherapy drugs. Many of the most effective chemotherapy drugs are developed and manufactured by large pharmaceutical companies, and the high prices associated with these drugs mean that they are often out of reach for patients in LMICs. This creates a market for counterfeiters to produce cheaper, but ineffective and potentially harmful substandard or falsified alternative medicines.</p>
<p>The consequences of using substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs can be devastating. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7113131/">These drugs often do not contain the active pharmaceutical ingredients</a> required to treat cancer effectively, meaning that patients do not receive the intended therapeutic benefit. In some cases, the drugs may contain harmful impurities or contaminants that can cause severe side effects and even death. Additionally, patients may experience a delay in receiving appropriate treatment as a result of using ineffective drugs, leading to disease progression and poorer health outcomes.</p>
 A broad but targeted approach&nbsp; 
<p>Addressing the problem of substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs in LMICs requires a multi-pronged approach:&nbsp;</p>
 
 A global effort between government regulatory bodies, pharma, and tech partners to increase the availability of high-quality chemotherapy drugs in LMICs. This could involve working with pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost of drugs or encouraging the development of cheaper, but still effective, generic alternatives. Additionally, there could be an emphasis on increasing local manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on imported drugs. 
 An increased focus on patient awareness and education. Patients should be empowered to take an active role in their treatment and be aware of the signs of counterfeit drugs, such as changes in packaging or labeling. 
 A concerted effort to strengthen regulatory frameworks and increase the capacity of regulatory agencies to track, trace, detect and remove counterfeit drugs from circulation. This could involve working with international organizations and governments to provide training and technical support to regulatory agencies in LMICs.&nbsp; 
 
 Expanding Verify for the specialised needs of chemotherapy drugs 
<p>As we’ve said before, chemotherapy drugs are particularly vulnerable to substandard or falsified medicines entering the supply chain due to their higher value. ARTiFACTS Verify is being deployed by the Lieberman Lab at the University of Notre Dame in their critical research into the prevalence of substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs and the impact on patients and healthcare systems in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our role in supporting the Lieberman Lab and its network of healthcare providers in Africa is designed to fill a critical gap in conventional track and trace solutions for chemo drugs. Capturing new data fields and automating the workflow makes identification of samples easier and more reliable, without requiring special training for hospital staff or lab technicians. You can find full details of how Verify works <a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Funded by a grant from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institute of Health</a>, this project to track and trace potential substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs will initially include Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi.&nbsp;</p>
 Working together to track and trace substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs&nbsp; 
<p>In conclusion, the problem of falsified and substandard chemotherapy drugs in LMICs is a complex issue with many underlying causes. However, with concerted efforts across governments, pharmaceutical companies and technology solutions to strengthen regulatory frameworks, increase the availability of high-quality drugs, and improve patient education and awareness, progress can be made towards addressing this critical public health issue.</p>

The catch is that most APIs can’t and shouldn’t let just anybody access your important resources.

  <p>Integrating with an API lets you power up your code by knowing what the API knows and doing what the API can do. The catch is that most APIs can’t and shouldn’t let just anybody access your important resources. Just as humans log in to access resources, programs accessing APIs must obtain proper authorization.</p>

<p>Your application can use two types of authorization mechanisms when calling Okta APIs from your Okta integration, each with its pros and cons:</p>
 
   API Tokens 
   OAuth 2.0 
 

<p>Let’s better understand the two types, how they work, and when to use them.</p>

<p>Table of Contents</p>
 
   <a>API Tokens</a> 
   <a>OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials</a> 
   <a>Decide which API authorization mechanism to use</a> 
   <a>Learn more about connecting to Okta APIs using OAuth Client Credentials</a> 
 

 API Tokens 

<p>If you’ve connected with APIs before, you’ve probably copied a token and pasted it into the Authorization header of your HTTP request. Token authorization has several notable drawbacks, including when connecting to Okta APIs.</p>

<p>You can create API tokens from the Okta Admin Console. The Admin Console only shows you the token value upon creation, so you’ll need to capture the value and securely persist it in a credentials manager. When you use the API token, you’ll add it to the Authorization header of the call using the proprietary <code>SSWS</code> scheme.</p>

   <code>GET /api/v1/groups?limit=10 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: SSWS api_token
Accept: application/json
Host: dev-1234567.okta.com
</code>   

<p>When an Okta user creates an API token, it has all of the user’s permissions, which are rarely the best choice for an automated workflow. The user represented by the token becomes a single point of failure:</p>
 
   The automation may break if their permissions are reduced, or the user leaves the organization. 
   If the user’s permissions are increased, the automation may silently gain the ability to cause unexpected problems if it has a bug. 
 

<p>All Okta API tokens automatically expire after being unused for 30 days to mitigate the security risks of old tokens falling into the wrong hands. A user can revoke tokens anytime from the Admin Console, and deleting no longer needed tokens is a good idea.</p>

<p>Considerations for using API tokens</p>

<p>It can be tempting to create a service account in Okta and use an API token from the service account, but this approach only moves the underlying problem rather than solving it. Managing access to the service account is complex, and mistakes can cause problems wherever the service account has access. Additionally, if the service account’s token accidentally becomes publicized, anyone who gets the token can impersonate the service account.</p>

<p>When to use API tokens</p>

<p>Due to these constraints, API tokens are never the preferred authorization method for Okta’s APIs. If you’re ever in a situation where you “have to” use API tokens in production because OAuth or a service integration won’t work, we’d love to hear about it! Let us know in the comments below, or discuss the challenges with your Okta representative.</p>

 OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials 

<p>OAuth has a standard flow for machine-to-machine communication called Client Credentials, the preferred way for processes without user input to communicate to Okta APIs. Using OAuth mechanisms enables you to use a well-known standardized format with fantastic support in libraries, frameworks, and languages of your choice. You can create an API Services application in the Okta Admin Console or use the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven’t used OAuth Client Credentials before, a quick overview is as follows:</p>
 
   You’ll create the Okta API Services application and configure the Okta API Scopes you want this application to have. When you make the Okta application, you’ll receive a Client ID and a Client Secret to add to your Okta configuration in your program. 
   Your program calls the authorization server’s token endpoint to exchange the Client ID and Client Secret for an access token. The access token contains the Okta API Scopes allowed. There may be <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/">Okta SDKs</a> that help support this token call for you, depending on your language and framework.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note
If you have a custom authorization server, such as when using a Okta Developer Edition org, you’ll have to use signed JSON Web Token (JWT) using a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). Read more about how to do this on the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/main/">Implement OAuth for Okta</a> developer documentation.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   When you use the access token to call Okta APIs, you’ll add the token to the Authorization header using the <code>Bearer</code> scheme. 
 

   <code>GET /api/v1/groups?limit=10 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer access_token
Accept: application/json
Host: dev-1234567.okta.com
</code>   

<p>Considerations with using OAuth</p>

<p>The preferred method is using OAuth to call Okta APIs. It’s more secure, and using widely available standards makes the calling process require less manual code. You’ll configure the scopes you want the process to access, which aren’t tied to a specific user. But you’ll need to get the access token before making the API call.</p>

<p>When to use OAuth authorization</p>

<p>You should use OAuth as the preferred authorization mechanism for communication with Okta APIs, including machine-to-machine communications. A widely accepted industry standard like OAuth affords the most security and scope flexibility.</p>

<p>But, if you create an API Service application in Okta to share it outside of your organization, you delegate the scope configuration to the customer as part of their process of setting up an API Service application. There’s a temptation for potential customers to either allow too much access or, conversely, limit access, causing frustrations that your integration needs fixes to work as intended.</p>

<p>Use API Service Integrations</p>

<p>API Service Integrations powers up your API integration applications using OAuth! Your API Integration becomes more discoverable to potential customers with improved handling for scopes. You can submit your integration to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/okta-integration-network/">Okta Integration Network (OIN)</a>, which makes your integration available in the OIN catalog. Potential customers can find your integration to add to their Okta org. Plus, as part of the submission process, you define the scopes your integration needs beforehand. Customers can see those scopes in the OIN catalog. Transparency in the required resources will help them feel more comfortable using your integration.</p>

<p>When creating integrations listed in the OIN, you can test your integration as part of the submission process. The OIN Manager provides a mechanism to create a local service app instance in your org to test your integration before you finalize the submission.</p>

 Decide which API authorization mechanism to use 

<p>When calling Okta APIs, we recommend using OAuth 2.0, and API Service Integrations if you create an API integration for the OIN. If you have limitations using OAuth 2.0 for your use case, use API Tokens.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn more about connecting to Okta APIs using OAuth Client Credentials 

<p>API tokens are the simplest, but this simplicity makes them too limited for production applications’ security and reliability needs. OAuth client credentials require more understanding to set up but scale indefinitely for internal use. And for code intended for use by your customers to access their Okta tenant, API Service Integrations built on top of OAuth maximize flexibility and control.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>At the most recent CA/Browser Forum (CABF) meeting in late February, Google announced its <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">Moving Forward, Together</a>Moving Forward, Together direction. This initiative includes a proposal to reduce the maximum TLS certificate validity and domain validation reuse period from the current 398 days to 90 days, which will impact many certificate subscribers. Google’s justification states:</p>
<p>“Reducing certificate lifetime encourages automation and the adoption of practices that will drive the ecosystem away from baroque, time-consuming, and error-prone issuance processes. These changes will allow for faster adoption of emerging security capabilities and best practices, and promote the agility required to transition the ecosystem to quantum-resistant algorithms quickly. Decreasing certificate lifetime will also reduce ecosystem reliance on “broken” revocation checking solutions that&nbsp;cannot fail-closed&nbsp;and, in turn, offer incomplete protection.”</p>
<p>The 90-day certificate validity does not appear to be the goal, but it’s used to encourage automation to enable faster replacement of certificates. Entrust also encourages this type of direction, as we have seen some of the certificate subscriber’s biggest issues are certificate expiry and inability to replace mis-issued certificates at a rapid pace. Automation would help to mitigate these issues.</p>
<p>To date, the CABF has had no discussions, proposals, or ballots on changing TLS certificate maximum validity period lifetimes to 90 days. We expect that any ballot to shorten the certificate validity period would take six months to a year to conclude. Also, the <a href="https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/6-CABF-F2F-58-Chrome-Browser-Update-PUBLIC.pdf">results of a Google survey</a> presented to the CABF indicates that Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555">RFC 8555</a>) is not yet ubiquitous and 58.3% of CA owners included in the Chrome Root Store do not offer ACME services. As such, we believe there will be a substantial grace period to not only allow CAs to implement ACME, but also to allow subscribers and service providers such as platform/software as a service (PaaS/SaaS) and content delivery networks (CDNs) to deploy ACME on their servers or platforms in a way that gives the subscriber the ability to decide which CA or type of certificate (OV/EV/QWAC) they would like to request and provision.</p>
<p>Even if CAs and other browsers don’t share Google’s objectives, there is a chance that Google could unilaterally make this change in its root program and force the entire industry in this direction in a time of their choosing. We hope that browsers will not make this decision unilaterally, but instead allow the decision to be made with broad industry and website owner consensus.</p>
<p>Another issue is that Google has presented no public research or factual data showing that such a change to the ecosystem is necessary or useful in many use cases. We believe there will be much discussion before a 90-day ballot will pass at the CABF as several CAs have indicated that a requirement for 90-day certificates might have far-reaching implications. There have also been several EU governmental bodies concerned over the market and competitive implications of Google’s proposal and the impact on eIDAS Qualified Website Authentication Certificate objectives, which are now being reasserted in the EU’s update of its eIDAS legislation.</p>
<p>Entrust does not believe that a maximum 90-day limit for TLS certificate lifetimes is the only method to drive automation and the deployment of ACME. Additionally, Entrust doesn’t believe that ACME is the only method for automation, or that it would be accepted by some of the most complex subscriber secure server deployments. Rather, we believe subscribers should be encouraged to deploy automation, but do not need to be discouraged by the cost and complexity of certificates with 90-day maximum validity.</p>
<p>While Entrust is not currently in favor of a mandatory 90-day certificate limit, we have no objection to 90-day certificates if that is what a website wants to use. We are always working to improve or extend its validation, issuance, and management processes, including greater use of automation through integrations with certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solutions such as Entrust Certificate Hub, AppViewX, Venafi, and ServiceNow, as well as automation through ACME v2, CMP, SCEP, and other new methods.</p>
<p>We understand that this Google proposal may be causing our customers considerable concern.

 American Banker makes the case for smarter innovation through collaboration 



<p></p>



<p>Mastercard is extending its services and technology reach, including deals with JPMorgan Chase, LSEG/Giact, Stax’s CardX and Jack Henry &amp; Associates, enabling Mastercard partners to connect merchants to payments, improve authentication and streamline transaction processing.</p>



<blockquote><p>“For the partners, the networks like Mastercard bring their technology and processing capabilities, but I think even more crucially they bring that brand and extremely high levels of trust,”&nbsp;said Gilles Ubaghs, strategic advisor for commercial banking and payments at <a href="https://aite-novarica.com">Aite-Novarica Group</a>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Mastercard’s multi-rail payments approach gives consumers more choice. Digital first and open banking offer an expansion of that choice, while ensuring transactions are easy and safe. </p>

 Reporting from the ICC Digital Trade Conference 
<p>In today’s interconnected world, supply chains and global trade are complex. With multiple entities involved in each transaction, it can be difficult to track and verify the parties involved. Yet trust, transparency and accountability are essential as we implement interoperable systems across both Government and Industry.</p>
<p>At this month’s International Chambers of Commerce (ICC) Digital Trade Conference in London, the subject of how to prepare the markets to go digital was a hot topic. Over three days, experts from the public and private sector met to discuss best practices and practical solutions to managing risk as trade and supply chains go digital.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joining a panel were experts from the GLEIF, ICC, Citi Bank, MonetaGo, and the IATBA. Unsurprisingly, the subject of a standardised, global organisation identity, specifically Legal Entity Identifiers, formed a core part of the conversation.</p>
<p>You can see the recorded panel below, or at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVEAs9qDVWg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVEAs9qDVWg</a>.</p>
 
  
 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>“If we want a transparent system where we know who owns the goods, where the goods are coming from, who the parties are, where the finance is coming from, then obviously identity is absolutely crucial. It’s in many ways a more foundational priority than other parts of the digitalisation agenda, and that’s one of the reasons why we are putting such a priority on this whole area of digital identities.”<br>
Chris Southworth, Secretary General of the ICC UK</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s step back and see where Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) come in. The LEI is the only standardised, regulated and global method to identify verified organisations. Each LEI code is unique, verifiable and provides several benefits in supply chains and global trade. Here’s a closer look at each of these benefits:</p>
<p>Efficiency: LEIs increase efficiency in supply chains and reduce costs of cross-border payments by streamlining Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes and reducing costs associated with manual data entry and verification. By providing a standardised way to identify legal entities, LEIs make it easier to enjoy paperless trade, uninterrupted trading and transaction tracking between partners.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have partnered with Ubisecure, and we are now a Validation Agent able to provide LEI to our clients, and it just made the process so much quicker and easier. And the feedback that we are receiving from onboarding is that clients are really grateful to have the service… And what benefit I can see from a client’s perspective is – they are going to have to go and get an LEI, but they also have to go through all of our onboarding KYC, sending us a lot of documentation. Who wants to do that twice? We can now get the LEI for them. So, it’s a win-win.”<br>
Deborah Hardy, SVP Citi Bank</p></blockquote>
<p>Compliance: Many regulatory bodies require organisations to have an LEI to participate in regulated financial transactions. There are currently over <a href="https://rapidlei.com/lei-regulation/">300 regulations</a> requiring or recommending the use of LEIs. LEIs are key to ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Supplier, and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. LEIs put transparency into financial transactions to help regulators identify potential risk, such as identifying the transacting organisations and understanding the group structure of parent and children companies acting as counterparties.</p>
<p>Risk Management: LEIs help manage risk in supply chains by providing transparency and visibility into the ownership structure of organisations. Potential risks, including conflicts of interest, fraud such as vendor impersonation, or corruption, can be better identified. The LEI is standardised, following a globally implemented data structure, meaning that LEIs can also help reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies in data entry.</p>
<p>Transparency: LEIs increase transparency in supply chains by providing a unique identifier for each entity involved in a transaction. The open global standard for financial information (ISO 20022) sees the LEI mandatory in SWIFT transactions and is now in go-live status. This helps ensure that all parties have access to accurate and up-to-date information about the entities they are doing business with. By providing transparency, LEIs promote financial inclusion by helping build trust among partners and suppliers, creating a level playing field for smaller or non-domestic companies to compete. Organisations that commit to obtaining and maintaining an LEI demonstrate credibility within a crowded market.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In terms of digital trade, we know that there’s a widening gap in finance. So, I think there are some strong links to having an LEI in terms of a digital readiness indicator and also a digital inclusion in digital trade.”<br>
Lisa Short, Co-Chair Digital Credentials Task Force at the International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications</p></blockquote>
<p>Standardisation: For years, organisations have needed to deal with different regional, vertical and proprietary organisation identifiers. LEIs provide an interoperable, standardised, globally implemented, way to identify legal entities across different jurisdictions and industries. This makes it easier to compare and analyse data across different organisations and sectors. By promoting standardisation, LEIs can help reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies in data entry. Such standardisation also supports sustainability initiatives by providing a way to track environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data across the supply chain. This can help organisations identify areas for improvement and make more informed decisions about their supply chain practices.</p>
<p>Data Quality: LEIs improve the quality of legal entity identification and reference data in supply chains by reducing errors and inconsistencies in data entry. This can help organisations make more informed decisions and improve the accuracy of their reporting.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I could go back in time, one of the key things I would have done is look at whichever use case you’re struggling with when it comes to legal entity, where LEI can actually add value. For me, it would have been cheaper to actually fund an LEI for every single one of my suppliers than continue to have really expensive people clean data.”<br>
Oswald Kuyler – Head of Strategy at MonetaGo Europe</p></blockquote>
<p>Integration: LEIs can be integrated with trade, onboarding and entity data management systems to improve supply chain visibility and streamline processes. New technologies broaden the reach of LEIs; for example, LEIs can be incorporated into Verifiable Credentials (see <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">vLEI</a>) and linked to blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent supply chain ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world because it is the hallmark of authenticity for a legal entity of any kind.”<br>
Drummond Reed, Steering Committee Member, Trust-over-IP-Foundation</p></blockquote>
<p>As innovators like Ubisecure drive innovative applications for LEIs, particularly to banks and business registries, it’s worth us remembering that even today LEIs are a core tool as trade and the supply chain go digital. In many ways, the journey of the LEI has only just begun.</p>

Despite the critics, industry stakeholders have been welcoming of MiCA legislation.  <p>Today marks a landmark development for the crypto landscape, as the European Parliament finally gave the go-ahead to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Act (MiCA). The new crypto licensing regime received overwhelming support from EU lawmakers, with 517 votes in favor, 38 against, and 18 abstentions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/McGuinnessEU/status/1648999671644188674?s=20">Image Source</a><p>Alongside MiCA, the European Parliament also endorsed the Transfer of Funds regulation, which is aligned with <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p><p>Transfer of Funds legislation makes it mandatory for crypto operators to verify customer identities, fostering transparency and mitigating potential illicit activities.</p> What’s Next? <p>The Markets in Crypto-Assets Act (MiCA) is currently awaiting approval from the European Council before taking&nbsp;effect.</p><p>The key provisions, particularly those related to stablecoins, are scheduled to be enforced in July 2024. The regulatory guidelines overseeing crypto-asset service providers, on the other hand, are anticipated to become fully operational by January&nbsp;2025.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1649000465139376128?s=20">Image Source</a><p>As the European Council gears up to evaluate this influential legislation, industry insiders and investors are closely monitoring its potential ramifications on the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>And although MiCA aims to offer regulatory clarity and harmonization across the European Union, the extent to which it will influence the future of digital asset innovation and growth remains uncertain.</p> MiCA under Criticism <p>While the industry at large has been welcoming of MiCA regulations, it has also faced criticism from both stakeholders and EU executives in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>Recently, European Central Bank (ECB) Supervisory Board member Elizabeth McCaul expressed concerns in a recent blog post. The proposed EU regulations for crypto assets, according to her, are inadequate and require strengthening to effectively tackle crypto-related risks.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1644325011107266561?s=20">Image Source</a><p>McCaul emphasizes that significant crypto asset service providers (CASPs) should be subjected to stricter requirements and enhanced supervision.</p><p>Acknowledging MiCA’s role in implementing safeguards to prevent FTX-type of incidents, such as robust governance and requirements for external audits, she asks for reinforcement of other&nbsp;areas.</p> Misses the Mark on&nbsp;DeFi <p><a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=591008092002067082114118082026071024057083047011093057124024027005121014070083121076006012033059126097000026119125064127000006019037091041086074078101031066103086091058061002117103031067080120118021127114123025106002101026101065120114081119114090024094&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">MiCA notably omits</a> references to the majority of segments within the broader decentralized finance space and does not address the booming crypto lending, staking, or nonfungible tokens&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>In fact, most DeFi services, such as portfolio management, insurance, and lending, remain beyond the purview of&nbsp;MiCA.</p> Industry’s Cautious&nbsp;Optimism <p>The industry’s response to MiCA has been predominantly positive, with many experts, such as Marina Markezic, Executive Director of the European Crypto Initiative, agreeing that it brings much-needed change.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/28/industry-offers-cautious-welcome-to-eus-landmark-crypto-law-mica/">Coindesk</a>, Marina highlighted how MiCA’s introduction would foster unity across Europe and bring maturity in applying crypto compliance.</p><p>That is not to say that all industry stakeholders have shown the same level of enthusiasm. Many have expressed concern about the regulations. Blockchain for Europe’s Robert Kopitsch, for example, believes the nonfungible tokens (NFTs) section is overly complicated, resulting in varying interpretations.</p><p>Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Binance’s founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/14/binance-ceo-zhao-says-eus-proposed-crypto-rules-are-fantastic-but-strict/">commented that MiCA is slightly strict on stablecoins</a>, particularly as the drafts do not accommodate USD-based stablecoins, which hold a significant market&nbsp;share.</p><p>Despite this, Zhao praised MiCA as a “fantastic” regulation at Binance Blockchain Week Paris 2022. He believes it is likely to become the global standard that other jurisdictions emulate.</p> MiCA’s Impact <p>The implementation of the MiCA carries significant implications for both crypto users and the broader ecosystem. And as the legislation is put into motion, understanding its impact on various aspects of the industry is essential.</p> User Experience and Access to&nbsp;Services <p>MiCA aims to bring regulatory clarity and consistency to crypto-asset service providers. but This also means that businesses will need to adapt to the new regulatory framework.</p><p>Users may experience some growing pains during the transition, as crypto platforms might need to modify their services to remain compliant.</p><p>In the long run, however, the uniformity provided by MiCA aims to provide a seamless and secure user experience across the European&nbsp;Union.</p> Innovation and Investment <p>While the primary goal of MiCA is to mitigate risks and ensure investor protection, the impact of the regulation on innovation within the crypto ecosystem is yet to be fully understood.</p><p>As such, the legislation could attract more institutional investors to the space, contributing to the overall growth and maturity of the industry. On the other hand, strict compliance requirements might stifle smaller startups or projects, potentially hindering innovation at the grassroots level.</p> Cross-Border Collaboration <p>One of the key benefits of MiCA is the harmonization of regulations across EU member states. This legislative alignment will likely facilitate increased cross-border collaboration and the development of pan-European blockchain initiatives.</p><p>By reducing regulatory barriers and fostering a more unified market, the act could stimulate the growth and integration of the European crypto ecosystem on a larger&nbsp;scale.</p> Privacy and&nbsp;Security <p>MiCA’s focus on transparency and consumer protection may lead to enhanced security measures across the industry.</p><p>Users can expect more rigorous <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">identity verification processes</a> and stronger anti-money laundering (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a>) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) policies. While these steps contribute to a safer environment for crypto users, privacy concerns may arise due to the increased collection of personal information.</p><p>In summary, MiCA has the potential to reshape the crypto landscape in Europe, influencing user experience, innovation, cross-border collaboration, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As the industry adapts to the new regulatory environment, the balance between fostering growth and ensuring consumer protection will be of paramount importance.</p> Final Note <p>With EI giving a go to MiCA, the crypto landscape is about to face a significant transformation.</p><p>Although most industry stakeholders embrace the clarity and harmonization MiCA aims at, it is equally crucial to address the concerns of industry stakeholders regarding its impact on crypto&nbsp;users.</p><p>The importance of striking the right balance between regulatory oversight and nurturing innovation cannot be overstated, especially at a moment when the European Council is about to assess the go-forward of&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>With the legislation taking shape, MiCA’s eventual impact on digital asset innovation and growth will be under close scrutiny within Europe and around the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>The AT Protocol already has a growing developer ecosystem. Although some protocol components are still under development, we’ve made it a priority to simplify the complexity of building on top of it. This effort extends to not only new clients, but also new experiences, such as <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">algorithmic choice</a> and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a>.</p>
<p>Today we’re shipping <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem/blob/main/app-passwords.md">app passwords</a>, a short-term solution for authentication that will let users experiment with new clients without having to fully trust them with their passwords. In the long term, we plan to implement SSO (Single Sign-On) with scoped permissions.</p>
<p>We published an <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem">atproto ecosystem overview</a> on GitHub awhile ago, but did not widely publicize it until we had an auth solution that didn’t put user credentials at risk. With the release of app passwords today, we’re ready to share it! There are AT Protocol implementations in 6 languages, and 13 clients across web, iOS, and Android: <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem">https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem</a></p>
<p>There are also many projects building on the “firehose” of Bluesky app data. Some highlights include a VR experience with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luLwADw37MM">a feed you can spatially explore</a> and an avatar that summarizes recent activity in the network for you, and a <a href="https://github.com/aliceisjustplaying/bluesky-heatmap">heatmap generator</a> that plots a user’s posts like a GitHub commit graph.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luLwADw37MM"></a></p>
Created by @antpb.xyz
<p>This is only the beginning. If you’d like to explore more, here’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OBvKfGsIpZGP6mwAatqVMXI8tsyWlfwMdGnuZprlx68/edit#gid=0">longer list of projects</a> in the atproto ecosystem so far.</p>
<p>A big part of our development philosophy has been to build on existing software stacks that make interoperability simple. For example:</p>
 
 All the data in the atproto ecosystem is valid <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> and can be manipulated and explored through <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs">existing IPFS dev tooling</a> 
 Our top level handles are simple DNS text records 
 We use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> for our identity layer 
 Our API is well specified and is simply JSON over HTTP 
 
<p>The Bluesky app demonstrates how a microblogging client can be built on the AT Protocol with an intuitive user experience. However, there is still much more to be done to fully explore the potential of this architecture.</p>
<p>Our core dev team is currently focused on finishing the AT Protocol. Our near-term priorities are open federation with account portability and shipping moderation tooling, as described in our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-2-2023-bluesky-beta-app">March update</a>. If you’d like to join the conversation, feel free to join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#bluesky-dev:matrix.org">Matrix dev chat</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for following atproto’s progress! We’re excited to share more with you soon.</p>

<p>Toronto, ON – April 20, 2023 – Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. (CSE: LQID) (the “Company” or “Liquid Avatar”) announces that it will not be in a position to file its audited consolidated annual financial statements, management’s discussion and analysis and related CEO and CFO certifications for the year ended December 31, 2022 and accompanying management discussion and analysis (the “Annual Financial Filings”) <a>by the filing deadline of May 1, 2023 due to the lack of necessary funds to timely commence the</a> audit process as part of the Annual Financial Filings of the Company.&nbsp; The Company has access to sufficient funds now and expects that the AnnualFinancialFilings will be filed prior to June 30, 2023.</p>



<p>As a result of the delay in filing, the Company has requested that the Ontario Securities Commission and other Canadian securities regulatory authorities issue a temporary management cease trade order (“MCTO”) that prohibits certain officers of the Company from trading in securities of the Company for so long as the AnnualFinancialFilings are not filed. The issuance of such MCTO would generally not affect the ability of persons who have not been directors or officers of the Company to trade in their securities.&nbsp; However, in its discretion, the Ontario Securities Commission may determine that it would be appropriate to issue an issuer cease trade order affecting all of the Company’s securities.</p>



<p>The Company intends to provide information in accordance with National Policy 12-203 – Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults with respect to further developments in respect of this matter promptly following their occurrence, including the issuance of bi-weekly status update reports for so long as the AnnualFinancialFilings are not filed.

							<p>Most of us have grown up with the warning not to trust strangers. We would never share personal details without verifying an identity or hand over $100 from our wallet to a stranger. But what happens when someone shows up in our home, asking for all of this and more?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our current age of technology and social media, the prevalence of <a href="https://blog.dentity.com/online-dating-romance-scams-how-to-protect-yourself/">online romance scams</a> has become a growing concern. As people get more comfortable navigating dating apps and social media, scammers have found new ways to exploit people who are just hoping to find love, friendship, or companionship. These crimes occur on our computers and phones, right in the safety of our homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the last few years, romance scams have become a widespread issue. In 2022 alone, they affected <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/02/romance-scammers-favorite-lies-exposed#ft2">at least 70,000 people</a> – and those are only the ones that reported their concerns. The losses stemming from romance scams in a single year topped $1.3 billion, with most people losing almost $4,500 per incident.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tactics used by scammers are becoming more sophisticated, making it difficult for even the most tech-savvy individuals to detect them. These scams are riskiest for <a href="https://www.ice.gov/features/LoveOnline">seniors aged 55 to 64</a>, but anyone can be targeted, regardless of age, gender, or sexual orientation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we’ll explore why romance scams have become so prevalent in 2023 and show how you can take steps to avoid becoming a target.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Three Factors Driving the Growth of Romance Scams  		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>While romance scams have been gaining in popularity for years, the circumstances that began developing in 2020 accelerated this trend. &nbsp;Three critical factors have been identified by experts as essential to the explosion of romance scams that have increased over the past three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Pandemic-era isolation  Our growing comfort with online dating  The rise of cryptocurrency  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The combination of these factors has been called a “<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze">combustible combination for fraud</a>” by data researchers at the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Pandemic-era Isolation <p>&nbsp;</p><p>When so many of us started isolating and socially distancing in early 2020, it began to create a deep sense of uncertainty and insecurity. Humans are social creatures and are designed to exist in groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When people were forced to stay indoors and limit their social interactions, many of us turned to online dating, social media, or other networking sites to find love and companionship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This gave scammers the perfect opportunity to prey on people’s vulnerability and loneliness. Fewer face-to-face interactions made it harder to detect red flags, such as inconsistencies in the scammer’s story or suspicious requests for money. It also separated people from their social safety nets, making them more likely to reach out to strangers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the pandemic greatly heightened many people’s emotional distress, making them more likely to fall for romantic or even platonic overtures from scammers who used flattery, affection, and the promise of a better future to cajole their victims into doing what they wanted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Growing Comfort with Online Dating <p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the percentage of the American population that has used dating sites or apps has remained consistent since 2019, what’s growing is our acceptance of these tools. There are now more choices than ever before, specifically targeted to different age ranges, demographics, and interests. People have started using them not only for romance but also to <a href="https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/what-exactly-is-bumble-bff">make friends</a> or find <a href="https://blackplatinumgold.com/looking-for-a-travel-buddy-here-are-the-5-best-platforms-that-will-help-you-instantly/">travel companions</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As more people turn to online dating and social networks to find love and connections, scammers have also found a lucrative opportunity to prey on individuals’ emotions and financial resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These apps and sites provide scammers with a large pool of potential victims, making it easier for them to create fake profiles and lure unsuspecting individuals into relationships. From there, scammers have proven time and time again that they’re happy to play the long game – often talking to their targets for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/romance-scams-booming-billions-facebook-instagram-pandemic-isolation-online-dating-2023-3">up to six months</a> before they ask for money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> The Rise of Cryptocurrency <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third factor that has combined to make romance scams so prevalent – and damaging – in 2023 is the proliferation of cryptocurrency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten years ago, crypto was solely a niche industry, but now it’s gone mainstream. Bitcoin alone has jumped in price by <a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/">311,000%</a> since it was launched on Coinbase in 2012, sparking much broader interest from the public along the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This interest can be harmful since it offers scammers the illusion of doing something innovative and potentially lucrative when they brag about “investing in crypto” to their unsuspecting targets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike gift cards or traditional currency, cryptocurrency provides scammers with an anonymous and decentralized means of receiving payments, making it easier for them to avoid detection. Romance scammers often use cryptocurrency to accept payments from their victims, since it is difficult to trace and recover once the funds are transferred.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Avoiding Romance Scams with Free Identity Verification Services <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ongoing isolation of the past few years, coupled with growing societal acceptance of both online dating and cryptocurrency, has made it easier than ever for scammers to find new targets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to avoid these scams is to ensure you know and <a href="https://blog.dentity.com/free-id-verification-for-craigslist-and-online-dating/">can verify the identity of anyone you trust online</a>. Using a free identity check tool like Dentity makes it easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://oidc.dentity.com/oidc/interaction/sign-up">Dentity</a> is simple, easy, and risk-free. The first step is to sign up and verify your identity.&nbsp; From there, you keep your identity information in a private, portable, safe and secure online wallet. Whenever you’re talking to a new person online – romantic or otherwise – you can request their verified information so they can prove that they are who they say they are. No more uncertainty, stress, or heartache.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://oidc.dentity.com/oidc/interaction/sign-up">Sign up today</a> to see for yourself.</p>

  Congress is divided on stablecoin regulation, with differing opinions on access to Federal Reserve banking services and the necessity of stablecoins.  The draft bill proposes stricter stablecoin regulations and explores the feasibility of a digital&nbsp;dollar.  As stablecoins gain momentum, governments are increasingly turning their attention to CBDCs, highlighting their key distinctions in governance, backing, and trade implications when compared to their stablecoin counterparts.  <p>As political parties divide over potential congressional action on stablecoin regulations, the future of digital assets in the United States hangs in the&nbsp;balance.</p><p>During a House hearing on Wednesday, April 19, Republicans advocated for the revival of a bipartisan bill designed to regulate stablecoin issuers and grant them access to Federal Reserve banking services.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats expressed reservations about fostering a tighter bond between the cryptocurrency and traditional banking&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Although stablecoin regulation advocates argue that digital assets extend beyond crypto speculation, enticing developers to relocate to countries with clear regulatory frameworks, critics are apprehensive about the implications of integrating cryptocurrencies into the traditional banking system without proper scrutiny.</p><p>Instead, they demand a complete bill overhaul, emphasizing that it must address recent crypto market disruptions, such as the collapse of FTX, and scrutinize the necessity of stablecoins.</p><p>A draft bill released on April 15 by the House Financial Services Committee proposes empowering the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors to oversee nonbank entities and digital asset firms aiming to issue stablecoins.</p><p>The bill delineates stricter regulations for dollar-pegged digital assets at federal and state levels while establishing interoperability, reporting, and enforcement requirements.</p><p>Furthermore, it imposes a two-year moratorium on the creation and issuance of algorithmic stablecoins and those backed by other cryptocurrencies, alongside requesting a U.S. Treasury study on the feasibility and impact of a digital dollar <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/cbdcs-101-understanding-the-basics-of-central-bank-digital-currencies">central bank digital currency</a>&nbsp;(CBDC).</p> The Possible Impact of Draft Stablecoin Rules <p>As the United States Congress wrestles with the future of stablecoin regulation, crypto enthusiasts and stakeholders keenly observe the potential repercussions of the draft stablecoin rules.</p><p>After all, the proposed legislation aims to reshape the digital currency landscape, impacting both crypto users and the ecosystem in myriad&nbsp;ways.</p><p>While the benefits of a well-regulated stablecoin market are indisputable, the draft rules’ ramifications warrant a thorough exploration. One notable advantage of the proposed regulatory framework is the bolstered trust and security it would&nbsp;offer.</p><p>By requiring stablecoin issuers to adhere to stringent guidelines, including holding sufficient reserves and undergoing regular audits, the risk of abrupt devaluations or collapses, such as the TerraUSD fiasco, diminishes.</p><p>This enhanced stability is likely to instill confidence in users, encouraging the adoption of stablecoins for everyday transactions. Moreover, consumer protection would receive a significant boost from the draft&nbsp;rules.</p><p>As stablecoin issuers comply with transparency and disclosure requirements, the likelihood of fraud or market manipulation dwindles. In turn, crypto users would enjoy a more secure environment, fostering mainstream adoption and spurring businesses to integrate stablecoins into their financial operations.</p><p>However, despite these positive implications, concerns remain regarding the draft rules’ potential drawbacks.</p><p>The increased compliance costs, for instance, may impede the growth of the stablecoin market. Operational expenses could rise for stablecoin issuers, leading to higher transaction fees or diminished services, ultimately passed on to end-users.</p><p>Additionally, the stringent regulatory environment might stifle innovation within the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/gibraltar-based-xapo-bank-to-enable-usdc-services-amidst-banking-crisis">stablecoin</a> ecosystem.</p><p>As such, emerging projects that drive novel solutions could find themselves burdened by the need to adhere to strict guidelines, hindering their ability to experiment and innovate. This could curtail the development of groundbreaking technologies in the stablecoin arena.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant concern arises from the draft rules’ potential to concentrate power among a select&nbsp;few.</p><p>By vesting authority over stablecoin issuers in the Federal Reserve and emphasizing federal and state-level regulations, the decentralized ethos that underpins the cryptocurrency ecosystem could be&nbsp;eroded.</p><p>This might lead to a less competitive market, dominated by a handful of major players and depriving the sector of the diverse perspectives that spur ingenuity.</p><p>Overall, the draft stablecoin rules represent a double-edged sword, poised to redefine the crypto landscape.</p><p>Trust, security, and consumer protection are set to improve under a regulated stablecoin market.</p><p>Nonetheless, the potential costs and constraints on innovation must not be overlooked. Striking a delicate balance between fostering stability and preserving the decentralized, pioneering spirit of cryptocurrencies will be crucial as the future of digital assets&nbsp;unfolds.</p> Stablecoins vs. CBDCs: What Should You&nbsp;Know? <p>As the world witnesses a surge in stablecoin adoption, governments face an intricate dance — confronting the implications for their financial systems while simultaneously steering toward central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a credible contender in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p><p>Amid this complex dynamic, understanding the stark contrasts between stablecoins and CBDCs becomes crucial, as it illuminates their individual roles in the rapidly transforming digital currency ecosystem.</p> What Role Do Stablecoins Play? <p>With digital currencies continuing to gain prominence in the financial world, stablecoins have emerged as a viable solution for addressing the challenges associated with traditional banking systems and crypto’s inherent volatility.</p><p>Designed to complement the fast-paced, increasingly global economy, stablecoins provide a more efficient and cost-effective means of exchanging money across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>After all, with stablecoins, users no longer require multiple international bank accounts to transact with individuals in other countries. Instead, a single crypto wallet is all that’s needed to facilitate seamless, peer-to-peer digital transfers.</p><p>This innovative approach not only reduces transaction fees and processing times but also offers a higher degree of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The decentralized, peer-to-peer nature of stablecoins also results in significant cost savings by eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries to facilitate transactions.</p><p>As a result, stablecoins have the potential to revolutionize the way individuals and businesses interact with the global financial system, providing a more accessible, efficient, and private alternative to conventional banking practices.</p> Final Note <p>With stablecoins gaining traction, the future of digital assets in the United States remains uncertain as Congress faces a sharp divide over their regulation.</p><p>The draft bill strives to strike a balance by tightening rules on stablecoins and evaluating the viability of a digital dollar CBDC. Yet, the dynamic interplay between stablecoins and CBDCs, each with their unique governance structures, backing mechanisms, and trade implications, fuels a complex debate that will ultimately shape the future of financial systems worldwide.</p><p>This high-stakes confrontation will determine which of the two digital assets — <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">versatile stablecoins or government-backed CBDCs</a> — will triumph and redefine global transactions in the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Next.js has emerged as a trailblazing framework for building decentralized applications, owing to its robust architecture and versatile features. Next.js provides developers with the right tools to create their latest project, and it can be very simple to install Sign-In with Ethereum in your Next.js app by using SSX. </p><p>This guide will show you how to set it up in just a few steps:</p>  Creating your Next.js project - you can skip this step if you already have one  Adding SSX dependencies - how to install the dependencies on your project  Setting up the Backend - how to configure your backend  Setting up the Frontend - how to configure your frontend  <p>So, let’s dive in.</p> 1) Creating a Next.js project <p>Note: if you already have a Next app, you can skip to the next section.</p><p>First, create a new Next app by running this command:</p> <code>npx create-next-app@latest
</code> <p>In this tutorial, we are using a project with the following configuration:</p> <code>✔ What is your project named? … my-ssx-dapp
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? … No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … No
✔ Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … No
✔ What import alias would you like configured? … @/*</code>  2) Adding SSX dependencies <p>To use the SSX library, you must install the <code>@spruceid/ssx</code> dependency for the frontend, and <code>@spruceid/ssx-server</code> for the backend. To add it, navigate to your app’s directory and use the following command like so:</p> <code>cd my-ssx-dapp
npm install @spruceid/ssx @spruceid/ssx-server
</code>  <br>3) Setting up the Backend <p>Let's start by adding a helper file on our code so that we don't have to instantiate a new SSX Server object directly every time. Create the file <code>pages/api/_ssx.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { SSXServer } from "@spruceid/ssx-server";

const ssx = new SSXServer();

export default ssx;
</code> <p>For more information about configuring SSX Server, you can check out our <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server?ref=blog.spruceid.com">documentation</a>.</p><p>Second, create an API route for generating a random nonce. This is used to identify the session and prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack?ref=blog.spruceid.com">replay attacks</a>. Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-nonce.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const nonce = ssx.generateNonce();
  req.cookies.nonce = nonce;
  res.status(200).send(nonce);
}
</code> <p>Third, add a sign-in API route. This route will do all necessary checks in the SIWE message, ensuring it's valid. All checks occur inside the <code>ssx.login()</code> function. Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-login.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json(
    await ssx.login(
      req.body.siwe,
      req.body.signature,
      req.body.daoLogin,
      req.body.resolveEns,
      req.cookies.nonce || "",
      req.body.resolveLens,
    )
  );
}
</code> <p>Finally, create the sign-out API route. &nbsp;Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-logout.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    success: await ssx.logout() ?? true
  });
}</code> <p><br>You can find more information about <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.generatenonce?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.generateNonce</a>, <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.login?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.login</a>, and <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.logout?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.logout</a> in the SSX documentation.</p> 4) Setting up the Frontend <p>First, we will create a new SSXComponent to wrap the sign-in/out logic. Create a new folder called <code>components</code> in the root directory, create the file <code>components/SSXComponent.tsx</code>, and add the following to it:</p> <code>import { SSX } from "@spruceid/ssx";
import { useState } from "react";

const SSXComponent = () =&gt; {

    const [ssxProvider, setSSX] = useState&lt;SSX | null&gt;(null);

    const ssxHandler = async () =&gt; {
        const ssx = new SSX({
            providers: {
                server: {
                    host: "http://localhost:3000/api"
                }
            },
        });
        await ssx.signIn();
        setSSX(ssx);
    };

    const ssxLogoutHandler = async () =&gt; {
        ssxProvider?.signOut();
        setSSX(null);
    };

    const address = ssxProvider?.address() || '';

    return (
        &lt;div className="App"&gt;
            &lt;div className="App-header"&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;SSX Example dapp&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            {
                ssxProvider ?
                    &lt;div className="App-content"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;
                            Account Info
                        &lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            {
                                address &amp;&amp;
                                &lt;p&gt;
                                    &lt;b&gt;Address:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;{address}&lt;/code&gt;
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                            }
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;button onClick={ssxLogoutHandler}&gt;
                            Sign-Out
                        &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt; :
                    &lt;div className="App-content"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;
                            Connect and Sign-In with your Ethereum account.
                        &lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;button onClick={ssxHandler}&gt;
                            Sign-In with Ethereum
                        &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
            }
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
};

export default SSXComponent;
</code> <p>This SSX configuration assumes you are running the Next.js dapp using the default port (3000). If you are running in a different port, change the <code>providers.server.host</code> in the SSX config. For more information about SSX client configuration, you can check out our <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx/ssx.ssxclientconfig?ref=blog.spruceid.com">documentation</a>.</p><p>Finally, let’s update the <code>pages/index.tsx</code> file with the following code. Add the additional imports specified, and if you generated your app using the create-next-app tool, replace the existing <code>export default function Home() {}</code> with the following:</p> <code>import SSXComponent from '@/components/SSXComponent';
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import Head from 'next/head'


const Home: NextPage = () =&gt; {

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;SSX Next Dapp&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;
      &lt;SSXComponent /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}

export default Home;
</code> <p>That's it! Now you can run the dapp by using <code>yarn dev</code> or <code>npm run dev</code>. </p><p>If you want to add some style to your new dapp, add the following to your <code>styles/globals.css</code>, but this step is completely optional:</p> <code>body {

<p>The increasing prevalence of financial crimes, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud, has led to stringent regulatory measures designed to protect consumers. These include using enhanced due diligence to verify user identities and manage risk potential.</p>
 What Is Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)? 
<p>Enhanced Due Diligence is a rigorous and comprehensive customer identification, verification, and risk assessment process that goes above and beyond standard due diligence procedures. EDD is typical in economic contexts, applied to high-risk customers or business relationships to mitigate potential financial, and legal risks associated with illicit activities.</p>
<p>EDD is a core part of most financial regulations, including <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/kyc-software/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements in the U.S.</p>
 How Does Enhanced Due Diligence Work? 
<p>EDD typically involves the following steps:</p>
 
 Identifying High-Risk Customers: Institutions assess the risk level of their customers based on factors such as occupation, location, transaction type, and associations. High-risk customers may include politically exposed persons (PEPs), individuals from high-risk jurisdictions, or those engaged in industries with higher incidences of money laundering or fraud. 
 Collecting Additional Information: EDD requires gathering more detailed information about the customer than typical due diligence. This information includes sources of wealth, sources of funds, business affiliations, transaction patterns, and intended use of the products or services. 
 Enhanced, Ongoing Monitoring: High-risk customers and transactions are subject to more frequent and thorough monitoring to detect unusual or suspicious activity, including reviews of transactions. 
 Escalating Suspicious Activities: If suspicious activity is detected during the EDD process, organizations must report it to the relevant authorities, such as the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) or other regulatory bodies. 
 Documentation: Institutions must maintain detailed records of their EDD efforts, including the information gathered, risk assessments conducted, and any actions to respond to suspicious activities. 
 
<p>Enhanced Due Diligence is crucial to an effective AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) program. By conducting EDD, organizations can better manage and mitigate the risks associated with high-risk customers and transactions, ultimately protecting their business and contributing to the global fight against financial crime.</p>
 What Are Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations, and How Does EDD Fit Into Them? 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-kyc/">KYC regulations</a> are a set of guidelines and procedures that financial institutions and other regulated entities must follow to verify the identity and assess the risk profile of their customers. The primary objective of KYC is to prevent fraud and money laundering used in organized crime and terrorism by ensuring that organizations have a thorough understanding of their customers and their transactions.</p>
<p>KYC typically involves the following steps:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/kyc-cip/">Customer Identification</a>: Collecting and verifying the customer’s personal information through personal and official <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/online-document-verification/">document verification</a>. 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Assessing the customer’s risk profile based on common threat factors around industry, nationality, etc. 
 Ongoing Monitoring: Regularly reviewing customer accounts and transactions to detect suspicious activity and ensure the customer’s information remains up-to-date. 
 Enhanced Due Diligence: When the customer rates higher risk requirements, then additional steps are taken to ensure identity and monitor activity. 
 
<p>By adhering to KYC and EDD regulations, organizations can protect their business, maintain regulatory compliance, and contribute to the global effort against financial crime.</p>
 What’s the Difference Between Customer and Enhanced Due Diligence? 
<p>Customer Due Diligence and Enhanced Due Diligence are both part of the broader KYC framework, but they differ in their scope, depth, and application. Here is a summary of the key differences between CDD and EDD:</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence: CDD is the basic level of due diligence that applies to all customers. It involves collecting and verifying the customer’s identity, understanding the nature of their business or activities, and assessing their risk profile based on geographical location, occupation, and transaction types. CDD is a standard requirement for all customers, regardless of their risk profile. 
 Enhanced Due Diligence: EDD is a more rigorous and comprehensive form of due diligence that applies to high-risk customers, transactions, or business relationships. For example, where CDD might call for official government documents verification, EDD might include videoconference or in-person interviews, identity verification, and more extensive background checks. 
 
 When Is Enhanced Due Diligence Called For? 
<p>Enhanced Due Diligence is required when a financial institution or other regulated entity identifies a high-risk customer, transaction, or business relationship. The need for EDD can arise from various factors or red flags indicating a higher potential for money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or other illicit activities.</p>
<p>Situations that may trigger the need for EDD include:</p>
 
 Politically Exposed Persons: PEPs are individuals who hold or have held prominent public positions, as well as their close family members and associates. These individuals are considered at higher risk for both corruption and blackmail. 
 High-Risk Jurisdictions: Countries with weaker AML or KYC laws might be prime targets for corrupted individuals that can sneak through CDD, and thus EDD may be called for. 
 High-Risk Industries: Some industries or business activities have a higher risk of money laundering or fraud. These include gaming and gambling, arms trading, government work, or esoteric and high-value art or real estate markets. 
 Unusual Transactions: Transactions unusually large, complex, outside typical jurisdictions, or without purpose are all red flags for EDD.

<p>In a scene from the 1980s hit movie Back to the Future, Marty (played by Michael J. Fox) does a rock guitar rendition at his parents 1950s high school dance. Leaving the crowd puzzled, he closes by saying, “you might not be ready for this yet, but your kids are going to love it.” As we look back at the evolution of hardware security modules (HSMs), innovative features have come as a result of changing security needs, and some have taken time to be widely adopted. Since their inception, HSMs have underpinned many of the technologies we now take for granted, and as they continue to evolve, they will undoubtedly play a key role in protecting the new technologies that we will depend on in the future.</p>
<p>This blog post examines how processing speed, robust security, the ability to securely run applications, deployment options, and support for strong quantum-resistant algorithms will continue to make on-premises and cloud-based HSMs indispensable components of enterprise cybersecurity strategies for generations to come.</p>
<p>A look back</p>
<p>On-premises HSMs have been around for decades, providing a root of trust to protect and manage underpinning cryptographic keys used for encryption and signing processes. They have often been perceived as mysterious devices sitting in back offices and data centers, working behind the scenes to protect everything from sensitive data to software downloads. HSMs have evolved over the years to meet the changing needs of the security landscape; most notably their design has addressed scalability, tamper protection, and ease of use and integration with the applications they support. Tamper-proofing has enabled HSMs to detect attempts to physically access or modify them, making it virtually impossible for attackers to get to the sensitive keys they store. Other aspects of their evolution have included performance improvements and support for new symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to stay up to the latest standards.</p>
<p>As the need for stronger cryptographic security grew, HSMs became more sophisticated, adding feature capabilities such as on-board secure execution that enabled complete sensitive applications to run inside their protected certified boundary. With the recent migration to cloud-based deployments, the traditional on-premises HSM model has also been transformed. Cloud-based HSM-as-a-service models are now available, offering enterprise customers the ability to consume cryptographic services without having to own and maintain the physical HSMs.</p>
<p>Today’s environment</p>
<p>A fast-paced digital environment requires organizations to process data quickly and securely. High-performance, crypto-agile HSMs provide rapid processing speeds and support for multiple hashing mechanisms and encryption algorithms. Today’s HSMs can also be configured to support custom algorithms, making them versatile for enterprises that require high levels of security and flexibility. As the need for data security continues to grow, the importance of high performance and cryptographic agility will continue to increase, making HSMs a valuable investment for enterprises that need to keep up with the latest security standards.</p>
<p>Modern HSMs also increasingly find themselves in use cases beyond traditional cryptography. These include securing more advanced applications such as blockchain, secure storage for sensitive data in cloud computing environments, and 5G cellular communications where security has been stepped up due to known vulnerabilities and potential man-in-the-middle attacks. With the rollout of 5G networks, hybrid symmetric/asymmetric algorithms, designed to validate user identity and to protect against unauthorized access, authenticate exponentially growing number of subscribers and devices. Running these algorithms within the tamper-resistant environment of an HSM has become critical for the security of these rollouts. Typically offered as certified devices, HSMs have also evolved to meet the changing needs for compliance to regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The quantum threat</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of quantum computing poses a new threat to the security provided by HSMs. Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the cryptographic algorithms (specifically asymmetric algorithms including elliptic curves) that are commonly used to secure data today. Because quantum computers can solve problems that had been considered intractable for classical computers, such as factoring large integers and solving discrete logarithm problems, the need to ensure that HSMs are ready for a post-quantum world is increasingly top of mind for many organizations.</p>
<p>To address this threat, new algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers are <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">already in development</a> under the leadership of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
<p>Way forward</p>
<p>In Back to the Future, the crowd at the dance was not yet ready for the future, but Marty was already ahead of the times. Having a unique perspective can make all the difference when it comes to preparing for evolving challenges. Today, organizations need to make the most of new revolutionary technologies such as cloud, blockchain, and others, while ensuring that their sensitive data stays safe and secure.</p>
<p>With the right security strategy and solutions, organizations can chart a secure future that addresses the performance, certifications, and cryptographic agility needs for today and tomorrow. The newly launched Entrust nShield 5 builds on the proven nShield HSM capabilities to provide enhanced performance, compliance with the latest Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140-3, certification expected Summer 2023) cryptographic robustness requirements, secure execution, and support for the new NIST-shortlisted quantum-resistant algorithms.</p>

 Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know about the newly ratified MICA crypto regulatory framework. 



 



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a>) regulation, which received a majority 517 votes from European Parliament lawmakers in favor of the crypto licensing regime in April 2023, aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector. MiCA is also likely to attract operators and users to the market, as it is the first regulatory framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) at EU level. &nbsp;</p>



 What is the meaning of MiCA?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA is a regulatory framework for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">crypto assets</a> traded on digital platforms. It covers three types of crypto assets: Utility tokens, which provide access to goods or services;- payment tokens, which are used as a means of payment or can be traded for other MiCA-regulated tokens; and e-money tokens, which are backed by fiat currencies and used to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the main objectives of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has established rules for the issuance, admission to trading, and operation of crypto assets, as well as requirements for the providers of crypto asset services. The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) has been set up to specifically promote cooperation between member states on blockchain technology.</p>



  Provide legal certainty for crypto assets that are not covered by current European financial regulation;  



  Bring all crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under one regulatory&nbsp;licensing&nbsp;framework;  



  Replace current national regulation for crypto-assets&nbsp;that are&nbsp;not covered by European regulation;  



  Create a specific regulatory framework for stable coins.  



<blockquote><p>Regulations will still need to be enforced&nbsp;by competent authorities designated by each member state,&nbsp;that will be&nbsp;overseen by&nbsp;both the&nbsp;European Securities and Markets Authority&nbsp;and the European Banking Authority. MiCA and TRF will add greater transparency to the crypto space, and the aim is to reduce risks the market, the overall economy, and future investments.</p>Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 What are the benefits of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has a number of benefits, including better regulatory clarity for CASPs in the EU, improved investor protection, enhanced financial stability, and the promotion of innovation. MiCA will also make it easier for member states to cooperate on blockchain technology, as the EBP will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MiCA will impact all CASPs offering services to clients in the EU. This includes exchanges, custodian wallet providers, issuers of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other CASPs. MiCA will not apply to persons who buy or sell crypto assets for their own account.</p>



 What does this mean for non-European crypto service providers?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will not apply to non-European crypto service providers unless they target EU investors or offer their services in the EU. However, national competent authorities in the EU may require non-European crypto service providers to obtain a MiCA authorization if they provide cross-border services into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses.</p>



 



 

 



 



 How will MiCA play into AML regulation?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will complement the EU’s existing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD)</a> by providing a specific regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCA will require CASPs to put in place <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML measures</a>, such as Customer Due Diligence and reporting of suspicious transactions. MiCA will also allow national competent authorities to exchange information on suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities involving crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses. However, CASPs will need to ensure that they comply with MiCA’s rules and requirements when they come into effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Commission also needs to implement further acts to specify certain technical requirements for MiCA-regulated activities. It was ratified by the European Parliament in April 2023, and is expected to come into effect by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CASPs are recommended to stay up to date with MiCA, and consult with a legal advisor to ensure they remain compliant.</p>

			 6 Steps for Issuing Verifiable Credentials From a Database 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				 
 	 Identify your data source 
 	 Create a credential template in the Trinsic dashboard 
 	 Set up the Trinsic SDK 
 	 Query the data from the database 
 	 Transform the data into a JSON that maps to the credential template 
 	 Issue and send credentials to the user wallets

				<p>In this scenario, imagine you have a small group who have signed up for an event, and you’d like to issue them a verifiable credential to use as their event ticket. We have a very simple database with five users, each with four attributes that looks something like what is shown below. You’ll need to be able to query this database.</p>

			 Create a Credential Template 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In the <a href="https://dashboard.trinsic.id/ecosystem/templates">Trinsic Dashboard</a>, you can create a simple <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/concepts/templates/">template</a> that includes:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Name  Email  Age  Allergies  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure the credential template fields map to the information that is in your database. Once your credential template is created, you’ll need to refer to the <code>templateId</code> in a future step.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Set Up the Trinsic SDK 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Call the Trinsic service so you can seamlessly sign and issue credentials once you’ve exported and formatted the data. In this scenario, you will be using the issuer auth token.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Query the Data From the SQLite Database 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>You’ll write a short script that queries your database. In our example we’re using a SQLite database and have written some JavaScript shown below:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Transform the Data Into a JSON That Maps to the Credential Template  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Then we loop over each row of user information, storing each property in &nbsp;<code>credentialValues</code>&nbsp; that corresponds with the credential template we previously defined. In the next step this JSON blob will be signed and become a verifiable credential.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Issue and Send Credentials to the User Wallets  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Once &nbsp;<code>credentialValues </code> is set, we call &nbsp;<code>issueFromTemplate</code>,&nbsp; referencing the&nbsp; <code>templateId</code>. This call returns a signed credential.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The signed credential can now be sent to a user’s wallet. Even if a user doesn’t have an existing wallet, you can send it to their email, allowing them to access a credential without needing to download a new app or create a new username and password.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Conclusion 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>As you can imagine, there are many edge cases that may complicate this process. In future walkthroughs we could explore issuing credentials from a CSV file, or issuing credentials to identifiers other than emails, or any other situations that you would find valuable.

<p>Why it’s time to move to high assurance passwordless MFA with physical proximity.</p>
<p>The most common MFA authenticators are vulnerable because they do not have a proximity-based factor as a requirement.</p>
<p>The cybercrime marketplace of offering stolen credentials to enable access-as-a-service attacks continues to dominate the <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/sale-of-stolen-credentials-and-initial-access-dominate-dark-web-markets">market with a 6 fold increase in number of credentials stolen by malware</a>.</p>
<p>Passwords as the single factor of authentication has become a thing of the past and many security conscious organizations have now adopted multi-factor authentication (MFA) as the standard. MFA incorporates the use of multiple factors when authenticating a user, such as knowledge (something a user knows), inference (something a user is), and possession (something a user has).</p>
<p>However, as the threat landscape grows we have seen from <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/uber-breach-external-contractor-mfa-bombing-attack">recent cyber-attacks</a> in the news that MFA is no longer enough to prevent breaches from account takeover (ATO) attacks. In addition to username passwords, attackers are also gathering contextual information such as browser version and geographical information to enable MFA bypass attacks. Some common MFA-based attacks are the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swap attack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/09/vulnerable-mfa-mfa-prompt-bombing/">MFA prompt bombing</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-aitm-phishing-attack/">Adversary in The Middle</a>&nbsp;(AiTM). These attacks are getting more sophisticated and successful at breaching an organization’s defense.</p>
<p>Why physical proximity should be a required MFA factor</p>
<p>As seen in most of the attacks that overcome MFA, these attacks are launched remotely and are able to bypass MFA controls in place. Having a requirement of physical proximity as a required factor for MFA, in addition to the other factors of knowledge (something a user knows), inference (something a user is), and possession (something a user has) helps protect against remote based ATO attacks.</p>
<p>If we look at some of the most common MFA authenticators, we can see that most of these are vulnerable as they do not have a proximity based factor as a requirement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, high assurance PKI-based mobile smart credential login, FIDO2 keys and passkeys (FIDO2 multi-device credentials) all require physical proximity as a requirement to authenticate a user. In addition, these authenticators eliminate the use of passwords, instead using the concept of cryptographic key pairs to authenticate a user.</p>
<p>Consider PKI based mobile smart credential and passkeys below:</p>
<p>PKI based mobile smart credentials – This high assurance <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login?utm_source=CSO-Online&amp;utm_medium=ext-site&amp;utm_campaign=Mar23-IAM-Passwordless-CSO-Blog-Link&amp;utm_content=Passwordless&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044VhEQAU">passwordless authentication</a> works by installing a digital smart credential on a user’s smartphone transforming their smartphone into a trusted device. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udGrvxPWW4k">When a user wants to authenticate to a device</a> such as a laptop, desktop or other workstation and are in close physical proximity to this device, they are prompted to authenticate themselves using biometrics on their smartphone, with the mobile smart credential. Once authenticated with biometrics, they gain access to the laptop or desktop and can also gain access to all apps and accounts using single sign-on capabilities. When they walk away from their laptop or desktop, they are automatically logged off. The process of triggering authentication on the user’s smartphone happens via Bluetooth, ensuring the user in close physical proximity to the device they are logging on to, protecting against remote based ATO attacks.</p>
<p>Passkeys – <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passkeys?utm_source=CSO-Online&amp;utm_medium=ext-site&amp;utm_campaign=Mar23-IAM-Passwordless-CSO-Blog-Link&amp;utm_content=Passkeys&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044VhFQAU">Passkeys</a> let you sign in or log on to applications and services without passwords or even usernames if configured that way. They are digital credentials in the form of cryptographic key pairs, with the public key stored on the application server and a private key stored on your device that can be accessed via biometrics authentication on your device. Using passkeys to log in to applications and services make it seamless and easy to use, just like you would unlock your phone with Face ID or other biometrics. When a user tries to log in to an application, the application issues a security challenge to the user’s registered device via Bluetooth. The user is then prompted to authenticate via biometrics to accept the sign-in request, which is signed with the private key on the user’s registered device and sent back to the application to be verified with the corresponding public key, after which the user is signed in if successful.</p>
<p>The above high assurance authenticators combine the best of both worlds – MFA and passwordless and utilizes cryptographic key pairs and proximity factor to ensure a phishing resistant and seamless user experience for users to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve moved on from plain passwords to MFA and the bad actors have also caught up to finding ways to beat the traditional MFA configurations, it’s time to move to high assurance passwordless MFA with physical proximity as a required factor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy.” ~ Ann Cavoukian</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Dr Ann Cavoukian is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts. Dr Cavoukian served an unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, networked infrastructure and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. In 2010, International Privacy Regulators unanimously passed a Resolution recognising Privacy by Design as an International Standard. Since then, PbD has been translated into 40 languages! In 2018, PbD was included in a sweeping new law in the EU: the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Dr Cavoukian is now the Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design Centre. She is also a Senior Fellow of the Ted Rogers Leadership Centre at Ryerson University, and a Faculty Fellow of the Centre for Law, Science &amp; Innovation at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.</p>

<blockquote><p>“One of the really challenging things about privacy and security is if you don’t bake it in at the lower layers, if you don’t build that foundation, it’s really hard to go back and put it into a product or service afterwards.” ~ Katryna Dow</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Katryna Dow&nbsp;is the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Meeco; a personal data &amp; distributed ledger platform that enables people to securely exchange data via the API-of-Me with the people and organisations they trust. Katryna has been pioneering personal data rights since 2002, when she envisioned a time when personal sovereignty, identity and contextual privacy would be as important as being connected. Now within the context of GDPR and Open Banking, distributed ledger, cloud, AI and IoT have converged to make&nbsp;Meeco&nbsp;both possible and necessary.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Today we’re happy to bring you a new episode of our Identity Stories Series. Privacy by Design has just become an ISO standard, which we want to celebrate, so let’s go back in time and hear moments of this journey.</p>
<p>Let’s first hear from Privacy by Design’s creator herself, Dr Ann Cavoukian. She is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts and she served an unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Dr Ann Cavoukian welcome back to Let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Ann Cavoukian: Thank you so much Oscar. It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Use a time machine and bring us to the moment in which you started writing Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>Ann: We’ll have to go back to the nineties. So, I was first appointed Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, and I think ‘97. And when I was appointed commissioner, I joined the office, which consisted of brilliant lawyers, and they took, of course, a legal approach to protecting privacy, applying the law after a privacy harm had arisen.</p>
<p>But you see, I’m not a lawyer. I’m a psychologist. I took a very different view of how we should protect privacy in addition to legal means. I wanted something that would prevent the privacy harms from arising. I wanted to have a model of prevention that was proactive, baked into the code, baked into your operations, so that ideally, we can have fewer privacy infractions and data breaches.</p>
<p>And this is a very different approach to the legal one. So literally at my kitchen table over three nights, I created Privacy by Design, and then I took it in, and I sold it to my lawyers. And it didn’t take long, but it was a different approach. And I said, look, this will complement regulatory compliance, which is after the fact, applying a privacy law, after a privacy harm has arisen.</p>
<p>That’s very, very valuable. But I want ideally to minimise the number of privacy harms that arise. And that’s what Privacy by Design is all about. So, they got that. It was a win-win and they liked it. And away we went. And Privacy by Design has grown dramatically since then. It’s been translated into 40 languages. We’ve had great success with it.</p>
<p>Oscar: How was the whole journey since that time until now, 2023? Has the road to becoming an ISO standard been a bumpy road?</p>
<p>Ann: It’s always a bumpy road, there’s no question. But I had great fortune. I was very lucky in 2010. Privacy by Design was unanimously passed as an international standard by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection authorities in Brussels. So immediately in the privacy community, it grew enormously. And then when, the new law in the European Union, the General Data Protection regulation, was introduced or came into effect in 2018.</p>
<p>My Privacy by Design was included in the GDPR as well as privacy as the default, which is the second of seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design. This was huge. It being recognised like that was just such a huge development and it took hold globally because everyone around the world wants to do business with Europe and engage in business and trade with the European Union.</p>
<p>So, lots of countries started doing Privacy by Design. And whenever there was a new law that was developed, a privacy law like Brazil last year, they included Privacy by Design in it. So, it really took off. So, when ISO started considering including it as an international standard, that took years in the making. I mean, it just came into effect this year.</p>
<p>But my colleague Michelle Chibba, who’s amazing, I mean, she’s been sitting on committee meetings for the past, I don’t know, three, four or five years with ISO in, in an effort to make Privacy by Design an ISO standard. But we succeeded and that’s the whole thing. It is now an international standard, ISO 31700. And it’s all over the world.</p>
<p>It’s already becoming embraced by countries who recognise the value of ISO standards. So literally, I’m delighted by this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. I can hear your, your voice of success when you are sharing this journey. And congratulations for that, of course.</p>
<p>Ann: Thank you.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: If you were wondering what are these ‘7 principles’, let’s hear now Dr Ann Cavoukian explaining the 7 foundational principles of Privacy by Design.&nbsp;Starting with Principle #1 Proactive not Reactive.</p>
 
<p>Ann: The first one ‘prevent the harms. You want to be proactive so that you could prevent the harms from arising. It’s very, very clear.</p>
<p>The second one is privacy as the default setting. And that’s– I talked about that quite a bit. It’s absolutely critical, in fact, it’s considered to be so important. When they enacted the GDPR in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, they included not only my Privacy by Design, but specifically privacy as the default setting as well. So that’s very important.</p>
<p>The third one embedded in design is absolutely critical. If it’s not baked into the code into your operations, it’s going to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The fourth one you have to have, what I always say full functionality. Get rid of the zero-sum mindset of privacy versus security, or privacy versus data utility. It can’t be either, or, win, lose. It has to be win-win, privacy and data utility. You make a positive sum, and you get multiple positive gains, privacy and security always intertwined.</p>
<p>And the next one talking about security. While the term privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections and security alone, in this day and age of daily hacking and phishing, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end, with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, start with a solid foundation of security throughout your entire organisation.</p>
<p>Give individuals access to their own data. I always say to companies and governments, you may have custody and control of someone’s data, but it doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to the data subject. So, give them the right of access that they have, allow them to gain access to personal information you have on them. And companies actually have come back to me, companies that are certified for Privacy by Design, and they say, “We love this. We love this principle. Because once we give customers access to their own data, they come back to us and say – No, no, that’s no longer the case. That was true about me two years ago, here’s what’s going on now.” So, they correct the information. They increase the accuracy of the information we hold. And it increases the quality of the data we have. So, they love it.</p>
<p>And the last principle, keep it user centric. When you keep it focused on the user, all of this flows out. Because it should all be around the individual, when it’s personal information you’re dealing with. Because personal information is about identifiable individuals. So, you have to keep it focused on the user, and what they permit, what they don’t permit, things of that nature. So that’s it. Seven foundational principles by design.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Despite all the recognition that Privacy by Design has received for two decades, and the influence it has had in regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, we saw that the vast majority of Internet products and services still didn’t use the seven foundational principles. An urgent push was necessary. What would help us make waves of such magnitude? Nothing better than a global standard published by the International Organisation for Standardisation, the ISO.</p>
<p>ISO standards are recognised by governments, regulatory bodies, and industry associations around the world, so becoming an ISO standard would increase the adoption of Privacy by Design and it would be recognised globally. It is not easy to become an ISO standard, with thorough review processes including, expert opinions, public consultation, and a vote by ISO members.</p>
<p>On 2018, a technical committee called ISO/PC 317 Consumer protection: Privacy by Design for consumer goods and services was created. Four more years, and all the efforts of this group of motivated and brilliant minds from all over the world came to fruition. On February 8th, 2023, the standard was published with the name “ISO 31700-1:2023 Consumer protection — Privacy by Design for consumer goods and services”.</p>
<p>Let’s now hear from another guest a perspective of a tech entrepreneur who has been incorporating Privacy by Design in their products.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: We are welcoming back Katryna Dow, who is CEO and founder at Meeco. Hello, Katryna.</p>
<p>Katryna Dow: Hello. It’s nice to be back. Thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Katryna, how has Privacy by Design influenced you?</p>
<p>Katryna: Well, I’m very privileged. If I think back to when Ann Cavoukian and the Canadian government were at the forefront of bringing the concept of Privacy by Design into the world. I was the recipient of an early Privacy by Design Ambassador Award and I think that was twofold.</p>
<p>One, because after reading about the principles of Privacy by Design, we immediately decided to bake those things into the development of Meeco as a product. So architecturally, to adopt them. And secondly, we were invited, around 2016, to submit a consultation to the Canadian government in support of Privacy by Design, and really in support of why it was important from a technology design perspective and actually how it could make a difference.</p>
<p>We all remember, a lot of this thinking was pre GDPR. This was kind of at the forefront of the concept of considering for citizens. Initially, Canadians and now all around the world, this idea of taking a principle of privacy and considering it in every aspect of the design of a product or service.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. And on your opinion, how has Privacy by Design influenced digital identity as an industry?</p>
<p>Katryna: So, I think it’s an interesting question about digital identity. Optimistically, I guess what we’ve seen with the advent and the evolution and the maturing of Self-Sovereign identity. At the heart of that are principles around human centred design and control. So, I think there are great parallels with Privacy by Design. However, if we step back and look at the whole digital identity landscape, I’m not sure that it has had a wide enough impact in the design of systems.</p>
<p>Certainly, large tech platforms or even some governments have not really thought about that human centred Privacy by Design, progressive disclosure, anchoring core part. And as a result of that, I think in the digital identity landscape, we have lots of really great systems and solutions, but they’re not always designed from a human centric or Privacy by Design point of view.</p>
<p>And I guess one topical example of that recently with the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and then opening up Twitter blue for everyone and not having a proper process in place for verification or identity protection in any way. We all saw that. That was a very short-lived example of what happens if you don’t understand some of the foundation principles of identity privacy, and if you don’t design from that perspective of understanding, you want to in one way protect the individual, but another way to be able to open up that identity for authentication, authorisation or access to trusted parties in a progressive way.</p>
<p>So, I think sometimes that balance, we don’t see enough in the design of digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: If you have some final idea, you would like to share about Privacy by design?</p>
<p>Katryna: I think one of the things that we’ve noticed just recently, being involved in a community project, where privacy and security were acknowledged to be important, but not enough to slow down architecture and design. So, the desire was to be able to build something really quickly and get it out into the community.</p>
<p>And one of the really challenging things about privacy and security is if you don’t bake it in at the lower layers, if you don’t build that foundation, it’s really hard to go back and put it into a product or service afterwards. I sometimes think about building a house. You imagine if you, if you didn’t put down a strong foundation and you were building on sand and then you went back later and you wanted to try and reinforce that structure, it’s not impossible, but it’s costly.</p>
<p>It takes time and it creates all sorts of adjacent problems, particularly if you’re building a digital system. So, I think I would encourage people to think it may slow down architecture, it may slow down consensus, it may slow down the beginning of a project, but it means you can go much, much faster once you’re up and running. And it also means that you’ve not created technical debt, policy, debt, compliance, debt that you will have to circle back and address later on.</p>
<p>So, it’s definitely worth investing that time upfront and building on a strong foundation.</p>
<p>Oscar: I couldn’t agree more. There was an excellent analogy in the very visual analogy that help us understand the importance of Privacy by Design.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: The stories that Katryna Dow just shared with us might sound like we’re still in a sombre passage of this journey. But it shouldn’t surprise us. Designing Internet services is only getting more complex: tight deadlines, limited budgets, scarcity of technical experts, all this determines and shapes the outcome. And those new applications are built to help the lives of millions of citizens, students, patients, and people of all ages.</p>
<p>At this crossroads, how can we make sure that this ISO standard builds the required momentum so what we’ll see in the next years is an avalanche of services that really protect our privacy?</p>
 
<p>Oscar: So now that it has become an ISO standard, what is the impact of having Privacy by design an ISO standard?</p>
<p>Ann: I think the impact will be significant because you see we’re struggling right now at a time where surveillance is mounting steadily mounting on a daily basis. We need massive intervention to put the brakes on it. And with Privacy by Design, being recognised as an ISO standard, that will draw so much more attention to privacy, embedding it proactively into the design of your operations. Into AI, artificial intelligence. We have to embed privacy into this from the beginning in order for it to take.</p>
<p>And that’s why I’m so excited about the timing of this, because it will attract a lot of attention to privacy, and privacy forms the foundation of our freedom. If you want free and open societies, you have to have freedom. And this will help to preserve freedom. So, ISO standards, marrying with Privacy by Design. The sky’s the limit – privacy and freedom. </p>
<p>And also, privacy and security go hand in hand. While privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections than security alone in this day and age of massive phishing and ransomware attacks, and all this, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, you have to have privacy and security by design.</p>
<p>Oscar: No doubt. Is there something else you would like to tell or share?</p>
<p>Ann: And what I want to remind people is please don’t be alarmed by the odds. Meaning people say to me, you know, I tweet every morning, I have a large Twitter following and I tweet about the latest stories of the day. And someone invariably will come back to me and say, Lady, give it up. That ship has had sailed.</p>
<p>Privacy is dead. And I go back again. Another friggin ship. You don’t give up on privacy. You don’t give up on freedom just because the odds are small. They’re getting bigger. But you look at what is important to preserve. Freedom is the most important thing to me to preserve. I’m Armenian. I come from a background, in 1915, 1.5 million Armenians were killed.</p>
<p>It’s you don’t give up. You know, that’s the whole point. You always come back. You never give up on freedom. And so, I just urge people don’t be alarmed at the odds that it seems to be overwhelming that we can’t do this. Yes, you can. We can do this. We have to do this. We want to preserve freedom for ourselves, for our children, for the future. We must do this. So please stay with me and embed privacy into your operations.</p>
<p>And one last thing. If you do shopping, either online or in real stores physically, if you express an interest in privacy, you will get so much more protection. You can imagine I always ask what they’re going to do with my information. I’m at a store, they’re asking for my postal code or this or that, and I say, “Oh, and how will you be protecting my privacy?” The guy I’m dealing with doesn’t know, but he’ll go get the manager, and the manager will say, “Oh, you care about privacy. Here’s what we can do. Boom, boom, boom.” And immediately the protections go up.</p>
<p>So just express your interest in privacy and see how much more protection it will lead to. It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Privacy is not only an Internet issue, a technology issue, it follows us everywhere we go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a kitchen table to an ISO standard, the world just saw how Privacy by Design arrived to this elusive, but crucial destination.</p>
<p>What’s our next milestone on this journey? The road that will come can be long and bumpy but as Dr Ann Cavoukian said, it’s never time to give up.</p>

<p>#BendNotBreak</p><p>In this series of 4 blogs we are exploring the emerging work that we are undertaking in partnership with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a>. The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. As always, we would welcome your comments and feedback so please do get in touch if you would like to contribute.</p> Blog 2 (of 4): Zooming out: thinking about the transition constraints and responses in the context of the wider political economy <p>“If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” — Einstein</p><p>In the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">first blog</a> of this series, we explored how using different filters can help us to identify the constraints (and related opportunities) that exist in relation to a just transition. In this next reflection we would like to shift our attention, to consider the wider socio-economic context in which the built environment is&nbsp;nested.</p><p>As we zoom out to the broader context, what does this signify for the dominant trends? What happens when we combine a requirement (or even desire) for using less energy with a financial system that is tethered to that same resource? How realistic is dematerialisation as a response to increasing resource pressures, when this kind of strategy flies in the face of the prevailing economic logic? Improving resource use efficiency in manufacturing processes might align with reducing costs, but simply leaving minerals in the ground and thus forgoing or delaying profits does not. However much we disagree with this worldview, economic value is a reality that we must explain and understand if we want to build effective strategies. It is easy to shrug our shoulders and make comments like ‘it’s just the way it is’ or ‘capitalism is the problem’, but what exactly do we mean when we make such statements? What are the dominant forces or dynamics that are holding this kind of logic in&nbsp;place?</p><p>In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">previous blog</a> we highlighted a concern about excluding an inequality filter from our constraints analysis. We would therefore like to pick this up here, by exploring some system dynamics that are fundamental to holding the current imagined order¹ and crippling levels of inequality in place. When we use the term system dynamics, we are referring to patterns and forces that play out across multiple areas of the systems that we interact with (e.g., political, ecological, cultural, physical).</p> Two examples of powerful system dynamics that are driving increasing levels of inequality and volatility <p>There are many excellent resources that consider these types of dynamics in depth (we can recommend some focused texts if you would like to look into anything mentioned in more detail), but the following examples highlight some key drivers and practical illustrations of how they manifest in the built environment.</p>  The finance / power / inequality dynamic  <p>‘It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.’ — Henry&nbsp;Ford</p><p>The fact that most of the money used in our economy is essentially created out of thin air, by bankers tapping digital numbers into existence, has been well documented². Less well publicised however, is the link between the seemingly benign mechanism of money creation and rising housing inequality. A good example of how this occurs is the practice of quantitative easing (QE) that began in Japan and has been used extensively by the Bank of England, the ECB and the American Federal Reserve. QE involves a Central Bank creating new digital money and using it to buy back government and corporate bonds (IOUs). The idea behind this process is to reboot a sluggish economy by reducing interest rates and making it easier for people to take out loans. Irrespective of whether this actually works, the process also results in the value of bonds rising (as the supply of bonds decreases the value of those that remain goes up). It also causes a general inflation of asset prices, as investments in the stock and property markets are closely linked to the bond markets. In short, those who are already wealthy and own assets benefit from QE, whilst those that don’t fall further behind. For&nbsp;example:</p>  In the 12 years since the financial crisis where QE has been liberally deployed, UK house price increases have far outstripped the growth in wages, with the UK first time buyer house price to earnings ratio rising from 4.3 to 5.6 in the past&nbsp;decade³.  In August 2020 at the height of the first Covid lockdown, western economies slumped to levels beyond the crash of 1929, whilst the FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 rose dramatically. On the face of it this made no sense — how could share prices be rising when the entire global economy had been put into standby? The answer was that the newly created credit was predominantly lent to large corporations, who as they didn’t need the money, used it to buy back their own shares. These buy-backs inflated both the company share prices and the management bonuses that were linked to them⁴. Many of those bonuses were used to buy additional properties, thus creating further upward pressure on house prices and compounding existing housing inequalities.  <p>In both of the above examples, the prioritisation of investors and asset prices over businesses and livelihoods was not a decision taken by citizens on behalf of society. It was a judgement made by bankers on behalf of existing asset holders, that dramatically increased both social and housing inequalities across the continent.</p><p>2. The energy / debt / growth&nbsp;dynamic</p><p>In our view this is one of the most important drivers in our current global economic and ecological situation, with severe consequences for the just element of Europe’s decarbonisation challenges. We see this as a chain of interlinked factors that will ultimately lead to increased economic volatility, with potentially devastating consequences for the most vulnerable members of&nbsp;society:</p>  Firstly, GDP (a proxy for the sum of everything that is bought and sold in the economy) is currently 99% correlated to energy consumption, whilst the relationship to material use is more like 100%. This means that at current economic forecasts of 2–3% GDP growth per year, we will double our energy and material use every 25 years. It is important to note that many prominent economists such as Dianne Coyle⁵ and Thomas Piketty⁶ have provided robust challenges to GDP being used as a measure of societal progress at all. However, as GDP growth is currently still the dominant measure of economic success globally, its correlation to resource use remains a central consideration.  To date, absolute decoupling of GDP from energy on a global scale has not been achieved, despite dramatic technological and efficiency gains⁷. This is largely driven by a rebound effect (often referred to as Jevron’s Paradox), whereby improvements in technological efficiency result in increased demand and greater resource consumption overall⁸. A good example of this can be seen in improved refrigeration technologies, because as the price of fridges has decreased our overall use of them has escalated (the average garage now offers more refrigerated goods than a supermarket would have stocked in the&nbsp;1970s).  <p>The Jevons paradox for energy consumption in the EU-27, 1995–2019</p>European Environment Agency&nbsp;[<a href="http://Figure%201.%20The%20Jevons%20paradox%20for%20energy%20consumption%20in%20the%20EU-27,%201995-2019">EEA</a>]  An additional issue is the impact of new debt which creates a future claim on energy, as its creation is currently entirely decoupled from our physical reality. To clarify, the creation of new debt does not automatically lead to growth; without the accompanying strategies proposed by MMT proponents such as <a href="https://stephaniekelton.com/">Stephanie Kelton</a>, the creation of new money would simply result in inflation. Instead, the availability of credit (and its associated interest) creates a future need to generate income by producing a good or service. This in turn equates to a forward claim on the energy that will be required to bring it into being. Thus, despite finance itself being a system without biophysical boundaries, the physical claims coded into its creation are essentially a contract with the future of the&nbsp;Earth⁹.  The levels of debt relative to GDP have steadily increased globally over the last decade (debt is doubling c.8.5 years compared to 25 years for GDP), showing that we are already struggling to service existing debt with current economic activities. As energy and resource costs rise and the quality of energy available decreases this issue will be magnified, fundamentally threatening the legitimacy of the global financial system.  <p>What happens when the music stops and we can’t make good on those embedded energy claims? Who will be the losers? After the 2008 crisis it was the lower income mortgage holders and general taxpayers who took the hit. As energy becomes scarce and expensive how will the risks be allocated? If we fail to address people’s needs at a rapid and inclusive scale (for example by implementing a continent-wide equitable repurposing of vacant space) it will be the poorest citizens of Europe who suffer the most. Unless we can fundamentally shift the relationship between how we finance real estate and its intrinsic value to society, initiatives aimed at repurposing space and retrofitting existing homes will remain as marginal interventions.</p> Introducing the economic matrix framework <p>“Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.” ― Donella Meadows, Thinking in&nbsp;Systems</p><p>Thinking about these kinds of dynamics in addition to the constraint filters, whilst trying to make anything happen day to day, can leave our heads spinning. It feels impossible to know where to begin or which thread to pull at first. For us at least it doesn’t feel humanly possible, so we have tried to create a framework to pull everything together. By doing so, we have of course been forced to simplify and use reductionist assumptions. We are aware of the irony of trying to illustrate complex systems by putting things into conceptual boxes. We would ask you to hold it lightly, taking what’s useful and leaving what’s&nbsp;not.</p><p>In designing this model we have drawn on extraordinary thinkers from diverse disciplines. If you are interested in exploring this work in more depth, then we wholeheartedly recommend the following: Professor Beinhocker’s <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/files/Beinhocker-2020-Ontological-Frmwrk.pdf">Ontological stack</a>, Marvin Harris’s <a href="https://anthropology.ua.edu/theory/cultural-materialism/">Cultural Materialism</a>, <a href="https://civilizationemerging.com/media/">Daniel Schutemberger’s</a> analysis of our political economy, the International Futures Forum’s <a href="https://medium.com/activate-the-future/the-three-horizons-of-innovation-and-culture-change-d9681b0e0b0f">3 Horizons model</a> and of course Donella Meadows’ <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">Points to Intervene in a&nbsp;system</a>.</p><p>Part 1: framing our responses</p><p>The following 3 by 3 grid provides some prompts to think through how we can design responses to the different constraints, in the context of the systems we are working&nbsp;within.</p><p>On the vertical axis we have the different domains (or levels) of the system. We have summarised these into three umbrella domains to make it easier to visualise:</p>  The cultural suprastructure: this relates to the values, wisdom, spirituality, ways of being and ways of knowing that are dominant in our culture. This domain results in the collective sense-making of what it means to live a good life and it is this value system that then shapes the political and economic structures below.  Political &amp; economic domains (governance &amp; jurisprudence, finance &amp; investment, market logic and ownership patterns): these are the institutions and processes that determine how we organise society. They provide the system’s overall goals, rules, decision making structures, patterns of behaviour and information flows.  Physical domains (resource &amp; land use): The physical domains represent the material and ecological economies and ground the socio-economic and ontological domains in the systems’ biophysical reality.  <p>Across the horizontal axis we can start to think about specific constraints and responses:</p>  Constraints: these blocks can be viewed as physical (e.g. biodiversity, energy, labour, materials), structural (e.g. money creation, embedded inequality, private property rights) or psychological (e.g. failure of the imagination).  Systemic capabilities: to unlock and repattern the structural blocks, we will need to create new capabilities in the system. Examples could include democratising money creation, embedding beyond GDP metrics in national policy, creating a new material economy or reimagining land as a common&nbsp;asset.  Pathways: these are the practical tools and pathways that can be used to start building towards the systemic capabilities.  <p>Once we have identified a constraint, we can use the matrix to think more granularly about the implications for a just transition. To bring this idea to life we have worked through two potential strategies that were highlighted in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">Blog 1</a> of this series, to give examples at each intersection of the&nbsp;matrix:</p><p>(A) Consider a no (or low) build future: If we can’t build the required volume of low carbon homes, how can we intensify our use of existing&nbsp;ones?</p><p>This strategy suggestion was driven primarily by physical constraints; i.e. intensifying pressures on energy and material resources. It was also however in consideration of inflated land and asset prices, which are excluding increasing numbers of people from home ownership.</p><p>(B) Embrace low-tech dematerialisation: If we cannot feasibly mine or recycle the materials needed, how can we radically adapt the way that we use&nbsp;them?</p><p>Reducing our material throughput cannot be left to individual choice alone as people still have to live and operate in the existing system. Instead, we need to recognise the main factors that are holding a linear material economy in place, so that we can think practically about how they can be&nbsp;shifted.</p><p>Part 2: visualising the response pathways over different time&nbsp;horizons</p><p>A second step that we find helpful in looking for response pathways is to think about the desired capabilities over different timeframes. Some issues are immediately threatening and require rapid mitigation responses, whilst others will play out over the longer-term and invite us to think more tactically. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.internationalfuturesforum.com/three-horizons">IFF’s 3-Horizon model</a>, we have begun to think about these time-bound responses in three tranches, that intersect vertically through the system domains as shown in the following matrix:</p><p>Taking the example above of dematerialisation we can break the potential response pathways down by timeframe. For example, if we take the pathway of citizen engagement:</p>  A mitigation response to the cost of living and energy crisis might be to ask citizens to temporarily reduce their electricity consumption;  A more transitional approach may be to introduce wide scale citizen assemblies, to debate how to live better with&nbsp;less;  A transformational pathway could be to work towards a new form of democracy, where citizens’ views on limited resource use are continuously consulted using digital technologies.  <p>Or, if we are thinking about promoting a circular&nbsp;economy:</p>  An immediate response could be to provide easily accessible recycling facilities for household devices;  An example of a transitional initiative can be seen in France where they have introduced an obsolescence law, which requires manufacturers to comply with a repairability index¹⁰;  In terms of a transformational strategy, we could start thinking about a planetary level governance mechanism for total material use, to bring it back inside the earth’s carrying capacity.  Combing the the 3*3 grids to illustrate the full response&nbsp;matrix<p>We do not believe that each type of response will intersect with every level of the system. In some triage situations for example, the appropriate response may be limited to an immediate governmental intervention, such as imposing lockdowns during the Covid crisis. Furthermore, in categorising the pathways, we are not attempting to create a hierarchy of responses, or to prioritise transformational pathways over mitigation tools. In our view, we will need to think and act over multiple timeframes using diverse system leverage points. Our goal with this framework is to probe the problem space, to try and make different elements of the system easier to visualise and thus to interact with. We hope that by doing this we can begin to identify gaps in the existing response landscape, thus promoting flexible precision in the response pathways we choose to pursue. As always we would welcome your feedback and suggestions so that we can modify and improve this conceptual tool.</p><p>In our next Blog (3 of 4) we will introduce an emerging community of just transition practitioners, that we have had the privilege of engaging with during this project. This has been both a challenging and exciting journey, where we have embraced the idea of working out loud, using the framework introduced above to guide our work. We will endeavour to share what we have learned so far, together with areas of our analysis that require strengthening and developing.</p><p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs), Aleksander Nowak (Aleks@darkmatterlabs), Vlad Afanasiev (vlad@darkmatterlabs) and Indy Johar (indy@darkmatterlabs).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) The ‘imagined order’ is a term used by the Oxford economist <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/events/new-economic-and-moral-foundations-for-the-anthropocene-with-prof-eric-beinhocker/">Eric Beinhocker</a> to describe a series of stories told by the elite to justify their position in&nbsp;society</p><p>(2) <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-in-the-modern-economy-an-introduction">https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-in-the-modern-economy-an-introduction</a></p><p>(3) <a href="https://www.nationwidehousepriceindex.co.uk/resources/ftb-hper-by-region">https://www.nationwidehousepriceindex.co.uk/resources/ftb-hper-by-region</a></p><p>(4) <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?dfMaqQ">The future of the Left in Europe with Yanis Varoufakis | Ep.33’.

 <p></p><p>You may know what a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> is or even how to generate one, but you may be wondering: what’s the point of yet ANOTHER way to identify myself? To get a better sense of the why behind decentralized identifiers, we’ll discuss the real problems society faces today when it comes to identity, and why DIDs are an enormous practical solution to a pervasive set of problems.</p> Identity<a title="Direct link to Identity">​</a> <p>Whether or not you consider yourself an “online” person, there are a million ways we currently identify ourselves. Do you have an email address? That’s an identity. A driver’s license? Another one there. A Twitter handle? An Instagram account? A phone number? Check, check, check. There are a seemingly incalculable number of ways we can be identified and reached in today’s day and age.</p><p>Today, however, our identities are deeply entangled with services and the companies that own them. Your Twitter handle, for example, is exclusive to Twitter - good luck trying to get the same username on Instagram. Want to view your text messages alongside your Facebook messages with a person? Not happening. Lastly, good luck trying to recover your data if your service of choice suddenly were to shut down. To put it even more simply, Bob may be able to say “hi my name is Bob” on one social network A, but the name “Bob” may be reserved on social network B, preventing him from claiming the same name or handle over there. Moreover, if Bob has been a long time user of music app A and decides one day to migrate to music app B, he’ll need to go through the painful process of migrating all his playlists and songs over to the new service.</p> The Data Problem and Solution<a title="Direct link to The Data Problem and Solution">​</a> <p>
So what’s the fundamental issue DIDs are trying to solve? Simply put, users don’t own their data - services do - and their identity is fragmented across a host of handles, cards, and more. Ideally, we’d have a single form of identification with strong authentication and deep ties to data ownership, rather than scattered identities, lost passwords, and data owned by someone else. All of these concerns are valid and, it’s important to note, not simply hype around a shiny new toy.</p><p>DIDs solve these problems by coming alongside something called a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Node (DWN)</a>. Think of DIDs as the identifiers that will allow you to have a truly universal single sign-on experience, while DWNs are a form of data storage that will permit you to own your data while simultaneously being able to use and enjoy all the same kinds of services you currently do.</p><p>DIDs are, as the name suggests, decentralized - so they’re inherently not controlled, operated, or regulated by a centralized authority like our current identifiers are. You can have as many DIDs as you’d like, but you can also have a main DID act as a controller for your other DIDs to help consolidate or partition data when needed, as well as enforce limitations when appropriate. The implications of both decentralization and a controller paradigm are enormous for a vast number of use cases.</p> Life, Decentralized<a title="Direct link to Life, Decentralized">​</a> <p>Consider this: Bob has a single DID that acts as his main identifier, but he wants to detangle his work and personal identities to avoid having everything come into the same inbox on weekends. He creates two new DIDs that are controlled by his main identity, and labels them as “personal” and “work.” All of his work emails, calls, texts, and notifications are connected to his work DID, and he can easily silence that noise come Friday night. He can still authenticate to all of those services and own all of that data through his primary DID since it’s the controller, but can also easily filter through his data since he’s filed his work things under a separate DID. On the personal side of things, Bob can sign up for new services every day without worrying about migration because he owns all of his data: the second he signs up for a new service, like a social network, he can grant that app access to the media stored on his DWN and that service can act as a presentation layer for his data. Even better, his employer can also act as a controller on his work DID, allowing them to enforce enterprise requirements while keeping completely siloed from his personal data.</p><p>In this paradigm, Bob doesn’t worry about remembering a million passwords or losing his data to a service. The new “password” for Bob’s life is access to his main DID, which is protected by his private keys that can be stored in a number of secure ways, including on a physical drive or in a secure digital wallet. Just as significantly, Bob can keep his personal and work lives separate while allowing there to be appropriate separations of authority over his different data silos.</p> Identity Reinvented<a title="Direct link to Identity Reinvented">​</a> <p>So why do you want a DID? Really, the question is, why do you want to shift to a Web5 paradigm? Because identity portability and data ownership are massive yet silent problems we deal with every day. And how will this shift happen? Through the proliferation and adoption of DIDs, the popularization of DID controller paradigms and DWNs, and the availability of mass-appeal wallets to enable secure usage of DIDs. The general public wouldn’t ever be expected to have a technical understanding of these concepts, but their proliferation will depend on new and existing apps integrating this tech and presenting it to consumers in an easily-digestable way. We don’t just have to limit ourselves to imagining using this design to separate personal and work life - we can use it to allow for advanced parental controls, role access, and more.</p><p>If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a> or join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Authentication is a crucial part of any web application, as it verifies the identity of the user and controls access to protected resources. One popular authentication method is JSON Web Token (JWT), which allows for secure and scalable identity verification via stateless authentication.</p>
 What Is JSON Web Token Authentication? 
<p>JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is a stateless method of securely transmitting information between parties as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object. It is often used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and APIs.</p>
<p>In the authentication world, “stateless” means a mechanism in which the server does not maintain any session state between requests. In a stateless authentication system, each request is self-contained and includes all the necessary information to authenticate and authorize the user or entity. In the case of JWT authentication, this comes in the form of a token.<br>
A JSON token consists of three parts:</p>
 
 A Header containing information about the type of token and algorithms used to generate the signature. 
 A Payload containing the “claims” (ID and authentication verifications) made by the user that can include a User ID, the user’s name, an email address, and metainformation about the operation of the token. 
 A Signature, or cryptographic mechanism, is used to verify the token’s integrity. 
 
<p>Together, the header, payload, and signature make up the JSON Web Token, typically passed between the client and the server in the HTTP Authorization header or in the body of an HTTP request or response. The server can then verify the signature to ensure that the token is valid and has not been modified and use the information in the payload to authenticate the user.</p>
<p>Here’s how JWT authentication works:</p>
 
 User Login: The user provides their credentials (such as a username and password) to the web application or system for verification, which is transmitted to the authentication server. 
 Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JSON token containing critical information about the user and the authentication session. The server sends the token to the client for verification. 
 Token Storage: The client stores the token, usually in a cookie or purpose-marked local storage, and includes it in subsequent requests to the server. 
 User Verification: When the client sends a request to the application server, it verifies the signature in the token and checks the claims in the payload to ensure that the user can access the requested resource. 
 Server Response: If the JWT is valid and the user can access the requested resource. 
 Token Expiration: When the JWT expires, the client must obtain a new JWT by logging in again. 
 
<p>JWT authentication provides several advantages over traditional session-based authentication, including improved scalability and reduced server-side storage requirements. However, it is important to properly secure and manage JWTs to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
 What Are the Best Practices for Using JWT Authentication? 
<p>Generally speaking, there are best practices for when and when not to use JWT Authentication:</p>
 
 When to Use: JWT authentication can be useful in scenarios where the server needs to handle many requests and sessions or in stateless APIs. JWTs can simplify authentication by reducing the number of database calls required for session management and can be passed between microservices to maintain stateless communication. 
 When Not to Use: JWT authentication may not be suitable for applications where the payload contains sensitive information, such as payment details, that must be protected against unauthorized access. JWTs can also pose a security risk if not properly secured, as anyone with access to a valid token can access protected resources. In these scenarios, a session-based authentication mechanism may be more appropriate. 
 
<p>Additionally, there are always implementation best practices when you’ve decided to use the technology, including:</p>
 
 Use Strong Encryption: Choose a strong cryptographic signing algorithm, such as, RS256, to sign JWTs. Avoid using insecure algorithms or plaintext. 
 Keep Sensitive Data on the Server: Not include sensitive information in the token payload, such as passwords or credit card numbers. Instead, store this information server-side and retrieve it as needed. 
 Use Short Expiration: Set a short expiration time (around 15-30 minutes) for tokens to reduce the risk of a stolen token being used maliciously.. 
 Use Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS): Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. 
 Implement Token Revocation: Consider implementing token revocation to invalidate tokens that have been compromised or are no longer needed. 
 
 What Are Some Challenges to Avoid When Implementing JWT Authentication? 
<p>While there are some significant benefits in implementing JWT authentication, there are always assumptions and pitfalls to avoid. These include:</p>
 
 Storing Private Data in the Token: Even with encryption, passing sensitive data across authentication requests is not good practice and can result in compromised accounts. 
 Encryption Failures: Weak algorithms can open the JWT to attacks, such as signature forgery or token tampering. It’s best to use strong cryptographic signing algorithms, such as RS256. 
 Not Validating Tokens: Failing to validate token signatures or expiration times can allow attackers to use stolen or expired tokens to access protected resources. 
 Using Long or No Expiration: While it may be tempting to set long expiration times to reduce the frequency of logins and “improve” user experience, doing so can increase the risk of a stolen token being used maliciously.

<p>How can we overcome existing structural challenges to reach investment readiness for the long-term stewardship of Nature-based Solutions in&nbsp;cities?</p><p>During the past two years, TreesAI — an initiative of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://lucidminds.ai/">Lucidminds</a> — have been running a pilot alongside Glasgow City Council and a number of public and private stakeholders to collectively raise capital for delivering Nature-based Solutions in the city. This is our interim learning&nbsp;report.</p><p>How can public organisations and private companies co-invest in urban Nature-based Solutions? During the past two years, we have been developing a pilot alongside Glasgow City Council and a range of public and private actors (Scottish Water, FloodRe, Nationwide, Clyde Climate Forest, Scottish Flood Forum and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) to design and develop innovative processes and mechanisms to collectively channel capital for the delivery and long-term maintenance of urban Nature-based Solutions (NbS) — that reduce flood-related risks and generate environmental benefits in the Glasgow&nbsp;region.</p><p>Our pilot tests the hypothesis that public and private entities can co-invest in Nature-based Solutions (e.g. street trees, sustainable urban drainage systems) that strategically provide Natural Flood Management (NFM) and Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), enhancing the performance of grey infrastructure. Using NbS for flood management is essential in the context of the UK, with w<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64866058">arming temperatures raising UK flood damages by 20%</a> and with <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/292928/geho0609bqds-e-e.pdf">1 in 6 properties in England being at risk of flooding</a> today. Beyond increased flood resilience, NbS can help cities and organisations adapt to various other climate-related risks (such as heatwaves) while hitting net zero and nature-positive targets while improving the health and well-being of both human and non-human dwellers.</p><p>Throughout the development of this work, we have observed that public and private organisations are aware and keen to explore possibilities for investing in NbS to tackle climate-related risks in cities. For example, water utilities are interested in using NbS to reduce risks in internal property sewer flooding; the (re)insurance sector is interested in reducing flood risk in properties and, lenders are interested in lowering long-term physical flood risks, which can cause property devaluation — while increasing investments in resilient and low carbon infrastructure assets that add to climate transition investment portfolios.</p><p>However, when it comes to execution, the reality of co-investing is more complicated. The challenges to funding adaptation are numerous: slow procurement and legal agreement processes to carry out transactions, a lack of technical skills and location-specific datasets to prove impact, along with a <a href="http://climatereadyclyde.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Annex-3-Resource-Mobilisation-Plan.pdf">mismatch between capital expenditures and return</a>. In this interim report, we discuss the challenges, findings and learnings that we have come across during the development of the pilot and offer possible solution pathways that could allow similar pilots to scale across Scotland and the UK, creating a market for urban&nbsp;NbS.</p><p>In this first series of learning reports, we set out three macro-challenges &amp; learnings (i.e. the strategic issues in reaching co-investment). These are not comprehensive but are those that we have felt most keenly throughout the&nbsp;pilot.</p>  We need to develop new forms of financing practices and the supporting tech infrastructure to scale investments in Nature-based Solutions.  We need novel public sector organisational structures which enable innovative processes and methodologies to invest in&nbsp;nature.  We need to build better market incentives, contracting &amp; regulatory frameworks for organisations to gain the practices, confidence and trust to co-invest in&nbsp;nature.  <p>In the following paragraphs, we outline the details of the above three learning outcomes.</p>Who could benefit from Nature-based Solutions (e.g. street trees, sustainable urban drainage systems) that provide Natural Flood Management? 1 | We need to develop new forms of financing practices and the supporting tech infrastructure to scale investments in Nature-based Solutions. <p>The capital gap required to tackle cities’ adaptation needs is huge — accounting for about £10 billion per year in the UK and approximately <a href="https://www.sniffer.org.uk/blog/closing-the-adaptation-finance-gap-in-scotland">£184 million a year in the Glasgow City Region alone.</a> However, the possible financial risks associated with not addressing this gap, and the subsequent negative feedback loops, dwarf this figure — for example as warned by Moody, cities’ <a href="https://impactalpha.com/bond-investors-are-getting-smarter-about-flood-risks-9af06bf7089a/">“credit rating will directly be tied to their flood prevention policies</a>”.</p><p>From innovative grants like the <a href="https://www.nature.scot/funding-and-projects/irns">Investment Ready Nature Scotland (IRNS</a>) and the <a href="https://www.nature.scot/funding-and-projects/firns-facility-investment-ready-nature-scotland">Facility for Investment ready Nature in Scotland (FIRNS)</a> grant schemes focused on supporting innovation and pilots, to institutions to support with first loss capital to support in taking on the risk of demonstrating the soundness of emerging business models. The UK Infrastructure Bank set out in this<a href="https://www.ukib.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-11/Natural-capital-discussion-paper.pdf"> discussion paper</a> its role across three target markets (of which water is one) and has recently committed <a href="https://highgrowth.scot/uk-infrastructure-bank-announces-first-natural-capital-transaction/">£12M to Highland Rewilding</a>, and natural capital was underscored in the <a href="https://www.thebank.scot/">Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB)</a> <a href="https://www.thebank.scot/sites/default/files/2022-10/snib003-mission-report-2022-final-010422.pdf">mission&nbsp;report.</a></p><p>Getting NbS projects off the ground is as challenging as ensuring these thrive over their lifetime (i.e. avoiding greenwashing and over-crediting). If we want to ensure these interventions lead to a real impact, we need to provide financial contributions across the lifespan of projects. In the pilot, time and time again partners have stressed the importance of early-stage studies to find the most suitable intervention sites. This requires a level of analysis at the catchment level and is the only way to proceed with detailed planning on the local scale. Beyond this we hear time and again that, with budgets being cut, maintenance is one of the first types of funding that gets cut for the council — and so there is a reticence to invest in such visible&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Hence we need to be thinking about funding streams for various stages of the development of NbS: from strategic analysis, concept and detailed design, construction, maintenance &amp; monitoring of projects. For some of these stages, and especially in these early days of market development, foundational capital is&nbsp;key.</p>The figure above lays out the preliminary business model for TreesAI Glasgow&nbsp;Pilot<p>NbS are a different sort of asset class where returns will not be immediately, or comprehensively monetisable hence why a new Monitoring, Reporting &amp; Verification (MRV) strategy is so important.</p><p>Across the Pilot in Glasgow, we have run into some of the challenges underpinning our risk, forecasting and impact verification capacities. Currently, each organisation has their own modelling approach, which has been designed for specific purposes and is often built on proprietary software that is rarely interoperable. As levels of scale, granularity and calibration are dependent on uses, data can often not be extrapolated for shared endeavours like co-investing. These risk models are often black boxes that cannot be broken down to understand incremental improvements (for example outputs are risk ratings for properties) — whereas investing in nature requires an acceptance of a degree of uncertainty.</p><p>Beyond this, the lack of confidence in the ability of nature to provide ecosystem services often means that modelling consultants will (to be confident in their estimations) reduce the real impact potential — modelling trees as permeable surfaces rather than including their stormwater retention capacity from evapotranspiration. We need a modelling infrastructure to support common decision-making through open and Interoperable tools &amp; processes.</p><p>Over the past two years, we have been developing the tools and approaches to support the planning of NbS projects. Our team from Lucidminds have developed an open-source framework called <a href="https://greenurbanscenarios.com/">Green Urban Scenarios</a>, which uses agent-based modelling to assess potential impact across different scenarios — for more information see this <a href="https://lucidmindsai.medium.com/green-urban-scenarios-298d75b100b4">blog serie</a>s. We have recently kicked off a partnership with <a href="https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/digital-innovation/hartree-national-centre-for-digital-innovation/">HNCDI</a> to integrate these models through their geospatial discovery programme. Beyond this, we have also adopted the <a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/guidances/impact-and-vulnerability-analysis-of-vital-infrastructures-and-built-up-areas">IVAVIA methodology</a> to develop a GIS-based tool to provide projects with a location-specific score based on the location’s risk profile. These have been built as a modular cloud-based platform that is intended to be plugged into a variety of organisations and contexts.</p><p>Modelling on its own, however, will not prove sufficient for investment to happen. As we have seen in the recent carbon credits scandals, natural capital markets require transparent monitoring &amp; verification processes — less we risk overselling them. This is a real problem expressed by public and private stakeholders: the lack of evidence &amp; processes to prove the performance of NbS. A stark reality is that a number of NbS projects have been built in Glasgow, none of which have received enough funding to be monitored in a detailed manner to understand their performance over time. From the design stage, we need discussions around intended benefits and methods and metrics to measure them, along with baseline monitoring to ensure they are accurately captured. However, there is a lack of standards &amp; monitoring methodologies, data-sharing practices and protocols, along with a lack of funding earmarked for post-construction activities (see above). We hope to continue co-building an MRV strategy and to start monitoring a number of sites to build evidence datasets to help decision-makers.</p><p>But to achieve this, we need to create the structures for collaboration across organisations…</p>Screenshot of TreesAI platform interface powered by Green Urban Scenarios and Location Based&nbsp;Scoring |2| We need novel organisational structures which enable innovative processes and methodologies to invest in&nbsp;nature. <p>Overcoming challenges in investing in urban NbS requires more than financial resources and technological solutions. The benefits of nature are many, and so too are the beneficiaries. Growing this nascent field requires a whole new set of skillsets within organisations, an overcoming of inter-organisational silos and partnership working between stakeholders.</p><p>Green finance for NbS is a nascent field, and stakeholders are only now starting to grasp how this could work. In order to participate in NbS (from design to implementation), stakeholders require specific technical expertise — for example, we found a need for hydrological modelling which is costly and time intensive. On top of technical skills, investing in NbS for stormwater management requires financial and operational competencies. For example, whereas implementing a piece of tried and tested grey infrastructure enables them to use known project management (for instance, with contractors they’ve already worked with), there is a lack of understanding around the costs and risks of delivering NbS. But it is not just in project delivery that skills are needed, organisations require an in-house understanding of cutting-edge technologies, financial instruments and constantly shifting policy contexts to accelerate their ability for delivering NbS. We support the proposal, within the Climate Ready Clyde Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan for a regional Adaptation Finance Lab — which is still at the concept stage — to support the development of many of the required&nbsp;skills.</p><p>There is a lot of learning that needs to be developed, and possibly integrating individuals with the right skills and background in public organisations could be of benefit, training existing employees or improving our collective capacity through partnership working.</p><p>Throughout our pilot major barriers to innovation have been 1) the misalignment, overlap and lack of implementation clarity between multiple formal and informal planning guidance being developed by different city departments or organisations (e.g. the Forest and Woodland Strategy developed by the planning department and a more informal tree development directive developed by the Parks and Gardens Department); 2) the lack of council leadership especially when it comes to treasury functions (e.g. such as the capacity to underwrite private capital investments and deploy existing budgets in innovative ways); and 3) the significant lack of decision-making capacity. In the public sector, hierarchical structures and lack of resources have meant that there are not enough decision-makers in the room and individuals lack the bandwidth to focus on making the transition possible to scale urban&nbsp;NbS.</p><p>The pilot in Glasgow is a stark reminder that co-investing in NbS requires dedicated capacities and clear decision-making lines in the governmental sectors to ensure policy alignment inter and intra-organisationally. We hope that local authorities can step up in creating the proper political structures to take decisions on green economy matters across relevant departments since they need a structure and relevant posts to make decision-making possible. The city of Edinburgh, for example, has changed its structure in order to bring a more efficient decision-making process around NbS and could be a potential example of integrating green economy matters across councils. At the same time, we are hoping to follow closely and work alongside the development of the new NPF4 and related workgroups that we hope will help unlock capacity and align existing plans across the region and where necessary co-develop novel local plans in a truly collaborative manner across organisations.</p><p>The Glasgow Metropolitan Strategic Drainage Partnership (MGSDP) is perhaps one of the many examples of place-based institutions that have struggled to achieve transformative results — for more information see the <a href="https://www.crew.ac.uk/publication/taking-collaborative-approach-water-sector-review-metropolitan-glasgow-strategic">CREW review</a>. While it has delivered a multitude of impactful projects across Glasgow, just a small number of NbS projects have been delivered through co-investment ( e.g. ERDF, Water Environment Fund, Nature Restoration Fund, Sustrans), but none have yet attracted private investment. In fact, the spatial scale of NFM is such that interventions need to be truly aligned at a sub-basin level to be successful (e.g. we have encountered examples where upriver flooding will have an impact on the flood zone regardless of the NFM intervention). Barriers include the misalignment of liabilities, incentives and timeframes of multiple stakeholders in the partnership, for example between the national water utility company and the local authority.</p><p>But it is not just public-private partnerships that are needed when intervening in the urban built environment, communities as those who live closest to the problem and solution must be involved from the outset. Benefits of doing so range from the importance of incorporating local needs, increasing social capital and stewardship, with trees lasting much longer when involving communities in their maintenance (which has been shown to reduce the mortality rate from 30% to 5%). However, partners who are co-designing and delivering projects on the ground have encountered the challenge of raising awareness of the benefits of such schemes, for example when a swale in a local park will take away a ‘neat-looking lawn’ or when a woodland preservation scheme was understood to worsen flooding ‘as that’s where the water was seen to be coming from’. However, this is only part of the story with the recently launched <a href="https://peoplesplanfornature.org/">People’s plan for Nature</a>, created by a citizens’ assembly, includes recommendations for national legislation concerning the “right to equitable access to nature” and for local government and NGOs to act on this by bringing more nature into urban&nbsp;areas.</p><p>Our pilot has tried to highlight and work across some of these challenges by building a new partnership that can test new modalities to collaborate across sub-basins (other similar examples are the <a href="https://missionpossiblepartnership.org/">mission possible partnership</a> or the <a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/publications/public-common-partnerships-building-new-circuits-of-collective-ownership">Public-Common Partnerships</a>). We will continue to develop this new model, working hard to ensure the private sector is looped into the conversation and that local public institutions have the capacity to engage with&nbsp;them.</p><p>But without the enabling environment, these partnerships will not grow in hostile&nbsp;ground…</p>Governance structure of the TreesAI Glasgow Pilot Partnership |3| We need to build better market incentives, contracting &amp; regulatory frameworks for organisations to gain the practices, confidence and trust to co-invest in&nbsp;nature. <p>While there is increasing hype around investments in nature, private capital is still slow. This is in part due to the nascent nature of many of net-zero and nature-positive requirements facing the private sector with corporate boards only just beginning to integrate concepts like carbon accounting or consider biodiversity investment strategies (specifically in England &amp; Wales due to the legally mandated Biodiversity Net Gain, <a href="https://www.theplanner.co.uk/2022/04/10/biodiversity-enhancement-scotland-different-approach#:~:text=Unlike%20England%2C%20Scotland%20has%20not,national%20planning%20framework%20(NPF).">a version of which</a> Scotland will begin to consider). Beyond carbon and biodiversity, investing in nature with specific flood management outcomes is an even more nascent market. This is apparent through our pilot in Glasgow where public and private stakeholders are aware they should be making the transition to investing in NbS for flood mitigation, but current regulation does not address retrofitting through NbS to tackle flood risk and to justify investments through a clear business incentive. In this section, we set out three interventions we believe could support the development of this&nbsp;market.</p><p>Carbon and biodiversity are just two ecosystem services that require investment if we want to scale the transition and reverse losses to our natural environment. If we want to capture other vital ecosystem services (such as flood management &amp; temperature regulation) we need firstly standards specific to those services and secondly agreed to approaches for the stacking and bundling of multiple benefits to allow different sectors and industries to structure shared investments. This would support the generation of viable business models based on the parcelling out of the different benefits related to different beneficiaries.</p><p>We positively welcome Defra’s recently published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147397/nature-markets.pdf">Nature Markets Framework</a>, which starts to set out the much-needed principles, rules and requirements needed for market alignment across standards and ecosystem services — and includes the next steps to support BSI to develop standards for a range of ecosystem services.</p><p>While still in its infancy, we do see innovative first movers who are on a journey to understand how Natural Capital markets could enable flood risk to be recognised and mitigated and we aim to work alongside some of these. For example, the River Trust is developing ‘Replenish credits’ as a mechanism to finance natural solutions to improve water quality and reduce flood risk and the Forestry Commission is planning to develop a Woodland Water Code by 2025, to provide a standard for water-related benefits of woodland creation (from pollution mitigation to flood risk mitigation). We are also looking to work with other approaches to mainstream private finance into nature for example the <a href="https://www.naturanceproject.eu/">Horizon 2020 funded Naturance project</a> aims to explore over the next 3.5 years the technical, financial and operational feasibility and performance of solutions that integrate NbS into disaster risk financing — using investments in nature as ‘natural hedging’.</p><p>Currently, only some public organisations bear the risk of flooding in Glasgow, yet many players would benefit from flood risk alleviation. As private actors in the Glasgow partnership do not legally bear the risk there is no explicit incentive for investment in NbS and NFM especially at the individual organisation level. Even within the public sector, the distribution of liabilities across actors is a barrier to co-investment. For example, Glasgow City Council (GCC) are liable for surface water flooding whereas Scottish Water (SW) is liable for chronic sewer flooding — on top of this they each are concerned with different types of flood events. This makes it difficult to bundle risks and agree on a common&nbsp;pathway.</p><p>We need to standardise risk measurements and requirements across organisations in order to induce co-investments. A regulatory framework is required to crystallise shared risks and incentivise investments, both for the public and private sectors. Regulation around disclosure aligned to <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/">TCFD</a> are positive first steps which are not yet filtering into investment decisions and are only tangentially relevant to the conversations we are having with stakeholders.</p><p>Beyond this, we also need to translate those risks into clear targets that incorporate the multiple benefits of nature's positive risk mitigation strategies. In Glasgow for example we have seen how clearly defined targets related to active travel (for example reducing no. of car journeys) and carbon mitigation (net zero by 2030) provide a clear motivation for aligned planning and resourcing decisions. Whereas the lack of clearly articulated national and local targets for nature-based solutions and blue-green infrastructure means that what gets built is dictated by cost-benefit analyses, which rarely capture comprehensively the long-term and complex benefits delivered by&nbsp;nature.</p><p>In Scotland, we are looking to emerging policy windows that could offer opportunities to place Scotland at the cutting edge of regulatory innovation in this space. Over the next few months our partner Scottish Flood Forum will be involved in the consultations for the national <a href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2022/09/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-2022-23/documents/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223/govscot%3Adocument/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223.pdf">Flooding Strategy</a> — stay tuned for the development of community engagement guidelines in the delivery of privately financed urban NFM so that the voice of nature and local residents can be embedded at the core of the project. We also are looking hopefully at the next Statutory Climate Adaptation programme — which will be published next year — where we expect to see more emphasis on clearer targets and monitoring/evaluation approaches, as advised by <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/is-scotland-climate-ready-2022-report-to-scottish-parliament/">the Climate Change Committee</a>. Another opportunity we see is the potential revision to Scottish Water’s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/principles-of-charging-2021-2027/">charging principles</a> which could offer an opportunity to incentivise the private sector to invest in BGI by potentially offering them a cost-saving on future water/drainage bills.</p><p>Beyond Scotland, we are pleased that the recently published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147377/mobilising-green-investment-2023-green-finance-strategy.pdf">UK Green Finance Strategy</a> provides a framework for scaling nature-based investment markets; putting adaptation higher on the political agenda and setting commitments towards the much-needed capacity building, training, skills, and wider net zero infrastructure (see C.1). However we are also aware that the outcomes of the Brexit Freedoms Bill, which will see the reform or removal of 570 environmental EU laws, might <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/uk-setting-bonfire-of-environmental-regulations-alight-with-new-bill/">negatively reduce existing standards</a> (e.g. water quality) as well as <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2364782-brexit-law-change-could-restrict-access-to-uk-river-pollution-data/">restricting legal rights to access environmental information</a>, increasing burden on civil servants and uncertainty across businesses that will have to operate knowing that the “<a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/uk-setting-bonfire-of-environmental-regulations-alight-with-new-bill/">rules and regulations… could change dramatically within the next 14&nbsp;months</a>”.</p><p>While this level of regulatory reform is beyond the scope of the pilot, it provides the context for which the pilot will either thrive or&nbsp;fail.</p><p>A template contract for co-investments in NbS would allow the development of legal commercial agreements and necessary MoUs between stakeholders. In the absence of market standards, the ability to strike (and contract on) a deal is hindered by the lack of consistency in documentation, meaning actors need (with every new deal) to spend time and resources on drafting these. The template agreements shared by the<a href="https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.co.uk/gfihive/toolkit/establishing-legal-contracts-and-closing/wyre-river-natural-flood-management-project/"> Wyre River investment project</a> have proved a helpful starting point and — as per lessons learned from the Wyre River project — we are going to be working towards the negotiation of non-binding MoUs between all the pilot partners that will ultimately require them to contract with each other to co-invest and deliver urban NbS. This iterative process will allow us to surface the technical, legal and financial requirements of different partners.</p><p>Through the pilot, we are hoping to develop these contracts as multi-stakeholder value agreements (across multiple actors, roles, values and assets) which exploit interdependencies to unlock multiple shared values. This builds off work as part of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/BeyondtheRules">Beyond the Rules</a>, where we are developing standardised many-to-many agreements, organising and governance that aim to help fragmented actors to cross-boundary, systemic organising and governance.</p>Image from report Nature markets: A framework for scaling up private investment in nature recovery and sustainable farming, March&nbsp;2023 Call to&nbsp;action TreesAI team in&nbsp;Glasgow<p>The Glasgow pilot for co-investments in urban Nature-based Solutions is surfacing a number of structural learnings. The aforementioned challenges and suggested solution pathways are a call to action required at multiple levels and by different market stakeholders.</p><p>First of all, national governments need to develop clearer targets, regulations and standards to help organise &amp; transition public institutions, as well as implicating the private sector into environmental targets, to collectively address climate risks in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Secondly, local governments and city councils should champion and lead cross-council institutions, building the necessary political momentum for scaling NbS.

 After numerous delays, the much-anticipated government review and update of the Gambling Act 2005 has finally arrived. 



 



<p>It’s safe to say that the UK’s gambling industry has been in a state of turmoil for a few years now. In 2020, Boris Johnson launched a review of the Gambling Act 2005, raising concerns that the document might need to be updated to apply to the digital age. Indeed, it absolutely did, as at the time the 2005 Act was created, almost all gambling took place in brick and mortar betting shops, casinos and racetracks. Now, the industry makes more than 65% of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/26/gambling-uk-white-paper-online-casinos">£11 billion annual revenue</a> from online gambling.</p>



<p>The review was expected to lead to a white paper outlining modifications to the act. Three years later, and the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1153228/1286-HH-E02769112-Gambling_White_Paper_Book_Accessible1.pdf">UK gambling white paper</a> (High Stakes: Gambling Reform for the Digital Age) is finally here.</p>



<p>Now that the white paper has been released, it will likely have long-term implications for the sector. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the potential consequences for players and operators.</p>



 What is the UK gambling white paper? 



<p>The Gambling Act Review White Paper is an official publication that sets forth its approach to regulating the online gaming industry in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The document covers current policies, regulations, and changes for gambling services in the UK. Such gambling regulations and policies include ensuring the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">protection of consumers</a>, mitigating problem gambling, preventing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>, and making the enforcement of payment regulations easier.</p>



<p>The official document aims to provide an environment where players can safely partake in various forms of mainstream gambling, such as casino games, slots, lotteries, and sports betting. Gambling operators can continue providing the same products, but all games have to be within the regulatory limits.</p>



<p>Overall, the ultimate goal of this white paper is to promote transparency, fairness, and safety within all aspects of UK-based gambling activities.</p>



<blockquote><p>[We’re] bringing our pre-smartphone regulations into the present day with a gambling white paper for the digital age.</p>Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer at the House of Commons</blockquote>



 Why was the white paper delayed? 



<p>Speculated by industry insiders to be the greatest reform in nearly two decades, the UK’s new gambling framework has introduced proposals for various significant changes. However, the nearly three-year delay in reform has resulted in frustration and even inactivity in the gambling sector.</p>



<p>Initiated in December 2020, the review was supervised by no less than four culture secretaries, six gambling ministers, and three prime ministers. Little wonder, then that its official release was stalled four times throughout government turmoil and the pandemic. </p>



<p>In February, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak revealed plans for a newly-formed DSIT (Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology) and a new “refocused” Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunak’s recent cabinet shuffle has caused further frustration, especially since Paul Scully, who received praise from those within the gambling industry for listening to both sides of the argument as demonstrated by his views on <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/retail/2023/01/27/paul-scully-white-paper-will-see-finance-risk-checks-not-affordability-checks/">affordability checks</a>, was then appointed to another post. On February 7th, Scully took up his new position as Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy.</p>



<p>It is important to remember that in the last few years, a cost of living crisis, the war in Ukraine, and rising energy prices have also been pressing concerns for the current government, which perhaps explains why the review into the Gambling Act being was so low down on the priority list.</p>



<p>The amount of negotiation that goes into such a paper must also be considered. Stakeholders within the gambling industry realize the devastating consequences these reported new initiatives could have, so they are still fighting for the best potential outcome for the health of the gambling industry.</p>

 Why is the UK gambling white paper important? 



<p>Overall, the UK gambling white paper is important in terms of providing much-needed regulatory clarity, and helping establish the social and legal framework of the gambling sector in the UK. By suggesting various measures to ensure consumer protection standards and mitigate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a> and cybercrime, the document offers guidance and direction on how operators should facilitate fair, transparent, and safe services. According to Frazer, the white paper also aims to protect individuals that are vulnerable to addiction and harm without affecting the overall experience of the majority. As other regulators often look to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">United Kingdom Gambling Commission</a> to see where gambling regulation is headed, the UK gambling white paper is likely to affect many global markets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/dutch-online-gambling-2022/">Netherlands</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">Ontario</a>.</p>



<p>In establishing a transparent legal framework and providing support services wherever necessary, the white paper will have a sweeping impact on operators and gamblers alike. Now that the document has been released, operators are advised to implement the necessary changes to their services and operations, from more active measures in managing problem gambling behavior, to increased minimum standards for protection and safety for players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implications for gamblers include more comprehensive access to information regarding their gambling activities, improved customer support processes, new limits on stake levels, more straightforward registration processes, and more robust consumer protection standards.</p>



<p>However, despite the apparent need to help tackle issues surrounding problem gambling, people within the industry argue that some of the UK gambling white paper’s proposals, including intrusive affordability checks and betting limits, could unfairly impact the enjoyment of your everyday punter.</p>



 What are the UK gambing white paper’s main proposals for change? 



<p>The UK gambling white paper sets out a series of changes to the Gambling Act 2005, which featured rules for the industry before the proliferation of smartphones and online gambling.&nbsp;The UK government has pledged to work with the Gambling Commission to implement changes as soon as possible. Consultations and trials for some of the changes will be carried out, but all measures are expected to be in force by summer 2024. Some of the most significant proposals include:</p>



 Promotion of responsible gambling 



  More prescriptive rules on when operators must check for ‘harmful’ customer losses.<br>  



  Stake limit for online slots games, bringing them in line with land-based sector. (e.g. between £2-15 per spin.)<br>  



  Greater protection for 18-24 year olds, which could be a £2 limit per stake or an approach based on individual risk.<br>  



 Gaming experience 



  Making the ‘design’ of online games safer, by reviewing game speeds and features that exacerbate risks.  



  Ensuring incentives like bonuses and free bets are constructed in a ‘social responsible manner’.<br>  Subject to trials, data sharing between online operators and high risk customers mandatory for ‘collaborative harm prevention’.<br>  Consultation on whether to make player-centric tools like ‘online deposit limits’ mandatory or opt-out rater than opt-in.<br>  



 Support services<br> 



  Strengthen informational messaging including on the risks associated with gambling.  



  Premier League to end ‘front-of-shirt’ sponsorships by gambling firms.<br>  Review Gaming Commission fees to ensure enough resources are available to implement changes.  



  Introduce a statutory levy paid by operators to Gambling Commission to fund research, education, and treatment of gambling harms.<br>  Creation of new ombudsman role to deal with disputes and provide appropriate redress when a customer suffers losses due to a failure in an operator’s social responsibility policy.  



<p></p>



 The demand for more regulations. 



<p>Britain has the world’s largest iGaming market, not to mention one of the most liberal. In the past, UK-based regulatory authorities primarily outsourced consumer protection to problem gamblers, who were expected to “self-exclude” from gambling platforms should they suspect problem gambling patterns in their own behavior. They can do so through a platform established and funded by the gambling industry in 2018: Gamstop. That said, anti-gambling lobbyists argue that it is unreasonable to expect addicts to make sound decisions for themselves, and it should be accepted that they require guidance. Many addiction clinics in the UK have reported an upsurge in gamblers seeking treatment for deterioration in <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2022/11/nhs-opens-two-new-gambling-addition-clinics-amid-record-referrals/">mental health</a>.</p>



<p>The horse racing industry in the UK has also suffered partly due to the delay in the white paper’s release. In December 2022, representatives of the British racing industry met with gambling officials outlining their concerns affordability checks will have on the industry.&nbsp;While the sport has always been popular in the country, it has lost at least <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/features/series/the-40-million-blow-how-affordability-checks-are-already-hitting-horseracing-aqfKc4Z8eMEU/">£40 million in revenue</a>. The UK Gambling Commission has also increased restrictions, causing shifts in betting sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, prominent operator Entain <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/business/affordability-checks-hit-entain-revenues-by-100-million-as-annual-results-released-av3z35a3pdzd/">reported a loss</a> of £100 million due to a significant drop in gambling activity led on by the UK Gambling Commission’s restrictions and the rumor of affordability checks in the white paper. According to the operator, the drop is because more players are headed toward platforms that do not enforce as much oversight.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">Betting and Gaming Council</a>, 250,000 bettors visited <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qatar-2022-show-red-card-betting-fraud/">black market betting sites in December </a>(during the World Cup 2022), up from 80,000 during the same month in 2021. Betting fraud affects all countries regardless of their legal stance on gambling.</p>



 How to prepare for the white paper. 



<p>The UK has become the world’s most prominent regulated iGaming market. Despite its impact on society – both positives and negatives – it is still held back by restrictions that the white paper’s release could correct.</p>



<p>Now that the white paper has released, one thing’s for sure – gambling platforms have a duty to ensure they’re protecting their users, especially those problem gamblers. Having a&nbsp;KYC process in place to verify who they are, and the age they are, has never been more important.</p>

<p>Northern Block and Canadian Bank Note enthusiastic about delivering a more convenient and intuitive solution for Canadian citizens, by unifying mDLs and Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.northernblock.io/">Northern Block Inc</a>. and<a href="http://www.cbnco.com/"> Canadian Bank Note Ltd. (CBN)</a> are working together to create a more convenient and user-friendly solution for Canadians by combining different types of digital credentials, such as Mobile Driving Licences (mDLs), AnonCreds and JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials (VCs), using Hyperledger Aries technology. They plan to first focus on integrating mDLs and JSON-LD VCs into Hyperledger Aries wallets, and then work on offline verification using NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transfer.</p>
<p>Both companies recognize that different credential technologies are suitable for different use cases and have varying levels of adoption in the industry. Therefore, to make it easier for citizens and ensure interoperability, a consistent approach across all technologies is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Hyperledger Aries and various verifiable credential formats, such as AnonCreds and JSON-LD VC, is a great choice for government programs that aim to provide citizens with privacy-preserving high-assurance personal identity credentials. Aries is a technology that is well-suited for digital interactions where citizens want to build different types of relationships with their peers. Citizens can use the same set of VCs for various purposes, and these VCs may need to support privacy preservation or not, depending on the type of relationship they want to build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile Driver’s Licences (mDLs) are gaining widespread acceptance and becoming more practical due to their standardization under ISO/IEC 18013-5 and the forthcoming 18013-7, which establish a unified framework for their development, issuance, and verification. As a focused use case, mDLs are specifically designed to address the unique requirements of driver’s licence management, including distinct data attributes, security features, and regulatory compliance needs. Consequently, they are better equipped to tackle the specific challenges and requirements of this application, offering increased utility in this context.</p>
<p>Northern Block actively engages in open source, standards, and conformance criteria communities, participating in organizations such as the Hyperledger Foundation, Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), the Digital Identity and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC – PCTF), and the Digital Governance Standards Institute. Northern Block recently showcased multi-VC format issuance and presentation flows, using AnonCreds and W3C JSON-LD credentials, as part of their commitment to interoperability, supported by funding from the Ontario Government. Northern Block is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario (<a href="http://www.northernblock.io/">www.northernblock.io</a>).</p>
<p>CBN, a security solutions provider to over 40 jurisdictions operating in the passport, driver’s licence, and identity market, deployed the world’s first mDL for live transactions and was awarded the contract to supply an mDL to the Commonwealth of Virginia. CBN is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada (<a href="http://www.cbnco.com/">www.cbnco.com</a>).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an essential component of IT security today, enabling organizations to control access to their systems and data by managing user identities, access entitlements and authentication. The importance of IAM continues to grow as cyber threats continue to evolve and data privacy regulations become more stringent.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey conducted by KuppingerCole Analysts, nearly 95% of organizations have an IAM solution in place. Most medium-sized to large organizations, factually, have multiples different IAM solutions in place for providing different IAM capabilities. This clearly shows the increasing importance of IAM in today's IT security.</p>
 Trends, facts and figures 
<p>The shift to cloud-based IAM solutions, also commonly referred to as IDaaS (Identity as a Service), which offer greater scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness than traditional on-premises solutions, is one of the key trends driving the growth of the IAM market. As more organizations adopt cloud computing, IDaaS is gaining popularity. Moreover, integration of IAM with additional security solutions, such as Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response (EPDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, is a trend. This integration enables organizations to adopt a more holistic security strategy by monitoring user activity across all systems and applications and detecting and responding to threats in real time. This demonstrates the importance of IAM within cybersecurity strategies.</p>
<p>The IAM market is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace, driven by factors such as those mentioned above, but also others. Regulations require a strong Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) posture. Cybersecurity and Zero Trust initiatives drive the demand for advanced authentication mechanisms&nbsp;such as passwordless authentication and adaptive access controls. KuppingerCole Analysts predicts that the IAM market volume will reach 35.58 billion USD by 2025, representing a CAGR of 16.8%, which is a clear indicator of this strong market growth.</p>
<p>IAM solutions are relevant across the globe. The largest revenue share comes from North America and EMEA, which approximately have a similar share of the global market across the various IAM subsegments. A smaller portion comes from APAC and LATAM, which have lower adoption rates, but we expect to see significant growth in these regions in the coming years.</p>
 A closer look into IAM subsegments 
<p>IGA is a core component of IAM, focused on managing users and their access to systems and data in accordance with policies and regulations. This market is expected to expand in the coming years as organizations seek to streamline identity management processes and ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. In addition, IGA solutions have begun to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate identity-related tasks and increase productivity. It is possible to learn more about this market segment in the Leadership Compass published by KuppingerCole (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81107/identity-governance-and-administration-2022">Identity Governance and Administration 2022 | KuppingerCole</a>).</p>
<p>Biometrics and adaptive access control is another growing area. The goal is to provide enhanced security and user experience over traditional password-based authentication. Their importance continues to grow in the context of Zero Trust initiative and for better protecting against cyberattacks targeting users, their digital identities, and credentials such as passwords.</p>
<p>Finally, Zero Trust security models are driving IAM adoption, requiring strong and continual authentication and authorization for verifying users and their devices. We also expect to see an increase in the adoption of decentralized identity solutions that allow users to reuse identities and associated identity proofs across multiple organizations, systems and applications. Warwick Ashford explained about the future using decentralized identity in his blog post (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/blog/future-with-decentralized-identity">Gear Up for the Future with Decentralized Identity (kuppingercole.com)</a>.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We expect continued growth in all IAM subsegments. While some are expected to show a good and stable CAGR around 10% others are expected to grow significantly faster. At the upcoming EIC (European Identity Conference), which will take place in Berlin in mid-May, we have several tracks where we will discuss topics such as trends in IGA, maturity levels of Identity Fabrics and the challenges of moving to passwordless authentication. As every year, there will be plenty interesting sessions at EIC. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/agenda">Agenda | EIC 2023 (kuppingercole.com)</a>.</p>

<p></p><p><a href="https://benri.io">Benri</a> is hosting <a href="https://ssi.benri.io">TBD's SSI Service</a> to enable users to learn more about SSI technology.</p><p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a decentralized approach to identity management
that gives individuals control over their personal data. With SSI, people can
manage their personal information, credentials, and other digital assets,
without relying on centralized authorities. At benri, we are proud to provide a
playground for <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service">TBD's SSI Service</a>
at our subdomain <a href="https://ssi.benri.io">ssi.benri</a>, where users can explore the
power of SSI in a secure and easy-to-use environment. This is not meant to be
used for production, but can be a hands-on learning experience for those
interested in building decentralized apps and learning more about SSI.</p><p>At Benri, users can access TBD's SSI-Service, which supports a wide range of SSI functionality. </p><p>Users can</p>  create and manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which provide a unique identifier for each user in a
decentralized system.   create and manage Verifiable Credentials (VCs), which allow users to share their identity information and credentials with others in a secure and privacy-preserving way.   facilitate credential suspension, credential revocations, applying for credentials, exchanging credentials, and data schemas for credentials and other verifiable data.   <p>It is not meant for production use, but is a learning tool to learn more about SSI technology.</p><p>To make it easy for users to access the SSI-Service, benri is providing 3 main endpoints:</p>  <a href="https://ssi.benri.io">ssi.benri</a>: which hosts a streamlit application.  <a href="https://ssi.benri.io/docs">docs</a>: which hosts the swagger docs  ssi.benri.io/api: which hosts the API
endpoints corresponding to the docs. It hosts the RESTful API's which can be
used to manage your services.  <p>See below for an example of a DID resolution using the SSI Service API's:</p>   <code># resolve a did<br>curl -X GET  https://ssi.benri.io/api/v1/dids/resolver/did:key:z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2<br>{"didResolutionMetadata":{"ContentType":"","Error":null},"didDocument":{"@context":"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1","id":"did:key:z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2","verificationMethod":[{"id":"#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2","type":"Ed25519VerificationKey2018","controller":"did:key:z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2","publicKeyBase58":"HRQkCkE6CXcxhJmeK1cZCPzDLdqyDHpPv4pK2LQALo9e"}],"authentication":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]],"assertionMethod":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]],"keyAgreement":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]],"capabilityDelegation":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]]},"didDocumentMetadata":{}}%<br></code>     <p>The docs have <a href="https://ssi.benri.io/docs">additional API's listed</a>.</p><p>The SSI service is a bridge to learning more about the decentralized web and
basic components in the Web5 Ecosystem. Users can store their credentials on
their devices or in the cloud, ensuring that they have complete control over
their data. Additionally, the platform uses cutting-edge encryption and
authentication technologies to protect user data and prevent unauthorized
access.</p><p>Access the easy-to-use playground for TBD's SSI-Service at <a href="https://ssi.benri.io">Benri</a>, and explore the power of self-sovereign identity.</p><p>If you're interested in learning more about SSI, visit the <a href="https://ssi.benri.io">SSI-Service</a> and start playing around with the tools!</p>

<p>Investment confirms approximate value of Aftermath Islands at $53 Million CDN </p>



<p>April 17, 2023 –Toronto, Canada / Bridgetown, Barbados –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) confirms receipt of a share purchase agreement for its lead investor in its private Series A round financing, at approximately $4.50 CDN per ordinary share.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lead investor is the principal of a Family Office and group of privately held funds in the UK and EU and includes an option to increase their position based on the Company reaching certain milestones, which the Company is well underway to achieving, but cannot be guaranteed.&nbsp; The purchase agreement values Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited currently at approximately $53,000,000 CDN.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited is continuing to work with additional VCs, Family Office, and High Net Worth Individuals to support the raise in its Series A round of up to $6,000,000 USD in aggregate, with approval to increase to a maximum of $7,500,000 USD and will provide further updates as they become available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the current Series A financing terms, Oasis Digital Studios Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. will not be diluted in its equity position in Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited in the Series A round of funding, retaining 50% of the ordinary, or common shares, with Aftermath Islands remaining a controlled subsidiary of Liquid Avatar.</p>



<p>Since its inception, Aftermath Islands has taken its own, unique path to providing a Web3 experience by developing and incorporating leading technologies that have created an open world platform that confirms, through its partnership with Liquid Avatar, that everyone on the platform can control and manage their digital footprint using biometrics with no username or password for signing into the platform.&nbsp; The Liquid Avatar Mobile App, available in over 100 countries and regions globally via the Apple Store and Google play, provides a Proof of Humanity process, the Meta Park Pass TM, which creates a high level of assurance that all players are individual, real people, reducing fraud, fake and duplicate accounts, and bots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands has generated over $2 million in retail sales, over 7,800 platform purchases, and provided high-fidelity gaming graphics for a real-world virtual experience with no download, making it accessible by a wide variety mobile, tablets and computers.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands has successfully launched its first servers and has incorporated Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT3 to enable Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to engage with players as subject matter experts.&nbsp; The platform also allows instant connections to legacy Web2 websites, eCommerce platforms, search engines, ticketing systems, gaming platforms, educational institutions, social media and more to create a holistic 360-degree experience for consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late October 2022, Aftermath Islands launched its first Play to Earn (P2E) game, Lost Kingdom of T’Sara, (“LKoT”) allowing players to collect resources and exchange them for Resource Pack NFTs that can be used inside the open world platform to create value.&nbsp; To date, users have collected over 3.9 billion resources, successfully created over 4.7 million Resource Pack NFTs and user engagement is upwards of 70 minutes per day, with outliers spending several hours a day playing LKoT.</p>



<p>“The investment in Aftermath Islands open world concept with high fidelity graphics, no download and proven revenues supports our ability to move forward expeditiously and continues to gain momentum and traction in market,” commented David Lucatch, CEO of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. and Managing Director of Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited. “As a Web3 pioneer and supporter of legacy Web2 platforms, Aftermath Islands has created a unique environment that provides users with a high-fidelity graphics experience with no download, creating a platform similar to the major streaming services but with multi-player usability.&nbsp; We believe that this approach is the launch point to integrating the future of online technologies, engagement, and commerce, while respecting and including today’s vast network of online properties.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 10th April to 16th&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap that focuses on some crucial regulatory developments and their potential effect on the ecosystem. This week, we cover the US setting its regulatory crosshairs on stablecoins, the IMF renewing calls for regulating crypto by citing the FTX collapse and turmoil in the banking sector, an SEC Commissioner blasting the agency’s heavy-handed approach toward the crypto industry, and India’s Finance Minister calling for globally coordinated crypto regulation at G20 meetings.</p> The US has set its Regulatory Crosshairs on its Next Target: Stablecoins <p>Since the FTX debacle, the United States has gone into an overdrive mode to regulate cryptocurrencies, with industry stakeholders raising the alarm and terming the government’s action “Operation Chokehold 2.0.” And now, its focus is on stablecoins.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1635964585621745665?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>A recent regulatory draft proposal detailed provisions stating that insured depository institutions issuing stablecoins would be subject to oversight by corresponding regulatory authorities. The hearing on the proposed stablecoin bill is scheduled for 19&nbsp;April.</p><p>If approved, non-bank institutions would come under Federal Reserve scrutiny, and foreign issuers would need to register to conduct business within the&nbsp;US.</p><p>However, approval of stablecoin issuance would depend on several factors, such as maintaining adequate reserves, including USD or Treasury&nbsp;bills.</p><p>The possible impact of this proposed regulation on the crypto ecosystem and users could be both positive and negative.</p><p>On the positive side, the increased transparency and oversight may foster trust and confidence in stablecoins, leading to broader adoption and utilization in various use cases, such as cross-border transactions and a store of&nbsp;value.</p><p>It could also help prevent fraudulent activities, protect investors, and contribute to a more stable financial system by reducing the likelihood of market manipulation and “black swan”&nbsp;events.</p><p>Conversely, the proposed regulations could have negative consequences, too, for crypto users and the ecosystem at&nbsp;large.</p><p>For instance, the stringent regulatory framework might push some companies to seek friendlier jurisdictions, leading to market fragmentation and creating challenges for global cooperation.</p><p>The regulations might even impose limitations on the privacy and autonomy of users, as increased monitoring and reporting requirements could affect the decentralization aspect that attracts many to cryptocurrencies in the first&nbsp;place.</p> IMF Renews Calls for Regulating Crypto Citing FTX Collapse &amp; Turmoil in Banking&nbsp;Sector <p>The International Monetary Fund called for regulating digital assets and strict prudential requirements for stablecoin issuers in its “Global Financial Stability Report.”</p><p>The IMF believes there should be comprehensive and consistent regulation and supervision in the crypto-asset ecosystem.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ilker_zorlu_/status/1646517523372982277?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The report emphasizes the failures of FTX and crypto-friendly banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, as reasons to stress the need for adequate supervision and regulation.</p><p>However, these claims are unsubstantiated, as cryptocurrencies did not play a role in the banks’ failures. In fact, the true causes for these failures lie elsewhere, which calls into question the rationale for increasing supervision and regulation specifically targeting the crypto industry, citing recent bank failures.</p> SEC Commissioner Blasts Agency’s Heavy-Handed Approach Toward Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Hester Peirce, the Commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), criticized the agency for being too rigid in regulating new technologies and punishing entrepreneurs who try to innovate, including those in the crypto industry.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/remer_eth/status/1647283342491123715?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>“Today’s Commission tells entrepreneurs trying to do new things in our markets to come in and register. When entrepreneurs find they cannot, the Commission dismisses the possibility of making practical adjustments to our registration framework to help entrepreneurs register and instead rewards their good faith with an enforcement action. Today’s Commission treats the notice-and-comment rulemaking process not as a conversation, but as a threat,” said&nbsp;Peirce.</p><p>She argued for the need to balance fostering innovation and protecting investors. Her comments come amid criticism of the SEC’s slow guidance and enforcement actions regarding cryptocurrencies and related activities.</p> India’s Finance Minister Calls for Globally Coordinated Crypto Regulation at G20&nbsp;Meetings <p>India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, attended G20 meetings in the US and urged for a globally coordinated approach to regulate crypto assets due to their potential to cause macroeconomic instability.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1647606092745023490?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>G20 members agree on the need for globally coordinated regulation of crypto assets to deal with related challenges, according to Sitharaman.</p><p>She added that under India’s G20 presidency, a “synthesis paper” will be prepared on crypto assets following discussions between finance ministers and central bank governors from member countries.</p> Introducing Veriscope’s New Feature: Bloom Filter for Deposit Addresses <p>We’re excited to unveil our latest feature: the Veriscope Bloom Filter for deposit addresses.</p><p>This Redis Bloom-based innovation streamlines deposit address management and attestation events for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), enhancing their experience and simplifying their workflow.</p><p>By using the Veriscope Bloom Filter, VASPs can easily upload their deposit addresses, which narrows NEW_ATTESTATION events to only those specific addresses.</p><p>This means less manual work and a more efficient way to identify and respond to relevant attestations.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-releases-bloom-filters-a-game-changer-for-vasps-to-identify-address-relevant-attestations">Visit our blog post</a> to discover more about the Veriscope Bloom Filter and how it can transform your VASP experience.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">G7’s Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1645955195837267974?s=20">Japan is taking major steps to boost its crypto&nbsp;industry</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1646189406217285632?s=20">France is considering extending proposed crypto laws to include&nbsp;DeFi</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p></p><p>It has been a very long time since the last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-0-is-here/">Dev Pulse</a> — almost three months, in fact! And you know what? It’s kind of been a good thing! In keeping with our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/#what-does-app-stability-mean-for-devs">promise</a>, the last four releases of Holochain 0.1 have had few breaking changes for hApp developers and users, so the changelogs haven’t had much to report on. [Editor: 0.1.4 has had some breaking changes that you should know about; read the release notes below.] This has meant that devs can keep focusing on the thing that matters most to them — their app — rather than worrying about how we’re changing things on them yet again this week.</p><p>And things won’t be changing much even in Holochain 0.2. There are very few breaking changes, and almost none of them will be in your hApp code. With that said, the most significant breaking change is the replacement of QUIC transport with WebRTC — but remember that, true to our six-month promise, we’ll still keep running our QUIC proxy relay server for Holochain 0.1 until July 15th, and our bootstrap server now supports both QUIC and WebRTC.</p><p>Holochain 0.2.0’s <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">first release candidate</a> was published on 16th March, the full-feature release candidate <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0-beta-rc.4?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.2.0-beta-rc.4</a> was published on 13 April, and the final release will be published on 27 April. I’ll share all the release notes on that date.</p><p>With that, let’s see what’s happened since 0.1.0 was released!</p> Holochain 0.1.1 to 0.1.4: Bug fixes and backports <p>Edit: After publishing some small breaking changes in 0.1.4, we received reports that it unexpectedly introduced issues in scaffolding and deployment. This happened because some structs were moved from <code>holochain_integrity_types</code> to <code>hdi</code>, which caused crate dependency resolution issues that bubbled up into our development environment build process. For now, we recommend that you do not upgrade your hApps or development environment to 0.1.4, and wait for the upcoming 0.1.5 release instead.</p><p>Rather than report on each release individually, I’ll just give you the full list of changes for all four releases. Although we’re still on the 0.1.x series, we did introduce two very minor breaking changes which should take mere moments of code refactoring.</p>  Breaking (hApp manifests): The <code>version</code> field of a DNA section in a hApp manifest has been renamed to <code>installed_hash</code> and is now a single optional hash rather than an optional list of hashes. This field can be used to verify the integrity of a DNA at hApp install time. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2157?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2157</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2180?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2180</a>)  Bugfix, breaking (HDI, host API): Validation of DHT operations for private entries would <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1861?ref=blog.holochain.org">fail</a> for the <code>StoreEntry</code> op which would put the entry in the author’s own store. This has now been fixed. As the changelog says, this is a ‘slightly’ breaking change because <code>FlatOp</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">previously</a> <code>OpType</code>, see below) has some new enum variants that your validation code may need to match against. The compiler will tell you if your code needs to be refactored! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1910?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1910</a>)  New: <code>OpType</code> is renamed to <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.3.0-beta-rc.3/hdi/flat_op/enum.FlatOp.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>FlatOp</code></a>, and the <code>Op::to_type()</code> helper is renamed to <code>Op::flattened()</code>. This enum is used in validation callback to simplify otherwise complex <code>switch</code> code paths. The old names still exist as aliases to the new ones, so this isn’t a breaking change yet. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1909</a>)  New: Certain conductor API methods that can return <code>CellMissing</code> errors now return <code>CellDisabled</code> when the cell is present but disabled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2092?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2092</a>)  New: Enabling or disabling a clone cell is now idempotent — if you try to enable an already enabled clone or disable an already disabled one, it’ll return a successful result rather than an error. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2093?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2093</a>)  New: The conductor can now be compiled to support tx5, the new WebRTC-based transport protocol to be used in 0.2.x. Note: This doesn’t mean that 0.1.x conductors can talk with 0.2.x, and is mostly for development purposes. Please don’t use this if you’re compiling your own conductor! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1741?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1741</a>)  Performance: When the last instance of a hApp is removed from a conductor, the shared DHT data is deleted to clear storage space. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Performance: Performance of zome calls, particularly remote ones, has improved dramatically due to optimisation of capability lookups. Previously, mere hundreds of calls would show a noticeable slowdown as more commits were made to the source chain; now thousands of commits only affect zome call time by about a millisecond. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2097?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2097</a>)  Bugfix: When uninstalling the last instance of a hApp, locally stored DHT data is now cleaned up. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Bugfix: Attempts to create duplicate clone cells (that is, clones of a DNA within one hApp with identical DNA hashes) are now rejected. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1997?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1997</a>)  Bugfix: The <code>name</code> field in a DNA manifest or definition incorrectly affected the DNA hash; this has now been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2099?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2099</a>)  Bugfix: The network seed was ignored for DNA roles whose provisioning was set to <code>None</code> in the hApp manifest at install time; this bug has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2102?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2102</a>)  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main-0.1/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#20230203200648">full changelog</a> for the 0.1 series.</p> JavaScript client 0.12.1 to 0.12.5   Update: Changes to the admin API’s <code>NetworkInfo</code> endpoint have been integrated, making JS client 0.12.1 the first release fully compatible with Holochain 0.1. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/172?ref=blog.holochain.org">#172</a>)  Development: The development environment for working on the repo has changed from nix-shell to a Nix flake; if you’re contributing to client development, you can now use <code>nix develop</code> in the root of the repo. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/175?ref=blog.holochain.org">#175</a>)  Improvement: When a websocket closes, reject pending API requests. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/178?ref=blog.holochain.org">#178</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/179?ref=blog.holochain.org">#179</a>)  Bugfix: Attempting to call a zome function by role name when giving a provenance now fails with an error. (Note: this change may be reverted in a future release.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/176?ref=blog.holochain.org">#176</a>)   Rust client 0.3.1   Development: The development environment for working on the repo has changed from nix-shell to Nix flakes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/pull/12?ref=blog.holochain.org">#12</a>)   Tryorama 0.11.1 and 0.11.2   Development: Similar to the client repos, the development environment for working on this repo has changed to a Nix flake. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/pull/166?ref=blog.holochain.org">#166</a>)  Improvement: Conductor logging now outputs at the <code>info</code> log level. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/commit/96bd726944da2f573943eaebe9f838a62adef496?ref=blog.holochain.org">96bd726</a>)   Launcher 0.9.1 to 0.9.3 <p>These releases bring all sorts of UX improvements:</p>  Improvement: The Launcher can now auto-update to the newest version.  Improvement: Windows <code>.msi</code> installer files are now code-signed.  Improvement: A 404 page is now shown for an improperly formed UI (that is, one without an <code>index.html</code> file).  Improvement: Support for multiple languages has been added, with German as the first alternative to English.  Improvement: The cell info card now shows the network seed.  Improvement: The arrival of new data in the app library is more obvious.  Bugfix: A bug on macOS has been fixed where Holochain processes would keep running after the Launcher was quit.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a> for full changelogs and known existing issues.</p> Around the community <p>Folks, the thing I’m most excited about right now is not beta releases — it’s the ways in which the developer ecosystem is growing and blooming (I guess I’ve got springtime on my mind <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-developer-ecosystem-in-full-bloom/">again</a>).</p><p>Developers are busy learning how to build hApps — the Holochain Foundation, in collaboration with our education partner Mythosthesia, ran an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-training-recap/">online course</a> last month, and the quality of commitment among participants was encouraging. These folks are going places. There are already some exciting demo projects and plans for mature apps built on Holochain.</p><p>We’re starting to see in-person meetings happen around the world; there was a Holochain hackathon in <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1644611045695127553?ref=blog.holochain.org">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Neighbourhoods</a> meetups in <a href="https://twitter.com/Neighbour_hoods/status/1641499291800723458?ref=blog.holochain.org">Wellington and Auckland</a>. Online events like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@holochain-in-action?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain in Action</a> co-learning meetings are starting again too.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XONE88KkbQk&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">most recent</a> Holochain in Action featured a demo of Neighbourhoods’ Social Sensemaker DNA.</p><p>This coincides with the first public release of the first developer preview of their Social Sensemaker.

<p>On July 27th, 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, announced the creation of the FTX Climate Program. Showing its commitment to fight climate change with a nicely designed website, presenting a well-thought out and wide list of strategies and projects.</p>
<p>However, in November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy after the world discovered massive wrongdoings – a fraud only comparable to Bernie Madoff’s multi-billion-dollar Ponzi scheme that hit Wall Street fifteen years ago. After the collapse, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried admitted that the FTX Climate Program was just a façade. A scam to attract environmentally conscious people.</p>
 Sustainability requires trust 
<p>With sustainability scams like this, how can you as an individual or a business leader spend any money on sustainability?</p>
<p>Personally, I have offset flights when I couldn’t avoid flying, and supported reforestation projects at other times. I did this because I believe we must do something now to avoid a climate disaster. But at the precise time I was typing my credit card details, did I know if those euros would reach the correct destination to have a positive impact? I had no choice but to simply trust that they would.</p>
<p>If you offset a flight, you trust in the airline. But does the airline really know if those carbon credits you bought will lead to a real offset? Do they know the whole supply chain of actors (companies, auditors, projects, field operators) for those carbon credits?</p>
<p>The harsh answer is No. Today hardly anybody can say for sure where the money will end up.</p>
 Transparency in the voluntary carbon market 
<p>Today, both individuals and companies that wish to reduce the devastating effect of the climate crisis can buy different types of carbon credits (e.g. offset a flight) to reduce their carbon footprint. All these transactions are made in the voluntary carbon market, so called because the purchases are made without any obligation, such as a government mandate.</p>
<p>At this point, hundreds of innovative companies have appeared with the promise of using the best of today’s technology to catalyse the voluntary carbon markets. Bringing transparency is a promise these ventures overwhelmingly have in common. Such services are tackling this problem through different fronts, for example:</p>
 
 A carbon accounting SaaS application that helps a company measure, report, and reduce carbon impact from a single web user interface. Such an application would help a company with their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting. 
 A platform that “tokenises” carbon assets, so carbon credits are listed on blockchains. 
 A game-like app that makes it very easy to buy carbon credits, paying with either fiat or cryptocurrencies. 
 
<p>In these cases, the services rely on several 3rd party actors (partners), for instance: reforestation projects, carbon removal companies, laboratories, marketplaces, auditors, and more. These partners have to be vetted and onboarded. If—as the end buyer—I see a list of some of these partners, can I really know who I’m transacting with? No. Do I know how their identity is being verified? No. Even though these services claim to be using the latest technology, the identity verification doesn’t seem to be based on digital identity’s latest standards.</p>
 Environmental, social, and governance 
<p>Where ESG (environmental, social, and governance) is concerned, as GLEIF’s Clare Rowley said in our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/history-of-lei/" title="History of LEIs Podcast Episode">History of LEIs Podcast Episode</a>, “data is core to addressing the question of sustainability and the current climate crisis.” Publicly traded companies are already publishing these ESG reports, which are read by different regulators, existing and potential investors, the media, and consumers. Such reports include traditional financial information on their investments, but the missing piece is that they should also include a verified profile of the company and their partners. Otherwise, we don’t know whom we’re doing business with, and the data is indeed insufficient. Also, in the same interview, Clare shared that, “As the world around sustainability reporting becomes more standardised, we expect the LEI there growing as a tool to connect.”</p>
 How verified digital identities can help 
<p>Verified digital identities are a crucial element to solve this problem, which, strictly speaking, has two main elements:</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must verify the real identity of every organisation globally. Regardless of whether it’s a startup, listed company, non-profit, educational institution, or alternative. Every time you interact or do business with a company, even on the other side of the globe, you must be 100% sure it’s a real company. If real, you must then be sure that the person you are talking with has the right to legally represent that company, and that you can know who the owners of that company are. The LEI (<a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/what-is-an-lei-code/">Legal Entity Identifier</a>) is the only technology that can make this happen and must be incorporated in every sustainability solution.</p>
<p>The second part of the solution is verifying the real identity of the person behind every transaction, as that builds trust. In the Nordics, bank authentication is widely available and popular. Other countries have similarly highly assured identification methods. The European Union’s eIDAS 2.0 will come soon to fill this gap at a European level, and we must embrace similar initiatives globally.</p>
 Bringing together sustainability and transparency 
<p>We need verification of both companies’ and individuals’ identities, for the whole supply chain, of every carbon credit. This is the only way to add real transparency and build the trust that we need for both businesses and individuals to embrace sustainability.</p>
<p>Using the word transparency in a company’s motto or putting it in bold fonts on a flashy website, is not enough. Sometimes I feel that companies trying to build sustainability solutions and talking about transparency provide the argument that “we are a web3 solution, therefore trust us.” Instead, trust is built on concrete actions, not with ethereal visions. The good news is that today we have the right tools at our disposal.</p>
<p>Without verified digital identities, sustainability will lose its battle. And this battle must be won, and we all must help to win it.</p>

  The G7 countries under Japan’s presidency, are emphasizing tighter cryptocurrency regulations to address digital technology challenges and protect the global crypto community.  One of its key objectives is to help developing nations adopt CBDCs, as the G7 members believe it could foster financial inclusivity.  At the same time, increasing political resistance and privacy concerns around CBDCs highlight the need for preserving privacy, which is a strong point of cryptocurrencies.  <p>As Japan takes on the presidency of the G7 this year, the Group of Seven countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S., along with the European Union — are set to address the challenges posed by fast-moving digital technology.</p><p>Japan’s Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, Masato Kanda, emphasized the need for tighter cryptocurrency regulations in light of last year’s collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, which reportedly served as a “serious wake-up call” for policymakers worldwide.</p><p>With varying viewpoints on cryptocurrency assets among nations, the G7 seeks to cultivate international agreement on the importance of more robust regulatory frameworks.</p><p>The group believes that implementing these enhanced regulations will safeguard the global crypto community from market instability and cybersecurity risks while reducing the potential for misinformation and minimizing social and political rifts stemming from digital advancements.</p><p>More on the topice: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-sneak-peek-into-japans-cbdc-program">A Sneak Peak Into Japan’s CBDC&nbsp;Program</a></p> CBDC: A Magical Pill to Empower Developing Nations? <p>Seeing CBDCs as a superior alternative to cryptocurrencies in terms of fostering financial inclusivity, the G7 plans to assist developing nations in adopting CBDCs consistent with international standards.</p><p>And how would they do so? By addressing potential risks associated with CBDC development through G7’s public policy principles for retail CBDCs, such as transparency and sound governance.</p> Political Resistance and Privacy Concerns Around&nbsp;CBDCs <p>While many governments and financial institutions worldwide are exploring the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), not all politicians are on board with this innovation.</p><p>For instance, in the United States, a group of Republican Representatives, led by majority whip Tom Emmer, introduced the <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/2023/2/emmer-leads-effort-to-squash-financial-surveillance-state-initiatives">CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</a> in February this year. This legislation aims to halt the efforts of the Federal Reserve in developing a CBDC that could potentially strip Americans of their financial privacy.</p><p>These politicians argue that a CBDC would create significant privacy concerns, as the government could potentially use this digital currency to monitor citizens’ transactions. They believe that, if implemented, a CBDC could lead to greater government surveillance and control over individuals’ finances, following in the footsteps of authoritarian regimes like China and&nbsp;Russia.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/624159">a petition against introducing a “programmable” CBDC</a> has garnered attention in the United Kingdom. Opponents believe such a currency would grant the issuer excessive control over how individuals use their&nbsp;money.</p><p>In response, the UK government clarified that it has no plans to program any future CBDC or restrict how the currency is&nbsp;spent.</p><p>These political debates and public concerns around CBDCs underscore the delicate balance that must be struck between innovation and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As G7 nations strive to support developing countries in implementing CBDCs, they must also address these privacy concerns and work towards building a financial landscape that ensures both innovation and individual sovereignty.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/cbdcs-101-understanding-the-basics-of-central-bank-digital-currencies">CBDCs 101 — Understanding the Basics of Central Bank Digital Currencies</a></p> CBDCs vs. Cryptocurrencies: What You Should&nbsp;Know? <p>While both Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and cryptocurrencies leverage the power of blockchain technology, there are some key differences that set them&nbsp;apart.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies emphasize decentralization, providing users with anonymity, and can serve as both an investment vehicle and transferring value. On the other hand, CBDCs, being government-backed digital money, prioritize centralization and are mostly focused on transferring value.</p><p>CBDCs are also more likely to utilize private, permissioned blockchain networks, whereas cryptocurrencies are most likely to operate on permissionless, open networks. Additionally, CBDC transactions are tied to users’ bank accounts and personal information, unlike the anonymous transactions typical of cryptocurrencies.</p> Impact scenarios <p>As the G7 addresses the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), both positive and negative consequences emerge for crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p><p>Enhanced regulations offer stability, user protection, and financial inclusivity through CBDC implementation in developing nations, while adherence to international standards fosters responsible, transparent digital asset governance. However, concerns around privacy, government surveillance, and potential abuse of power cannot be overlooked.</p><p>With the G7 striving to foster innovation and collaboration, finding a balance between the regulations and protecting individual freedoms remains critical. As such, the G7’s actions should prioritize the needs of citizens, ensuring that the development of a digital financial landscape respects privacy rights and empowers users in the rapidly changing world of cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;CBDCs.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption-617c544a9e9b">G7’s Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC Adoption</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

There are also links to some data feeds and AI modeling approaches that may be helpful in the challenge’s <a href="http://bit.ly/3UweuZd">description</a>.</p><p>We are providing a dataset from <a href="https://www.transpose.io/">Transpose</a> data that shows all of the transactions for the NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, Moonbirds, and Otherdeed. Participants should pick two NFT collections to&nbsp;analyze.</p><p>The submission deadline for the reporting part of the competition is April 30th, 2023, at 23:59 UTC. Participants must submit their reports by the deadline to be eligible.</p> Evaluation Criteria <p>The winner of the data report competition will be judged based on the following criteria:</p> Data Analysis (50&nbsp;points) <p>Select five questions below to answer as part of your analysis. Your answer should include quantitative and qualitative elements.</p> Choose 2 NFT collections to&nbsp;evaluate   Analyze how the number of daily transactions for the collections has changed over&nbsp;time.  Provide a visual overview of the NFT collections of your choice and its characteristics (e.g. size, type of NFTs, date&nbsp;range)?  Can you identify any clusters or groups of NFTs within the collection based on their attributes or characteristics? If so, what are the key features of these&nbsp;groups?  How does the price of NFTs with similar levels of rarity compare across different NFT collections?  Can you identify any correlations between the characteristics of the NFTs within the collection and their prices? If so, what are the most important factors influencing the&nbsp;prices?  Have any traits increased in value over time, and if so, which&nbsp;ones?  Which NFTs in a collection were most profitable when they were flipped (bought and sold&nbsp;quickly)  Determine the correlation between the number of transactions in a collection and its floor&nbsp;price  Determine the correlation between the number of transactions in a collection and the price of&nbsp;ETH  What are the most liquid traits (those with the most sales) for each collection?   Report (25&nbsp;points): <p>Submit a report describing the above findings. Make sure to include qualitative insights in addition to quantitative ones. Reports will be evaluated on presentation structure, approach, content, and completeness.</p> Predict Model (25&nbsp;points) <p>Use your findings above to develop a machine learning model that can be used to determine the current floor price of the rarest NFT in your chosen collection. Based on your model, is the NFT underpriced or overpriced? You will be judged on your choice of features and&nbsp;model.</p> Bonus (10&nbsp;points) <p>Source your own dataset to create an additional lens to analyze the NFT collections.

Or, jump straight into the text content&nbsp;below.</p> Main Flow:&nbsp;Text <p>Steps in the&nbsp;flow:</p>  Alice publishes dataset  Bob gets access to the dataset (faucet, priced,&nbsp;etc)  Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset  <p>Let’s go!</p><p>(Note: this blog post is up-to-date as of Apr 2023, but if 2+ months have passed, we recommend using the READMEs directly for up-to-date instructions. )</p> 1. Alice publishes dataset <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4pp3qyq5tc&amp;ab_channel=Smokie-Topic">Alice! Alice! Who the f*** is&nbsp;Alice?</a></p><p>Well, for the steps below, you are Alice!&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/girl/">👧</a></p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> #data info<br>name = "Branin dataset"<br>url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trentmc/branin/main/branin.arff"<br><br>#create data asset<br>(data_nft, datatoken, ddo) = ocean.assets.create_url_asset(name, url, {"from": alice})<br><br>#print<br>print("Just published asset:")<br>print(f"  data_nft: symbol={data_nft.symbol}, address={data_nft.address}")<br>print(f"  datatoken: symbol={datatoken.symbol}, address={datatoken.address}")<br>print(f"  did={ddo.did}") <p>You’ve now published an Ocean&nbsp;asset!</p>  data_nft is the base (base&nbsp;IP)  datatoken for access by others (licensing)  ddo holding&nbsp;metadata  <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-publish-details">Appendix: Publish Details</a>.)</p> 2. Bob gets access to the&nbsp;dataset <p>If you’ve ever spent time in the world of crypto, or cryptography:</p><blockquote>Wherever there’s a Bob, there’s always an&nbsp;Alice</blockquote><p>OK, OK. So yes, there’s a Bob. He wants to consume the dataset that Alice just published. The first step is for Bob to get 1.0 datatokens.</p><p>Below, we show four possible approaches:</p>  A &amp; B are when Alice is in contact with Bob. She can mint directly to him, or mint to herself and transfer to&nbsp;him.  C is when Alice wants to share access for free, to&nbsp;anyone  D is when Alice wants to sell&nbsp;access  <p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> from ocean_lib.ocean.util import to_wei<br><br>#Approach A: Alice mints datatokens to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach B: Alice mints for herself, and transfers to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.transfer(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach C: Alice posts for free, via a dispenser / faucet; Bob requests &amp; gets<br>datatoken.create_dispenser({"from": alice})<br>datatoken.dispense(to_wei(1), {"from": bob})<br><br>#Approach D: Alice posts for sale; Bob buys<br># D.1 Alice creates exchange<br>price = to_wei(100)<br>exchange = datatoken.create_exchange({"from": alice}, price, ocean.OCEAN_address)<br><br># D.2 Alice makes 100 datatokens available on the exchange<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.approve(exchange.address, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br><br># D.3 Bob lets exchange pull the OCEAN needed<br>OCEAN_needed = exchange.BT_needed(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0)<br>ocean.OCEAN_token.approve(exchange.address, OCEAN_needed, {"from":bob})<br><br># D.4 Bob buys datatoken<br>exchange.buy_DT(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0, tx_dict={"from": bob}) <p>You may not realize it, but you just covered a crazy amount of ground!! You just went through four different ways to share data! Minting, transferring, faucets, and&nbsp;selling!</p><p>What made this possible is that the access control to the data is tokenized, via datatokens. Then you were basically using the tools of crypto to move those datatokens around.</p><p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-faucet-details">Appendix: Dispenser / Faucet Details</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-exchange-details">Exchange Details</a>.)</p> 3. Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset <p>Bob now has the datatoken for the dataset! Time to download the dataset and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> # Bob sends a datatoken to the service to get access<br>order_tx_id = ocean.assets.pay_for_access_service(ddo, {"from": bob})<br><br># Bob downloads the file. If the connection breaks, Bob can try again<br>asset_dir = ocean.assets.download_asset(ddo, bob, './', order_tx_id)<br>import os<br>file_name = os.path.join(asset_dir, "file0") <p>Let’s check that the file is downloaded. In a new&nbsp;console:</p> cd my_project/datafile.did:op:*<br>cat file0 <p>The beginning of the file should contain the following contents:</p> % 1. Title: Branin Function<br>% 3. Number of instances: 225<br>% 6. Number of attributes: 2<br>@relation branin<br>@attribute 'x0' numeric<br>@attribute 'x1' numeric<br>@attribute 'y' numeric<br>@data<br>-5.0000,0.0000,308.1291<br>-3.9286,0.0000,206.1783<br>... <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-consume-details">Appendix: Consume Details</a>.)</p> Conclusion / Next&nbsp;Step <p>You’ve now done a walk-through of the main flow, congrats! As Alice, you published a data asset, posted for free / for sale, and had that Bob guy dispense it / buy it and consume&nbsp;it.</p><p>Have questions? <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/720631837122363412">Here’s</a> the Ocean Protocol #dev-support channel on&nbsp;Discord.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Identity, for the most part, is not natively digital. We have digital artifacts that refer to real-world physical credentials, like driver's licenses and passports. Identity, however, is at the core of most of our interactions in daily life, both physically and digitally, with ever-increasing dependency on digital interactions. </p><p>However, since the internet was built without an identity layer natively baked in, significant coordination and collaboration efforts are required to ensure what is built and adopted can serve use cases across the internet, spanning various industries across the public and private sectors.</p><p>Spruce participates in various working groups of global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. We have also implemented and architected multiple global emerging identity standards, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials, Sign-In with Ethereum, and more.</p><p>Here are non-exhaustive highlights from our participation in the first quarter of 2023:</p> Global Working Groups: <p>W3C Working Groups: We continued participating as co-editor in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group to work on the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) v2.0 standard</a> where we are also leading the holder binding discussion that will contribute to more secure digital credentials for pure online use cases and interactions with digital identity documents. Additionally, we are actively contributing to the definition of the formal semantics for the new RDF 1.2 quoted triples in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/08/rdf-star-wg-charter/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">W3C RDF-star Working Group</a>.</p><p>ISO Working Groups: We continued our participation in <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Cards and security devices for personal identification</a> in WG4 and WG10 as delegated experts to work on ISO 18013-7, a specification to securely exchange mobile Driver’s License (mDL) online, and on ISO 23220 which is a series of specifications for building blocks for mobile identity documents (mdoc).</p><p>OpenID Foundation Working Groups: We continued our participation in the OpenID Foundation AB/C Working Group as co-editor and contributors. We helped to publish the second implementer’s draft of <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)</a> and contributed to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Credential Issuance (OpenID4CI)</a> to get it closer to the first implementer’s draft.</p><p>Additional Working Groups: We joined the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Open Wallet Foundation (OWF)</a>, a project of the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member and are working to stand up its first Technical Advisory Committee with some of the world’s largest digital identity technology and solutions providers. You can learn more about the OWF here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">  Spruce Joins the OpenWallet Foundation  We’re pleased to announce that Spruce has joined the Open Wallet Foundation, a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member.  SpruceSpruce    </a> Ethereum Standards: <p>At the end of 2022, Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE), or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-4361</a>, moved from “Draft” to “Review” and we are currently incorporating feedback from the community to improve the specification. We are actively working on advancing the specification to the next stage.</p><p>After we authored and published a draft for Sign-In with Ethereum Capabilities, or ReCaps (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-5573</a>), we received significant interest from the Ethereum Magicians and Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA) communities. As one of the outcomes, we updated the specification to align it more closely with the User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) Specification for interoperability and composability reasons.</p> Authorship and Events: <p>In February, we finalized and published our <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/final-documents/identifier-binding.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) whitepaper</a> on holder binding from RWOT XI: The Hague, which is co-authored by people from the Federal Printing House of Germany, TNO, Danube Tech, and other leaders in the identity standards community.</p><p>Across the world, there are various digital credential and digital identity guidelines currently being considered for various purposes, like official government-issued documentation, learning and employment records, and more. As contributors to many of the standards paving the way for global adoption, we are thoughtful in reviewing and submitting comments to improve specifications where feedback or formal comments are requested. </p><p>We recently submitted comments for the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/news/2021/national-technical-specification-for-digital-credentials-provide-greater-privacy-and-security-for?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Canadian National Technical Specification for Digital Credentials and Digital Trust Services</a>. We also intend to provide comments for the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">NIST SP 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, which had its latest major revision in 2017 to accelerate the adoption of the work that is happening across the other various working groups, such as ISO and W3C, that we participate in.</p><p>And last, but certainly not least, next week, we will have a live demonstration of interoperability with Microsoft and Ping Identity at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> in Mountain View, California. This quarter, we continued our engagement in the DIF JWT Interoperability Presentation Profile Initiative, and at IIW, we will demonstrate interoperability based on the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials specifications. We look forward to meeting you there!</p><p>We fundamentally believe this work to champion global standards is core to the success of further adoption of digital identity, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving, yet seamless interactions that build digital trust across the web. </p><p>If you're interested in discussing or contributing to any of our work outlined above, please contact our team. </p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>There are several ways that hackers can steal passwords, and even encrypted credentials might be vulnerable to attacks.</p>
 What Is a Rainbow Table Attack? 
<p>A rainbow table attack is a type of attack used to crack password hashes through the use of a table of common passwords, hashed, allowing an attacker to discover the original password. Password databases typically “hash,” or irreversibly encrypt, passwords so that they cannot be used to sign into user accounts if that database is stolen. Rainbow table attacks rely on precomputed tables called rainbow tables containing these hashes. By using these tables, an attacker can reverse a hashed password back to its plaintext form more efficiently than by using brute-force methods or simple lookup tables.</p>
<p>A rainbow table is a precomputed set of hash values used to crack password databases that do not store their information as plaintext. These tables allow attackers to access secure systems without guessing a password.</p>
<p>The attacker first creates a “chain” of hash values to generate a rainbow table. This is done by starting with a known value and applying the hash function to get the corresponding hash value. The attacker then compares hashed values from the table against hashed values from a database to look for a matching hash value. When a matching hash value is found, the attacker can use the corresponding password to log in to the target system or access the user’s sensitive information.</p>
<p>Rainbow tables are practical because they can be pre-computed for a specific hash function and password length and reused across multiple targets using the same hash function. This means the attacker doesn’t need to generate new Rainbow Tables for each target, making the attack more efficient.</p>
 What Are Some Real-World Examples of Rainbow Table Attacks? 
 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack">LinkedIn</a>: In 2012, hackers accessed a database containing over 6.5 million hashed passwords from the social networking site LinkedIn. They then used rainbow tables to crack the passwords and leaked them online, exposing millions of user accounts. 
 <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/adobe-online-attack-was-bigger-than-previously-thought/">Adobe Systems</a>: In 2013, hackers accessed a database containing over 150 million encrypted passwords from Adobe Systems. The passwords were encrypted using a weak hashing algorithm, making them easy to crack using Rainbow Tables. 
 <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/07/ubuntu-forums-hacked-2-million-usernames-stolen">Ubuntu Forums</a>: In 2013, the Ubuntu Forums website was hacked, and the attackers obtained a database containing over 1.8 million usernames and hashed passwords. They used brute force and Rainbow Tables to crack the passwords and gain access to the user accounts. 
 
 How Can I Protect Against Rainbow Table Attacks? 
<p>There are several ways to protect against Rainbow Table attacks:</p>
 
 Use Good Password Hygiene: The strength of a password is crucial in protecting against Rainbow Table attacks. The longer and more complex a password is, the more difficult it will be for attackers to guess or crack it. It’s also important to use a different password for each account so that the others will still be secure if one password is compromised. 
 Use Hash Salting: A salted hash is a password combined with a random value before being hashed. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to use precomputed Rainbow Tables to crack passwords because the salt value will differ for each password, even if the passwords are identical. 
 Use a Strong Encryption Method: When storing passwords or other sensitive information, use a robust encryption method to protect it. Algorithms like AES or RSA can provide strong protection against unauthorized access and should be used in conjunction with other security measures. 
 Implement Multi-Factor Authentication: Two-factor authentication adds extra security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide a second piece of information in addition to their password, such as a one-time code generated by a smartphone app or sent via SMS. 
 Update Database and Encryption Software: Attackers can exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or information. It’s important to keep all software and systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent Rainbow Table attacks and other types of cyber attacks. 
 
 How Do Rainbow Table Attacks Differ From Other Forms of Cracking? 
<p>Rainbow tables, brute force, and dictionary attacks are methods used by attackers to crack passwords, but they differ in their approach and effectiveness.</p>
 
 A brute force attack works by trying all possible combinations of characters in a password until the correct password is found. This method is very time consuming, as it can take a very long time to try all possible combinations. However, it can still be effective against weak passwords. 
 A dictionary attack, on the other hand, works by trying a list of commonly used passwords, dictionary words, or variations of these words. This method is faster than a brute force attack because it only tries some possible combinations, but it’s less effective against complex or unique passwords. 
 
<p>As we can see, the rainbow table doesn’t rely on “guessing” in the same way as brute force or dictionary attacks. Also, rainbow tables, unlike the other two options, can potentially break through protective cryptography.</p>
 Strengthen Authentication Against Rainbow Table Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>One of the key weak points of an identity management system is the database–specifically, when a hacker gets access to a database dump where they can run different techniques, like a rainbow table attack, against that information.</p>
<p>1Kosmos mitigates these issues by decentralizing identity management. Our decentralized blockchain system removes database honeypots while placing ownership of identity back into the hands of users. The result? Strong, compliant authentication that’s secure today, tomorrow, and into the future.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos BlockID, you get the following security and usability features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.

<p><br>
At Northern Block, our primary goal is to facilitate the orchestration of trust tasks as seamlessly as possible. We aim to make it easier for our partners, customers, and the entire world to engage in digital interactions with trust embedded into the fabric.</p>
<p>The concept of a “trust task” was first introduced to me in the Trust over IP Foundation’s Technical Architecture Specification, but the term was originally coined by Daniel Hardman, who describes it very nicely in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V3v3-g6pAR8oMhk0Az-pheFM7PRCxJO9OsonH7STi5I/edit#slide=id.g2082f750436_0_349">recent presentation of his</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trust tasks differ from applications in important ways: they are multi-party, and they should be composable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really liked how Daniel displayed trust tasks within the ToIP hourglass model, as it really showcases its composable nature. I’ve taken the liberty of adapting his slide in the context of Northern Block to showcase where we are focused within the large spectrum of digital trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll observe that there is a trust task called “ask trust registry.” To support this task, we have been dedicating efforts into developing the necessary supporting systems to ensure its smooth operation.</p>
<p><br>
What is a Trust Registry?<br>
</p>
 
 A trust registry essentially serves as a source of truth and authoritative information. The governance framework behind a trust registry is what makes it authoritative for its trust ecosystem. If there is confidence in the governance framework, it naturally leads to confidence in the authority imposed by the governance body within the trust registry or source of truth. 
 It’s crucial to recognize that a verifiable data registry (such as a blockchain or DLT) doesn’t always provide a source of truth. These registries can serve as storage for information related to a public entity’s decentralized identifiers, DID documents, schemas, credential definitions, and more. Although they offer immutable data storage with resolution and discovery capabilities, they may not always deliver authoritative information. 
 This is where the trust registry comes into play. By providing authoritative information backed by a strong governance framework, trust registries support the attainment of digital trust and ensures that the entities participating in an ecosystem are reliable and credible. If you’d like to learn more about the role of governance, I highly recommend listening to the insightful <a href="https://northernblock.io/governance-and-trust-with-scott-perry/">podcast conversation I had with Scott Perry</a>, a colleague in the digital trust space. Scott chairs the Governance Stack Working Group at the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation, and our discussion delves into this important topic. 
 
<p>​​Within a typical credential acceptance trust task within <a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise</a>, several sub-trust tasks may need to be orchestrated in order for a party to accept a credential offer. These may include peer connections, secure messaging, negotiations, and the consultation of external supporting systems such as trust registries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The holder receiving a credential offer may want to invoke other trust tasks to assist them in making the decision to accept the credential offer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Northern Block has been collaborating closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a>, Chief Technology &amp; Security Officer at the <a href="https://www.cira.ca/">Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA)</a>, which manages over three million .ca domains as the .ca top-level domain (TLD) registry. Together, we’ve been exploring how the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure can enable digital trust, particularly in the context of trust registries and their role in maintaining authoritative records for .ca domain owners. We recently co-published an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-latour-dns-and-digital-trust/">IETF Working Draft</a> of our work if you wish to have more information.</p>
<p>When an entity is presented with a verifiable claim, there are three things they will want to ensure:</p>
 
 That a claim hasn’t been altered/falsified at any point in time (cryptographic verifiability, verifiable data registries) ✅ 
 That a claim has accurate representation (DID authentication, accurate representation) 🤨 
 That a claim has authority (authorization, authority) 🤨 
 
<p>While cryptographic verifiability is a fundamental aspect of verifiable credential exchange protocols, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee the accurate representation or authority of a specific public key or decentralized identifier (DID).</p>
<p>To address this human trust issue, we’ve utilized the decentralized DNS infrastructure to create a flexible linkage between issuing bodies’ domain names and their DIDs, which doesn’t impose a specific DID method. By enabling issuers to edit their DID documents with pointers to their DNS records, our approach allows for various DID methods to leverage the DNS infrastructure for added assurance.</p>
<p><br>
Why DNS?</p>
 
 The Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure is considered global, unique, resilient, and highly secure, particularly when the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are utilized. As a global system, DNS operates across the internet, mostly known for ensuring that domain names are translated into IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites and online services. The uniqueness of the DNS lies in the fact that each domain name corresponds to a unique label such as trustregistry.nborbit.io, avoiding any confusion or conflicts. The DNS infrastructure is resilient, as it relies on a distributed hierarchical structure, which minimizes the risk of a single point of failure. Finally, the security of the DNS is significantly enhanced by the implementation of DNSSEC, which provides cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data within the DNS, preventing attacks such as DNS spoofing or cache poisoning. 
 The exclusive write access granted to domain name owners for their DNS records, coupled with the proper implementation of DNSSEC, enhances the records’ authoritative nature, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the information they provide. This write access is cryptographically verifiable through a chain of trust that, in the Canadian context, flows from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA), and then further down to the .ca domain owners. 
 Beyond the cryptographic trust, CIRA has established processes and agreements with domain name registrars to ensure that .ca domain names meet specific criteria, such as having a Canadian presence. The registry operated by CIRA can be considered sources of truth because they are authoritative in the context of .ca domain names and are connected to existing governance mechanisms managed by CIRA (more details on CIRA governance <a href="https://www.cira.ca/about-cira/board-and-governance">here</a>). This governance structure further reinforces the trustworthiness of the registries, making them reliable sources of information for .ca domain names and their associated entities. 
 
<p>We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A credential issuer can ensure that certain information is synced up with their DNS records.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two things that this implementation facilitates for parties are:</p>
 
 To authenticate the DID against a second source, to achieve greater assurance that the DID owner is indeed the same party that owns the domain. This added layer of trust strengthens the overall reliability and security of the system. 
 To get information related to trust registries that the DID claims to be listed in. This enables the discoverability of trust registries that may have been unknown prior. 
 
<p>Orbit Enterprise users can utilize the Trust Decision Helper to assist with the aforementioned points. In the screenshot below, you can observe how a holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records using the Trust Decision Helper. They are offered with information that can be used as inputs to inform their trust decision.</p> 
<p><br>
With hundreds or thousands of trust registries in existence, it becomes virtually impossible for a central entity to manage their locations and purposes. Furthermore, having a central entity overseeing all global trust registries is not ideal for promoting privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Currently, there are numerous identity systems functioning within specific ecosystems, each serving as a source of truth within their respective contexts. Centralizing the management of these systems is not practical. The challenge lies in discovering the presence of trust registries and understanding their associated governance frameworks. This is where DNS comes in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we trust that an entity is accurately represented by their DID, they should be able to guide us towards sources of truth or trust registries in which they are listed. This decentralized and privacy-preserving approach enables direct interaction with the entity, instead of relying on a central authority. By leveraging the widespread adoption and trust established within the DNS infrastructure, we can discover relevant trust registries and gather inputs to inform our trust decisions.</p>
 <p>The holder was able to validate that the issuer who offered them a credential has authority to offer said credential within a specific trust registry.</p> 
<p><br>
In the final screen which completes the flow, a few key points are evident. Firstly, additional assurance is achieved by validating the match between the DID written in the DNS system and the one presented, enabling cross-verification through two distinct trust systems. Secondly, verification is conducted within a trust registry that the issuer directed the holder to. A third check is performed against the same DID presented in the document, which is also listed in both the DNS records and the specific trust registry. The holder is also given the confidence that, based on this trust registry, the issuer possesses the authority to issue the credential they initially offered.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: we could have presented the holder with the trust registry’s referenced governance framework as well. Something to add in future iterations of the Trust Decision Helper.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these additional inputs, the holder can exit the Trust Decision Helper flow and return to their credential negotiation workflow. They may choose to engage in further trust tasks, such as sending secure messages to the issuing body if they have questions, concerns, or wish to negotiate further. Alternatively, they may be satisfied with the inputs received and feel comfortable making their trust decision and accepting the credential offer.</p>
<p>By incorporating the DNS and trust registry functionality into Orbit Enterprise, we aim to facilitate the scaling of trust registries while enhancing their discovery and usage. The joint presentations between CIRA and Northern Block at IdentityNorth and ICANN have garnered positive feedback, and we continue to actively participate in the Trust Over IP Foundation’s Trust Registry Task Force as well as the Identity Lab of Canada’s Trust Registry Community of Practice. </p>
<p>We will be presenting this work at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> next week, and look forward to engaging in interesting conversations and further advancing what we think to be an important initiative.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Just recently, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>, a new security offering based on a combination of the GPT-4 language model, the well-known technology provided by OpenAI that also powers ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing, and Microsoft’s own technology, data, knowledge, and security-specific model from their ongoing global threat intelligence.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, the new solution, which is not publicly available yet, is positioned as a “copilot” augmenting the security analysts in SOCs (Security Operations Centers) / CDCs (Cyber Defense Centers) and empowering them.</p>
<p>A use-case specific application of GPT-4</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot resembles ChatGPT to a certain extent, but also vastly differs from it. The users can prompt the solution and receive answers. These answers are not just text, but also contain flowcharts/visuals that detail the anatomy of the incident that is researched. All or selected parts of the analysis can be stored in a pinboard that summarizes an investigation and that can be shared with others.</p>
<p>The solution also comes with predefined promptbooks. Promptbooks are pre-engineered collections of prompts for various use cases such as malware analysis. Thus, the user must not think about the right questions (or prompts) but can rely on preconfigured analytical steps. Microsoft provides promptbooks, but users can add their own ones and share them.</p>
<p>Log analysis, context, and resolutions</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot analyzes log files and uses the data from Microsoft’s global threat intelligence. It helps in identifying affected systems and accounts and reengineering attacks so that the accounts that had been compromised first can be identified. It currently works closely with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender, with other integrations to be added. With the multitude of security tools many organizations have deployed, openness for integration to other vendor’s solutions would be something I’d like to see in the future.</p>
<p>All that is done in a way that still requires some level of security skills, but way less than a manual analysis would require. While being somewhat skilled in security, I wouldn’t claim to be capable of doing threat analysis and investigation myself. However, in the demo I received from Microsoft, there was nothing in any of the responses I did not understand. In other words: The Security Copilot would have turned me into a security analyst, by augmenting me.</p>
<p>The tool can even create a PowerPoint file with the condensed results of an investigation, for instance, for reporting to the management. As mentioned, the solution will become integrated with all major Microsoft security services but remain a separate offering.</p>
<p>Augmenting Intelligence</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot, even while being just announced and, as of now, being integrated with only some of the Microsoft security products, is an impressive showcase for the benefit and business value AI can deliver. It can help in closing the skills gap in security and speeding up security analysis. This is done by using a specific model and a vast amount of global data and applying them to the concrete log information of a customer. The customer data is not shared and is not used for machine learning purposes. However, users can rate the quality of responses.</p>
<p>I must admit that I’m impressed by what I have seen so far: A solution delivering tangible benefits and empowering and augmenting human analysts instead of threatening to replace them. This is exactly what we should expect from emerging AI applications, in cybersecurity and in general.</p>

<p>There’s been some movement in state and federal data privacy laws in the United States. Here are three things to know about the regulatory landscape in 2023:</p>



 1. More states are introducing data privacy laws 



<p>The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">says</a>&nbsp;state-level momentum for comprehensive privacy bills is at an all-time high.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(CPRA) became fully effective on January 1, 2023. This Act is an amendment of the pioneering California Consumer Privacy Act which has been around since 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also on January 1, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a>&nbsp;came into effect, while the<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-190">&nbsp;Colorado Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB00006&amp;which_year=2022">Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act</a>&nbsp;both take effect on July 1 this year.</p>



<p>Utah will join the states leading the way on data privacy when the&nbsp;<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/SB0227.html">Utah Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;takes effect on December 31, 2023.</p>



<p>Follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">tracker</a>&nbsp;for a clear picture of the current state of play:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>We believe one reason for increased state momentum is probably the stalling on a federal data privacy law (see point 3). Some states have no doubt realized that their citizens can’t wait any longer. And that leads us to point 2 …</p>



 2. Protecting privacy through law is a growing priority for Americans 



<p>We’ll let the IAPP’s infographic speak for itself:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>Consumers globally have been growing louder in their demands for data privacy for some time.</p>



<p>In 2020 we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">reported</a>:</p>



 
 High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp; 



 Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp; 



 Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can. 



 Levels of consumer trust for brands is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>.&nbsp; 



 Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data. 



 The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers. 
 



<p>Indeed, privacy is the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue</a>&nbsp;of this decade that we predicted it would be. So it’s good news that …</p>



 3. A federal data privacy law is (finally) looking more likely 



<p>The US is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While hopes for a federal data privacy law in the US have been raised and dashed many times over many years,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/topics/adppa/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>&nbsp;has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two sticking points have been whether bills would pre-empt state law or enable enforcement of a private right of action. Democrats argue for a private right of action that will give consumers legal rights if government fails to enforce the federal law, while Republicans want a federal law to pre-empt state laws to end the patchwork of compliance obligations on business. A counterpoint on the Republicans’ pre-emption position is that some states with strong laws, such as California, may end up with weaker protections if a federal law pre-empts&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">CPRA</a>.</p>



<p>The ADPPA is a compromise position. It’s worth viewing the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf">IAPP’s Federal Data Privacy Tracker</a>&nbsp;to understand the details of ADPPA and each of the other privacy-related bills proposed in Congress to date.</p>

 DID, GLN, DUNS, BIC, TIN, and LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers are essential tools in the modern business world where B2B value is high and trading across borders and supply chain management is complex. Such organisation identifiers help streamline transactions, communication, trust, and collaboration between different parties by identifying and connecting the parties involved. </p>
<p>This blog post will provide an overview of six common organisation identifiers: Decentralised Identifier (DID), Global Location Number (GLN), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS), Bank Identifier Code (BIC), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). We will also look briefly at their respective real-world use cases.</p>
<p>All these identifiers, except DUNS, are identified in the World Trade Organisation’s <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">Standards Toolkit for Cross-border Paperless Trade</a>.</p>
 Decentralised Identifier (DID) 
<p>DID is a framework and container for identity, but not an identity scheme. DIDs are often used in conjunction with distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain. It allows individuals, organisations, and things to be identified and connected without the need for a centralised authority, and enables privacy protecting systems.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DID can be used to store or reference verifiable digital identities for people, organisations, and devices, enabling secure and private communication, transactions, and authentication in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>
 Global Location Number (GLN) 
<p>GLN is a proprietary 13-digit unique identifier developed by GS1. GLN allow organisations to identify physical locations, legal entities, or functions within their organisation. The identification data is supplied by the entity.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: GLN is used to manage and track the flow of goods and services in the supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors to retailers. </p>
 Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) 
<p>DUNS is a proprietary nine-digit identifier assigned and managed by privately owned Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). The DUNS number is used to identify businesses, primarily being used to provide a method for tracking and assessing the creditworthiness and financial health of organisations. Once considered the “standard” for organisation identification, as of April 2022 the DUNS ceased being used by the US federal Government.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DUNS numbers are commonly used by businesses and governments to evaluate potential suppliers, partners, and customers. They help organisations make informed decisions about credit risk, procurement, and market research. </p>
 Bank Identifier Code (BIC) 
<p>BIC, also known as the SWIFT code, is an entity-supplied alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies financial institutions and sub-elements within the organisation. It is used for international wire transfers and messages between banks, ensuring accurate routing of transactions. </p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: BIC is crucial for cross-border transactions, such as international wire transfers, securities trades, and foreign exchange transactions. </p>
 Trader Identification Number (TIN) 
<p>Trader Identification Number (TIN) is a unique identifier assigned to Authorised Economic Operators. An Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) is a party involved in the international movement of goods that has been certified by a national Customs administration. TINs are assigned by national bodies, typically governmental, for the purposes of customs processing of import and exports. TINs are not publicly available or referenceable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">WCO Guidelines on Trader Identification Number</a></p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: TINs are used by importers to enhance the data quality of Customs clearance processes, improve the visibility and transparency of supply chains, and enable Customs to enhance supply chain security.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) 
<p>LEI is a 20-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities and group structures in a live, publicly accessible database. It was introduced by the supra-national not-for-profit Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) under the direction of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a single identifier to enhance transparency of “who is who” and “who owns whom”, to identify counterparties and reduce risk in transactions. Over 300 regulations require or recommend the use of LEI. LEIs are only issued by GLEIF-accredited LEI Issuers.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: LEI is used to identify parties involved in financial transactions, including banks, investment firms, and corporations. It helps regulators monitor systemic risks, reduce financial fraud, and increase transparency in financial markets. More recently the LEI has been incorporated into innovative new use cases including entity data management, digital signing, B2B Identity &amp; Access Management and others.</p>
 Conclusion – the case for the LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers evolved for jurisdictional or vertical markets, historically leading to an over-complex and confusing choice for businesses. The LEI is designed to simplify the concept of organisation identity by providing both accessible identity reference data, and acting as a “connector” to other specific-purpose identifiers. For example, a partnership between the GLEIF and SWIFT to publish BIC-to-LEI mapping demonstrates the flexibility of the LEI to co-exist alongside legacy identifiers, to simplify otherwise costly entity data management processes. </p>
<blockquote><p>The one global identity behind every business.<br>
LEI is the linchpin that connects the dots across the universe of entity identification.<br>
Global LEI Foundation</p></blockquote>
<p>Global trade needs a standardised organisation identifier, and fortunately the LEI is well on the way to making the case to be the one.</p>

<p>Dock has just released a Credential Template Builder in <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> that enables users to create custom credential templates to accommodate their specific needs and a variety of use cases.</p><p>Before this feature was added, if users wanted to issue credentials using other than our pre-built templates such as University Degree and Proof of Employment, they would have to use the API to create a custom template (schema) and define the custom attributes they wanted a credential to have, which requires more technical knowledge. The Credential Template Builder is a no-code feature that allows anyone to choose which details they would like to add on their credential such as license number, area of concentration on a university degree, and membership type. </p><p>Nick Lambert, CEO of Dock said, “The Custom Credential Builder was added in response to the growing demand from our customers for a customizable and easy-to-use solution that accommodates a diverse range of use cases. Our team has worked tirelessly to create a solution that doesn't require technical expertise, enabling organizations of all sizes to build and issue custom credentials efficiently, cost-effectively, and for those credentials to be interpreted by any entity verifying them.”</p><p>This feature can be used to define custom attributes on documents that can be issued as <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials</a> for a variety of use cases, including:</p>  Identity documents  Professional licenses  Membership associations  Training certificates  Employment records   Benefits of the Credential Template Builder for Issuing and Verifying Organizations <p></p>  Efficient: With a no-code credential builder, issuing organizations can create custom credentials without needing to know how to code. This makes it much easier for organizations to efficiently create and issue credentials.  Cost-effective: Using a no-code verifiable credential builder can be much more cost-effective than hiring developers to build a custom solution.   Reliable data from custom credentials: Verifying organizations such as employers or financial institutions can be assured that the data on the custom credentials is reliable, unaltered, and valid  <p>Complete Guide on the Credential Template Builder</p><p><a href="http://www.dock.io/guides/custom-credential-template-builder?ref=blog.dock.io">Click here to see the step-by-step guide</a> on how to use this feature.</p><p>About Dock</p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Emilio and I’m from&nbsp;Spain.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? Do you have any pets? What are your hobbies? What is your superpower? <p>I studied electrotechnical systems, but as I like everything related to new technologies, I have trained myself in different areas, as new technologies and innovations appeared. I like many different sports including kitesurfing, surfing, and snowboarding. I also love animals and I have a dog and two cats. If I had to think of a superpower I already have, it’s my ability to have a go at everything in any field, professional or personal, no matter how challenging it might be — although, sometimes I think this is also a weakness because I don’t focus my skills on any one thing in particular.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology at its inception therefore I had the opportunity to see the birth of its MainNet almost 5 years ago. Many projects were taking their first steps then around that time, and then the initial coin offering (ICO) fever arose and many of those projects disappeared. However, thanks to the continuous work of the Ontology team, the Ontology project is still going&nbsp;strong.</p><p>I work as an administrator for the Hispanic Ontology community. I resolve concerns within the community and keep the community informed of the progress of the project. I also look for synergies with other projects in the sector, to possibly integrate with Ontology solutions. I keep up to date with all the news and developments surrounding the crypto sector, so that I can inform the Ontology community of new updates and discuss these updates with other community members. Some of my day-to-day duties include monitoring and updating social networks, translating content, and looking for opportunities to cooperate with other projects to perform AMAs or integrate ontology solutions.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Contacting other blockchain developers and finding synergies and ways to integrate Ontology’s solutions is exciting, but at the same time very complicated. With that said, it’s something I do enjoy very&nbsp;much.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In five years, I expect massive adoption of Web3. I would like to see major companies choosing to integrate Ontology’s digital identity solutions (DID) and data (DDXF) solutions to achieve that adoption. It would be great if I could play a part in&nbsp;this.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-administrator-emilio-bur-d07338913bea">Meet the Team: Community Administrator, Emilio Bur</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork is a major milestone in the Ethereum<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain,</a> especially with its migration to proof-of-stake. This upgrade brings several benefits to the network like increased security, improved scalability and higher throughput, but the most important thing is the ability to pay ETH staking rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To become a validator on the Ethereum network, users must have at least 32ETH. Those who can’t afford that amount of Ether can join shared staking pools like Lido or Rocket Pool. In such pools, rewards are proportionally smaller but still profitable as long as users remain staked for an extended period of time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the biggest changes for validators introduced in Shapell is the ability to pay rewards for their work, which has not been possible since Merge.&nbsp;Rewards are now paid out to actual validators (instead of being split between them and end users). However, this doesn’t mean that end users won’t see any reward from their staked Ether – it simply means that their reward will come from the pool operators they stake their ETH with via smart contracts instead of directly from the Ethereum protocol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important feature of Shapella is that up to 1800 validators per day can fully unstake, which would equate to 57,600 ETH (~$113 million). This allows for a gradual release of rewards and prevents serious price drops due to drastic dumps by large investors. Additionally, in each block up to 16 validators can make withdrawals which creates even more liquidity on Ether and helps prevent bank-runs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The example below shows how ETH rewards payments are handled in Coinfirm Analytics Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its records, one specific address (0xcfc7E96Be27d836b034b37132052549611341108) received one reward which can be seen in its balance graph on the AML Report. It also affects the overall address balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As this is not a typical “transaction”, this transfer does not have a transaction<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/hash/"> hash </a>and was not sent from a regular ETH address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To handle this, all rewards made after Shapella, appear on Coinfirm Analytics Visualiser under the synthetic address 0x00000000000000000000000000000WITHDRAWALS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows how Coinfirm Analytics tools keep track of all transaction movements related to Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork, no matter if it comes from or goes into this synthetic address or other ETH addresses associated with participants in the network.&nbsp;</p>

 Takeaways from the webinar — The Implementers Guide: PDG Blueprint on Credentialing Spherity &amp; Legisym co-hosted webinar key takeaways<p>The PDG Blueprint is a functional design recommendation for the pharmaceutical industry to meet DSCSA compliance. But what does it mean for my DSCSA project? That’s what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-j%C3%BCrgens/">Georg Jürgens</a>, Spherity, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwkessler/">David Kessler</a>, Legisym, discussed in our co-hosted webinar.</p><p>As co-chairs of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative’s </a>Steering Committee, Georg and David explained the <a href="https://dscsagovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PDG-Blueprint-Chapter-6.pdf">PDG Blueprint chapter “Credentialing and User Authentication”</a> and demonstrated how using OCI-specified credentials can positively impact a trading partner’s DSCSA project. They also shared their practical experience and knowledge acquired over the years to solve the challenge for Trading Partners to authenticate and authorize their counterparties in DSCSA-related Product Verifications.</p><p>We’ve put together a few key takeaways from the&nbsp;webinar.</p> #1: A network of systems requires interoperability. <p>Each participant in the supply chain has the choice between a multitude of systems and solution providers. These must be able to communicate with each other to meet DSCSA requirements. We need to ensure that all the participants are interoperable with each other, from pharmacies to manufacturers to protect healthcare supply chain security. This is why PDG collaborated with various stakeholders on the ‘Foundational Blueprint for DSCSA 2023 Interoperability’ to address TI/TS data exchange, product verification and tracing, authorized trading partner authentication and other key DSCSA requirements.</p>Source: Partnership for DSCSA Governance, PDG Blueprint #2: Credentialing as a security and authentication layer in electronic interactions. <p>While GLNs are re-usable enterprise identifiers, they are publicly available and, thus, cannot sufficiently identify trading partners in electronic interactions on their own, nor do they prove “authorized” status. That’s where OCI-aligned credentialing comes into play and closes the compliance gap. Credentialing adds a layer of security without changing current standards and provides digital evidence of who the interacting trading partner is and that they have the proper license or registration to be considered an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) as defined by&nbsp;DSCSA.</p> #3: Compliance decision: Automated or manual ATP&nbsp;checks? <p>If you opt for manual checks, you should understand that these are not compatible with VRS-based interactions. That means, the response can’t go back through the VRS process and turns into a manual process for both sides, requiring emails, phone calls, or other methods to facilitate the line of questioning: Who is the Trading Partner? Is the Trading Partner authorized? Is it really the Trading Partner who’s interacting with me at this very moment? It can turn into a very labor-intensive method.

<p>With online gambling the preferred method for gaming in today’s society, both operators and players want to feel safe as the popularity of online betting continues to increase. However, with that comes certain responsibilities from both the operator and the player. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">With 2022’s global online gambling market valued at $63.53 billion</a>, online casinos want to guarantee that their players are practicing responsible gaming through developing information solutions that support and assist gamblers, safeguard the authenticity of gambling activities, and prevent fraudulent activities, thus giving players the assurance of using a safe online gambling site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there might come reservations from both parties that their time and efforts must be sacrificed in order to practice safe gaming, but that’s quite the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is responsible gaming and why is it important?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gaming is all about prevention. Players want to enjoy themselves, but sometimes things can go too far, or individuals might take advantage of the system. Instead, responsible gaming is a concept that encompasses several policies and requirements which apply to gambling stakeholders. These policies and requirements make sure operators adhere to the highest standards of quality, while offering a safe user experience that protects people from the potential negative consequences of online gambling.</p>



<p>The creation and maintenance of a socially responsible gambling environment and the provision of tools to support gamblers with their gambling behavior lies at the core of the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2022/02/Consumer-Protection-in-Online-Gambling-Regulation-Jan31-EGBA-Final.pdf">European Commision’s Recommendation</a> principles. Although it is up to the individual players to take advantage of the tools being offered, it is up to the Member States to ensure that appropriate tools that facilitate safer gambling practices are available. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, ”the Recommendation specifies that online gambling operators should be required to allow players to set their own financial and temporal limits, to offer time-outs, temporary breaks and long-term self-exclusion schemes, to provide gamblers with information regarding their playing and expenditure patterns, and to initiate engagement with any customers whose playing patterns give indication of the potential development of gambling problems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is suggested that gambling websites should display links to relevant support helplines and other details of support organizations in order to ensure responsible gambling. Furthermore, Member States are urged to&nbsp;create national self-exclusion registers that would enable players to exclude themselves from all online gambling operators licensed in that jurisdiction and to ensure that all operators have access to such registers.&nbsp;Through this encouragement, the number of Member States that offer national self-exclusion registers has actually increased over the past three years&nbsp;to a total number of 16. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus,&nbsp;gambling operators have the opportunity to give their customers all the tools they need to practice responsible gambling. However, it isn’t only through self-exclusion and monitoring gambling behavior that this will be achieved. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;entails a few more aspects on the side of the stakeholder. Here is a list that operators should be aware of and implement in order to establish responsible gaming:&nbsp;</p>



  Protecting vulnerable gamblers with responsible gaming tools and self-exclusion lists&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Preventing underage gambling</a>&nbsp;  Incorporating safety measures to fight criminal activities&nbsp;such as i.e. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/chip-dumping/">chip dumping as part of money laundering schemes</a>  Providing an information policy&nbsp;  Having an online payment protection&nbsp;  Maintaining a secure online environment&nbsp;  Complying with ethical and responsible marketing&nbsp;  



<p>The importance is therefore driven home through the above practices. Thus, companies in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">online gambling</a> sector who implement the above measures act as role models when it comes to the importance of responsible gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Underage gambling and fraud prevention. 



<p>Not only are vulnerable gamblers protected, as well as underage gamblers, but by having a safe online gambling site it allows the operator to fight criminal activities, which put not only the company in jeopardy, but also its players. With underage gambling becoming more popular, with <a href="https://www.roulettesites.org/blog/responsible-gambling/underage-gambling.php">nearly 40% of 11-16 year-olds wagering their own money</a> in the UK, this is one of the many reasons why <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">countries such as the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Germany place heavy restrictions</a> on online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the case of criminal activities, fraud is a serious problem in many aspects of the online world, not excluding online gaming. This is particularly the case when big sports events occur and operators see an increase in user activity. <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2022/04/29/62427-digital-gambling-fraud-rate-grows-50--in-q1-industry-marks-secondhighest-increase">Just in the first quarter of 2022, the global online gambling fraud rate grew to 50%</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In consequence, safe online gambling sites are required to verify the identity of their players in order to prevent such cases, both fraud and underage gambling alike, from happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What does responsible gaming or safe gambling mean for gambling operators? 



<p>No matter the jurisdiction, responsible gaming is at the core of all regulated operators. This means that operators must ensure that their customers gamble in a safe and controlled environment by implementing practices to prevent and combat gambling addiction.</p>



<p>Thus, when looking at responsible gaming from an operator’s perspective, KYC is an important part of the matrix due to getting an overall picture of the players on their sites. Without identifying a player, monitoring that individual’s gambling behavior would not be possible. As such, KYC is crucial when it comes to responsible gaming because it helps prevent addiction, protects vulnerable players, as well as reduces fraud all by identifying players before they start gambling. In short, responsible gaming with the help of KYC is a crucial aspect of gambling operations that emphasizes the need for safe and sustainable gambling practices and will help secure a company’s reputation.</p>



 Securing players &amp; platforms. 



<p>With KYC a major part of responsible gaming, gambling operators need to secure not only their players but also their platform. Many operators face the challenge of performing the regulatory requirements correctly due to lack of knowledge or solutions. With jurisdictions having varied regulations such as those <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">across the EU</a>, it can be quite overwhelming to know <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gaming-regulation-in-europe-an-overview/">what needs to be included</a>. However, what responsible gaming comes down to is securing players and the platforms they use.</p>



<p>Thus, each market has different levels of importance for what triggers responsible gaming. Some may set more importance on Loss Limits, Deposit Limits or Time Limits with imposed monetary or time values. Some may focus on affordability of an individual player, multiple accounts, or regular changes in payment options. All of these data points tie into an overall player profile and from that an operator can assess if any interactions are required to either prevent a player from increasing their risk levels, a time-out (cool down period) is required, or changes in marketing towards a player (no bonus marketing, and more of a safe gambling marketing approach is required) or in some extreme circumstances closure of accounts.</p>



 How ID verification can assist in responsible gaming. 



<p>When it comes to online gambling and identity verification, many companies and players are turned off by the requirements. However, this need not be the case. Businesses can incorporate responsible gaming while keeping player conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to such success is through a user-friendly verification process that also prohibits fraud. By providing such an experience, huge sporting events such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qatar-2022-show-red-card-betting-fraud/">FIFA World Cup</a> or any gaming event can become perfect examples and opportunities for operators to showcase what they are able to do for their players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By giving players options on how to identify themselves, like with&nbsp;automated identity verification&nbsp;options provided by IDnow, it takes into consideration background checks that take place before the ID verification, and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">through the use of NFC</a>, operators are able to quickly scan an NFC document which requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. And not only that, it provides a higher level of security for the company through the reading of the chip, with more regulators accepting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This in turn uncovers a new wave of sophisticated crime that is only detected through ID verification. Because when visual security features on an ID document, like holograms and watermarks, are forged to perfection it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features, like with NFC.</p>



<p>In the end, ID verification is a win-win for both the gaming operators and sports fans alike by providing high levels of security for the company and a fast and convenient onboarding process for customers. In fact, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">83% of operators believe smooth digital transactions have become essential to business survival</a>. Trust is consequently forged between the operator and its players.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>13th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform and main contributor to the protocol, announced that the version 4.0 of the T-REX implementation of the ERC3643, the open source blockchain protocol for tokenizing real-world assets, underwent a thorough security audit conducted by the leading Web3 auditor, <a href="https://hacken.io/">Hacken</a>. The results of the audit yielded a flawless score of 10/10, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>

		 
	 
                      
	 
		 
			<p>The full score from Hacken builds upon the proven track record achieved by its previous version, which has received similar approval from the reputable third-party auditor, Kaspersky. Over the years, the protocol has undergone multiple developments to enhance its capabilities and cater to the needs of the tokenization ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ERC3643 is the leading token standard for permissioned tokens. It provides a comprehensive framework for token issuers to enforce compliance and control, making it the most suitable standard for tokenization of real-world assets and financial instruments. With its proven track record of five years, it has become the de facto standard for tokenization. In fact, more than $28B of assets around the world have been tokenized using the protocol, including open-ended funds (UCITs and REITs), alternative funds, asset-backed securities, debt, real estate, equity, trade finance, with much more in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The key enabler of the compliance framework is ERC3643’s built-in decentralized identity (DID) framework, ONCHAINID. It provides a reliable way to ensure compliance by verifying the identity of token holders via verifiable credentials. As a result, this solution allows users to retain full custody of their assets, providing a high level of security and control all within a compliant environment, even on a public blockchain. Notably, the ONCHAINID standard was audited in parallel and earned as well a 10/10 security score from Hacken’s audit.</p>
<p>Hacken’s position as a top tier security auditor for blockchain protocols is indisputable. Its extensive portfolio includes conducting security audits for numerous high-profile crypto exchanges, underscoring their profound comprehension of the security necessities of blockchain-based systems. With both protocols earning 10/10 security audit scores from Hacken, users can trust that they are reliable and secure options for asset tokenization and identity verification.</p>
<p>The release of ERC3643 V4 is Tokeny’s latest contribution to the standardization of tokenization for capital markets. These upgrades are also open source. By making sure that the main token standard for tokenized securities is always up-to-date with the latest innovations, Tokeny aims to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Munich, April 12, 2023 – IDnow, a leading European platform provider for identity proofing, has recorded an increase in transactions with the German online ID function (eID) by more than a factor of four for the year 2022. This means that eID usage at the Munich-based identity expert is growing much faster than the nationwide eID transaction figures, which increased by around 19% from 2021 to 2022, according to the <a href="https://dashboard.ozg-umsetzung.de/">OZGDB</a>. </p>



<p>When reading out sensitive eID data, IDnow can rely on its own eID authorization certificate, issued by the Federal Office of Administration (Bundesverwaltungsamt). The certificate allows IDnow, in cooperation with the Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei), to read out the eID online ID card function in accordance with the Identity Card Act (Personalausweisgesetz, PAuswG) for identity verification. </p>



<p>Electronic ID card: Advantages of NFC technology</p>



<p>At IDnow, growth has been driven primarily by the more highly regulated industries such as the financial and eGovernment sectors. It is in these sectors, in particular, that the electronic ID card with its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC-based (near field communication)</a> online ID function can show its strengths. Fraud prevention with this method is particularly high because the chip integrated in the ID card is extremely forgery-proof. Thanks to the high level of security, the solution is compliant with both the German Money Laundering Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/glossar/geldwaeschegesetz-gwg/">Geldwäschegesetz, GWG</a>) and the Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz, TKG).</p>



<p>As a sovereign-notified procedure, the eID online ID function offers the highest level of security among identification procedures. In addition, the identity check with the eID takes only a few minutes and is fully automated, i.e., it can be processed without service employees.</p>



<p>Only 8% of the population have used the eID</p>



<p>Despite the recent positive developments, the penetration rate of this identification method among the German population remains at a low level. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/digital-identity-index-2023-study-future-germany/">IDnow’s Digital Identity Index 2023</a> recently showed that even more than 10 years after its introduction, the eID function is hardly used on a broad scale. According to the YouGov survey, only 8% of the population has ever used it.</p>



<p>Private identification solutions such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">video identification procedures in a video chat</a> (38%) or on-site identification in a post office branch (40%) continue to dominate the German market.</p>



<p>One reason for this is the unfamiliarity of the eID solution – according to the Index, only 7% of the German population has any idea what the term “eID” means. The lack of use cases in everyday life, as well as the comparatively poor user-friendliness of the solution, also contribute to the fact that the method is used so little. Both a 6-digit PIN and an NFC-enabled smartphone are required. Data transmission via the NFC interface often causes users problems when reading it out.</p>



<p>“To counteract the low level of awareness of the solution, Germany needs extensive marketing and awareness campaigns by politicians and the private sector on the one hand. On the other hand, financial service providers, mobility providers, and telecommunications companies must dare to implement the solution in their onboarding processes. An increased range of use cases will automatically have a positive effect on awareness of the eID. All players, politics as well as businesses, must work closely together to make the eID a success after all,” explains Armin Bauer, co-founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow.</p>



<p>Platform approach allows integration of different identification solutions</p>



<p>In the future, IDnow expects a further increase in the number of eID users due to various political decisions such as the Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz, OZG), the introduction of the BundID in additional federal states and the flat-rate energy fee for students. The higher penetration rate of NFC-enabled smartphones and onboarding in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> planned by the EU will also have a positive impact on penetration in the future.</p>



<p>“We see ourselves very well equipped for these developments with our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">platform approach</a>. After all, there will never be one, dominant solution in identity verification, as the needs of younger, older, tech-savvy or less-savvy people differ greatly. Instead, we rely on a wide range of different identification solutions to address all citizens’ needs,” Bauer continued. “If the user has misplaced their PIN or the smartphone’s NFC interface doesn’t work, for example, they can seamlessly switch to an alternative identification solution like VideoIdent on our platform and reliably complete the onboarding process.”</p>

<p>Moderation is a necessary feature of social spaces. It’s how bad behavior gets constrained, norms get set, and disputes get resolved. We’ve kept the Bluesky app invite-only and are finishing moderation before the last pieces of open federation because we wanted to prioritize user safety from the start.</p>
<p>Just like our approach to algorithmic choice, our approach to moderation allows for an ecosystem of third-party providers. Moderation should be a composable, customizable piece that can be layered into your experience. For custom feeds, there is a basic default (only who you follow), and then many possibilities for custom algorithms. For moderation as well, there should be a basic default, and then many custom filters available on top.</p>
<p>The basics of our approach to moderation are well-established practices. We do automated labeling, like centralized social sites, and make service-level admin decisions, like many federated networks. But the piece we’re most excited about is the open, composable labeling system we’re building that both developers and users can contribute to. Under the hood, centralized social sites use labeling to implement moderation — we think this piece can be unbundled, opened up to third-party innovation, and configured with user agency in mind. Anyone should be able to create or subscribe to moderation labels that third parties create.</p>
 An Ecosystem of Moderation Labeling 
<p>Here’s the way we’re designing an open, composable labeling system for moderation:</p>
 
 Anyone can define and apply “labels” to content or accounts (i.e. “spam”, “nsfw”). This is a separate service, so they do not have to run a PDS (personal data server) or a client app in order to do so. 
 Labels can be automatically generated (by third-party services, or by custom algorithms) or manually generated (by admins, or by users themselves) 
 Any service or person in the network can choose how these labels get used to determine the final user experience. 
 
<p>So how will we be applying this on the Bluesky app? Automated filtering is a commoditized service by now, so we will be taking advantage of this to apply a first pass to remove illegal content and label objectionable material. Then we will apply server-level filters as admins of bsky.social, with a default setting and custom controls to let you hide, warn, or show content. On top of that, we will let users subscribe to additional sets of moderation labels that can filter out more content or accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the layers here. Centralized social platforms delegate all moderation to a central set of admins whose policies are set by one company. This is a bit like resolving all disputes at the level of the Supreme Court. Federated networks delegate moderation decisions to server admins. This is more like resolving disputes at a state government level, which is better because you can move to a new state if you don’t like your state's decisions — but moving is usually difficult and expensive in other networks. We’ve improved on this situation by making it easier to switch servers, and by separating moderation out into structurally independent services.</p>
<p>We’re calling the location-independent moderation infrastructure “community labeling” because you can opt-in to an online community’s moderation system that's not necessarily tied to the server you're on.</p>
 Community Labeling 
<p>Community labeling can be done by automated systems, or it can consist of humans manually labeling things. The human-generated label sets can be thought of as something similar to shared mute/block lists.</p>
<p>Here’s how we think a manual community labeling system will work:</p>
 
 Anyone can create a label set, then add admins or mods to help manage it 
 Mods can add labels that the set defines to accounts or content (“rude”, “troll”, etc.) 
 Anyone can subscribe to the set and have the labels be applied to their experience 
 
 What's Ahead 
<p>We’re landing a first pass on automated filtering in the app today, and will improve it based on user feedback. Community labeling is still in the works. We’ll be publishing more details soon.</p>
<p>Through this approach of a composable, customizable moderation system, we aim to prioritize user safety while giving people more control. An open labeling system for moderation contributed to by both developers and users will allow for innovation, transparency, and agency in this critical piece of social networking infrastructure where technical and social systems collide.</p>

     <p>It was a power packed day for Digital Trust today with 22 speakers joining us from around the world to share the latest in the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>It was a big – dare we say exciting – day for our community. We shared that after more than 10 years of growing and building the IdentityNORTH community focused on identifying how digital ID technology might be able to solve issues by rolling out socially beneficial distributed Digital ID. While we still don’t have those systems, we realized that the digital ID systems themselves were just the tip of the iceberg, we needed to be having broader conversations, talking about what would inevitably be built on top of these systems, how society would evolve, and how to ensure that safeguards and values are built into whatever we allow to be built. Most importantly, we felt it important to be bringing more perspectives to the conversations than were present before. Technology and how it affects us is evolving at an incredible pace. Conversations about harnessing tech and regulating it need to evolve too.</p>
<p>Starting this June, EXCITE will be where thousands of change-makers come together to advance the future of digital trust and ignite innovation. With a focus on Advancing Digital Trust, EXCITE events and content will focus on three key streams:</p>
 
 Advancing New Models of Trusted Service Delivery 
 Advancing Cybersecurity 
 Advancing Digital Talent &amp; Inclusion 
 
<p>EXCITE SUMMIT events will continue to bring together professionals and experts from both public and private sectors to collaborate, learn, and innovate on critical issues arising from the increasing digitization of our world: privacy, cybersecurity, inclusion, skills development, identity and access management, and data protection.</p>
<p>With the move to EXCITE, we plan to continue the beloved traditions from our community – creating discussion and networking opportunities to provide time for learning, collaboration, seeing how we can support each other’s work across industry and government here in Canada and around the world, honoring the leaders in our shared efforts, and of course providing great swag…</p>
<p>We will start new traditions to support us on this path and welcome your ideas and referrals as we are expanding to bring more individuals and organizations from different sectors into our community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/2023-excite-annual-summit-registration-474871652897"></a></p>

   Managing multiple tiers of identity can help boost brand management, yield security gains, and uncover revenue opportunities  

<p>Does the following sound anything like your organization? A complex, layered enterprise with many different business units (BUs). Inside these BUs are different departments. Inside of some of these departments exist different brands or products that need to be discretely managed to present unique digital experiences for customers.</p>

<p>If so, you are part of a growing cadre of organizations managing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/multi-brand">multi-brand</a> experiences.</p>

<p>Traditional approaches to identity and access management (IAM) tend to break down when faced with these types of advanced multi-brand identity hierarchies. In the following paragraphs, I’ll explain why — and what you can do to prepare your organization for next-level success</p>

 Managing identity in a multi-brand environment 

    
<p>The term "multi-brand experience" fits neatly at the intersection of IAM and customer success.</p>

<p>On the IAM side, the challenge is granting the right users (internal workforce users and end-user customers) access to the right digital properties or assets needed to do their job or to complete their purchases — and in a timely manner</p>

<p>Take internal users. If too much access is given — for example, you grant users in Brand 4 access to resources in Brand 1 — you can unnecessarily and unwittingly expose part of the business to employees who do not need those resources to do their jobs. Worse, you can potentially open up a greater footprint of your business to hackers or malicious insiders.</p>

<p>On the customer success side, knowing a user is a consumer of Brand 5 leads to all sorts of interesting possibilities for going deeper on that interaction and the customer’s user experience. You can, for example, present a highly personalized shopping experience on that preferred brand or introduce a loyalty program for users of a particular brand. You can even strategically micro-target products and services that the consumer may be interested in. Or do both, why choose? The key is all about having an elegant, frictionless experience that starts with identity</p>

<p>“Customers” can also be internal workforce users requiring access to new applications and services. Being responsive to their needs in a timely fashion is critical for maintaining a productive and satisfied workforce.</p>

 Why delegated administration has failed to address the multi-brand challenge 

<p>The way organizations have traditionally attempted to handle multi-brand experiences is through the use of groups.</p>

<p>The logic goes like this: when you onboard internal users, the admin assigns them to one or more groups. For example, one user gets assigned to human resources, another to marketing, and another to finance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Groups can cover the gambit, including location, projects, specialties, geography, and more. So, one user can be a member of the “Cleveland Plant” and another employee a member of the “Manchester Office.” Almost everyone is a member of multiple groups. Various admins (through delegated administration) then manage access to the groups, either allowing or denying the members of those groups access to various resources.</p>

<p>But then things get complicated. Companies grow, reorganize, and go through all manner of&nbsp; change over time, throwing the task of managing by groups and delegated administration into chaos. Groups are suddenly left without an admin. I have talked with customers who are managing up to 30,000 groups within their organization! Of course, nobody can actually manage 30,000 groups or do it well in any kind of fashion. What you end up with is the illusion of control without having any ability to drive the business forward.</p>

<p>The B2B2C business model (that is, business-to-business-to-customer) has moved to the fore. This means that multi-brand requirements now extend to business partners or vendors — intermediaries — who have contact with the end-user customers. Being able to control access to applications and services using this model, through the partner, and right on down to the end customer is imperative, and cannot be done effectively with groups and delegated admin</p>

 Addressing the multi-brand challenge with organizational model 

<p>A better way to manage complex hierarchical identity requirements, including B2B2C, is through the use of an organizational model</p>

<p>An organizational model is first and foremost a data model. It is a structure that mirrors the actual organization itself (hence, the term “organizational model”). Rather than diving right into the typical IAM minutia of what groups, roles, and entitlements an individual user should be assigned to (all very important, by the way), an organizational model starts at the business level. By mirroring the way your business looks and operates, this model allows you to use identity more effectively and strategically to help the organization meet its business objectives.</p>

<p>An organizational model starts with a single organization, the top tier of the hierarchy. Then other organizational units (locations, brands, sub-groups, business units) can be flexibly built, assigned, and re-assigned across the organization as circumstances change. An almost infinite number of sub-organizations can be instantiated. Administrators are then assigned to each organizational unit, with the admins above having total visibility and control of other admins and members in the sub-orgs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does an organizational model differ from delegated administration? Here are a few differences (a non-exhaustive list)</p>

  Utilization of non-technical admins – Typically, administrators need to have some IT and identity chops, or at least be part of the IT org. But with an organizational model, admins are presented with a simple portal to support access requests within their particular organization. This portal is convenient for assigning admin rights to a department owner who needs to make quick access decisions for direct reports. It also makes it possible to assign admin rights for onboarding users within a vendor, partner, or supplier. 
	 Supports full inheritance and visibility – Changes made to the top-level org, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-orgs without requiring admin intervention. This ensures that no group gets left behind, including B2B2C partners and vendors, when security decisions get made at the top. All access decisions are logged for visibility and assistance in passing audits and meeting compliance requirements down the road. 
	 Greater span of control – Who knows the access needs of users better than the application owner, business owner, or department head? An organizational model puts control into the hands of these users, while keeping IT in the driver’s seat. It can also speed decision-making.  
	 Better enforcement of least-privileged access&nbsp;– Rather than spraying broad access rights across the organization, members of each group are confined to just what is in their particular organizational area. In complex organizations with many BUs, this means reducing the surface area of a potential attack. 
	 Better support of a B2B2C model – In the past, extending access to partners and your partners’ customers was usually a one-off operation, with the necessary application sitting unmanaged within a department. With an organizational model, these projects are folded into the overall identity framework, meaning they are fully supported and secured within the same identity stack as the other users and applications.

				  With ChatGPT 4 expanding its functionality through plugins, the emergence of AI virtual assistants capable of performing delegated tasks through text and voice input in a realistic human way is increasingly likely. In a new position paper, we look at a hypothetical “Chat Valet” booking a flight in order to illustrate why continuous verifiable identity is essential to managing the process.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The current inability to know how ChatGPT 4 formulates a specific answer to a specific question as it learns from answering questions successfully has created an outpouring of speculation as to what this all means for the future of business (the end of many jobs) to the future of humanity (the end, period).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as ChatGPT cannot give an account of its evolution in advance of evolving, we need to: anticipate how, realistically, the technology is most likely to be used in the near future, assess where problems may occur, and suggest solutions that, probably, should be adopted in advance of the problems occurring.</p>
<p>Here, the advent of plugins for ChatGPT gives us a useful prompt: If we combine the ability to “understand” text or verbal requests with a learning capacity to deliver successful responses and then add more ways to learn through plugins that <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/chatgpt-plugins-explained">expand functionality</a>, we can see how a chatbot could become a more adept <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-03/chatgpt-s-plugins-may-be-ai-s-iphone-moment-and-threat-to-google-search">virtual assistant</a> with the ability to act on its user’s behalf.</p>
<p>The following position paper explores this idea in more detail. It anticipates using a ChatGPT-like virtual assistant to book an airline flight in a fully delegated way that results in a “beautifully frictionless process.”</p>
<p>But it also imagines what “a compromised AI virtual assistant could do with access to all your accounts AND a predictive understanding of your behavior and preferences.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be able to take advantage of AI, this systemic risk needs to be addressed with some urgency; and to that end, we illustrate how open-source decentralized identity provides one way to tackle these problems. If we are to delegate tasks to an AI assistant, we need continuous, mutual verification between ourselves and the assistant. It must be able to trust that it is dealing with us as much as we must be able to trust that we, and we alone, are dealing with our assistant.</p>

<p>At Spruce, our core drive revolves around a world where users have full control over their identity and data in their digital interactions. However, this shouldn’t be at the expense of user experience in applications, or user experience around the control of said information. </p><p>To start with, let’s take a look at the web as it stands now. Current regulations governing user data protections have left us in the following state, which includes an illusion of choice - namely that one can leave, but not in any meaningful way.</p><p>For example, I can always export my data from Twitter or Google, but can I honestly do anything meaningful? I can scroll through endless machine-readable CSVs and marvel at my own witty fodder, but beyond that, there’s not much I can do with it. The goal for any system geared toward user control should be to answer the following questions:</p>  Can a user leave an app or service?  Can they have control over their information?  Can they user their information elsewhere?  <p>We believe that it all starts with a user being able to meaningfully leave a service.</p> Can I Leave an App or Service? <p><br>One of the first core tenets of user control is that, at any time, users should be able to eject from any system or application they don’t wish to use and have complete control over all of their generated data. Whether in the context of a social media platform, a banking website, or even productivity applications, the user, as the sole generator of information, should always be taken care of. </p><p>This is one of the cornerstones of the web3 movement regarding assets and identifiers. Your public key is an identifier under your control, and your on-chain activity translates across dapps.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/decentralized-identity-and-web3/">  Decentralized Identity and Web3  Decentralized identity is the continual catalyst that will unlock a new host of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Giving users control is not as easy as clicking a button to export data, as it will require various ways of representing different pieces of information that can be useful in other contexts. It will also require industry groups to coordinate and agree upon standard representations of different forms of data. Right now, the rights afforded to users mainly serve the purpose of not drawing the ire of regulators, by allowing users to export poorly formed files to let them know how they are being tracked. </p><p>Once granted control in the form of useful data exports and data custody, our goal should be to continually let users leave these existing platforms while granting the expectation that the experience will be nearly the same in a different context. </p><p>Thankfully, we’ve reached a point, especially with those working on the fediverse, web3, and more, that looks a lot like this:</p><p>Incredible steps have been taken across the space in key management, signing, and more to make this possible. We’ll always continue to commend those that came before us and those we collaborate with now on these complex problems. </p><p>However, the next step is the user experience around the control of this information.</p> Can I Have Control Over My Information?<br> <p>Now that we’ve established that the “can I leave” problem should always be answered with “yes,” the next question should be around how much control a user has over said exported information. Our goal as an organization is to never compromise on the user having the ability to take full control over their interactions but also to tip the scale in favor of user experience while we do it. Every organization philosophically aligned with this concept should be building toward this same type of outcome.</p><p><br>If a user could usefully export their data from an app or service but was limited to only using a large tech provider to continue to custody that data, then we haven’t really achieved user control and instead have just shuffled our trust assumptions. When thinking about decentralized data, it isn’t necessarily just about leaving that user at the whim of a decentralized network, but rather, giving the user control to specify where they custody their information and how they present it. </p><p>When considering this problem space, the following question should be the core litmus test of user control: can a user kick a custodian out and easily take custody of their own data? </p><p>We understand that some users will go with existing providers that they trust, but our goal is to also avoid situations where everyday users have to use complex systems to manage their own information. We want to see a world where a user can always control the governance of their data, specifying anything from a group of custodians to even the server in their basement as to where that data lives.</p><p>Additionally, as mentioned earlier, if a user were to ever self-custody their data, we want to avoid the situation where a user is forced to wrangle with a command line to get started.</p><p>And instead, have interfaces they recognize, while knowing users are storing and managing their own data:</p><p>Finally, now that we have exports that users can command, and custody users can achieve, we have to answer the final question.</p> Can I Use My Information Elsewhere?<br> <p>Finally, the last question in our for user-controlled data is, “Can a user now take this data under their control to different apps and services and use it there?” Users should be able to opt out of one service and replace it with a competitor. </p><p>This would result in a future where tech companies and services compete on user experience, rather than holding user content hostage as their primary competitive edge.</p><p>This is demonstratable in the world of social media. Content creators have built personal brand empires across social media platforms, including Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and more. These content creators are at the mercy of each independent social media platform, without a clear way to export their self-generated content, social graph, and brand relationships if one of those platforms shuts down (or becomes banned, as has recently been a concern with TikTok in the United States). This “profile hostage” situation happens across almost every service we use across the internet, but it requires a radical shift in how we collectively, across every industry, think about consumers’ relationships with companies.</p><p>This requires collaboration across public and private sectors to agree on common representations of specific data. User data could be anything from how a post is represented in the context of a user’s social graph, to even a credential linking a Twitter account to an Ethereum account. </p><p>At Spruce, we’re working on a lot of these core primitives, and want to build a world where all three questions aren’t just acknowledged, but answered.</p> <p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="https://discord.gg/spruce?ref=spruce"></a><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>

 How artificial intelligence is likely to affect the online world of crime,&nbsp;and why we must act now. 



 



<p>If history has taught us anything, it is that with every innovation and development, whether technological or otherwise, there comes a new criminal endeavour to exploit suddenly created regulatory gaps and legal loopholes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT, which seemed to appear out of nowhere from the Tech Gods at the latter end of 2022, has been met with unbridled excitement, cautious trepidation, and most recently in Italy, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">outright ban</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the weeks since the launch of ChatGPT 4.0, LinkedIn was quickly awash with ways that artificial intelligence could be used to supercharge operations; taking creativity to the next level by outsourcing the grunt work of actually doing it to AI, leaving humans with the important stuff like… erm… strategy, budget, and making a perfectly crafted coffee every time (although there are tools for those too).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media users on less business-focused platforms saw things less optimistically and stopped just short of predicting the imminent End of Days. Many argued that if we rely too heavily on artificial intelligence for creating content and take our hands off the wheel for too long, then this would weaken the argument for wrestling power back. Some even questioned whether we would even be capable after ceding generational creative control.&nbsp;</p>



 The next step in AI? 



<p>Despite such emotional public reactions, huge corporations including Apple, Microsoft, Google and HubSpot have all jumped on the ‘AI bandwagon’, or at least planning to embark very soon, and have announced that they will implement AI technology into its products in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to some tech titans and academics, however, humanity itself could be at risk if AI continues to advance too rapidly without proper and adequate guardrails. This could explain why many experts, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, are calling for a six-month ‘time out’ on the AI arms race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>AI labs [are] locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.</p><a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter</a></blockquote>



<p>They argue that rather than continue to build even more powerful AI systems, all parties should pause work on development, and instead shift focus to making systems more accurate, safe, trustworthy and loyal, while ensuring problematic forms of bias are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/31/uncovering-the-different-types-of-chatgpt-bias/?sh=4b9c53a571bb">eradicated.</a> It would also, of course, allow time for policymakers and regulators to roll out governance.</p>



 What is the AI Act? 



<p>The European Commision is the first major governing body to formally attempt to regulate AI. In its proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206">Artificial Intelligence Act</a>, it warns of the need to monitor and “curtail’ AI use in social scouting, manipulation, and some uses of facial recognition (referred to as ‘high-risk’ AI). It also mentions General Purpose AI (GPAI) large language models like ChatGPT, which have applications in a wide variety of use cases. EU lawmakers have thus proposed an amendment to the Act, which would require GPAI providers to comply with the same standards and restrictions as “high risk” AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>March 2023 also saw the release of Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Tech%20Watch%20Flash%20-%20The%20Impact%20of%20Large%20Language%20Models%20on%20Law%20Enforcement.pdf">‘ChatGPT: The impact of Large Language Models on Law Enforcement’</a> report, which detailed how artificial intelligence systems were currently being used by criminals and highlighted potential future misuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what exactly have regulators got to fear?</p>



 The corruption of innovation. 



<p>While there is clearly excitement regarding how ChatGPT can boost productivity and supercharge operations, it is only a matter of time before criminals start using AI for nefarious activities, such as fraud, impersonation and social engineering. In fact, scammers are already utilizing the powerful technology on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing">phishing</a> to churn out avalanches of fake documents (invoices, financial statements, contracts, transaction records) that are often more personalized and accurate than man-made documents (which often contain grammatical and other semantical errors). GPAI models can also be used to reproduce realistic language patterns to replicate the idiosyncrasies of individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Europol, one of the other major misuses of ChatGPT, and other artificial intelligence systems, is the potential for criminals with little technical knowledge to engage in cybercrime. This is because as well as being able to draft human-like language, AI can quickly produce (and correct) code in different programming languages. With relatively little effort, bad actors can easily create malware, malicious VBA scripts, and realistic AI chatbots that can assist in priming victims for the scammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Over the last decade, AI-powered software has achieved significant progress, taking the technology to the next level and offering increasingly robust solutions in many aspects of our daily lives. However, these advancements have also created opportunities for malicious use.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>With the rapid improvements in generative AI (a type of artificial intelligence that can create a wide variety of data, such as images, videos, audio, text, and 3D models), it is not inconceivable that we are only a few months away from scammers using AI to create realistic looking passports and official sophisticated documents in any language, with correct letterheads and security features, such as holograms at scale, within a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verifying which documents are authentic, and in the case of deepfake technology, which people are real, are likely to cause problems for companies without the most rigorous of Liveness checks and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">facial recognition technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT also poses clear concerns over data and privacy, as evidenced in March 2023, when Italian Data Protection Authority provisionally took the platform offline until it <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">“respected privacy”</a> and fixed a bug where other users’ chat history, and personal identifiable information (PII) was visible. Some major banks, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, have also broken ranks and taken steps to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/02/24/workers-chatgpt-use-restricted-at-more-banks-including-goldman-citigroup/?sh=281cac676cf4">limit staff utilizing ChatGPT</a> and similar platforms until research can be carried out on ways of ensuring “safe and effective usage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Controlling who has access to information, and whether that information is a) accurate and b) unbiased will be a top priority. Of course, this has always been a concern when using the internet, but the danger of unsubstantiated “fake news” is likely to grow exponentially alongside the increasing volume of content. For example, according to a recent ChatGPT enquiry, Aung San Suu Kyi was sanctioned by the European Union. Companies are therefore advised to not soley rely on ChatGPT for Sanctions and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> checks.</p>



 Knowledge is power: Fighting fire with fire. 



<p>There are clearly dangers when ChatGPT is in the wrong hands. However, in the right hands, AI can also be used for good, and to battle digital fraud, and other types of financial crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasing numbers of organizations, including IDnow are utilizing artificial intelligence to help digitize their Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and help to prevent fraud. Whether your business is in the Mobility, Financial Services, Gaming, or Crypto sector, if you need to onboard customers and need verify their identity, then there are major benefits of implementing an AI-enabled identity proofing service:&nbsp;</p>



  The most important step for any organization that wishes to protect its business from monetary and reputational harm is its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC process</a>. AI can help automate much of the analysis, including the processing of customer data, personal information, and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  AI can process huge swathes of information and verify customer identities, quickly, effectively, and securely. By automating tasks, bottlenecks in customer onboarding can be removed, allowing the company to scale at an unprecedented rate.  



  Check customers against sanctions and PEP lists (using a dedicated sanctions or PEP platform).<br>  Using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, AI can flag potential fraud in real-time. For example, AI can detect suspicious user behavior and alert the a platform’s security team, such as someone with the same identity using different gambling platform accounts to place bets at the same time.<br>  Multinational organizations can focus on servings its international audience, safe in the knowledge that they re compliant with complex and disparate regulatory requirements.<br>  By combining AI with anti-fraud technology, organizations can analyze vast volumes of data, including transactions, locations and times to identify suspicious patterns and activity.&nbsp;  



<p>The coming years will be crucial regarding the development, use and regulation of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Concerning KYC, the primary danger is identity theft and obfuscation. Specifically, generative models have enabled the creation of relatively user-friendly tools for generating more and more realistic attacks on both identity documents and biometric characteristics. This same technology is an important asset that we consider fighting efficiently against different kinds of fraud.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Dystopian days. Utopian bytes. 



<p>The threat posed by artificial intelligence is likely to be less Terminator, more Wall-E, so we shouldn’t necessarily be worrying about losing our clothes, boots and motorcycles, but more our creativity, autonomy and will to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, there is no putting the ChatGPT genie back in the bottle now, even if we wanted to. We must learn to live with it, and learn from it, like it learns from us. Only then will we realize its [and our] true potential.<br></p>

 🇺🇸 U.S. Department of the Treasury 



<p>On April 6th, the U.S. Department of the Treasury published <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf">a report</a> on illicit finance risk assessment conducted on DeFi.</p>



<p>The report starts off by explaining key terminology and aspects of the virtual asset market such as technical elements used in DeFi, types of DeFi services and intrinsic characteristics and levels of decentralization of DeFi services.</p>



<p>It carries on by listing facets of DeFi that attract criminals to support their activities:</p>



  DeFi services that aid Money Laundering techniques:
  DEXs and Cross-Chain Bridges 



 Mixers 



 Liquidity Pools 
  



 Move funds obtained from Ransomware attacks: 



 Steal funds by exploiting:
  vulnerabilities of smart contracts 



 low-security levels used by companies and individuals 
  



 DeFi services proved to be lucrative in committing Fraud 



 Laundering proceeds from Drug Trafficking 



 Exploiting DeFi services to sustain a flow of funds destined for financing the acquisition and development of weapons of mass destruction 
 <p>DeFi services are found to be vulnerable to criminal use mainly because a link between the individual using them and the virtual asset transactional activity cannot be made. Reasons for this are:</p>



  DeFi services are not obliged entities due to their technical nature and AML/CFT regulations do not apply to them, thus users cannot be KYC’ed. 



 Direct peer-to-peer transactions are possible as there is no need for an intermediary due to the lack of a need for an account or custodial relationship. 



 Some DeFi services fall under FATF’s definition of a VASP. Jurisdictions with gaps in their AML/CFT regime are a safe heaven for such DeFi services which have no intent to abide by AML law. Topped with the cross-border and almost instantaneous nature of VA transactions some of such services are structure from the get-go as a front for money laundering or service created to assists criminals. 



 Some DeFi services are prone to fall victim of cyber-attacks due to the lack of requirements for cybersecurity and audits in the DeFi space. 
 <p>A set of Mitigating measure for the identified vulnerabilities are laid out surrounding:</p>



  Regulatory Frameworks 



 Public<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> Blockchain </a>Transparency

  🇦🇺 Australian Supervisory Authority revokes Binance’s license 



<p>In Australia, Binance faced a targeted review conducted by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) which resulted in its financial services license for derivatives being withdrawn on April 6th as <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-091mr-binance-australia-derivatives-afs-licence-cancelled/">related by the Authority</a>.</p>



<p>ASIC opened the investigation into Binance’s local financial services business and discovered that some retail investors were misclassified as wholesale. Oztures Trading Pty Ltd is the legal entity trading as Binance Australia Derivatives. On April 5th the Authority received a license cancel request from the entity which was accepted and will come into effect on April 14th 2023. As a result, “clients will not be able to increase derivatives positions or open new positions with Binance; Binance will require clients to close any existing derivative positions before 21 April 2023; on 21 April 2023, Binance will close any remaining open positions.”</p>

<p>By Jess Turner, Executive Vice President of Global Open Banking and API at Mastercard&nbsp;</p>



<p>So much has changed over the last 20 years in payments that it’s hard to imagine the way the world used to be. A world where booking a trip or shopping for everyday needs required visiting a local travel agent or a grocery store in person, using paper currency for every transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we’ve become used to an ever-expanding menu of payment choices. Different circumstances call for different types of payments — the convenience of cards for everyday purchases and extended payment terms; bill pay and account-to-account for recurring payments; installments plans for larger purchases spread over a few months. All of these options have emerged as money has become an increasingly digital or data-driven experience, and they are only expected to become more popular in the coming years. According to the results of <a href="https://www.finicity.com/blog/five-key-trends-to-consider-when-integrating-digital-payments-into-fintech-innovations/">Mastercard’s 2022 New Payment Index Report,</a> 85% of consumers made at least one digital payment in the past year and 93% expect to in the next 12 months. Consumers are also increasingly adopting alternatives such as digital wallets (35%), digital credit or debit cards (32%) and digital money transfer apps (31%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>We all saw the impacts of COVID when we needed to be socially distanced. Electronic payments played a key role in keeping life and the economy running. Now, those digital experiences are supercharging other activities. Open banking lets people and businesses safely share their financial data with forward-thinking organizations in order to access new and improved financial experiences like digital payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going forward, consumers will likely have access to even more sophisticated payment solutions. Mastercard’s 2022 Index Report also showed that:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Nearly 60% of consumers are open to connecting their bank account to other financial services to enable automatic repayments for installment plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 More than half of consumers have already used a merchant-specific currency, including loyalty points, store credit or “in-game” money.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Younger generations are more likely to explore payments in emerging spaces – 48% of Gen Z and millennials are interested in being able to purchase virtual products in the metaverse.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The financial data that’s now delivered from open banking was historically available to the consumers themselves – on a computer screen or a paper statement – but traditionally has been cumbersome and complex to use. Yet, with open banking, consumers can now take advantage of new services that make their daily lives easier and with higher levels of safety by opting to share their data with a host of financial institutions and third parties, ranging from billers, merchants, fintechs and digital platforms.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking can help build an economy that works for everyone. Data is at the heart of every financial experience, from lending to money management to payments and beyond. It can also help the under-banked or those with thin or no credit files by providing easier access to financial data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world is still in the early days of open banking. As an industry, we’re connecting to additional financial data types (sometimes referred to as Open Finance) such as investments, retirement, payroll, and utilities. Financial institutions and fintechs are continuing to innovate financial experiences. In the ecosystem of payments, we’re dramatically expanding choices for consumers and businesses to pay or get paid how, where and when they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>As an industry, we’re increasing payment choice, but we’re also optimizing these experiences. Our Smart Payment Decisioning Tools integrate consumer-permissioned data in the account-to-account payment experience, providing billers with indicators of payment success likelihood. Then enhancing payment processing options based on factors like speed and confidence. We are working with our partners to modernizing account-based payments to provide the best outcome for consumers, banks and merchants. It can ensure a higher level of completed payments, supporting stronger impact for consumers and operational efficiencies for banks. Some of these data services are delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As open banking-enabled financial services proliferate and their use impacts our daily lives, we as consumers and businesses will expect the same security, protections, and confidence we’ve come to expect of our other financial experiences. We will also see that our ability to control and safely share our data using bank accounts, Pay-by-Bank, blockchain, cards and digital wallets will be transformational to our money experience – making it easier to understand our financial fitness and gain the insights needed to make the best financial decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To deliver on its promise, open banking requires the most advanced principles and technology in data privacy and security — to provide an easy and effective way to verify account ownership and identity. The open banking ecosystem is rapidly expanding, ushering in the next wave of systems that scale. Players with deep expertise are injecting further trust for even greater adoption. Early results indicate that we’ve got a bright future ahead – more choice in lending and payment types, more control over our financial data and more insights to help us achieve our financial goals.&nbsp; Learn more about our Mastercard Open Banking solutions for <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">payments</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/secure-account-opening/">account opening</a>.</p>

<p>After diving into the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">science of quantum computing</a> in the second episode, the Entrust Engage podcast moves toward the world of blockchain and the impact of quantum computing on it in the third episode. Providing commentary on this topic was Jon Geater, Chief Product and Technology Officer at RKVST, and Pali Surdhar, Director of Product Security at Entrust. The intersection of blockchain and quantum computing is quite fascinating, and that’s exactly what this episode explores. Here are the four key things I learned from this conversation:</p>
<p>#1: What is blockchain? </p>
<p>Before we go further into how quantum computing impacts blockchain, it’s important to have a foundational understanding of just what this technology is. As this episode explains, blockchain is ledger-based, decentralized, and built on high-integrity cryptography. It features two crucial properties: Control is spread around to a number of participants, and accountability is shared and decentralized. Built on the foundation of cryptography and fair-access principles, blockchain ensures fair access, good control, and knowledge of trustworthiness of the data.</p>
<p>#2: Is blockchain at risk from quantum computing?</p>
<p>In blockchain, the threat from quantum computing has more to do with the integrity of historic ledger records than the decryption of data. If a bad actor was able to back-date data and effectively rewrite history by leveraging quantum computing, it would break the blockchain principle of ensuring the truthfulness of data.</p>
<p>While this could be a potential vulnerability in the future, at present blockchain happens to be partially quantum-resistant already. Even if the technology were to be compromised, it could only happen at one point in time, in one place, on one computer, and in one piece of memory. And then after that, the computer must convince the other participants in the consensus that this is the correct version of history to accept. In a sense, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks has some built-in quantum resistance.</p>
<p>#3: In that case, does blockchain need to be prepared to mitigate risk?</p>
<p>There’s a significant overlap between what’s being required by regulatory bodies and the capabilities of blockchain-based architecture. Since there’s already some resistance in blockchain to quantum attacks, is there any urgency to transition to quantum-safe techniques? This can depend on the use case, but the answer is probably yes.</p>
<p>In blockchain, if the use case involves a confidentiality requirement, key exchanges are occurring, and there exists the same vulnerability as in the wider internet. Another important consideration is the data inside the blocks themselves; users need to make sure the chain references or digests can’t be faked. That’s another situation in which it is useful to have quantum-resistant algorithms deployed.</p>
<p>#4: When should blockchain prepare for the quantum threat? </p>
<p>To paraphrase our experts: Prepare now but know you’re not alone. Blockchain creates accountability for its shared infrastructure. Blockchain users would be wise to update their cryptography and transition their algorithms to <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">quantum-safe options as outlined by NIST</a>. They exist in a community; the best advice is for users to come to a consensus about protecting assets and joint histories for the road ahead.</p>

<p>Encryption is a foundational tool to secure data from unauthorized disclosure and protect privacy for users and businesses.</p>
<p>What is private key cryptography? It is a form of encryption that uses a single private key for data encryption and decryption.</p>
 What Is a Private Key? 
<p>A private key is a cryptographic key used in an encryption algorithm to both encrypt and decrypt data. These keys are used in both public and private encryption:</p>
 
 In private key encryption, also known as symmetric encryption, the data is first encrypted using the private key and then decrypted using the same key. This means anyone with access to the private key can decrypt the data. 
 In a public-key system, also known as asymmetric encryption, data is encrypted with a widely-distributed public key. This data can only be decrypted with a corresponding private key that the user keeps secret. This makes it possible for anyone to send encrypted data to the owner of the private key, who can then decrypt it using their private key. 
 
<p>In both systems, the private key is kept secret and not shared with anyone else. It is used to decrypt and read encrypted messages. However, in a symmetric system, there is only a single key (the private key). In asymmetric systems, a message uses the public key to encrypt data that must then be decrypted using a private key.</p>
<p>Private key encryption is often used to encrypt data stored or transmitted between two parties. For example, when you log in to a website using a username and password, the password is often encrypted using a private key before it is transmitted to the web server.</p>
<p>While private key encryption is a simple and efficient method, it has limitations regarding secure data transmission over a network. Since the same key is used for encryption and decryption, two parties must securely exchange the key before data can be encrypted and transmitted. If an unauthorized party intercepts the key, they can easily decrypt the data.</p>
 Private vs. Public Key Encryption 
<p>As previously discussed, public and private key encryption differ on how they create and distribute keys. As such, there are several different applications of each approach.</p>
<p>Some examples of private key encryption include:</p>
 
 Block Ciphers: Block ciphers encrypt data in fixed-size blocks and typically use a single, private key. Examples of block ciphers include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Blowfish, and Triple DES. 
 Stream Ciphers: Stream ciphers encrypt data continuously and are commonly used in real-time communication, such as voice or video streaming. 
 Hash Functions: Hash functions are one-way functions that generate a fixed-size output from any input, allowing data recipients to verify the integrity of the data. Examples of hash functions include SHA-256 and MD5. 
 
<p>Some examples of public key encryption include:</p>
 
 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA): RSA was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman as an asymmetric encryption standard used for encrypting data as well as for digital signatures and key exchange. 
 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): ECC is a modern asymmetric key encryption algorithm becoming increasingly popular for key exchange, digital signatures, and encryption. 
 Diffie-Hellman: Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm that is used to securely exchange keys for common applications like secure communication and virtual private networks (VPNs). 
 Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA): DSA is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is used for digital signatures. It is commonly used in programs like secure email and financial management. 
 
<p>Additionally, some applications use public and private key encryption combinations to secure data communications. Some of these include:</p>
 
 Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): This uses both private and public key encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. It uses symmetric-key encryption to encrypt the data and asymmetric-key encryption to securely exchange the symmetric key between the sender and the recipient. 
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): SSL is a cryptographic protocol that establishes a secure and encrypted connection between a web server and a web browser. SSL provides a secure method of data transmission over the internet by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client and server. 
 
 What Is Private Key Management? 
<p>One of the most critical points of security failure around private key encryption (and encryption more broadly) is managing and protecting keys. If a key is compromised, then any data that uses that key is effectively open to the public.</p>
<p>This presents a problem, however, in that keys must be stored and, in some cases, transmitted so that users can decrypt information. Therefore, effective private key management is critical to maintaining the security and integrity of sensitive information.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices for private key management:</p>
 
 Secure Storage: Private keys should be stored in a secure location, such as a hardware security module (HSM), a smart card, or a secure file system. The storage should be physically and logically secure, and access should be restricted to authorized personnel only. 
 Key Rotation: Private keys should be rotated regularly to prevent any potential compromise. This can be done by generating a new key and phasing out the old one. 
 Access Control: Access to private keys should be strictly controlled, and only authorized personnel should be granted access. The access should be logged and monitored for any unauthorized activity. 
 Key Destruction: Private keys should be securely destroyed when they are no longer needed to prevent any potential compromise. This can be done by using a secure key destruction method, such as cryptographic erasure. 
 
 Generating and Finding Your SSL Key 
<p>The process of generating keys will differ depending on the application used and your proximity to key and encryption administration.</p>
<p>For example, the admin of an SSL server can generate a certificate using the software on hand. Likewise, the admin can use the URL they manage to request SSL certificates (which will generate public and private keys) from a certificate authority. These keys would be located on the server on which they are created… but aren’t available for general access.</p>
<p>Likewise, an application that uses PGP (like an email service) may create and store private keys in a local directory–again, in a location where normal users should not be able to access them.</p>
<p>The reality is that the key must remain private whenever a private key is generated. Therefore, these keys are often encrypted and protected behind strong authentication and access standards.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Private Key Encryption? 
<p>There are several benefits of private key encryption, including:</p>
 
 Performance: Private key encryption algorithms are easier to implement. Furthermore, these algorithms can encrypt and decrypt larger data blocks faster than their public counterparts. 
 Authentication: Private key encryption can be used for authentication by providing a digital signature that verifies the identity of the sender. Furthermore, different forms of authentication (passwords, etc.) can be used to authenticate a recipient before decryption. 
 Integrity: Private key encryption can ensure data integrity through message digests or one-way hashes by detecting any modifications or tampering that may have occurred during transmission. 
 
 1Kosmos identity Management and Encryption 
<p>At the heart of the 1Kosmos BlockID is decentralized, encrypted <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/blockchain-authentication/">blockchain</a> technology serving as a private, encrypted ledger. This ledger uses private and public keys to encrypt user information. These keys are generated and controlled by the user via the app without their needing to directly manage these keys.</p>
<p>1Kosmos also includes features like:</p>
 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone. 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure that there are no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out of the box integrations or via API/SDK.

			<p>11th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://www.cofund.ai/">CoFund</a>, a pioneering marketplace in the field of real estate tokenization, has announced its partnership with <a href="http://www.tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform. The collaboration enables CoFund to leverage Tokeny’s innovative platform to bring institutional-grade real estate assets to the masses, issuing ERC3643 security tokens on the Polygon network.</p>
<p>CoFund is determined to establish itself as a premier marketplace for real estate tokenization by enabling a global investor base to invest in top-tier real estate assets, earn passive income, and engage in secure peer-to-peer trading on the blockchain. With a deep commitment to compliance, CoFund has chosen the ERC3643 standard for permissioned tokens.</p>
<p>CoFund’s flagship offering is a $10 million luxurious hotel situated in the heart of Bali, where investors can participate with as little as $1,000. Bali is a renowned vacation destination and a hub for tourism, with a remarkable 9.2 million international visitors in 2019, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism.</p>
<p>For decades, Bali’s thriving tourism industry has captivated millions of visitors worldwide, yet investment opportunities in this sector have been inaccessible to many. Through tokenization, CoFund allows individuals worldwide to participate in this flourishing industry.</p>
<p>CoFund’s primary focus is currently directed towards Bali. However, the company has plans to expand to other regions worldwide, enabling a greater number of investors to access a wider range of real estate investment opportunities.</p>
<p>By partnering with Tokeny, CoFund has leveraged its SaaS tokenization solution to effortlessly issue and manage security tokens, enabling fully auditable and immutable cap tables on the blockchain and providing investors with direct ownership and complete transparency. Moreover, CoFund is able to conduct real-time operations such as distributing and recovering tokens to investors with ease.</p>

		 
	 
    Our ultimate goal at CoFund has always been to democratize real estate investment by making it accessible and profitable for everyone. With Tokeny's proven platform, we can create a secure and accessible real estate investment market that meets the needs of all types of investors while ensuring compliance. This collaboration takes us one step closer to realizing our vision of a global real estate investment market that's open to all and we are extremely excited in starting our journey with the amazing island of Bali.  Giri KayogiswaraCEO CoFund       We are thrilled to be working with CoFund to help upgrade the real estate investment market. With the tokenization market accelerating, serious projects like CoFund are realizing that simple ERC20 tokens and NFTs don't meet compliance needs. Our technology platform leverages the ERC3643 token standard to ensure our partners can enforce compliance, even on a permissionless blockchain. CoFund's real estate expertise and our technical capabilities make for a powerful combination, bringing accessibility to real estate investment.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny

<p>Join us for Fission's first-ever conference! We're exploring the future of computing with experts in AI, programming language theory, computational media arts, and more.</p> Causal Islands: The Origin Story <p>Fission co-founders Boris and Brooklyn have been working together for quite a while on computing, distributed systems, and encryption in an effort to create developer tools that make building applications more accessible.</p><p>After attending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6fvZA0L-ok&amp;list=PLFkGFMxuCsI2hwxF0TjUVGq-iLmn3MkIb">BlueYard's EthCC side event</a> in 2022, they were inspired by the speakers and attendees who brought their diverse research interests and areas of expertise into the conversation. They realized that being able to connect with folks outside of their regular circle was invaluable, and decided that they wanted to hold a conference of their own. One where everyone could learn from each other and share their knowledge while working on the future of computing. </p><p>The name "Causal Islands" comes from physics. It refers to how information traveling at the speed of light hits a physical limit. In our distributed systems, we experience this physical limit as latency - a function of our proximity to data centers and the quality of our connectivity. Brooklyn has used this concept in several of her talks to highlight how edge compute plays a part in reducing latency.</p><p>As we thought about it, it seemed like a good metaphor: we can think of us as all existing on our own islands of information: building our tech stacks and pursuing research into different areas of the future of computing, each in our own direction.</p><p>The Causal Islands conference is designed to bring together and engage everyone interested in the future of computing, both to share what they're working on, and to learn and be inspired by cross-disciplinary approaches on other islands of focus.</p><p>Now that you know the origin and purpose of the conference, let's jump into some frequently asked questions!</p> Who is behind Causal Islands? <p><a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a> created Causal Islands with the generous support of <a href="https://www.blueyard.com/">BlueYard Capital</a> and <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>.

<p>Our founders attended the inaugural <a href="https://www.apacdigitalid.org/">APAC Digital Identity unConference</a> that took place in Bangkok, Thailand. It was an exciting one as expected that aimed to promote innovation and collaboration among new digital identity businesses and initiatives in the APAC region. Open Space <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unConferences</a> is a participatory event where attendees co-create the agenda together live each day of the event. The focus is on discussing the subject with professional colleagues from a variety of identification sectors, there are no keynotes or&nbsp;panels.</p><blockquote>Secure and interoperable identity is necessary for engaging with people to benefit on the problems in today’s world such as tracking trade, supporting labour markets, and crossing borders for a variety of reasons. Significant investments have been made into the development of interoperable standards, protocols, systems application layers, conceptual use cases, and more.<br>APAC Digital unConference is one such newly initiated forum where people from the region have a platform come together, brainstorm on such problems to find solutions to with the emerging trends &amp; technologies and most importantly, to collaborate — eventually, get benefitted.</blockquote> People behind the idea — unConference - <p>The people behind the idea of the APAC Digital Identity unConference are passionate professionals who believe in the importance of digital identity and its impact on society. The Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>) had a major inspiration for the APAC Digital Identity Conference. The APAC event was organised and hosted by the two IIW facilitators and producers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young (Identity Woman)</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-nobantu-saul-0291941/">Heidi Nobantu Saul</a>, in partnership with a nearby business, Newlogic. IIW is being facilitated &amp; organised since year 2005 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Phil Windley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/docsearls/">Doc Searls</a> besides these two veterans.</p><p>The opportunity was to conduct an event for the APAC region in the same Open Space unConference style as the Internet Identity Workshop.</p> The new way of ‘Being Involved’! - <p>The new way of being involved is what makes the unConference unique. Unlike traditional conferences where attendees sit through pre-planned sessions, the unConference is a participant-driven event that empowers the attendees to take ownership of the agenda. It is a platform to share knowledge, ideas, and best practices in an open manner. All the sessions were led by experts in the field and moderated by volunteers from the community. The unConference is an event where the participants have the freedom to create their own agenda and ask questions, connect with others, and contribute to the conversation.</p> Glimpses of the topics covered&nbsp;- <p>The sessions were highly interactive, and participants had the opportunity to exchange answers to questions and get feedback.</p><p>Glimpses of the topics covered at the UnConference:</p><p>Day 1, Thursday, March 02,&nbsp;2023:</p>  Standards for Distributed ID for&nbsp;Asia  Sri Lanka Digital&nbsp;ID  Open Discussion: Navigating, Recognition Across&nbsp;Borders  What Constitutes Indigenous ID in SSI Approaches  Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF) Ecosystem  Pictures as Identifiers  How Cloud Wallet could act as a bridge in the SSI&nbsp;space  DCDR — Data-Centric Digital&nbsp;Rights  Singpass — Singapore’s National Digital&nbsp;ID  “Not QR” Codes + Civil Registration + Vital Statistics  <p>Day 2, Friday, March 03,&nbsp;2023:</p>  (ToIP) Digital Trust Ecosystems  Identity &amp; Domain&nbsp;Names  Whiteboard Session: Elements That Make APAC Trust Framework  Building Open Source Communities + New&nbsp;Ideas  Verifiable Identity: Social Media — “The Bali Process”&nbsp;Context  Blue Economy and Regional paperless trade  NFTs as an Identifier — Pro’s Con’s Is it worth&nbsp;it?  Verifiable Credentials — Exchange Protocol and Wallet Interaction   Key Takeaways - <p>There have been several key takeaways from the unConference. However, some of the key ones include&nbsp;-</p><p>1. There was a unanimous vote to have APAC level collaboration to draft a APAC Digital ID Trust Framework. This group can have the participants of the working group shared diverse operating realities, their learnings and interests in building a coherent method to trust each other’s <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital identity systems</a>. As a key conclusion on this, it was agreed to house meetings for this group under one of the Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) working&nbsp;groups.</p><p>2. It was encouraging to see that a few countries in the APAC have already embarked on the journey of building Digital Identities infrastructure for the nationwide benefit of its citizens. Couple of the examples were&nbsp;-</p>  Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of <a href="https://www.dhi.bt/">Druk Holding and Investments Limited</a> (DHI) — Bhutan’s investment arm, updated about Bhutan just launched a new national digital ID system (NDI). Bhutan NDI is Bhutan’s new National Identity System, developed by Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) for GovTech Bhutan. The NDI will have citizens eight years old and above enrolled into it. Apart from the ID card, the NDI wallet will carry other information including health, tax filings, education and census records as well as revenue and bank statements, and business documents.  Singapore (they are implementing <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/">SingPass</a>). The representatives from the Singapore government who attended the unConference stated that with SingPass, the citizens can access over 2,500+ services by over 800+ government agencies and businesses at their fingertips  Sri Lanka government also leveraged an India based open source platform, MOSIP, to implement Digital identity management for its citizens.  <p>3. Decentralised Identity Foundation (<a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>) and Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) are the forums where most of the innovation is happening — innovation in terms of tech stack&nbsp;, frameworks, libraries and standards for Decentralised Identity, Trust Frameworks, Governance Frameworks, Trust Ecosystems, et. al. It was an opportunity for the first time attendees of such Digital Identity unConference to get first hand update about these two&nbsp;forums.</p><p>4. We urged the facilitators that the next APAC event should be hosted in India. Considering the vast diversified demography spawning across technology enthusiasts to unicorns to startups to government representatives to people from all walks of life, there will potentially be a huge attendance for the&nbsp;event</p> Benefit to participate in future&nbsp;- <p>Everyone should participate in the UnConference, especially those who are interested in digital identity, including individuals, practitioners, researchers, regulators, implementers, government leaders, technologists, digital and privacy rights activists. The UnConference is an excellent opportunity where individuals representing various standards, initiatives, and businesses can congregate, exchange knowledge, form relationships, and advance the&nbsp;cause</p> Proud Sponsors&nbsp;- <p>AyanWorks was honoured to be one of the sponsors of the inaugural APAC Digital Identity unConference. Companies that sponsored the event besides <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a> included <a href="https://gluu.org/">gluu</a>, <a href="https://newlogic.com/">Newlogic</a> and <a href="https://opendevelopmentmekong.net/">Open Development Initiative</a>. Over the past 4 years, AyanWorks has been working in the core <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">Decentralised Identity solutions</a> space and delivering solutions to our global clients. With this experience at our strength, we strongly believe that such events are essential to bring awareness, do more evangelising and move forward in the new digital era followed by innovation, building digital identity infrastructure and developing secure, dependable digital identification ecosystems.</p> Summing it&nbsp;up! <p>To summarise, the APAC Digital Identity unConference is a great place to network, learn, and add to the conversation about digital identities. We invite everyone to take part in upcoming activities, all future APAC Digital Identity unConferences and keep promoting innovation in the Digital Identity&nbsp;space.</p><p>See you all in the next such event in APAC.. hopefully in India&nbsp;🙂!!</p>

</p><p>Blockchain technology offers huge benefits – decentralization, transparent interaction, high levels of security, and immutable record keeping. It has enabled a thriving crypto ecosystem to grow and support continuous technological innovation. However, one of the main problems with many blockchain networks is their scalability. Scaling is an issue when the amount of data passing through the blockchain hits a limit due to the insufficient capacities of the blockchain.</p>



<p>In an ideal case, a blockchain would be able to process countless transactions per second, also known as throughput or with the acronym TPS. However, the Bitcoin main chain can only handle about 3-7 TPS. By comparison, Visa can process more than 20,000 TPS using the VisaNet centralized electronic payment network. The difference is in the level of decentralization and privacy that Bitcoin and other blockchains aim to provide.</p>



<p>Similarly, Ethereum is coming to a point where it faces scalability challenges. As of summer 2022, Ethereum is processing an estimated 500,000 transactions per day, which equates to 30 transactions per second. By comparison, Visa's payment system can process up to 150 million transactions per day and 65,000 transactions per second. This far exceeds the processing power of Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 is expecting it to increase to 20,000-100,000 transactions per second however it will take few years to reach that maximum capacity.</p>



 What Are Layer-2 Scaling Solutions? 



<p>Layer 2 refers to secondary frameworks or protocols that build on top of existing blockchain systems. The main purpose of these protocols is to solve the transaction speed and scaling problems faced by major cryptocurrency networks. It not only reduces workload on main net, but maintains the same security and decentralization standards as the underlying blockchain.</p>



 Layer-1 v/s Layer-2 Blockchains 



<p>Layer 1 blockchain refers to the underlying blockchain network architecture and protocols that serve as the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based use cases. It is the core layer of a blockchain system and consists of the basic building blocks that enable data storage, transaction processing, and consensus mechanisms.</p>



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions are technologies that build on top of existing layer 1 blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, to increase their scalability and efficiency. Layer 2 solutions allow for off-chain processing of transactions, which helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its scalability.</p>



<p>One of the key differences between layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain technology is scalability. Layer 1 blockchain networks have limited transaction processing capacity, which can result in slow processing times and high fees during periods of high demand. Layer 2 solutions address this issue by reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its capacity.</p>



 Advantages of layer 2 blockchain solutions 



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages, including:</p>



 
 Scalability: Layer 2 solutions can help increase the transaction processing capacity of existing blockchain networks, making them more scalable and able to handle higher volumes of transactions. By offloading transactions from the main blockchain, layer 2 solutions can reduce congestion and increase throughput. 
 



 
 Speed: By processing transactions off-chain, layer 2 solutions can significantly reduce transaction processing times, resulting in faster and more efficient transactions. 



 Lower fees: Layer 2 solutions can help reduce the fees associated with blockchain transactions by reducing the workload on the main blockchain and reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on it. 



 Improved privacy: Layer 2 solutions can enable privacy-preserving transactions by using techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and state channels to keep transaction data off the main blockchain. 



 Interoperability: Layer 2 solutions can enable interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing for the seamless movement of assets and data between them. 



 Flexibility: Layer 2 solutions can be tailored to specific use cases and can be designed to work with a variety of blockchain networks, making them a flexible and versatile solution. 
 



<p>Overall, layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages over traditional layer 1 blockchain networks, including improved scalability, speed, privacy, and interoperability, making them an essential component of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 What Types of Layer-2 Solutions Out There? 



<p>There are several types of Layer 2 scaling solutions, each with its own approach to increasing the scalability of blockchain networks. Here are some of the most common types of Layer 2 solutions:</p>



 
 State Channels 



 Plasma 



 Rollups 
 



 State channels blockchain solution 



<p>State channels are a layer 2 blockchain solution that allows for off-chain transactions between two parties. State channels enable fast and cheap transactions by keeping most of the transaction data off the main blockchain.</p>



<p>Projects - Lightning Network, Celer Network, Trinity</p>



<p>Here's how state channels work:</p>



 
 Two parties create a contract that defines the rules of their transaction. 



 They deposit their cryptocurrency into a shared channel, which is a smart contract on the blockchain. 



 They then conduct their transactions off-chain, using the rules defined in the contract. 



 Once they are finished, they close the channel and settle their balances on the main blockchain. 
 



<p>State channels are useful for microtransactions, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive. They can also be used for real-time, interactive transactions, such as online gaming or instant messaging.</p>



 Plasma layer 2 solution 



<p>Plasma is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon in 2017. The goal of Plasma is to enable the Ethereum network to process a large number of transactions, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plasma chain projects- Polygon, Loom Network</p>



<p>Here's how Plasma works:</p>



 
 A smart contract is created on the Ethereum network that serves as the root chain. 



 Child chains, also known as Plasma chains, are created off of the root chain. These Plasma chains are fully functional blockchains with their own validators, but they are connected to the Ethereum network. 



 Transactions on the Plasma chains are processed off-chain, and are only submitted to the Ethereum network when a block is finalized. 



 The finality of blocks on the Plasma chains is enforced by the root chain, which acts as a final arbiter for any disputes that arise. 
 



<p>Plasma is useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. It can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main Ethereum network would be prohibitive.</p>



 Rollups 



<p>Blockchain rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that aim to improve the scalability of blockchain networks by grouping multiple transactions together before submitting them to the main blockchain for verification. There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups, which assume that most transactions are valid and only require minimal verification, and ZK-rollups, which use zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions off-chain before submitting them to the main chain.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Optimistic Rollups 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution for blockchain networks that offer several advantages over traditional on-chain transactions. Here's how they work:</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then validated by a small group of validators who check for fraudulent or invalid transactions. 



 Once the batch is confirmed, it is sent to the main blockchain and added to the ledger. 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are useful for applications that require high transaction throughput, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. They are also ideal for micropayments, where the transaction cost on the main blockchain would be prohibitively expensive.</p>



<p>Optimism and Arbitrum are popular optimistic rollup projects</p>



 
 Zero-Knowledge Rollups 
 



<p>Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups) are a layer 2 blockchain solution that enables fast and efficient transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain network.</p>



<p>Projects- Minaprotocol, immutableX, loopring, ZK Sync</p>



<p>Here's how ZK Rollups work:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then verified using zero-knowledge proofs, which enable the network to verify the transactions without revealing any of the transaction data. 



 The verified batches are then submitted to the main blockchain, where they are added to the ledger. 
 



<p>&nbsp;ZK Rollups are useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. They can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive.</p>



<p>To sum up, the implementation of layer 2 scaling solutions is paramount in overcoming the scalability and usability limitations of blockchain technology. These solutions allow for increased transaction throughput, decreased fees, and enhanced functionality, all while maintaining the security and decentralized nature of blockchains. As more projects adopt layer 2 technologies, we can anticipate remarkable progress in the blockchain industry, along with the emergence of fresh use cases for decentralized applications.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our upcoming articles, where we will dive deeper into various layer 2 projects and provide detailed insights into their technical details, advantages, limitations, and potential use cases.&nbsp; Whether you are a blockchain enthusiast, developer, or investor, our articles will provide valuable insights into the latest developments in blockchain scaling solutions. </p>

   In 2022, we learned that when it comes to digital experiences, users have growing expectations for convenience but refuse to sacrifice their security to get it. At the same time, threat actors have become increasingly sophisticated. With enterprises facing competing demands to prevent and protect against threats, while still providing a seamless experience, a robust identity security strategy has

<p>In 2022, we learned that when it comes to digital experiences, users have <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3698-2022-consumer-survey.html?utm_source=news-release&amp;utm_medium=pingpr">growing expectations for convenience</a> but refuse to sacrifice their security to get it. At the same time, threat actors have become increasingly sophisticated. With enterprises facing competing demands to prevent and protect against threats, while still providing a seamless experience, a robust identity security strategy has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
In recognition of <a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2023/">Identity Management Day</a>, we wanted to review trends shaping our industry in the present and acknowledge their implications for the future. Here are three trends we expect to unfold in 2023:</p>

 Cyberattacks continue to increase at an alarming rate, and many security breaches can be traced back to an authentication issue. Whether a password or a password plus an additional authentication factor, attackers are adept at bypassing them at scale. For example, over 100 million multi-factor authentication (MFA) attacks were recorded in Q1 2022, whereas such attacks were virtually non

<p>Cyberattacks continue to increase at an alarming rate, and many security breaches can be traced back to an authentication issue. Whether a password or a password plus an additional authentication factor, attackers are adept at bypassing them at scale. For example, over 100 million multi-factor authentication (MFA) attacks <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/Ways-to-overcome-multifactor-authentication-vulnerabilities">were recorded in Q1 2022</a>, whereas such attacks were virtually non-existent in 2019.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Just this month, law enforcement agencies in Europe and the U.S. announced the seizure of a major online <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation">marketplace that offered over 80 million stolen login credentials</a>, giving cybercriminals access to accounts in the financial sector, critical infrastructure, and government agencies, among others. This hasn’t put them out of business, however, as the group’s admins announced the marketplace would soon be available <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seizes-stolen-credentials-market-genesis-in-operation-cookie-monster/">through other channels</a>.</p> 
<p>The pressure on security teams is showing no signs of abating, and against that backdrop, we compiled our <a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless Security report</a> for a third consecutive year. For this report, we asked 1,000 IT/IS security decision-makers from around the world about the state of cybersecurity in their organization and where passwordless security currently fits into their defense strategy.&nbsp;</p> 
 Authentication Is Still Highly Vulnerable  
<p>As has been the case in our <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-state-of-passwordless-security-in-2022ss-security">previous two reports</a>, authentication remains the greatest weakness in enterprise cybersecurity. Of the professionals we interviewed, 60% said their organizations had suffered breaches through authentication-based attacks across the last 12 months. These breaches can then be used as launchpads for further attacks, such as ransomware or data theft.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ability of attackers to automate phishing processes, including buying easy-to-deploy kits on the dark web, make any authentication process featuring passwords and other shared secrets high-risk. This ease of access means that even low-skilled attackers can launch successful assaults on major corporations. However, despite these clear and obvious risks, most organizations don’t make any changes to their authentication processes after a successful attack. Even worse, a majority still deploy passwords in some form, with 57% using the most basic username and password combos for some systems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Since credential theft is still the easiest and most successful method for attackers, major industry groups and the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">federal government</a> have advised organizations to deploy phishing-resistant, passwordless methods.&nbsp;</p> 
 Global Cyber Defenses: New Avenues of Attack  
<p>Virtually every organization has suffered some form of cyberattack over the last year. The main vectors for these attacks are common threats such as phishing and ransomware, but one, in particular, has shown noticeable growth. Nearly 30% of organizations were hit by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a>, which have more than doubled their prevalence since the 2022 report (12%).&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This increase relates to how organizations have tried to counter their greatest cybersecurity weakness (passwords) with multi-factor authentication. MFA requires a user to authenticate themselves using two or more factors based on knowledge (i.e., password or PIN), possession (i.e., device or hardware security key) or inherence (i.e., fingerprints or face scans).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the general acknowledgement that passwords are easily phished or cracked, MFA in the form of a password plus an additional factor, has been widely considered a possible solution. However, as our report shows, this has not proven to be an effective security measure. For example, attackers can bypass push notification MFA by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">spamming users with push requests</a>, aka MFA prompt bombing, hoping the user will accept.&nbsp;</p> 
 Passwordless Security: A Multi-Problem Solution  
<p>The most tangible consequences of authentication-originated breaches are monetary, costing organizations an average of $2.95 million annually. This doesn’t factor in the longer-term financial impacts of losing business to rivals and reputational damage.</p> 
<p><a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report"></a></p> 
<p>The problems with passwords, however, extend beyond their serious security implications. From a user-experience perspective, passwords are the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">root cause of significant frustration</a>. Our report reveals that 81% of respondents experienced occasions where they could not access critical information because they’d forgotten a password. Along with the time spent logging in with passwords, password resets and account lockouts significantly impact employee productivity and, consequently, their bottom line.</p> 
<p>The costs are also very real at the IT support desk. Our report uncovered some thought-provoking insights into how much upholding password-based authentication costs organizations yearly. Enterprises spend 32% of their IT helpdesk budget on password-related issues, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-much-does-a-password-reset-cost">such as resets</a>. This equates to $465,645 annually, or $375 per employee per year, wasted on password issues.</p> 
<p>While passwordless security has its own implementation costs, it is generally far cheaper than maintaining password-based systems.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Short-Term Future of Passwordless Security  
<p>Despite the clear and obvious problems using passwords causes on an annual basis, many organizations have yet to adopt full passwordless security. Even though the security leaders interviewed were almost unanimous in their belief in passwordless security benefits, organizations still face significant obstacles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These obstacles range from fears around integration with their current technology stack to lacking the internal knowledge to implement a new system, to general misunderstandings of what exactly constitutes phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA. Only 3% of organizations that state they use passwordless solutions are using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. This means that 97%&nbsp;of the “passwordless” solutions deployed are susceptible to phishing and push attacks.</p> 
<p>Our State of Passwordless Security Report 2023 gives an in-depth insight into exactly how much authentication weaknesses are costing organizations every year. We also look at the global state of passwordless security and how organizations respond to the biggest threats.&nbsp;</p>
