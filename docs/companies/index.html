 The world of finance is rapidly evolving and at the heart of this transformation is the emergence of digital currencies. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), in particular, have been a topic of increasing interest among global central banks. Coinfirm, as a leader in blockchain analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) solutions, closely follows these developments. Today, we delve into the latest updates from the European Central Bank (ECB) on their ongoing project – the digital euro. 



 The Digital Euro: Prioritizing the Euro Area 



<p>According to a recent presentation from the ECB, the primary focus of the digital euro project is to serve the needs of the euro area. The ECB plans to gradually introduce different use cases for the digital euro, aiming to make it accessible to everyone within the euro area before expanding to users outside this zone. This phased approach is designed to prevent the project from becoming overly complex while ensuring it meets the needs of its primary users.</p>



 Exploring International Opportunities 



<p>The ECB recognizes the significant potential of an international dimension for the digital euro. It aims to enable access to and use of the digital euro outside the euro area without requiring currency conversion. Furthermore, the bank acknowledges the need for interoperability to facilitate cross-currency payments. The ECB’s foresight in considering these broader opportunities is a promising indicator of the digital euro’s future utility.</p>



 A Rising Tide of CBDC Projects 



<p>The ECB isn’t alone in this digital currency exploration. In fact, a recent report by the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/bank-for-international-settlements/"> Bank for International Settlements </a>(BIS) shows a substantial rise in CBDC projects around the world. The ECB is actively supporting international CBDC initiatives, collaborating with the BIS,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/g7/"> G7,</a> and<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/international-monetary-fund-imf/"> International Monetary Fund (IMF) </a>among others. This collective effort by central banks worldwide underscores the significance of CBDCs in the future of finance.</p>



 The International Use Cases of the Digital Euro 



<p>When it comes to the use of the digital euro outside the euro area, the ECB is considering several scenarios. These include cross-border payments in digital euro, payments in digital euro outside the euro area, and use by visitors. The rules for geographical access will be determined by legislation, and if permitted, access could be extended to consumers and merchants in the European Economic Area and selected non-EU countries.</p>



 Interoperability of Digital Euro with Other CBDCs 



<p>One of the key factors in the success of the digital euro will be its interoperability with other CBDCs. The ECB has proposed two models to facilitate this: the interlinking model, which allows transactions without participation in each system, and the single system model, which involves a single system across multiple currencies.</p>



 Wholesale Central Bank Money Settlement: A New Initiative 



<p>The ECB is looking to contribute to digital innovation while ensuring that central bank money remains a monetary anchor. To this end, it has announced a new initiative on wholesale central bank money settlement. A new Eurosystem task force has been established to explore new technologies that could facilitate interaction between TARGET services and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>As an organization deeply entrenched in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>and digital currency space, Coinfirm recognizes the potential of CBDCs to revolutionize financial systems globally. We are excited to see how the ECB’s exploration of the digital euro progresses and will continue to provide our expertise and solutions in AML and blockchain analytics to support this evolution.</p>

<p>During this development cycle we have focused our lens on Sweden in particular, specifically with the continued support for Swedish BankID. Additionally, we have performed expected security and life-cycle management development. For full details, please head over to review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Swedish BankID 
<p>Throughout the Nordics, the ability to strongly identify oneself is considered to be second nature. The countries have invested substantial time over the last twenty years ensuring that each citizen and resident can perform many of their day-to-day tasks online. To carry this out, one needs to have a strongly authenticated digital identification method.</p>
<p>Within Sweden, this is predominantly <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en/privat/skaffa-bankid">BankID.</a> Since our original support of BankID via CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) back in the summer of 2018, things have changed. We have reviewed the BankID Relying Party Guidelines (v3.7) and developed an authentication adaptor to enable you to directly configure BankID within the Identity Platform. This means both two device flow, and the more commonly used single device flow, are supported. Now your users can strongly authenticate your web page or mobile app directly on their mobile device.</p>
 Focus Sweden 
<p>Full support for BankID coupled with our existing support for <a href="https://frejaeid.com/en/home/">Freja eID</a> and <a href="https://www.svipe.com/">Svipe</a> means that you can empower your users to authenticate with the most common services in Sweden. It’s well known that Ubisecure has a long history of supporting the Finnish population with a full suite of authentication options, from banking (TUPAS, which is now the FTN), through social logins (O365, Google and Apple), as well as specialised authenticators. &nbsp;Our latest release demonstrates our commitment towards Sweden, and we continue to develop the Identity Platform with a pan-European focus. We will be carrying out additional work over the next year to develop animated QR codes, required in 2024 by BankID. If there is an authenticator you need, that we are not yet offering, please contact Support or your account team and let us know. We work alongside our customers to ensure our Identity Platform evolves in line with your needs and expectations.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>Ongoing security maintenance is, of course, paramount. As we maintain the Identity Platform, we continue to improve both its functionality and security. During this release cycle, we have focused on updating Wildfly (to Wildfly 26). We have also updated OpenLDAP to 2.5.14, and Redis support to 6.2.8. Support of Linux Redhat 8 has also been tested. We always encourage you to upgrade to the latest possible release of our software as it provides the most secure and feature-rich Identity Platform possible. As always, you can find highlights of the changes on the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> along with a link to the detailed example of the logging changes found on our Developer Portal.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>In the short term, we are continuing work towards ongoing improvements that will be available in the next month, when we release updates for both SSO (SSO 9.2.1) and CustomerID (CID 6.2.1). Over the summer, we are continuing the maintenance cycle as usual. Continuing into the autumn and winter, we will be continuing our research into risk-based authentication development and other aspects of strong authentication.</p>

<p>It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve <a href="https://moneyzine.com/personal-finance-resources/credit-card-fraud-statistics/">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a>. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.</p> 
 What is PSD2 SCA?  
<p>The revised Payment Services Directive, more generally known as&nbsp; PSD2, is a regulation that has been implemented in Europe, covering countries in the EEA, Monaco and the UK. Its main goals are to improve customer choice among payment providers, protect customer safety, and combat payment fraud. One key aspect of PSD2 is its obligation for all companies that provide payment services, including banks, financial institutions or other payment service providers (PSPs), to use Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The PSD2 SCA requirements oblige relevant companies to enhance customer security around payments by deploying <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for relevant transactions. MFA means that the customer must verify their identity by providing two or more factors of authentication. The guidelines on PSD2 SCA also note that authentication must be performed in a manner that protects customer data.&nbsp;</p> 
 Who Needs to Comply with PSD2 SCA?&nbsp;  
<p>Who falls under the umbrella of PSD2 SCA compliance? Well, it's not just the traditional players in the banking industry. Thanks to PSD2, new players like Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) and Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) have entered the scene. PISPs act as intermediaries between customers' banks (or where their money is) and sellers of goods or services. AISPs, upon user permission, consolidate all user financial information (such as deposits, loans, and direct debits) in one place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your company falls into these categories, you need to adhere to the PSD2 SCA requirements when <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">providing the following services</a>:</p> 
  
  Payment initiation services (these inform a seller that the customer has proceeded through an online purchase)  
  Account access (when a user, or a third-party service provider, asks their bank to inform them of their financial situation)  
  Card-based instructions (when a customer asks their bank or PSP to pay someone from their account)  
  
<p>If the payment or information instruction is initiated and processed in the regulation’s area, it must follow PSD2 SCA guidelines. For US companies, this could apply, for example, if they have a European-based entity or are looking to provide the specific services mentioned to EU citizens.</p> 
<p>Organizations are required to decline transactions that do not meet SCA requirements. There are exemptions for small transactions (less than €30), where the financial institution can prove it is a low-risk transaction or where the customer has whitelisted the service provider, such as for a direct debit of a phone or electricity bill.</p> 
 How to Implement PSD2 SCA  
<p>To comply with the PSD2 SCA requirements, organizations must ensure that their customer authentication meets the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1761863/314bd4d5-ccad-47f8-bb11-84933e863944/Final%20draft%20RTS%20on%20SCA%20and%20CSC%20under%20PSD2%20%28EBA-RTS-2017-02%29.pdf">regulatory technical standards</a> (RTS) set out for PSD2 SCA. This involves implementing MFA for relevant transactions and adhering to&nbsp; other specifications detailed in the RTS. These include:</p> 
  
  Dynamic linking of remote payments (creating a unique code specifying payee and amount to reduce fraud) should be based on technologies such as digital signatures or cryptographically underpinned validity assertions using keys.&nbsp;  
  Special advice should be given about the length or complexity of knowledge factors and the algorithms underpinning possession and inherence factors.&nbsp;  
  The application of PSD2 SCA should strike a balance between enhanced security for relevant payments and user-friendliness and accessibility.&nbsp;  
  Payments and PSD2 SCA elements must have separation. For example, if a smart device is used to make a payment and also counts as a factor of authentication, there must be a clear process to differentiate them.&nbsp;  
  
 Benefits of PSD2 SCA  
<p>Beyond regulatory compliance, PSD2 SCA brings other significant benefits to financial institutions and their customers, including improved customer security, fraud reduction, and a better user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improved Customer Security  
<p>First and foremost, PSD2 SCA enhances customer security by raising the bar for authentication. With MFA in place, it becomes much harder for attackers to impersonate users and carry out fraudulent activities. While there are still issues around <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/passwordless-vs-mfa">allowing knowledge factors (namely passwords) in MFA</a> as they can be easily phished or brute forced, mandating MFA is a major step towards a more secure online world for consumers.</p> 
 Reduced Fraud  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">Fraud committed through account takeover</a>, which uses a victim’s card or bank details to purchase items, can create significant distrust between the customer and the firm involved, even if neither party was at fault. Reducing payment fraud fosters greater trust in online transactions, making customers more comfortable with making purchases and boosting revenue opportunities for service providers.</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>The PSD2 SCA regulation recognizes the importance of maintaining a user-friendly process. Nobody wants frustrated customers <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/customer-authentication-tips-for-safer-shopping">abandoning their shopping carts</a> due to cumbersome authentication requirements or forgotten passwords. The specification for being accessible and user-friendly means companies complying with PSD2 SCA should consider how their authentication stream impacts the user and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">how it can be as frictionless as possible.</a></p> 
 What’s Next?  
<p>Earlier this year, the European Commission presented a study on the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f6f80336-a3aa-11ed-b508-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-280122910">application and impact of PSD2</a>. The study follows a period of <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/consultations/finance-2022-psd2-review_en">open consultations into revisions of PSD2</a> legislation. It is widely expected that a PSD3 framework will be announced, but its timing and the extent of the revisions have not yet been made public.</p> 
 Comply With PSD2 SCA and Improve Customer Experience With HYPR  
<p>The PSD2 regulates financial transactions in the EU and other countries such as the UK and Norway. Its strong customer authentication (SCA) requirement obliges financial institutions, banks and payment service providers to maintain strict MFA authentication procedures for operations such as payments over €30 or requests for account information. The PSD2 SCA requirements aim to improve online consumer trust by reducing fraud and account takeover attacks, yet without a significant trade-off of user experience.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless solution for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-customer-authentication">customer authentication</a> allows firms to fully comply with the PSD2 SCA and transaction signing directives, including cryptographic signing of every transaction and unique dynamic linking. With HYPR, you can ensure SCA regulatory compliance while removing friction from your customer authentication process.

 Put AI to work with IBM Watson Assistant 



<p>Last week during Think 2023, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/introducing-watsonx-the-future-of-ai-for-business/">IBM introduced watsonx</a>, a new platform that enables businesses to build AI models at scale and unveiled that Digital Labor offerings <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant">Watson Assistant</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-orchestrate">Watson Orchestrate</a> will be infused with large language models (LLMs) trained and tuned on watsonx to enable enhanced employee productivity and customer service experiences.</p>



<p>With that, we are introducing the new accelerated authoring and conversational search capabilities for Watson Assistant. Watson Assistant uses these new LLMs to drive user outcomes including:</p>



 
 Better understanding of your customers and their needs 



 Automating self-service actions and answers 



 Accelerating the development of exceptional experiences 
 



 Accelerated authoring 



<p>Accelerated authoring fast-tracks the delivery of new conversational&nbsp;flows. With this&nbsp;generative&nbsp;functionality, Watson Assistant makes it easy&nbsp;for your organization&nbsp;to accelerate build-time and deliver&nbsp;outcome-oriented&nbsp;conversational&nbsp;flows. The new “generate” feature for building actions now offers users the option to automate the build process for creating new actions by identifying multiple intents within context and automatically generating the steps to accomplish these tasks at once,&nbsp;whether it’s helping the customer of a telecommunications company add family members to their account, or assisting a bank branch manager as they hire a new customer service representative.</p>

<p>Summary:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Together with IBM, Deltares is working to enhance and expand the reach of its Aquality app, formerly called the Nitrate app. The tool can help farmers improve water quality, protect biodiversity, save on fertilizer costs and make farming practices more sustainable. 



 The Aquality app leverages technologies such as machine learning to help communities detect nitrate pollution and other quality characteristics in water and is experimenting with artificial intelligence to provide feedback and recommendations to farmers. 



 IBM is accepting proposals for the third cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator — focused on water management solutions — until May 31st, 2023. 
 


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator/water">Apply to the 3rd Cohort by 5/31</a>



<p>Maintaining good water quality is crucial for the overall well-being of people and the environment. Yet, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access">reports have said</a> that one in four people do not have access to safe drinking water. The world is making progress on clean water and sanitation, but is still far behind its target to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: ensuring access to water and sanitation for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Agriculture is one of the main sources of contamination in the water we use to drink, fish, participate in recreational activities and more. According to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food">reports</a>, 78% of global ocean and freshwater pollution with excess nutrients is caused by agriculture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nutrients, pesticides and other harmful chemicals commonly used by farmers enter the water through various channels, including runoff from fields and irrigation systems. This results in eutrophication: the over-enrichment of water by nutrients such as nitrogen, which can create severe ecological and human health consequences. For example, too much nitrate in water will stimulate algae growth, which can then deprive the water of oxygen needed by fish and other organisms that live in the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farmers also want to optimize their fertilizer use for economic reasons. In an ideal situation, they would be able to track the amount of fertilizer they need in order to make the best use of their resources, helping them to save money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there is a solution in development, all thanks to the power of data and human-centered design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 A solution to improve farming’s impact on water quality&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Monitoring nitrate levels is critical to managing and improving water quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why Deltares, a non-profit research organization based in the Netherlands, teamed up with IBM to enhance and expand the reach of its Aquality app: to find a tech solution that helps farmers monitor nitrate levels and give insights into nutrient losses and local water quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This app, originally created by Deltares, is free for users and can help farmers improve water quality, protect biodiversity, save on fertilizer costs and make farming practices more sustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deltares joined <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">the IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a> to implement a new user interface designed to make the app more accessible for farmers, add more value to the user, and increase adoption. After completing the first phase with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage">the IBM Garage</a>, a new version of the app will become available in the next few months with enhanced user experience, measurement recording and information sharing capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This solution is being developed to support farmers with the intention of using IBM technology, such as artificial intelligence, to provide an easy and accessible platform to engage with other farmers and to share water quality knowledge with communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The main goal is to provide farmers — even those who aren’t the most technologically savvy — with a tool that helps them to optimize their resources, which is advantageous to both the farmer and the planet,” said Joachim Rozemeijer, a water quality researcher at Deltares. “IBM’s technology and expertise has been instrumental in helping us achieve this mission.”&nbsp;</p>



 Improving water quality with human-centered design&nbsp; 



<p>Another key component of the project is the use of <a href="https://medium.com/ibm-ix-northern-europe/accelerating-sustainable-agriculture-by-leveraging-the-power-of-human-centered-design-and-2215cb5a007f">IBM’s Enterprise Design Thinking framework</a> to create value for the business, people and the planet. The framework was applied to assess the app from a user perspective to bring more value to communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve been doing a lot of research, talking to farmers, but also agricultural advisors, people from water authorities, and even researchers who use the app currently,” said Michelle ten Pas, a UX Design Consultant at IBM helping with the redesign of the app. “We translated those needs that we identified through the user research, and we implemented them by redesigning the app in a way that meets their needs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many enhancements have already been made to the usability, accessibility and functionality of the Aquality app. For example, to make it easier to understand how the app works, the team added instructions in the app that explain how to take measurements, which is particularly helpful for first-time users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other new functionalities that the team hopes to add based on farmer feedback include the ability to measure nitrate in soil, adding measurements of phosphate and ammonium in water, setting location labels that can be reused by farmers, enabling users to share measurements within groups to ease collaboration and even adding a page within the app for farmers to order the equipment they need. The new version of the app is expected to go live in the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The global Aquality app user community currently consists of over 600 active users and thousands of direct beneficiaries, in particular in the Netherlands. For example, measurements from the App inform environmental monitoring and management efforts in the provinces of Limburg and Zeeland. Further, the App is now being piloted by users in Denmark, France, South Africa and the United States, which provides an opportunity to continue testing the app with more farmers to increase awareness and address a greater variety of needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Solutions for real-world impact&nbsp; 



<p>To help protect our environment and aid farmers around the world, utilizing sustainable agriculture systems is critical. This project is a great example of how technology and partnerships can help solve some of the most urgent environmental challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What makes me proud about this project is that I can really contribute to something that matters,” said ten Pas. “I think you see a lot that people from my generation are looking for meaning in their work, and something where they can make an impact. And I think this project is exactly that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But progress can’t end here. IBM announced in March that it is currently accepting proposals for its third cohort focused on water management solutions, providing more opportunities to support solutions like the Aquality app. Nonprofit and governmental organizations <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator/water">are encouraged to apply by May 31, 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that provides organizations with scalability, security, availability and performance while keeping their IT infrastructure management needs at bay. It was launched in 2006 as the first AWS service and manages data as objects instead of a file hierarchy or blocks within sectors and tracks.</p>



<p>Amazon S3 provides management features to configure access controls that meet specific business, organizational and compliance requirements, making it customizable. However, AWS S3 does come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to S3 pricing. As AWS S3 usage grows, so does the cost; managing AWS S3 pricing can be complex and frustrating, especially when you’re trying to optimize your business.</p>



 AWS S3 storage classes 



<p>There are a number of S3 storage classes available in AWS S3, including the following:</p>



 
 S3 Standard 



 S3 Intelligent-Tiering 



 S3 Standard-IA 



 S3 One Zone-IA 



 S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval 



 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval 



 3 Glacier Deep Archive 
 



<p>S3 storage classes are designed to cater to different storage use cases depending on how often the storage needs to be accessed and the level of redundancy required. These storage classes are not static and can be updated either manually or via a lifecycle policy. The S3 lifecycle policy allows data to automatically transfer to a different storage class without any changes to the application. However, with so many storage classes available (and each designed for a specific storage use case), it can become challenging to choose the right one and manage them cost-effectively.</p>



 
 S3 Standard: The S3 Standard is the AWS default and the most commonly used storage class, so it is designed for frequently accessed data. It has low latency, high throughput and is highly versatile, making it suitable for many applications. However, it is also the most expensive storage class per GB stored. 



 S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data between frequent-access (FA) and infrequent-access (IA) tiers for cost optimization, making it ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It can seamlessly transfer data to the most cost-effective access tier on a per-object basis, without performance degradation, retrieval fees or operational complexity. 



 S3 Standard-I-A: Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access is a storage class suitable for long-term storage or backups of data that is accessed less frequently than data stored in S3 Standard (but still requires rapid access when needed). It is best for storing data that needs to be available quickly in case of disaster recovery. 



 S3 One Zone-I-A: Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access stores data in a single AWS Availability Zone, making it 20% cheaper than S3 Standard-IA. It’s ideal for users who don’t require the additional protection provided by geographic redundancy. However, it is important to note that it’s not designed to be resilient to the physical loss of an AZ due to a catastrophic event. 



 S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is the most cost-effective archive storage class for long-term data that is rarely accessed but requires quick retrieval. With cost savings of up to 68% compared to S3 Standard-IA when accessed once per quarter, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval offers the same high throughput and quick access as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is ideal for users seeking to save on storage costs without compromising fast retrieval times. 



 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is a low-cost storage option for archive data that is accessed one to two times per year and is retrieved independently. It is similar in capabilities to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval but is up to 10% cheaper. This storage class is ideal for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as in backup or disaster recovery use cases. 



 S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive was designed for long-term retention and preservation of data that is infrequently accessed. It is commonly used for backup, disaster recovery, and regulatory compliance in highly regulated industries. This storage class is ideal for organizations that need to retain data sets for long periods of time without the need for regular access.

 IBM Turbonomic and AWS S3 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> can help organizations navigate the complexity of AWS storage options by providing guidance on how to select the right storage class. Our software can recommend which storage class is best for you based on the expected usage pattern and provide insights into the pricing structure of each class. By doing so, Turbonomic helps organizations avoid overprovisioning resources and overpaying on AWS S3 services, which ultimately leads to cost savings and improved efficiency.</p>



 Optimizing AWS S3 Pricing with Turbonomic 



<p>While AWS S3 storage seems to be remarkably inexpensive at the unit rate level, it’s not—like all cloud solutions it operates in a pay-as-you-go model. If you fail to consider the fully burdened cost of AWS S3 pricing, you could be left with a substantial bill. It’s crucial to understand how each AWS S3 storage class operates before committing to it.</p>



<p>The AWS S3 pricing structure is one of its biggest challenges because it’s complex and difficult to manage. The cost of storing data on Amazon S3 can vary and depends on factors like the amount of data stored, the number of requests made and the geographic region where the data is stored. It’s challenging for many organizations to accurately estimate AWS S3 costs and optimize their spending.</p>



<p>IBM Turbonomic can help manage AWS S3 pricing efficiently and effectively, allowing organizations to focus on innovation and growth. With IBM Turbonomic, organizations gain real-time insights into their AWS S3 usage and spending, allowing them to identify inefficiencies and make data-driven decisions to optimize their usage and costs.</p>



<p>AWS S3 pricing can be particularly challenging to manage when it comes to choosing the right storage class to fit your storage needs while simultaneously minimizing costs. IBM Turbonomic considers your chosen AWS S3 class and generates scaling actions based on your IOPs and throughput to optimize each workload for performance and cost.</p>



<p>The automatable actions that our software generates allow organizations to optimize resource allocation and utilization. IBM Turbonomic identifies any idle or underutilized storage and reclaims it for other workloads, ensuring you only pay for what you need. This allows you to avoid unnecessary spending.</p>



<p>While Amazon S3 is a powerful cloud storage service, its pricing can be complex and challenging to manage. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Turbonomic, organizations can gain better visibility into their Amazon S3 usage and costs and optimize resource allocation and utilization to reduce costs and improve efficiency.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In today's modern work environment, effective management of user identities and access is crucial for securing enterprise applications, systems, and data. As organizations increasingly deploy cloud-based services and resources, managing access has become complex and necessary. As a helpdesk engineer, it’s my responsibility to manage and track access requests from end users. To streamline this process and ensure secure access, I recently deployed an approval-as-code tool, which automates the approval process for access requests and integrates with our existing tools. This will enhance our ability to manage access and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access to critical systems and data.</p> 
 Access Management Challenges  
<p>Traditionally, I provide users with predefined default access based on their roles and responsibilities. Some admin users are provided with full access to core resources on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately, these accounts are potential targets for security breaches.&nbsp; Experian, Uber and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, and many others, were all breached due to hackers, such as the Lapsus$ group, exploiting admin access.</p> 
<p>In some emergency situations, users are provided with elevated access to be able to resolve a critical issue or incident. These requests are largely handled in either tickets or Slack threads. In other words done “by hand”.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some of the challenges I face:</p> 
  
  Inefficiency: Manually managing access can be an inefficient process and mistakes can be made if access is not removed.  
  Compliance challenges: It can be difficult to demonstrate that access controls are being enforced when some users have perpetual admin access.  
  Scaling: As the organization grows and the number of users and resources increases, it becomes more difficult to manage access for a large number of users across many systems. Creating access policies can get complex.  
  
 What Is Approval-As-Code?  
<p>At HYPR, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an already adopted practice to automate and standardize the process of deploying and managing our IT resources. We recently came across a tool that advertises “approval-as-code,” which extends the same principles as Infrastructure as code. With approval-as-code, we can automate and codify approval workflows for elevated access.</p> 
<p>The tool in question is called SYM by a company called <a href="https://symops.com/">SYMOps</a>. Sym allows you to build approval workflows that can be initiated and approved within Slack to dedicated resources defined within the tool.&nbsp; This provides just-in-time access in a manner which is audited and tracked. The current approval flow we have in place:</p> 
  
  End users request access within Slack and are asked  
   
   Which resource they need access to  
   Justification (ticket, incident or reason)  
   Duration of access  
   
  Request is routed to a dedicated Slack channel  
  Designated approvers can either approve or deny the request  
  If approved, the user is provided access to the resource for the duration selected  
  Once the time for the duration expires, access is removed and the user is notified within Slack.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Being that SYM is approval-as-code, we use our current code review process and I can collaborate with my team when building the workflows. The tool itself is managed with Terraform code so you can deploy resources and update the workflows. The approval logic is all defined in Python code so I am able to create custom policies that meet our needs but also help us scale.</p> 
 Deployment&nbsp;  
<p>Now I am not a strong or even an average coder, but the examples and support provided by the SYM team has been invaluable in helping my team and I get this tool off the ground running. No question was too basic or complex for their team as they helped me craft this tool which is now critical for our daily operations.</p> 
<p>SYMops offers multiple out-of-the-box integrations with their Python libraries. With the custom logic, we are taking advantage of the PagerDuty integration. This integration on request checks if the user is on-call in PagerDuty, to assist with&nbsp; “break-glass” access after hours in response to an incident or a page. Here is an example of the code that defines this logic which is also in the examples SYMOps provides:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>https://github.com/symopsio/examples/tree/main/basic/pagerduty_on_call</p> 
 Greater Security, Greater Convenience&nbsp;  
<p>By implementing a tool like SYM on top of our HYPR Passwordless stack, we can improve the speed, tracking and security of our applications, systems and data. Being that the tool is built within Slack allows our organization to easily adopt this process and not impede any critical work or velocity of our teams. Having the elevated access being gated by the approval workflows helps us ensure that there are sufficient guardrails for access controls in place and they are enforced.</p>

 Recap of recent IDnow ‘The State of Micromobility Regulations 2023’ webinar. 



 



<p>Our April webinar, which explored <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">the current state of micromobility regulations</a>, could not have happened at a more interesting time for the industry, following the recent Paris escooter ban.</p>



<p>Moderated by Oliver Bruce, Co-Host of The Micromobility Conference &amp; Podcast, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Usman Abid, Senior Product Manager at Tier, Martin Lefrancq, New Mobility Policy Advisor at Brussels Mobility, Felix Aumair, Head of Customer Success at GoUrban, along with our very own Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow.</p>



 What happens in Paris, stays in Paris? 



<p>With the escooter ban fresh in people’s minds, it was natural for the group to start by sharing their opinions on how it would likely impact the wider micromobility landscape in the rest of Europe.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it was a mixed bag of opinions, with some participants pointing out that it would likely heap additional pressure on mobility operators, who would be forced to play the waiting game while other cities decide whether to follow suit with a ban or not.</p>



<p>Despite the recent happenings in Paris, Michael said that there was no time to waste, and operators should seize the opportunity to enter the growing micromobility industry, “Now is a good chance to invest more and have a bigger focus on these kinds of topics to improve and develop micromobility services in the future.’’</p>



 The relationship between technology and regulations. 



<p>Later in the webinar, Felix and Michael discussed what measures and technology micromobility providers could implement to improve user compliance with regulations and ensure responsible use of their services.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is where IDnow supports many companies – not only in mobility – to give more responsibility to the user because there needs to be rules in place, certain behaviors, certain qualifications to make use of certain services, especially in the mobility sector. But since regulations develop and change, it’s important that providers have flexible solutions.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



 Shaping the future of a safer, more sustainable mobility future. 



<p>Later in the webinar, discussions shifted from regulations to the role that micromobility could play in addressing urban congestion, and how this can be better communicated to policymakers and the public.</p>



<p>Martin mentioned how there have been huge changes over the years regarding sustainable urban mobility in Brussels.</p>



<p>“Micromobility is forecasted to help reduce carbon emissions in our cities by 30-50% by 2030,’’ said Usman.</p>



<p>Before the webinar ended with a Q+A session with the audience, the panel covered the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">key trends and developments</a> that will shape the regulatory landscape in the coming years.</p>



<p>Predictions ranged from the importance of free-floating, dedicated parking zones to why micromobility needs to have a consistent regulatory framework that is only part of a broader ecosystem. Michael said that the very future of cities was dependant on the success of micromobility, citing the need for collaboration between key stakeholders (users, city governance, operators and regulators) to ensure regulations offer a safer and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">balanced mobility experience</a> for everyone.</p>

<p></p><p>The concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) was first proposed in 2015 by Drummond Reed and then became an official W3C standard in July of 2022.</p><p>Adoption has grown quite a bit in the last few years. Here are a few ways they are being used today.</p> Employment Verification<a title="Direct link to Employment Verification">​</a> <p>LinkedIn recently announced a new free <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23679998/linkedin-verification-badge-system-clear-microsoft-entra">verified badge feature</a> that will be used to prove the validity of your employment, education, and other achievements. “The system is backed by decentralized identity and a trust model that involves an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. Organizations can issue cryptographically signed digital IDs, which employees can then use to prove they work at a company…” </p><p>LinkedIn is  using the Self-Sovereign Identity trust model connecting an employee's DID (subject) with their employer's DID (issuer), and LinkedIn as the verifier of the transaction.</p><p></p><p>As for education verification, LinkedIn users can request that their educational institution issue a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) for their degree or certification. The user can then choose to share the credential with employers or other third parties via LinkedIn, who then verifies the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic proofs.</p>  info  <p>DIDs vs VCs: DIDs provide a way to create and manage decentralized identities, whereas VCs provide a way to prove information about those identities in a secure and portable way.</p>   Digital Driver's Licenses<a title="Direct link to Digital Driver's Licenses">​</a> <p>The DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in the United States and in Queensland Australia are piloting a program that involves issuing <a href="https://www.govtech.com/fs/california-moves-to-test-new-digital-drivers-licenses">digital driver's licenses</a> and vehicle registration documents that can be accessed and verified using a mobile app. Digital driver's licenses are cryptographically secured, and the apps can be used to verify the authenticity of the license without the need for physical documents.</p><p>They are doing this with the use of VCs, which are stored on-chain, tamper-proof, and cannot be altered or forged, which ensures the integrity and authenticity of their credentials.</p><p>The main component of VCs are DIDs, see here for example:</p>   <code>curl -X PUT -d '{<br>  "data": {<br>    "givenName": "Alice",<br>      "employedAt": "2022-08-20T13:20:10.000+0000"<br>  },<br>  "issuer": "did:key:z6MkpEQY4FCCtJEVpZ6gGK541fYWynH2ya7D1RikTGfdydCF",<br>  "subject": "did:key:z6MkqcFHFXqzsYyDYrEUA2pVCfQGJz2rYoCZy5WWszzSW3o6",<br>  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",<br>  "expiry": "2051-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",<br>  "schema": "b28feb61-e0b8-454a-86ed-d487a46e8584"<br>}' http://localhost:8080/v1/credentials<br></code>     <p>As you can see there are two DIDs used, one for an Issuer (DMV) and one for a subject (Drivers License recipient, Alice). </p><p>This program will lead to faster and more efficient services for customers, as well as improved security and fraud prevention.</p> COVID Digital Health Apps<a title="Direct link to COVID Digital Health Apps">​</a> <p>IBM used VCs as a key component in its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/resources/digital-health-pass-blockchain-explained/">Digital Health Pass</a> solution to enable individuals to securely and privately present their COVID vaccination status to third parties - such as concert venues and stadium events.</p><p>When an individual needs to prove if they are vaccinated, they can simply present their VC to a verifier (e.g., baseball stadium), who then verifies the authenticity of the credential and the accuracy of the information it contains using cryptographic proofs. </p><p>There are several benefits to DIDs and VCs in this use case including privacy protection, security, and efficiency. This simple interaction now allows individuals to maintain control over their personal health information. For example, all they need to disclose is true/false (vaccinated or not) versus a more detailed health record. </p><p>Overall, the use of VCs and DIDs in the IBM Digital Health Pass provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for individuals to prove their health status, which was essential for enabling safe travel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Social Media<a title="Direct link to Social Media">​</a> <p>Even social media applications are embracing the use of decentralized identifiers. Bluesky is a new social platform that serves as a reference implementation of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">AT Protocol</a>, a federated protocol for large-scale social applications. Instead of usernames that are specific to and owned by the application, BlueSky instead uses domain names for identity (e.g. alice.bsky.social). Unbeknownst to most users, these domain names are associated with a DID for the user.</p><p></p><p>These persistent DIDs enable users to migrate their account data to any other applications that utilize the AT Protocol - therefore giving users more control and ownership over their content.</p> Future of Decentralized Identity<a title="Direct link to Future of Decentralized Identity">​</a> <p>These companies are embracing the use of decentralized technology for identity management and verification at a massive scale. As this technology continues to mature, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of DIDs in various industries.</p><p>Want to learn more about DIDs and VCs?

<p>Secure remote access is a method that lets authorized users access a private network as if they were on-premises with that network.</p>
<p>This includes accessing systems, resources, and data the user could access where they logged in on the private system.</p>
<p>While remote access was relatively common in business sectors for the past decade, the onset of COVID and work-from-home situations expanded this kind of technology even further. Now, remote access is used for everyday work, managing remote systems, or performing IT support for end users.</p>
<p>Key components of secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Authentication: Users must provide valid credentials through various methods, including usernames and passwords, biometrics, or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication-best-practices/">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>. 
 Access Control: Administrators can implement access control policies to restrict user access to specific resources, applications, or systems based on their roles and responsibilities. 
 Encryption: Data transmitted between the remote user and the target system is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. This is often done through protocols like Secure Shell/Transport Security Layer (SSH/TLS) that support strong encryption and tunneling. 
 System Security: Servers, network devices, and endpoint devices must remain secure. Otherwise, they will compromise the integrity of the overall access solution. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Using a Secure Remote Access Solution? 
<p>Secure remote access offers several benefits for businesses, organizations, and individuals, including:</p>
 
 Security: First and foremost, secure remote access allows users to connect to sensitive systems and data wherever they are. The value of this kind of remote access in a modern, decentralized world cannot be understated. 
 Compliance: Secure remote access can play a major role in compliance efforts. Most frameworks and regulations have some requirements on how users access systems–requirements that include authentication, authorization, and encryption. Secure remote access checks these boxes. 
 Flexibility: Secure remote access allows employees to work more flexibly, accommodating various schedules and time zones. This means more productivity, more variation in where your company can hire, simplified collaboration between remote teams, and reduced office space and equipment costs. 
 Scalability: Secure remote access can quickly scale to accommodate the growth of an organization, particularly its workforce, allowing new users and resources to be added with minimal effort. 
 Centralized Security and Operations: IT administrators can manage remote devices, install updates, and troubleshoot issues remotely and en masse, ensuring that all systems get the same level of attention. 
 
<p>By providing secure access to resources and systems from remote locations, secure remote access offers numerous advantages in terms of productivity, cost savings, flexibility, and security.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Remote Secure Access? 
<p>There are several types of remote secure access solutions available to accommodate the varying needs of organizations and individuals. Some popular solutions include:</p>
 
 Virtual Private Network (VPN): VPNs are secured and persistent connections (private networks) that can extend to users such that they have full access to secure system resources. These networks work through a combination of technologies, including all those listed previously. 
 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that functions like a VPN but allows the user to access a single system rather than an entire network. 
 Secure Shell/Transport Layer Security (SSH/TLS): SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure remote access through “tunneling.” TLS is the protocol that supersedes SSH. 
 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): VDI is a technology that provides remote access to virtual desktops hosted on a centralized server. Users can access their virtual desktops from any device with an internet connection. 
 Remote Support Software: There exist additional tools that IT support services can use by requiring end users to install a client app that can facilitate secure system sharing between the two. These solutions have also become somewhat popular in instances of digital fraud. 
 Cloud-Based Solutions: Cloud-based remote access solutions leverage cloud infrastructure to provide secure remote access. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) WorkSpaces and Google Cloud’s Compute Engine. 
 
<p>Each remote secure access solution has its unique features and uses cases. Organizations should carefully assess their needs and requirements before selecting the appropriate solution to ensure security, scalability, and ease of use.</p>
 Are Their Problems Using Secure Remote Access? 
<p>Although secure remote access solutions provide numerous benefits, they also introduce some risks and challenges that organizations must address to ensure the security of their networks and data.</p>
<p>Some of the risks associated with secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Unauthorized Access: If an attacker gains access to a remote user’s credentials or devices, they may be able to access sensitive resources and systems. Since the solution assumes the user is legitimate, they will have full access to any system the user would have access to. 
 Endpoint Security: Security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the case of remote access, this is typically user security. An unsecured laptop or mobile device can open up a vulnerability in the network that admins cannot plan for. 
 Insider Threats: Much like endpoint security, insider threats are hard to fight since they are, for all intents and purposes, legitimate users. An insider with remote access can gain control of sensitive resources. 
 Data Leakage: Data transmitted over insecure networks or stored on remote devices can be intercepted, stolen, or manipulated by malicious actors. This can lead to data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and damage to the organization’s reputation. 
 Compliance: Organizations must ensure that their remote access solutions comply with relevant regulations and industry standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA. 
 
<p>Organizations should implement robust security measures to mitigate these risks. One such approach is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-best-practices/">zero-trust architecture</a> that can address typical attacks as well as user-based vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Businesses rely every day on various systems and pieces of equipment to keep their operations running smoothly. But all systems inevitably require upkeep. It could be intangible software, like an IT service network that has accumulated enough bugs to break an important feature, sending developers scrambling for a fix. Or it could be a piece of physical equipment, like an ice cream machine in a fast food restaurant with a broken o-ring.</p>



<p>Eventually, everything breaks down, from multi-site IT systems down to individual light bulbs. Unplanned downtime can have catastrophic consequences, and it’s up to facility maintenance engineers and technicians to plan ahead so that swift measures are taken to rectify a failure. The goal is to minimize downtime, reducing the costs associated with lost productivity, revenue or customer dissatisfaction.</p>



<p>Downtime can be minimized in many ways. For example, businesses can aim to reduce the amount of time it takes to repair a piece of equipment by having sufficient replacement parts accessible to technicians on-site. Or, they can observe repair processes to find faster ways to perform repairs or quicker ways to notify technicians. Even further, they can make investments in better-performing tools with longer lifespans to reduce the number of repairs needed.</p>



<p>But in order to understand how to improve the reliability of systems and components, we first must be able to measure their reliability. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mttr">Mean time to repair (MTTR)</a>—also known as mean time to recovery—and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mtbf">mean time between failures (MTBF)</a> are two failure metrics commonly used to measure the reliability of systems or products within the field of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/facilities-maintenance">facilities maintenance</a>. While these acronyms are related, they have different meanings and are used to answer different questions.</p>



<p>First, let’s review MTBF.&nbsp;</p>



 What is mean time between failures (MTBF)? 



<p>MTBF is a key performance indicator (KPI) that represents the average time between two consecutive failures of a system or product. MTBF is a measure of reliability, and it is commonly used in the context of warranties, maintenance planning and product development. Note that MTBF, which refers to repairable items, is not to be confused with the closely related term, mean time to failure, (MTTF), which refers to assets that are non-repairable and need to be replaced rather than repaired.</p>



<p>The MTBF calculation uses the following formula:</p>



<p>MTBF = Total operating time / Number of failures over a given period</p>



<p>So, for example, if a product is used for 1,000 hours and it fails 3 times during that period, the MTBF would be: 1000 hours / 3 failures = 333.3 hours</p>



<p>This means that on average, the product can be expected to fail after 333.3 hours of use.</p>



<p>MTBF is useful in determining the expected lifetime of a product and can help manufacturers plan for maintenance or replacement. However, it does not take into account how much time it takes to repair a product after it fails, which can be an important consideration in some applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s where MTTR comes in.&nbsp;</p>



 What is mean time to repair (MTTR)?&nbsp; 



<p>MTTR is the average time it takes to repair a system or product after it has failed. MTTR is used to measure the reliability of a system or product from a repair standpoint. MTTR typically includes the time it takes to notify maintenance teams, allow equipment to cool down for repair, fix the issue, reassemble any relevant equipment or systems and test before restarting production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of MTTR is to minimize the downtime caused by failures and reduce the costs associated with repairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to calculate MTBF:</p>



<p>MTTR = Total downtime / Total number of failures over a specific time</p>



<p>For example, if over the last year, a system failed 5 times, resulting in 10 total hours of downtime (including repair time), the MTTR would be: 10 hours / 5 repairs = 2 hours</p>



<p>This means that on average, it takes two hours to repair the system after a failure occurs.</p>



<p>MTTR is useful in determining the efficiency of maintenance operations and can help identify areas where improvements can be made.&nbsp;</p>



 Differences between MTBF and MTTR 



<p>Mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) answer different questions and have different applications. MTBF and MTTR exist in a family of KPIs that include mean time to respond, mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to acknowledge (MTTA), among others.</p>



<p>MTBF is a measure of how long a system or product is expected to operate before it fails, and it is used to plan for maintenance or replacement. MTTR is a measure of how long it takes to repair a system or product after it fails, and it is used to minimize downtime and reduce repair costs.</p>



<p>MTBF does not take into account the period of time it takes to repair a product after it fails, while MTTR does not take into account the total time between failures.&nbsp;</p>



 How MTBF and MTTR work together 



<p>Across many use cases, both metrics may be used in tandem to get a more complete picture of the overall maintainability of a system or product. For example, in a manufacturing plant, MTBF might be used to determine the expected lifetime of a machine and plan for replacement, while MTTR might be used to optimize maintenance schedules for that machine and maximize total uptime. In the context of software development, MTBF might be used to measure the stability of a system and plan for updates or bug fixes, while MTTR might be used to optimize the development process and reduce the time it takes to fix issues.</p>



 Manage assets to improve MTBF and MTTR 



<p>Improving MTBF and MTTR to reduce downtime can be a complex process that involves identifying and addressing the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root causes</a> of system failures, optimizing maintenance operations and implementing improvements in design and manufacturing processes.</p>



<p>Today, large organizations use Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) to help them manage their maintenance processes. A CMMS typically offers features like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/work-order">work order</a> management, preventative maintenance scheduling, inventory management, asset management and reporting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Maximo is enterprise asset management software that includes comprehensive CMMS capabilities. Maximo is a single, integrated cloud-based platform that uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, IoT and analytics to optimize performance, extend the lifecycle of assets and reduce the costs of outages. A related tool, IBM Instana Observability, offers full-stack observability, with the goal of helping users optimize and democratize incident prevention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these products will give you the visibility into your assets and operations that you’ll need to make smarter, data-driven decisions, ultimately resulting in fewer breakdowns and less downtime.</p>

 Open banking is een vrijwel onuitputtelijk onderwerp van speculaties en voorspellingen gebleken. Nu PSD2 de weg heeft vrijgemaakt voor Europa om deel te nemen aan de open-banking-revolutie, zullen we in 2023 mogelijk het eerste concrete bewijs zien van een disruptie op de markt.

<p>Open banking is een vrijwel onuitputtelijk onderwerp van speculaties en voorspellingen gebleken. Nu PSD2 de weg heeft vrijgemaakt voor Europa om deel te nemen aan de open-banking-revolutie, zullen we in 2023 mogelijk het eerste concrete bewijs zien van een disruptie op de markt. Daarom belooft 2023 een spannend jaar te worden voor zowel voorstanders als sceptici.</p>

 Recap of IDnow’s recent ‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar. 



 



<p>To coincide with crypto’s busy few days in April, when the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> was finally <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">given the green light</a> by the European Parliament, we hosted a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/identity-verification-kyc-aml-requirements/">‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar</a>, exploring the likely ramifications of the regulatory framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderated by Jennifer Hanley Giersch at ALL AML GmbH, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank, and Peter Müller, Financial Crime Officer at UBS, along with our very own Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs and Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</p>



<p>Watch highlights below:</p>



 



 

 



 MiCA: KYC and AML’s most important development for 2023? 



<p>The session strarted with predictions from the group as to what is likely to be the main driving force for developments in the KYC and AML space. Unsurprisingly, considering it was finally ratified by the EU in April, Rayissa touched upon the potential of MiCA.</p>



<p>“To harmonize regulations across an ecosystem is an ambitious project. The unification and transparency that is supposed to come out of MiCA is really important. One of those crucial steps is to enable KYC to do its job and foster trust in this ecosystem,” said Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>Jason agreed, explaining how MiCA would provide important guidelines that crypto exchanges and crypto entities would need to follow to ensure they do not run afoul of money laundering risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a great development for the industry because with clarity brings the ability for obliged entities to do the right thing, and implement the right technologies, controls, and internal processes to meet MiCA’s requirements,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed during the session, including the larger upcoming European Commission’s legislative proposal known as the AML/CFT package.</p>



 When together is not always better.  



<p>While there was a general consensus that the combined EU approach to regulatory requirements and policy was a positive thing, Nico did warn that this is not always the case.&nbsp;He said that while a common financial market policy in the banking sector exists in the European Union, there is no common policy that translates into a common implementation of AML/ CFT rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This means that practices are divergent across countries, and this is to the benefit of those that don’t want to comply with the legislation, because the system from a European perspective is only as strong as the weakest link.</p>Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank</blockquote>



<p>Nico went on to use the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20is%20a%20process%20that,element%20throughout%20the%20customer%20relationship.">Know Your Customer (KYC) process</a> as an example, and said that although there are common rules for the onboarding of clients, when it comes to effective controls, each member state does it differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed in the lively session, from the impact of regulations on unhosted wallets and decentralized ecosystems, to ways of changing the perception of crypto as an increasing risk for sources of wealth, the topic of KYC and MiCA was never far away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we are going to have a successful crypto hub – wherever that is, then we need to instil certain rules and regulations that enable a functioning and healthy ecosystem, and KYC will be integral part in facilitating this,” added Rayissa.</p>

<p>A global fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) enterprise needed to modernize its product portfolio, focusing on high-growth categories like pet care, coffee and consumer health. Its aggressive sustainability goals included achieving net zero emissions by 2050, making all packaging reusable or recyclable by 2025 and investing more than USD 3 billion globally over several years to drive momentum. Along the way, it needed to transform its organizational footprint, technology architecture and workplace culture—all sustainably.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting™ helped the customer modernize its architecture for a heavily used business-to-business conversational AI app. IBM’s recommendations included API-specific improvements, bot UX optimization, workflow optimization, DevOps microservices and design consideration, and best practices for Azure manage services. After getting familiar with the app architecture, priorities and requirements, IBM provided a detailed trade-offs analysis, including improvement options and security and cost implications.</p>



<p>The need to digitally transform touches every organization, in every industry. As a result, increasing numbers of organizations are migrating their information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures to the public cloud, shifting workloads from on-premises to remote data centers and modernizing their application estates. While this trend is driving growth in the global cloud market, it’s also drawing increased scrutiny to the environmental impacts of data centers.</p>



<p>Currently, data centers are a significant source of organizations’ energy usage and carbon emissions. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/it-sustainability">According to the IT Sustainability Beyond the Data Center report from the IBM Institute for Business Value, some estimates suggest that there has been a 43% absolute increase in the power capacity demand by data center operators between 2018 and 2021, and that the global data center market will grow by more than 30% between 2021 and 2027.</a> That’s why IBM is working with Microsoft to help organizations lower their ICT footprint through sustainable cloud modernization and full-lifecycle cloud carbon accounting.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/omv-ibm-consulting-sap/">Learn how an international leading oil and gas company is driving its goal of net zero operations by 2050</a>



 A framework for success based on a shared blueprint 



<p>With IBM Consulting and Microsoft Tools and Services, customers can leverage the core strengths and latest innovations of both organizations as they move forward with cloud modernization. Along with Azure-managed services to help streamline workloads across the enterprise, customers can use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard">Emissions Impact Dashboard</a>, a Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability solution, to search for ways to reduce emissions specifically related to their usage of Microsoft cloud services.</p>



<p>The dashboard aims to provide easy-to-understand data visualizations, report preparation and baseline accounting of their cloud-usage-based greenhouse gas emissions. The tool identifies carbon-intensive usage areas (or “hotspots”) and analyzes potential changes in emissions over time as enterprises migrate workloads and rearchitect applications. It can also help organizations plan for the future by forecasting how emissions may change as Microsoft moves forward with its mission to power operations through 100% renewable energy sources.</p>



<p>Based on IBM’s extensive modernization consulting knowledge, our professionals work with organizations to determine the best opportunities and target application architectures to deliver benefits throughout the entire application lifecycle. IBM’s modernization strategy starts with a solid understanding of business needs and the existing application landscape, including the precise number and function of apps and interdependencies.</p>



<p>Using both manual and automated tools to assess the landscape and operations, IBM Consulting guides enterprises as they map their modernization journeys. This includes outlining desired business outcomes, an implementation roadmap, target architecture, sustainability targets and outcomes, and required employee skillsets and business operating models. During the assessment, IBM will position 60+ cloud modernization design principles mapped to different Azure services based on different dispositions like rehost, replatform, refactor or rearchitect. Suggested services are aligned to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/">Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework</a>, a set of Green IT recommendations for optimizing Azure workloads that was developed in partnership with the Green Software Foundation.</p>



 Refactoring monolithic apps to microservices in Azure Kubernetes Service  



<p>Organizations are moving from traditional application development to cloud-native development (microservices) to help alleviate pain points like application inefficiency, high energy consumption when running monolithic (self-contained) apps on premises and fractured application ecosystems (as opposed to integrated environments enabled by cloud-native containers). Learn more about the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/cloud-native-apps/">benefits of cloud-native development</a>.</p>



<p>Approaching these challenges and achieving goals at the unique scale required for each organization requires both a modernization roadmap and a timeframe. In our engagements, we use benchmarking, templates, virtualization and detailed analysis of technical capacities (such as network latencies) to streamline the journey.</p>



<p>Eventually we recommend replacing physical servers or storage with managed Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) solutions to help reduce energy and resource consumption through centralized cloud governance aligned to the customer’s security principles.&nbsp;</p>



 Better together: IBM sustainability design principles with Azure-managed services 



<p>The beauty of modernization that targets common infrastructure attributes like reliability, scalability, usability and security is that these all may lead to environmental benefits. <a>For this modernization, IBM’s proposed sustainability design principles (such as cluster auto-scaling , serverless architecture for data sync from SAP workload to Conversational AI platform and chatty I/O antipatterns) and corresponding Azure services (such as Azure Kubernetes Services, Azure Function, </a><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/">Azure Resource Manager</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-sql/database">Azure SQL Database</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db">Azure Cosmos DB</a>) can potentially help customers reduce carbon footprint and advance sustainability efforts by minimizing impact in many areas. These include:</p>



 
 Server- and application-related resource and energy usage 



 Latency and network congestion (saving energy by speeding response times) 



 Physical resource requirements 



 Maintenance overhead (saving resource and energy usage) 



 Manual errors that can necessitate repetitive operational overhead 



 Network and database loads (enabling smaller databases) 



 Resource-intensive duplication (speeding communication between dependent APIs) 



 Latency (improving efficiency at massive scale) 



 Development dependencies (freeing organizations to choose sustainable technology and granular scaling)&nbsp; 
 



 What else can be gained with cloud modernization? 



<p>Organizations that move forward with implementing strategies for sustainability capitalize on the operational, cost, resource utilization and competitive benefits of solution features like load-based “just in time” scaling, offerings of managed services like Azure, cloud data center proximity and database right-sizing through caching.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting’s “Green IT” framework and Microsoft Tools and Services for Sustainability work together to assess workloads, identify optimization levers that can help lower energy consumption and create an application modernization roadmap that enables you to achieve sustainability goals.</p>

A name is public, globally unique, and verifiable. </p>  Public - viewable by everyone  Globally unique - cannot be duplicated  Verifiable - possible to prove control of the name using a DID. Examples of verifiable names include DNS hosts and domains, email addresses, social media handles, public keys, HTTP URLs, SSNs, and more.  <blockquote>"A DID is not a name, but all NNS names have at least one valid DID."</blockquote> What is NNS? <p>It is a way to map names to data securely.</p> How Does it Work? <p>Step 1: Select a did:method</p><p>This could be did:ens, did:DNS did:twitter, etc.</p><p>Step 2: Fetch the TXT record for your did:method and find the public key</p><p>Step 3: Input the name and DID data in the NNS form</p>  Name (the name you are assigning to the content)  Issuer (the DID)  Fact Type (DNS link, Mastodon server, etc.)  Fact Value (the pointer to that fact type)  <p>Step 4: Generate a UCAN out of that data</p>  DID for Private Key  UCAN  Signature  <p>Step 5: Store in NNS DHT (shown in Blaine's demo in the recording)</p><p>Step 6: Fetch the record(s) for the name from the DHT and use the data in the UCAN</p><p>Since a name is tied to a specific DID, and the DID is self-validating, there is no way to manipulate a name you don't have control over. We enable authentication (DID) and authorization (UCAN) in a distributed P2P system and create a DHT by storing the UCAN in NNS, thus opening up many exciting possibilities. &nbsp;</p> What Problems Does NNS Help Solve? <p>Discoverability - NNS helps users find other users' public keys without knowing the DID method they used to generate them. It also allows the user to find where another user shares content tied to that DID. </p><p>Encrypted Chat - NNS can be a mechanism for enabling encrypted communication</p><p>IPFS Search - If you want to know where someone's IPFS-hosted blog exists, finding it can be very difficult if you don't know the CID. NNS helps locate specific content by its name, which is much more human-readable and easier to remember.</p><p>Package Naming - Similar to IPFS Search, NNS makes locating specific Wasm code easier through package naming.</p> What is NNS Not? <p>It's not a petname system. Petnames don't cross connectivity or trust barriers. In a local-first future, we need names to help us continue working offline and ensure we interact with the person/data we intend.</p><p>It's not a way to prove ownership of a name (that's what the DIDs are for!). It helps you discover those proofs.</p><p>It's not a new namespace. </p><p>It's not guaranteed to be globally consistent.</p><p>It's not a blockchain.</p> Possibilities <p>It can bring together all existing standards in one place instead of trying to create a new standard.</p>XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/927">https://xkcd.com/927/</a><p>It could replace IPNS and DNSLink by improving latency and security. Yes, a decentralized DNS!</p><p>Currently, there are several ways to link DNS names to the decentralized web, but virtually no options link email, social handles, HTTP, etc.</p><p>We could enable permissionless usage of names that we don't own using NNS by signing a proof that we own an email address (for example) even if that email is from a centralized service that hasn't enabled interactions with some new decentralized service. </p> Next Steps <p>This work is in the beginning/experimental stages, and many questions still need to be answered. We also need to solve for latency and locality and ensure a degree of consistency. </p><p>Here's the recording of Blaine's presentation at IPFS Thing 2023.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about NNS, you can review the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/nns-the-name-name-system/3684">spec</a> and join our monthly <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan?tk=I52b5p">UCAN community calls</a>. </p><p> </p>

  The G7 is pushing for increased oversight of P2P cryptocurrency transactions through the&nbsp;FATF.  Authorities insist that the proposed regulatory changes could lead to a safer and more transparent cryptocurrency market, fostering wider adoption.  These stricter regulations raise concerns about privacy rights and could increase costs for crypto service providers.  <p>Cryptocurrencies have surged onto the global stage, carving out a significant niche in an increasingly digital world. However, the rapid expansion of this relatively nascent market has also been accompanied by notable challenges.</p><p>The Group of Seven (G7), recognizing these challenges, is now pushing for improved oversight of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. And although this call to action has its share of potential benefits, it also underscores the complex realities of&nbsp;change.</p> A Significant Shift <p>The G7’s call for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to intensify its scrutiny signals a significant shift in global regulatory focus.</p><p>The FATF, an intergovernmental body known for setting global standards against illicit financial activities, currently only supervises transactions that go through crypto service providers. By extending this oversight to include peer-to-peer transactions, the G7 aims to cast a broader safety net over the global crypto landscape.</p><p>This proposition comes at a pivotal moment as digital currencies continue to gain traction worldwide, with regulators insisting that a robust regulatory framework is not just essential anymore — it’s imperative.</p><p>Authorities believe enhanced oversight could curb illicit activities, strengthen overall market confidence and security, spur trust among users and potential investors, and set the stage for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>More on the topic: G7’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p> The Flip&nbsp;Side <p>This regulatory coin involves striking a delicate balance between increased oversight and the sanctity of user privacy — a valued feature that has been central to the appeal of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While necessary for mitigating risks, regulations may impinge on the freedom and privacy that crypto users have come to appreciate.</p><p>Also, the increased costs for crypto service providers to adhere to new regulations could indirectly affect the users. While some view these potential costs as necessary for the sector’s evolution, others fear it could hamper innovation and growth in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Balancing these aspects — privacy, security, and cost — will be a crucial part of the regulatory evolution.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule — Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p> Final Note <p>While the G7 calls for enhanced oversight of individual cryptocurrency transactions is a significant step towards a safer and more transparent crypto ecosystem, it is essential to tread carefully.</p><p>The crypto landscape is a complex and rapidly evolving one, and ensuring its sustainable growth requires a regulatory approach that considers all sides of the equation.</p><p>The crypto world is on the brink of significant changes, but with careful consideration and balance, these changes could pave the way for a brighter crypto&nbsp;future.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

Are passkeys now here to stay? What will help adoption? Will attacks on passkeys start to increase along with usage rates? Will attacks against existing MFA forms including SIM swap, MFA fatigue and social engineering be a compelling event to improve adoption?</p>

<p>Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is a critical requirement for organizations. In the past we’ve talked about the need for CLM <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/05/the-speed-of-business-is-fast-is-your-pki-keeping-up/">due to CA sprawl and concerns around legacy PKI</a>, and it being a means to rein that in and centralize certificates across environments. We also know that the number of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/12/the-trend-continues-organizations-are-managing-and-issuing-more-certificates-than-ever/">machine identities are on the rise</a> and in addition to the sheer number of machine identities that need to be managed, they also bring complexities – such as short-life certificates – that make manual processes unsustainable.</p>
<p>While those are excellent reasons to invest in a proper CLM tool, let’s talk a bit more about the role of CLM in relation to overall IT strategy – like implementing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and preparing for post-quantum.</p>
<p>Zero Trust</p>
<p>Digital certificates provide identity to people and machines, such as mobile devices, virtual machines, and IoT devices. Those certificates need to be issued by a PKI/certificate authority, which will then be able to verify that thing and give it access, whether that’s allowing someone access to your network, or servers talking to one another.</p>
<p>The part where CLM comes in as an important component of your overall Zero Trust strategy is in making sure you have strong issuance protection for your certificates. Essentially making sure no rogue certificates get issued giving too much access or privilege. This same reasoning applies to the need for control at any stage in the lifecycle of a certificate, like revocation.</p>
<p>Going one step further, here’s how CLM helps enforce the principles of Zero Trust:</p>
 
 Verify Explicitly – Making sure the right certificate is provisioned to the correct endpoint/target 
 Least Privilege – Providing the right assurance and access/privilege, by picking the correct certificate and lifecycle controls to be able to issue and manage it 
 Assume Breach – The ability to contain an attack and limit the loss and damage by revoking certificates (incident response) 
 
<p>Post-Quantum </p>
<p>When it comes to post-quantum preparedness, there is a looming <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">threat to existing cryptography</a>, which means organizations need to take steps today to prepare for the migration to quantum-safe cryptography. One of the first steps in that preparation is to have visibility into your cryptographic assets – from hardware and software to keys, certificates, and secrets.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways CLM can help:</p>
 
 Inventory. With robust discovery capabilities, CLM tools can help centralize the visibility of certificates across environments, from different certification authorities, so you know what credentials you have and where. 
 Identify Weak Cryptography. Is your cryptography up to date? Do you have hard-coded algorithms?<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/"> Are you crypto-agile</a>? The right tools can identity any risks you might have with your cryptography so you can remediate in advance of preparing for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 
 Consolidation. Going back to a core use of CLM – reining in the CA sprawl – it can be a tool to help migrate and consolidate your PKI footprint, making the transition to PQC much easier. 
 Automation. With the growth in the number of certificates organizations are managing, and the complexities of IT landscapes, organizations are looking for automation. There’s too much to manage and it’s too great of a risk to not have, making it a necessity. Pairing that with the migration challenge of PQC, automation will be a key ingredient to successful implementations.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Hamzat and I am an Ontology harbinger.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am a quiet and simple person in general. However, I get things done quickly when something piques my interest. My strength is my ability to work really well within a team. I like to have an impact on the success of my team, therefore, I work hard and contribute many of my own&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering before starting my career. My hobbies include reading, traveling, and going on adventures. If I could have a superpower, it would be to be positioned whereby I can do things that make me happy and support humanity each and every day without having to worry about financial implications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology as a harbinger in 2017 to help others to understand and contribute to the company’s vision and mission. My role is to provide support for Ontology’s English-speaking community members. This involves providing members with information on the Ontology project or assisting them with any questions they might have. I also run a procurement company (BitKong General Merchandise) aside from volunteering with Ontology.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has been well-funded from the start and devoid of any crypto drama. As a project, it places huge value on its community and acts on any community feedback related to the Ontology product offering. Ontology is wholly dedicated to building the most impactful thing for the crypto space — a framework for Decentralized Identity Management, and this is something that sets it apart as a Web3&nbsp;project.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Although I don’t have an active part in developing the Ontology project, I enjoy supporting the success of the project through my role. I contribute to building a community with a rich knowledge of the Ontology project, disseminating any information, and offering support to&nbsp;users.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>I am very grateful for the time spent working with Ontology. While it has been a tough journey, it has sharpened my perception as an individual. Also, being able to provide support to other people, irrespective of their background, and being recognized for my efforts frequently, is very fulfilling for&nbsp;me.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about being able to contribute to the growth of the Ontology community and provide much-needed support to the ever-growing network of Ontology members. I have seen how Ontology has succeeded in recent years as a decentralized identity provider and how the project has grown steadily, so I am very excited to see how it&nbsp;expands.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I expect Ontology to be very successful in the next five years and to become a dominant force to contend with in the industry. I think it will outpace its competitors with its data privacy protection products and decentralized identity management tools, and thus, become a widely adopted Web3 project with a high price appreciation for its native&nbsp;token.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-hamzat-5f01a23ee227">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Hamzat</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Securing access to data and applications has become a cornerstone of any modern cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>User access governance projects however have a history of incurring multi-year roll-outs and requiring specialized personnel, making many companies shy away and bear excessive cyber risk.</p>
<p>For those companies, approaching user access governance as a data problem can provide the answer. This approach effectively trims down user access governance to its essentials: low-effort data collection, user-friendly risk analytics, access reviews and plugging into the existing ITSM processes. This data-driven approach has the potential to let companies achieve mature access governance in a matter of days, not months.</p>
<p>In this session, Elimity CEO Maarten will give an overview of the essentials of user access governance and will showcase how this approach is successfully applied in practice by industry leaders such as <a href="https://www.securitas.com/">Securitas</a>, <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/">the Belgian Railroads</a> and <a href="https://www.federale.be/">Federale Assurances</a>.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mature-access-governance-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The digital-first customer experience and remote-first workforce pushed zero trust from buzzword to reality. And yet, much of the conversation is still heavy on theory and light on practice. Cyentia completed a global study of high-level practices which measurably contribute to a more successful cybersecurity program based on a rigorous survey of nearly 5,000 practitioners. Within that study, we analyzed commonalities of organizations implementing and operating Zero Trust. Let's look closely at where we are today.</p>
<p>Now imagine it is 2028. You’re five years into your Zero Trust transformation. People like it and usability has improved. Defensibility is better, too, with a number of attacks having been stopped over the past couple years. But then, in 2028, you get the call. There’s been a security breach. What happened!? This session will explore the future with a pre-mortem on how breaches will look under a Zero Trust architecture.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-five-years-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Regulatory bodies, government agencies, and CIOs are mandating Zero Trust as a cyber security framework. What does Zero Trust mean for your security strategy? With a Zero Trust security model, nobody is trusted automatically, even when they’ve cleared the perimeter. Instead, all identities are verified, minimum access is granted based on context, and activities are monitored to make sure controls are working as expected. The Zero Trust model requires multiple security controls throughout an IT environment to protect and manage identities, devices, networks, applications, and data. This session will take you through the reality check of where Zero Trust started, how it has evolved over the years and what does it really mean for your organization today.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beyond-zero-trust-zero-friction-eic2023"></a>

We will discuss various technical components that may be employed and what is required — and more importantly what is not? We will also present how decentralized trust solutions can support the trust of objects that have nothing to do with human identity, but are necessary to create a digital trust landscape that enables digital transactions to happen seamlessly, efficiently, and automatically.<br> <br> We’ll also touch on how the traditional identity solutions and emerging decentralization can co-exist in context appropriate settings.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-rage-eic2023"></a>

Most frequently encountered are probably “user” and “identity” - do they represent the same type of entity or is a difference intended?

   Traditional network security focuses on perimeter defenses, but many organisations, systems and processes no longer have a clearly defined network perimeter.    To protect a modern digital enterprise, companies need a comprehensive strategy for securely accessing their IT resources (e.g. applications, physical access control systems, portals, data resources, and devices) wherever they are located.

  <p>Traditional network security focuses on perimeter defenses, but many organisations, systems and processes no longer have a clearly defined network perimeter.<br> <br> To protect a modern digital enterprise, companies need a comprehensive strategy for securely accessing their IT resources (e.g. applications, physical access control systems, portals, data resources, and devices) wherever they are located.<br> <br> APIs in supply chains and cyber-physical systems (CPS) are proliferating exponentially across the technology landscape, creating a huge attack surface that security teams struggle to understand and defend.<br> <br> Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) refers to security concepts and threat models that no longer assume that actors, systems or services operating within the security perimeter are automatically trusted, but instead must verify everything and everyone who attempts to connect via an API to their systems resources before granting access.<br> <br> Hence, ZTA is an important design philosophy to establish security mechanisms at the API layer of each individual IT resource for increasing API Endpoint Security in both, corporate infrastructures and open systems. Identity and authorization credentials as well as policies are a key enabler of securing the API endpoints.<br> <br> These different ZTA approaches include:<br> <br> 1) ZTA Using Enhanced Identity Governance, <br> 2) ZTA Using Micro-Segmentation, and<br> 3) ZTA Using Network Infrastructure and Software Defined Perimeters.<br> <br> Our presentation will demonstrate how Trust Frameworks and Identity Governance (1) are the foundational layer for a credentialing infrastructure. With this layer in place credentials can be used enable SW-defined perimeters (3). <br> <br> We will provide in-depth insides how ecosystems solutions such as the Open Credentialing Initiative and Gaia-X are applying design patters using decentralized identity and verifiable credentials for (3).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-api-endpoint-security-eic2023"></a>

  <p>PAM (Privileged Access Management) is one of the established core disciplines within IAM. PAM also is the IAM discipline that is changing most from what it has been in the past.</p>
<p>On one hand, there is the impact of CIEM &amp; DREAM, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management or Dynamic Resource Entitlement &amp; Access Management. This is about the expansion of PAM beyond humans accessing servers and selected applications towards any type of human and non-human (silicon) identity accessing any type of workload, from servers to dynamic cloud resources. This also implies an expansion from serving static data center infrastructures to dynamic workloads in today’s agile IT. PAM is changing, with more parties involved – a “PAMocracy”, as KuppingerCole Analyst Paul Fisher recently named it.</p>
<p>These changes also require expansions in integration to other IT services. There needs to be a dynamic governance approach, where IGA comes into play. It requires rethinking whether PAM tools really should care for authentication. There is no need for authentication point solutions in an age where most organizations have a strong Access Management solution with MFA, passwordless authentication and adaptive, risk- and context-based access in place. Finally, this new PAM must integrate with the DevOps tools chain for permanent updates about new code and the resources used as well as with IT Asset Management for an always up-to-date insight into the ever-changing, dynamic IT landscape that needs to be protected.</p>
<p>Also worth to think about is integration with further security solutions, beyond the standard SIEM/SOAR integration. AI-powered security solutions are one aspect. Integration to Cloud Security Posture Management is another example.</p>
<p>In this panel, the state and requirements on the future PAM will be discussed.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-role-of-pam-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide. Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that cybercrime costs will reach $10.5 trillion by 2025. Banking, finance, payment services, and retail are some of the most frequent objectives of fraudsters, as expected. However, insurance, gaming, telecommunications, health care, cryptocurrency exchanges, government assistance agencies, travel and hospitality, and real estate are increasingly targeted as cybercriminals have realized that most online services trade in monetary equivalents. In this session we will look at critical capabilities for FRIPs and provide an overview on the solution market.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/frip-capabilities-market-overview-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Access control is a key part of cyber security, however traditional approaches do not work well for modern business IT environments that nowadays typically include a mix of applications on-prem and across multiple cloud environments.</p>
<p>Most modern companies tend to struggle with access management for a variety of reasons. These include the fact that it is difficult to make the necessary connections to the many disparate IT systems for which they need to provision access, role-based access management is challenging, static role-based entitlements are difficult to manage and typically require regular recertification processes, and traditional approaches are focused on granting access to resources required by an individual to perform their job function, but do not cover how those rights are actually used to stop any abuse of entitlements.</p>
<p>In addition, course-grained authorization is no longer sufficient because modern applications and sensitive data assets in cloud-native, containerized and DevOps environments require fine grained authorization capabilities that can also supply identity attributes and context variables.</p>
<p>A policy-based approach can address many of the pain points experienced by organizations today by enabling a centralized, consistent, dynamic, on-demand (just-in-time) way of managing access to IT resources. In this panel session we will discuss nothing less than the future of Access Management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/getting-rid-of-roles-recertification-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The past few years have seen a startling increase in decentralized technologies for Digital Identities. So far, much of their adoption has been limited to academic or proof-of-concept integrations (barring some shining examples) rather than consolidated production-ready use cases.</p>
<p>Generally, there isn't an enforced link between real-world and digital identities, and rightfully so. Still, enterprises' policies and regulations mandate companies to ensure restricted access to reserved data and undeniable attribution, which collides with general anonymity and distributed principles. Albeit SSI technologies aim at filling this gap with trusted-yet-privacy-preserving solutions, companies still need to consolidate digital identities and collapse them into a well-defined entity. We will talk about a hybrid approach to classic IAM for workforce management including W3C native credential integration with solidified and well-established SSO federations. In other words, delegate to the end users the choice of which identity technology to use as long as they can provide a trust chain that the companies can verify.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hybrid-iam-interoperable-verifiable-credentials-eic2023"></a>

  <p>In this talk, Krishna Balan Kannappan will describe Kone´s path to a holistic and integrated Identity Security infrastructure.</p>
 
 IDM Deployment in KONE includes Lifecycle management of KONE Internal Users and non person accounts. Automated Processes in IDM ensures that minimum accesses required for Internal Users are granted automatically based on User Attributes and all accesses are removed automatically when user leaves the organization. Non Person accounts are hardened automatically based on the usage. 
 Applications authorization is managed by IDM using various provisioning mechanisms. 
 Applications authentication is controlled by Azure AD, MFA enabled is mandated for all applications and end users. 
 Admin Accounts used for Accessing KONE Infrastructure and Workstations are managed in IDM(Microsoft recommended Tier based model is used). 
 Self Service allows Role Owners and Account Owners to Create Access Reviews, Manage Passwords, Manage Access. 
 KONE SOC team uses IDM for performing emergency actions to disable/enable/reset Password of AD Accounts. 
 
<p>Privilege Access Management:</p>
 
 KONE uses PRIVX as the PAM Solution for allowing access to Infrastructure. PAM is integrated with IDM for authorizations. PAM Solution ensures KONE Infratructure cannot be accessed outside PAM by access controls and continuous monitoring. 
 PAM Uses Separate MFA for added Security. 
 Automations are implemented to onboard/offboard Application servers into PAM 
 
<p>DevSecops model is used for Development, automated deployments, Security Scans and automated Testing.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-security-implementation-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Italy has two National Digital Identity schemes, namely: SPID and CieID (leveraging the national ID card). Both of them are based on SAML2 and are on their way to supporting OpenID Connect. The reasons for this decision are numerous, and they are primarily related to OpenID Connect Core features such as flexibility, ease of implementation, better support for mobile applications, and widespread adoption, particularly in the private sector. To manage this transition, we considered several documents by the OAuth working group describing security best Current Practices and the OpenID Foundation specifying a profile for iGov and a framework for federation. In particular, the latter defines a hierarchical federation model with high security, interoperability, scalability, and transparency based on dynamic delegation mechanisms; Italy is an enthusiastic early adopter. <br> In this talk, we introduce the Italian OpenID Connect profile based on the iGov and federation profiles and explain the main security measures that we considered within our design from the aforementioned standards and available best current practices. We also discuss how the Italian OpenID Connect profile contributes to the iGov and OpenID Connect Federation documents. We conclude the presentation with a brief discussion of eIDAS 2.0 and some of the ongoing preliminary works in the context of the Italian digital identity ecosystem to move toward an SSI-based solution using the Italian OpenID Connect profile as a starting point.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/italian-digital-identity-ecosystem-eic2023"></a>

<p>Should that continue to be the case? Are the conditions right for the establishment of a Chief Identity Office… and is that even a good idea?<br> <br> In this panel, Drs. Jacoba Sieders, Denny Prvu, and Ian Glazer will debate the pros and cons of the notion of a Chief Identity Officer role. Topics will include:</p>
 
 What would the value of such a role be? And how is such a role measured? 
 What would the responsibilities of said Officer be and what is the role’s remit? What are its boundaries? 
 What questions should the Board and C-Suite be asking? What should they know about identity that they don’t today? 
 How would such an Officer quantify the value of the identity infrastructure to the business? 
 Does the need for the role differ based on industry sector and geography? 
 How would this role fit with the Chief Digital Officer, Information Security Officer, and Privacy / Data Protection Officer? 
 And how would this make things better for the digital identity practitioner and the industry as a whole?

  <p>Imagine a world where security risks are identified and mitigated before they even happen. Imagine if access and auditing recommendations were made with the precision of a computer algorithm. Imagine the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices. We have reached an inflection point in the world of AI.&nbsp;The release of technologies like ChatGPT is as monumental as the development of the internet or Google as a search engine.&nbsp;AI is going to change the way we think about IGA. With the capabilities of AI, IGA solutions can provide a higher level of granularity, faster data processing, and more complex analysis to better identify and mitigate risks in real-time. This will lead to more effective risk management, smarter access and auditing recommendations, and increased automation of processes and operations. But this is just the beginning. As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even greater benefits from AI-enabled IGA solutions in the future. Imagine a future where your organization's security is not just protected but anticipates and proactively prevents threats before they happen. So I ask you, are you ready to join us in shaping the future of IGA? Are you ready to harness the power of AI to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices? The future is here, and it's time to embrace it.<br> In this talk, attendees will learn about the potential for AI to revolutionize Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-future-of-iga-eic2023"></a>

For years we are trying to develop access policies which at the same time corresponds to business expectations, digital security rules and regulations, and people-centric to minimize deviations.<br>In this session, we will discuss human factor in IGA program and how to provide human factor analytics in access governance using new three-dimensional model called NPR (need, policy and resolution). We will show how NPR reports will help the organization to determine necessary adjustments of the policies and their implementation in Identity Governance workflows and processes to improve maturity, decrease risk of breaches, policy deviations by users and cost of managing and enforcing policies also known as Costidity. We will also show the sample reports based on data from higher education customer.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/human-factor-access-governance-eic2023"></a>

And if people wanted to work, they needed to follow our rules to access corporate apps and services. But then came Cloud apps, and BYOD, and consumerization, pushing security beyond our outer limits. Security happens where psychology and technology intersect. The everyday decisions of employees increase or decrease an organization’s risk.</p>
<p>Employees don’t need us. And by employee, I mean more than end-users. This is a broader conversation; including software developers, IT engineers, DevOps practitioners, and more. To get people to opt in and follow secure practices, we turn to behavior science. IT security leaders must offer them a compelling experience. In this panel we will discuss how to&nbsp;carefully balance the need for security, compliance, and efficient resource management to ensure that your cloud environment is both secure and effective.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/rethinking-cloud-access-management-eic2023"></a>

  <p>There’s a lot of foundational work happening in the space of Selective Disclosure (SD) right now. Selective Disclosure enables you to have a token with many claims (say, an ISO Mobile Drivers’ License (mDL)), and only release the claims necessary to the interaction – for instance, your birthdate but not your home address.&nbsp; Selective Disclosure enables Minimal Disclosure.&nbsp; This is sometimes realized using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) but that’s not always necessary.</p>
<p>In decentralized identity ecosystems, users hold their own credentials to share them with others when needed. One key requirement for these credentials is selective disclosure: instead of sharing the entire credential, users should be able to share only the minimal amount of information necessary for a given use case. This is where SD-JWT comes in.<br> SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) is a new format for enabling selective disclosure in JWTs. It is based on the JOSE family of standards for signing and encryption, making it easy to understand and implement.<br> Developed by the IETF OAuth Working Group, SD-JWT is not limited to verifiable credentials, but can be used universally to provide selective disclosure for any JWT.<br> <br> Due to its simplicity, SD-JWT has quickly gained traction, with several implementations already available and ongoing adoption as an important building block in both commercial and public projects. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts behind SD-JWT and provide a detailed overview of its capabilities and benefits. We will also discuss the current state of SD-JWT adoption and future directions for its development.</p>

According to the Verizon DBIR, more than 80% of breaches start with compromised credentials.Decentralized identity represents a massive paradigm shift to a safer, more secure future by making the user's device the transport mechanism for that single user's data. In other words, no more “trusted” third parties. Decentralized identity eliminates the need to build connections into federation systems, and reduces the amount of personally identifiable information organizations must collect.In short, we’ll discuss how shifting to a decentralized identity model reduces risk for organizations while simultaneously improving users privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-future-of-digital-identity-eic2023"></a>

  <p>When I travel aboard or do business with someone from outside my country, my payment cards and phone work across international boundaries. When will my Digital ID do the same? <br> <br> This presentation will share how OIX’s work on Global Interoperability, part of the GAIN initiative, is defining how this will be possible through smart digital IDs or wallets that dynamically adapt to the policy rules of each new trust framework they encounter in a way that works seamlessly for the end user. <br> <br> So, when I fly to the EU from the US my Digital ID from my US based wallet provider reads the rules of the EU trust framework and simply adapts. I don’t need to get a new local Digital ID for my visit to the EU. The EU trust framework policy rules will be described using a new globally applicable Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework that allows all frameworks to publish their policy characteristics in a standard machine-readable way. <br> <br> My digital ID wallet contains key ‘golden credentials’ that should be accepted all over globe: passport, driving licence, bank account, telco account and my digital national ID card. Each trust framework will value these differently in its own Assurance Policy, which can also be published via the policy rule exchange framework. To make this work, new proofing and data content standards for some of the golden credentials will be required.<br> <br> Technically, exchange of policy rules will be a decentralized approach, where policy rules are shared directly from each trust framework only to wallets they trust. The presentation will also outline the technical architecture to underpin this, and how the Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework will fit as a policy component as part of the Open Wallet Foundation architecture. <br> <br> OIX is working with and analysing various trust frameworks around the global to create the Open Policy Rules framework, including the UK, Canada, EU, Australia, Singapore, MOSIP and Bank ID Sweden. <br> <br> Come and find out more about how OIX’s vision of allowing us all to have a trusted Digital ID that can be accepted anywhere in the world can be achieved.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-id-wallet-all-over-the-world-eic2023"></a>

  <p>“Graph-Based Access Control'' (GBAC) is a generic term that refers to the use of graphs and networked data to solve Identity and Access Control problems. You may have seen this before through the disguise of acronyms such as ReBAC (relationship-based), KBAC (knowledge-based), PBAC (policy-based), NGAC (Next-Generation), FGA (fine-grained), and even some implementations of ABAC (attribute-based). All of these terms refer to techniques that use graphs to enforce access-control for any level of coarseness.<br> <br> In this session you will learn why all the latest Dynamic Authorization offerings on the market use GBAC in a way or another, and how you can successfully adopt the technique yourself. Graphs are becoming ubiquitous - one can just look at the rise of the GraphQL API model to witness their popularity first-hand. Through concrete, real-life examples we will showcase the use of graphs to solve common access problems using the same modern and future-proof techniques that you see in the current authorization market.<br> <br> As a result, storing all identity data in graphs truly unlocks its full potential. Graphs are data-science and analytics enablers, and have the potential to transform the IAM practice from a cost centre to a true revenue generator. We’ll explore how this can happen for you too…</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/graph-based-access-control-eic2023"></a>

  <p>This decade may well be labeled “the decade of the digital credential.” From COVID passports to mobile driver’s licenses, digitized credentials transforming to “born digital” credentials, and governments and large tech companies developing their own wallets, personal information has never been easier to share with the wave of a device. The convenience is amazing, and the privacy implications are terrifying. <br><br> Even scoping the issue down to government-issued credentials or credentials directly derived from government data, there are a variety of requirements feeding into this growing ecosystem:</p>
 
 user control of data 
 data minimization 
 relying party accountability 
 extensibility to other domains 
 optional audit log of transactions and ability to assert rights (CCPA, GDPR) 
 minimization of fraud 
 
<p>In this session, Heather Flanagan and Mike Kiser will discuss the outcomes of the recently released white paper on government-issued credentials and the privacy landscape (publication date expected in April 2023). The issues at hand are not solely about policy, nor are they only about technology. It is about closing the policy and protocol gaps that exist between today’s disparate solutions and services and providing a vision of a privacy-preserving, globally viable privacy landscape.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ubiquitous-credential-government-issued-identity-eic2023"></a>

<p>We have had an amazing week with IBM clients, partners, and stakeholders at our annual Think® Conference in Orlando, Florida. For IBM, Think is a perfect time for us to connect, collaborate and help our clients and partners continue to forge ahead with digital transformation and innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we wrap up Think 2023, we’re excited to recap a few of the exciting new capabilities we are launching in our IT Automation portfolio.</p>



 Accelerating IT operations with IBM’s AIOps platform 



<p>Managing IT environments in today’s modern business landscape is a complex and challenging task, requiring IT operations teams to move from being reactive to predictive and proactive. Traditional approaches are no longer sufficient to ensure continuous availability, functionality and performance.</p>



<p>To address this challenge, IBM offers an AIOps platform that utilizes AI to enhance decision-making across infrastructure and operations personas by contextualizing large volumes of operational data.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-watson-aiops">IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps</a> is a comprehensive, self-hosted <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/aiops">AIOps</a> platform solution that provides central IT operations teams with a single pane of glass to view their managed IT environment. This platform utilizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to aggregate data from various sources, detect and correlate incidents, and quickly drive incidents to resolution. IBM’s AIOps platform is designed to help businesses by augmenting, accelerating and automating incident resolution, while helping to foster collaboration across teams.</p>



<p>Further contributing to the value of our existing AIOps platform—alongside the Cloud Pak for AIOps—IBM is excited to announce the addition of our cloud-native SaaS solution, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/aiops-insights">IBM AIOps Insights</a>, set for general availability at the end of June 2023. This AI-powered solution is designed to streamline <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/what-is-incident-management">incident management</a> and increase uptime to help improve operational efficiency and reduce costs. With AIOps Insights, organizations can leverage AI and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> to automate end-to-end processes, transforming reactive IT operations into proactive and predictive operations that identify issues and anomalies before they occur.</p>



<p>AIOps Insights is a SaaS deployment option for incident management and remediation that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of an organization’s IT environment. Like IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps, it consolidates multiple tools and correlates resource status across silos, streamlining incident management, reducing incident costs and increasing availability. With AIOps Insights, organizations can connect and integrate cross-domain data—including infrastructure, network and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-performance-management">APM</a>—and visualize their entire IT environment with just a few clicks.</p>



<p>The platform dynamically generates a topology of an organization’s IT environment, adding new entities as they are detected. By correlating events and grouping them into incidents, AIOps Insights addresses noise and enables quick identification of incidents that may require more investigation. The platform also automatically suggests remediation actions. The platform then provides visibility of status updates as incidents are resolved.</p>



<p>IBM’s AIOps platform, including IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps and the new IBM AIOps Insights, empowers organizations to tap into the power of intelligent automation and streamline IT operations to help them achieve better business outcomes.</p>



 Better together with IBM Instana Observability and IBM Turbonomic 



<p>In today’s complex IT environments, lack of visibility is a major challenge. IT operations teams need to gain full-stack health and performance monitoring, which traditional monitoring tools may have lacked.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana Observability</a> provides comprehensive visibility into modern applications, services and environments through a technology-agnostic approach that continuously provides high-fidelity data. It is engineered to identify issues before they impact business operations and automatically deploys monitoring in over 250 different applications, microservices and software infrastructure components across hybrid and multicloud environments. Instana is designed to deliver quick-time-to-value while keeping up with dynamic complexities.</p>



<p>In addition to comprehensive visibility, organizations need to detect performance issues and eliminate waste caused by over-provisioning. Enterprises need to shift from reactive to dynamic and continuous resource allocation for optimal, cost-effective utilization.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074478118701&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwu-KiBhCsARIsAPztUF2LocAwBI6MRcQ_rxVavdxDJuR6XdhEP94h9N5huBdDgN-nxlebf8saAqU8EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Turbonomic</a> is an AI- and automation-driven solution that dynamically allocates resources based on performance analysis and AI-driven recommendations.

				  With growing interest in decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, it’s easy to think that they are something only big business or nation states can use. But even the smallest businesses can benefit from this technology. So the question we will answer: What can verifiable credentials do for you if, say, you have a small business?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Let’s start with a few of the problems that all businesses face: employee and access management, engaging customers, and payroll. While larger organizations can have entire teams dedicated to each of these tasks, leaner businesses — such as a single location — might have a small number of people trying to manage everything; this is where verifiable credentials can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s break down exactly how for each business problem.</p>
<p>Employee and Access Management</p>
<p>Employees at any business need to be allowed access to certain things to do their job properly, such as&nbsp; interacting with the suppliers to procure ingredients, or a manager or team lead may need to set the schedule and hours for other employees. By providing everyone a credential it becomes easy to grant these permissions, and for the employees to be able to share that they are authorized by their employer to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>Creating these different levels of access is super easy to set up, it can be as simple as checkboxes — employee X can access suppliers, while employee Z is new, and can only access the time clock to clock in and out. Should an employee leave, removing their access, business-wide, is as simple as revoking their credential: no more need for changing passwords or getting their keys back.</p>
<p>All of this can be coordinated without the complexity and expense of creating direct integrations with external databases. Some of this vision is far reaching (such as lock access via credentials), but some of this (such as employee software access via credentials) is quite real today.</p>
<p>Engaging Customers</p>
<p>Customers are the lifeforce for any business; so, you need to do your best to keep them.This means building relationships, online and in person — and this is where verifiable credentials shine. They enable you to create a trusted digital relationship that enhances the customer’s experience.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to build a trusted relationship by enabling direct, semantically described, privacy-preserving, and secure communication with your customers. This is not the same as sending your customer an email or text message and he or she sending one back. This is direct communication that is solely between you and your customer, by consent, and managed through a digital wallet.</p>
 
 Secure verification
 
 Customers can verify they are dealing with a business representative and workers can verify customers. This would be critical for any home medical provider. 
 The Agent software can detect when a customer is approaching and verify the customer and their order. 
 
 
 Secure messaging
 
 A customer can ask business or restaurant for today’s business hours, and where exactly it is, the special offers (if any), and the method of payments they accept. 
 The restaurant can alert a customer that their order is ready, the customer doesn’t need to stay within earshot or sight, and the business saves the cost of a specialized solution. This also prevents the need to share private data, such as a phone number, to receive the notification. 
 
 
 Enhanced data handling
 
 The business can save customer order history on the customer’s device with the customer’s permission, allowing the customer to share their preferences on a subsequent visit if they want to order their “usual.” 
 Data is saved on the customer side, so there is no need for the business to store customer data and manage data privacy compliance. 
 
 
 Balanced power
 
 Customers have full control over the connection with the business; they don’t need to unsubscribe or ask to be taken off a list. 
 Businesses benefit via simple customer relationships that are both powerful and regulation compliant. 
 
 
 
<p>The customer can interact with the business knowing that their personal data is not being stored or their behavior tracked, and they have consent over how they engage with the business. Loyalty programs built with this technology contain significant advantages over traditional solutions.</p>
<p>Payroll and Timekeeping</p>
<p>Tracking hours and payroll&nbsp; is a huge part of running any business. Verifiable credentials provide a secure way for everyone to clock in and out&nbsp; and automated payroll. By using an employee credential, no one else will be able to clock in for another employee if they are running late, or be able to see when anyone else clocked in unless they have access to that data, providing the business with a more accurate look at employee hours.</p>
<p>Easier than you think</p>
<p>Finally, if you take nothing else away from this article, we hope that you understand that none of this has to be complicated or particularly expensive. Whether you see your business as big or small, verifiable credentials offer a way to streamline several different aspects of your operations and make your life easier.

<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Good morning, Robert. How are you?</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
I’m good Huzefa. How are you this morning?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Wonderful. I’m so excited about next week.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So am I.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
We are going to be at the European Identity Conference in Berlin, which starts on May 9th and goes through May 12th. We will be at Booth 40, so we will have a presence there. Anybody can stop by, come and say hello, or if you just want to learn about 1Kosmos, stop by our booth. In addition to this, we are also hosting two sessions, one of the sessions is titled Utilizing Verifiable Credentials in the Workforce for Vendors and Contractors. This session is hosted by Mike Engle, our co-founder, our Chief Strategy Officer as well. This will be a very, very exciting session, primarily because how verifiable credentials can play in the workforce and his thoughts around it, along with live implementation that we’ve done. And the second session that we are providing is around Trends in Passwordless Authentication in Customer Identity and Access Management. Passwordless authentication has grown rapidly. The need for Passwordless is there in the market, but it’s primarily targeted on the workforce today. So we talk about how the customer identity and access management market is changing the passwordless access, and that would be another talk track, and I’m hosting that one.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So I know that I’m excited about a bunch of things. What are you excited about going to be there?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
EIC or the European Identity Conference, in my opinion, is a premier identity conference, which is out there. It brings together the whole notion of how digital identity plays on the cloud with security as well. Very, very excited to see new emerging trends, which are going to be in the market for identity and digital identity in particular, as well as very excited to see our customers, partners and a few prospects as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. I’m same boat. I always like going over and just listening to what’s going on in the market, how Kuppinger sees the world, just in general, where they see the market going. Plus, it’s always good to see new friends, old friends, just kind of catch up. We know that this industry is pretty small, so it’s always fun to catch up with people and then obviously talking to customers and potential prospects is also a lot of fun. So I’m looking very forward to it. Plus I’ve never been to Berlin, so I’m looking forward to that too.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
There you go. And I’ll have a great company in Berlin with you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
That’s right, that’s right, that’s right. It is just going to be you and I. And you mentioned the booth earlier. We’re going to be at Booth 40 just for people that are coming by. When you do come by, we’ve got a great demo that we’d love to show you. It really illustrates what makes 1Kosmos different and as a thank you, we’re going to enter you into a draw for a brand new Apple Watch plus we’ve got some pretty cool 1Kosmos socks, so if you need some socks, swing by, we’d love to get you a new pair of socks. And then one of the activities at the EIC, which is short for the European Identity and Cloud conference is the passport. So if you are an attendee and you’ve got your passport, don’t forget to swing by. We’ll stamp that for you as well.</p>
<p>And aside from that on our website Huzefa, I’m pretty sure you’re aware, but for those of you that haven’t seen it, there’s a opportunity there to book a meeting with us ahead of time. So as we know, we get to conferences, calendars fill up. It gets a little bit crazy sometimes so if you want to plan your days a little bit more in advance, you’re more than welcome to go to our website, click on the EIC link, and there’s an option there where you can enter in your information and book a time to meet with either Huzefa or myself or both of us while you’re at the event. So it’s a great way to kind of plan for things ahead of time, or you can do it while you’re at the event as well. So looking forward to seeing everybody there.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Absolutely. Looking forward to seeing you next week. Looking forward to seeing our customers, and all the analysts as well.</p>

<p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS brought the banking industry into the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165274305/the-fed-raises-interest-rates-again-despite-the-stress-hitting-the-banking-syste">global spotlight</a>. The banking sector has been in a state of uncertainty after California regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank in the largest U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banks-face-scrutiny-fed-rate-decision-looms-2023-03-22/">bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis</a>.&nbsp;The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-03-17/tabbush-report-founder-reacts-to-recent-bank-turmoil-video">has delivered</a> a small rate hike amid global banking tension.</p>
<p>There are many factors that could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, when interest rates started sharply rising last year, and depositors demanded their deposits, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/why-silicon-valley-bank-collapsed-svb-fail">the bank was forced to sell</a> U.S. Treasury bonds at a loss. Amid this environment, it is more important than ever for banks to project an image of calm, stability, and transparency to their customers.</p>
<p>Since the invention of instant payment card issuance in the mid-2000s, it has quickly become a top priority for banks and credit unions as it provides convenience and a better experience for customers and members. We saw it become a top priority first through a dramatic increase in the use of instant issuance for getting chipped cards quickly into the hands of cardholders during the transition to EMV, and then through persistent availability of instantly issued cards through the COVID-19 pandemic via drive-up, drive-thru, and self-service terminals.</p>
<p>However, recent macroeconomic impacts in the retail banking sector have heightened consumers’ awareness of who they use as their primary banking institution, making it even more critical for financial institutions to differentiate themselves and prove their commitment to their clients and the broader community.</p>
<p>Instant card issuance allows cardholders to receive their debit or credit card from a local branch or interactive teller machine in minutes – the moment they open their account or are in need of a new card. These instantly issued cards are activated, personalized, and permanent. This quick and easy process can enhance the customer experience and improve customer loyalty, affinity, and likelihood to become a brand ambassador. By offering instant card issuance, banks and credit unions can demonstrate their commitment to their clients by providing a convenient and efficient service that meets their needs. This can help build trust and confidence in the institution, which is particularly important as consumers have more options for banking than ever before.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating commitment to cardholders, instant card issuance can also help banks compete with fintech startups and other financial institutions. These players are known for their agility and ability to quickly respond to customer needs, which has driven traditional banking models to leverage a unique differentiator: their physical footprint in the community. Instant card issuance allows financial institutions to offer a similar level of speed and convenience but through an in-person relationship-building event.</p>
<p>As we move through 2023, instant card issuance will become more important than ever before as banks and credit unions are looking to demonstrate their commitment to their community, differentiate themselves in a competitive market, and enhance the customer and member experience.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) recently published a working paper on May 8th, 2023, diving into the complex world of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on the economy. The paper, titled “CBDC and business cycle dynamics in a New Monetarist New Keynesian model,” provides a deep-dive into the intricacies of an economy intertwined with CBDCs.</p>



<p>To embark on this exploration, the authors of the study ingeniously integrate a New Monetarist-type decentralized market into a New Keynesian model with financial frictions. This hybrid model, featuring a centralised market (CM) and a decentralised market (DM), helps to simulate the potential impact of an interest-bearing CBDC on the economic landscape.</p>



<p>The centralised market (CM) in the model encapsulates the New Keynesian dynamics, introducing familiar frictions such as monopolistic competition among retail goods producers and Calvo-type sticky prices, which allow for real effects of monetary policy. In addition, the model includes investment adjustment costs for intermediate goods-producing firms and a unique incentive constraint for bankers, leading to frictions in the bank intermediation process.</p>



<p>In contrast, the decentralised market (DM) is a monetary search model, providing a platform for CBDCs and bank deposits to function as a medium of exchange. Here, households receive a preference shock at the beginning of the DM, determining their roles as sellers or buyers, creating a double-coincidence-of-wants problem.</p>



<p>The study shows that the introduction of an interest-bearing CBDC can help stabilize the liquidity premium. This can influence bank funding conditions and the opportunity costs of money, potentially smoothing the reaction of investment and consumption to macroeconomic shocks.</p>



<p>An increase in CBDC supply, which leads to a decrease in the liquidity premium, can boost consumption, output, and inflation. The study underlines the pivotal role of the central bank’s adjustments to the CBDC supply in response to changes in the liquidity premium in shaping the dynamic impact of the CBDC on the economy.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that the existence of a CBDC does not significantly alter the model’s responses to typical macroeconomic shocks. Instead, it tends to dampen and smooth their transmission to core variables such as output and inflation.</p>



<p>By integrating the New Monetarist decentralised transactions with the New Keynesian business cycle dynamics, this research provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate the properties and impacts of CBDCs.</p>



<p>The implications of this study are profound, casting light on how CBDCs could affect monetary policy, financial stability, and the broader role of digital currencies in our economic systems. As central banks worldwide continue to explore the potential of CBDCs, this research presents a crucial step towards understanding the multifaceted effects of these digital currencies.</p>

<p>This week, we’re thrilled to bring together thousands of IBM clients, partners, business leaders and stakeholders at our annual <a href="https://www.ibm.com/events/think/">Think® Conference</a> being held in Orlando, Florida. For IBM, Think is all about how we support organizations in their digital transformation and help them compete in their markets via the use of technological innovation. There’s a great deal of uncertainty throughout the business world, but we believe IBM Think offers a moment for our collective industries to come together and discuss solutions.</p>



<p>As you’ve heard IBM CEO Arvind Krishna share many times, IBM is a hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence company. Today, we are witness to one of those rare moments in history—the rise of an innovative technology with the potential to radically transform business and society forever. That technology, of course, is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. So, how do we at IBM continue to provide technological solutions that tap into the power of artificial intelligence and leverage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a>, all while bolstering human ambition for collaboration, creativity and innovation?</p>



<p>Ultimately, we believe the answer lies in the power of augmenting our own human intelligence. Empowering the desire for efficiency with the spirit of innovation and employing the technology to help organizations maximize their potential—all while applying <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics">AI ethics</a>, which is a field of methods and practices that determines how we create and use AI and AI systems.</p>



<p>Today, you’re seeing business and IT leaders turning to automation to improve operational efficiency, employee productivity, customer satisfaction and, ultimately, business performance. But getting the most out of your automation initiatives requires the right focus, with a comprehensive vision and an experienced team to drive continuous value creation throughout your organization to help achieve your goal—more engaged, productive people focused on work that truly matters.</p>



<p>By working together to achieve new levels of performance, a client experienced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/td-ameritrade/">a 70% reduction in the time required to open a new account</a>. Another client saw a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/blueshore-financial/">250% increase in transactions</a> lending volume over three years. The potential to realize up to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/JEWOV1BM">470% ROI over three years is possible</a>.</p>



<p>As we enjoy IBM Think 2023, I’m excited to share a litany of new updates to our business, products and solutions that we believe will help organizations better identify and execute high-impact automations across business and IT to arrive at stronger business outcomes.</p>



 Putting events to work with IBM Event Automation 



<p>With today’s relentless work pace and constantly shifting customer needs and market dynamics, thousands of business events flow through your organization every day. These events can provide valuable information about what’s happening across your business; however, they may remain siloed and locked away in various data sources.</p>



<p>Imagine if your business tapped into these ongoing streams of information, connected the dots between disparate events and could detect new trends, customer issues or competitive threats. This could enable your business to offer new products or services, increase customer satisfaction or simply improve today’s operations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/accelerate-your-speed-of-business-with-ibm-event-automation">Introducing IBM Event Automation</a>, a solution designed to put events to work by enabling both business and IT users to detect situations in real time, act on them and trigger automations. With event distribution, discovery and processing in an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, IBM Event Automation provides a composable approach to accelerate your event-driven journey.</p>



<p>Whether your organization operates in retail, banking and financial services, travel and transportation, or healthcare, IBM Event Automation offers you the ability to remain aware of what’s happening across your business, so you can become more responsive to customers and resilient in the face of shifting market dynamics.</p>

 Digital labor: A new approach to work 



<p>With employees cycling through many apps multiple times per day, organizations continue to seek ways in which they can boost employee productivity while still fostering a climate of innovation and creativity. At IBM, we believe organizations can boost productivity by embracing digital labor solutions. There are three entry points for using AI and automation to help individuals free up time to focus on higher-value work:</p>



 
 Employee productivity: Automate processes and individual tasks, and create space to work on more complex problems. 



 Customer care: Empower businesses to create personalized, unified and outcome-oriented experiences for their customers. 



 Employee empowerment: Give employees the information and insights that they need to deliver fast outcomes and more informed decisions. 
 



<p>The question now becomes how do we move from how much we work to how well we work with the help of digital labor?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-watson-orchestrate-unlocking-new-levels-productivity-for-every-employee">Introducing IBM Watson Orchestrate Enterprise Edition</a>, a cloud-based enterprise platform that helps organizations empower their workforce to streamline repetitive tasks.</p>



<p>With the goal of freeing up an employee’s time to focus on higher-value projects, Watson Orchestrate doesn’t require you to become an expert in enterprise business processes, policies and application logins to do your job. IBM Watson Orchestrate will work alongside you, understand you, guide you and learn from you as you do your work.</p>



<p>Customers can now use over 30 new pre-built/pre-trained skills for SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM and Workday. Where more are needed, foundation models within Watson Orchestrate can be used to import existing automations and turn them into skills in minutes. The software’s new digression capability gives Watson the ability to multi-task, allowing users to make multiple requests at the same time.</p>



<p>Additionally, we’ve expanded our partnership with clients to further embed AI and hybrid cloud solutions into their HR transformation services through a new set of Watson Orchestrate skills. In the future, with Watson’s generative models, our vision is for users to be able to create personalized automations using natural language.</p>



<p>I’m also excited to share that later this year we’ll be unveiling <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-code-assistant">IBM Watson Code Assistant</a>*, an innovative solution that helps developers write code with AI-generated recommendations. Powered by IBM watsonx.ai foundation models, Watson Code Assistant is designed to help developers of all experience levels scale the learning curve by providing recommended code based on natural language inputs. I’m excited about this solution because it will help address the growing IT automation skills gap by making hybrid cloud code development more accessible to IT professionals and help those experienced with automation code to be more productive.</p>

 Accelerating IT operations with AIOps 



<p>Businesses need to support continuous availability, functionality and performance across their IT environments. Traditional approaches to managing IT often can’t keep up with the demands of modern business. IT operations teams must stay one step ahead of end-user issues, moving from being reactive to predictive and proactive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why I am delighted to announce the upcoming release of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/products/aiops-insights">IBM AIOps Insights</a> this quarter—a robust, AI-powered solution that aims to streamline IT operations, increase uptime, improve efficiency and reduce costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cloud-native event and incident management solution will offer central IT operations teams a comprehensive view of their managed IT environment in a single pane of glass. AIOps Insights uses intelligent automation and AI to aggregate data from various sources, correlate related incidents and help teams to effectively detect and remediate incidents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While streamlining incident management with the aggregation and consolidation of multiple tools, AIOps Insights is also designed to foster collaboration across teams and accelerate the incident resolution process by eliminating war rooms and addressing silos across tools and processes.</p>



<p>For IBM, this represents another way that we’re empowering organizations to tap into the power of intelligent automation solutions and streamline IT operations.</p>



 Let’s continue the conversation 



<p>In today’s business landscape, we have a digital workforce that’s constantly evolving, and the need to optimize IT and business operations is imperative. IBM is committed to being the catalyst to help organizations accelerate their adoption of intelligent automation solutions.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the programming and continued innovation coming out of IBM Think this week and look forward to continuing the conversation.</p>

<p><br><a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise</a> is a no-code, self-sovereign identity platform that facilitates the orchestration of trust tasks. We’re all very familiar with digital credentialing trust tasks such as issuing a credential or verifying a presentation proof. However, Orbit Enterprise supports other trust tasks, including secure messaging and <a href="https://northernblock.io/feature-showcase-6-aries-credential-issuance-orchestration/">negotiations</a>.</p>
<p>Our recent 0.6.10 Orbit Enterprise release includes a Trust Decision Helper module which allows for an additional trust task called “ask a trust registry” to be used alongside others. Not only do we facilitate the lookup of trust registries when a party is looking to make a trust decision, but we’ve also implemented options that leverage the DNS zone of a party you may be interacting with.</p>
<p>Here is some additional details from the release notes that capture the module being applied towards a holder receiving a credential offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in better understanding why we’re leveraging DNS in this flow, we recently wrote a <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">blog post</a> which covers the use case in much more detail.</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we show how an organization being offered a credential can use the issuer’s DNS information, which has been put into their DID document, to validate that the owner of the DID also has ownership of a specific domain name. Additionally, they can use pointers in the domain name system to discover trust registries that could facilitate trust decisions to be made.</p>
  
			
		
<p>We hope you find this demonstration useful and thought-provoking. Please get in touch with us if you’re looking to do any work in the intersection of credential exchange and trust registries. As we continue to work on more trust registry enhancements and features, we would love to collaborate with different community members.</p>

<p>The future belongs to those leaders willing to make bold, informed bets today. To take action, business leaders need the foresight to peer around the corner—and take decisive action based on what they see.</p>



<p>Today, we launched a new IBM Consulting report, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets">Seven Bets</a>, that identifies major trends we expect to shape the world in the near future, and the strategic bets leaders should make to benefit from them and redefine their business.</p>



<p></p> 



 Trend: Tech-led disruptions are accelerating, driven by generative AI 



 Bet: Implement secure, AI-first intelligent workflows to run their enterprise 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">Generative AI</a> has captured the world’s imagination and democratized AI in every aspect of society and business, from supply chains and IT operations to customer service and HR. Cybersecurity costs continue to grow, as do regulation and governance requirements. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">Quantum computing</a> is quickly approaching the ability to break public key encryptions, but also introducing the possibility to solve complex problems that classical computers cannot. </p>



<p>In order to capitalize on these disruptions, organizations should bet on implementing secure, AI-first intelligent workflows to run their enterprise. Getting the most from these disruptions will require moving from AI as an “add-on” to embedding it at the strategic core of your enterprise and accelerating the transition to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust">zero-trust security</a> strategy.&nbsp;</p>

 Trend: Experience matters more than we think 



 Bet: Apply design leadership to change every aspect of the business 



<p>In today’s digital-first world, great experience is essential to cultivating passionate and loyal customers and employees. Putting the end user at the center is key to creating a positive experience. It’s important that organizations apply technology to deliver ease and value, and cultivate trust, among their customers. </p>



<p>To do that, they must <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/approach/design-thinking/">apply design leadership</a> to change every aspect of their business. This means understanding their customers’ motivations and behaviors, incorporating user-focused design early on, and ensuring it’s included in every stage of development. Digital products gain more value when they are combined with a high-quality experience. By integrating creative and technology teams, businesses can improve how products look and work, and, ultimately, boost performance.</p>

 Trend: Reglobalization, reskilling, and new partnerships are transforming value chains 



 Bet: Simplify, digitize, and partner to build resilient enterprises 



<p>Leaders are under intense pressure to drive productivity while also navigating supply chain disruption, geopolitical change, the global skills gap and more. In this time of challenge and change, leaders must simplify, digitize, and partner to build resilient enterprises. This includes applying AI and automation technologies to simplify and streamline operating models and processes, providing skills-sharing platforms that will allow talent to flow to most productive jobs, and doubling-down on ecosystem partners for resource-sharing, innovation and expertise.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Sustainability promises are showing progress 



 Bet: Avoid false choices between sustainability and profit—deliver both 



<p>While <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-is-innovating-for-a-more-sustainable-future/">sustainability</a> tops organizations’ list of priorities as their key stakeholders demand results, too many executives still see sustainability and profitability as conflicting rather than complementary. Organizations should avoid false choices between sustainability and profit—deliver both.</p>



<p>Environmental sustainability needs to be embedded in economic sustainability. Applying data and AI against sustainability goals can help drive productivity. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets">For example</a>, green IT solutions powered by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud technology</a> can reduce both IT carbon footprint and 30% of computing cost. And automation can transparently track sustainability metrics, helping organizations achieve long-term sustainability objectives, optimize costs and create new sources of value.</p>

 Trend: The pragmatic metaverse will enhance the physical world, not replace it 



 Bet: Invest now in augmented reality (AR) solutions with clear benefits 



<p>While there’s been a lot of buzz about the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-metaverse-ready/">metaverse</a>, the bigger value will be bringing technology to the physical world and navigating both physical and digital with tools like digital twins that deliver quantifiable results.&nbsp;Bridging the physical-digital divide requires organizations to invest now in augmented reality (AR) solutions with clear benefits. This includes investing in spatial design skills and applying them to product engineering, field services, manufacturing, and operations, and implementing an enterprise simulation platform to leverage secure data and create new digital twins. Metaverse skills are still scarce, so execs should be prepared to build rather than only hire them.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Every product is becoming a digital product 



 Bet: Invest in the software supply chain as much as the physical supply chain 



<p>Every product is becoming a digital product—your car, your bank account, even your air conditioning. Today, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets/software">67% of products are digital or have a digital component</a>. That means what used to be the design, manufacturing and service of physical products will have to be transformed; there’s now a parallel software supply chain that leaders need to manage, too. Every company needs to act like a software company, investing in their software supply chain as much as their physical supply chain. They must have a product engineering mindset and pair product, technology, and functional skills with a hyper focus on user experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Skills scarcity and demographic shifts are defining the new social contract 



 Bet: Embrace a new work-life continuum in a tech-enabled workplace 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets/work-life">Ninety percent of C-suite executives surveyed say their organization has been impacted by a scarcity of skills</a>. As the demand for digital skills accelerates, business leaders must embrace a new work-life continuum in a tech-enabled workplace. This means reskilling and upskilling employees, changing hiring practices to focus on skills and diversity rather than degrees and redefining roles themselves. It also means adjusting to meet new employee expectations for company values, flexibility and work-life integration, supporting workers’ holistic well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these bets are worth making. It’s less about which ones you’ll choose, and more about how you can pull them together into a systematic approach to drive true transformation at scale.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and&nbsp;thank you for joining us. As the years have been passing, I&nbsp;have noticed&nbsp;actually that, digital signatures are becoming more and more common. At a time when we need to sign some agreements, electronically or Internet services. So, let’s take some time today and&nbsp;hear what is going on, what the trends are, in the European Union, but particularly, in&nbsp;Sweden, where today’s guest is coming from.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Magnus Kardell.&nbsp;He is the product owner of SignPort, a product developed by Knowit, enabling high&nbsp;security, e-identification and e-signatures. He is a specialist in identification and signing&nbsp;services, with a focus on IAM and SSO Federations. Magnus started his career in this field in 2013&nbsp;and has since then gained extensive experience in the public sector, catering to clients&nbsp;with high security standards and needs. With a strong background in the industry, Magnus&nbsp;is dedicated to delivering innovative and secure solutions to his clients through SignPort.</p>
<p>Hello, Magnus.</p>
<p>Magnus Kardell: Yes, hello. Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s great having you. We are going to talk about signatures. But&nbsp;let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. First of all, we want to hear about our&nbsp;guest, so we want to hear about you. Tell us a bit about your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Magnus: Thank you. Yeah, Magnus Kardell is my name, and I work at Knowit Secure&nbsp;Solutions, as Oscar mentioned, and I’m product owner for SignPort, which is an&nbsp;identification and signing service. I started roughly 10 years ago with IT security and at the&nbsp;time we were having, and working with, identity and access management. Providing single sign on&nbsp;and federations between different organisations, and soon after that, we were adding&nbsp;also signature services.</p>
<p>In Sweden, there is a technical framework provided by the&nbsp;Swedish agency, DIGG, the agency for digital government. We have always complied to that&nbsp;standard, and that’s where we built our services. It’s mainly targeting public sector, but it’s&nbsp;also good for private sector. And I think in 2016, we made the first signatures, doing it this way&nbsp;and according to this standard. So, we were first with that one. And I’ve been a project manager&nbsp;for establishing about 40 customers in Sweden, in different configurations, and they&nbsp;are mainly government agencies and large municipalities.</p>
<p>So that’s basically my&nbsp;journey and where I got my experience in this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds great. So magnus, what would you&nbsp;say are the main challenges that organisations, we talk about public and private,&nbsp;these organisations’ face, when they ask you for a digital signature solution?</p>
<p>Magnus: When it comes to public sector, you have to consider many things, maybe more than&nbsp;for a private company. For example, to start with, you need to be able to connect to different eID&nbsp;issuers. So, you can’t only have one.</p>
<p>In Sweden, BankID is the most common, but you need to be able&nbsp;to connect to different, both for identification and also signing. And also, there is a request for&nbsp;dividing into what we call private eID issuers where we use your personal number, which is more&nbsp;private. But that can also be as an employee at an organisation. So, you have that kind of&nbsp;– maybe you don’t want to mix your private entity and your employee entity, so you have&nbsp;to consider that. And also, international, so you can also identify yourself and sign with&nbsp;an eID issuer that is from another country. So that’s one of the things.</p>
<p>The most common eID&nbsp;issuer is BankID, of course, but there is also Freja e-ID, Freja org ID, which is for employees&nbsp;more, and foreign e-ID, that is international. So those are examples, but there are more. So, you&nbsp;need to cope with that, and you need to be able to connect to those.</p>
<p>They are also high security&nbsp;when it comes to signatures. It’s level three, which basically means that you need a hardware&nbsp;secure module, where you do the actual signing. So that’s also a bit higher in security than&nbsp;the general need.</p>
<p>A signed document must be self-supporting over time. So, you can’t&nbsp;rely on our service later on, it has to be self-supporting. And the supplier of the signature&nbsp;service must be replaceable. That’s not good for us, but it’s good that we are, because well, all&nbsp;companies, they are not forever. So, it’s, we should be able to replace as a supplier. So&nbsp;that would be in our system cemeteries that our customers that they, that the document itself&nbsp;is self-sustaining. And you have different things, in some cases, the documents to be signed are&nbsp;really sensitive, or the content is delicate, so you need to be able to sign the document&nbsp;without the document itself leaving the customer’s IT environment. But some requirements&nbsp;also on the signature service.</p>
<p>There are also, in some cases, you need a pure e-service, like&nbsp;signing portal. But in some other cases, the customer probably has their own platform&nbsp;that we would like to connect to our, how to say – signing engine. So, we have to provide APIs for&nbsp;our customers’ e-services– sometimes you have a simple signing portal, and in other cases,&nbsp;you let the customers e-platforms connect to our signing service. So, these are things that&nbsp;they need.</p>
<p>And then, of course, going into public sector, there can be really high volumes, when&nbsp;citizens in the country are using the service. It’s demand for high availability, and there is&nbsp;also a demand for high level automation. That means that the signatures need to be – you need to&nbsp;be able to validate the document electronically to the person who has signed it. If you look into&nbsp;the electronic signature of the PDF and read, signed by the supplier of the service, that is&nbsp;a no go, because then you can’t electronically extract what person who has actually signed&nbsp;the document.</p>
<p>So, this also put some specific requirements, and this is about the journey to&nbsp;digitalisation, and we’re not there yet. We may be in the beginning, of course, so far, when we&nbsp;sign a document on, electronically, like a PDF, that’s good. But often, it’s human reading&nbsp;it, at the end, at the other end anyway. So, we have replaced the paper, which is good.&nbsp;It’s much smoother. That’s very good. But still, it isn’t, the flow isn’t really digitalised.&nbsp;And if looking at these challenges that our customers have, they need to be able to do&nbsp;this high level of automation, at least have it further on.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are&nbsp;requests for sustainable operations. For example, excess heat in the operation centre should be fed&nbsp;back into the district heating network. So, this kind of, you don’t really think of them, but if&nbsp;looking at society, you need to think about those things to be sustainable. Those requirements I&nbsp;mentioned now, or the challenges there were, these organisations have. Of course, they’re mainly for&nbsp;government authorities or municipalities, but, I mean, it could apply also for private companies.&nbsp;It’s not bad, it’s really good things. So that’s about the challenges.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see quite many, different types. As you mentioned, some are purely&nbsp;security, some more like usability, what the user is going to face. What else? And the last one,&nbsp;you mentioned actually, the sustainability side. So yeah, different – and some are, yeah,&nbsp;legal. So yeah, different for different fronts, there are these type of requirements for signature&nbsp;services. And when it’s great that our solutions that, yeah, fix all these together and give a&nbsp;great product to, for us, for the users.</p>
<p>So, I would like to hear now, how are you solving&nbsp;some of these challenges? What are the main use cases? Just, if you can illustrate some&nbsp;of those use cases, hot use cases, let’s say?</p>
<p>Magnus: Signature service that we provide,&nbsp;SignPort is following the, I mentioned before, DIGG, the agency for digital government in&nbsp;Sweden they put up a framework for how to solve these issues. But there is also architecture or&nbsp;reference architecture for how to cope with these challenges. So, we follow that. And if looking&nbsp;at our service, it’s split up in four different components, mainly, four different components, and&nbsp;it’s a Signing Portal, Support Service, a Digital Signing Service, and Identification Service.&nbsp;So, these are the four different components.</p>
<p>And the Signing Portal is like a web page that is&nbsp;an e-service, a service provider. The only thing you can do is to just create a signing assignment.&nbsp;Just to, for example, take a PDF document, drag and drop, and then you apply the email address to the&nbsp;signers, and you send it away, and create the sign message, so that’s how it works. It’s a&nbsp;very simple, but useful tool for just keeping the, having a web interface to the users.</p>
<p>Then we have a Support Service. And the support service is basically calculating the hash of the&nbsp;document to be signed, and then the hash is sent further on to the digital signing service.</p>
<p>Digital Signing Service is a bit more – has the highest security, it contains these hardware&nbsp;secure modules, etc. That are creating those signings with the highest security.</p>
<p>And then&nbsp;we have the Identification Service, which is actually different identity providers connecting&nbsp;to each e-ID issuer. And we’re splitting this up, you can facilitate several things, because&nbsp;the signing portal and the support service is – those are the only components that are hit by&nbsp;the document to be signed, and they are done in a way that they can be installed in our customers’ operations.&nbsp;So, by doing it that way, the document to&nbsp;be signed is never leaving our customers’ IT departments. So, they stay at our customer.&nbsp;That is one thing. And by splitting up, so you have an API towards the support service, you also&nbsp;facilitate the possibility that the customer has other e-services that also would like to use an&nbsp;API for signing documents.</p>
<p>Those two parts, the signing portal and support service are rather&nbsp;easy components, that doesn’t contain any hardware or anything like that. So, it’s easy for the&nbsp;customers to install and operate themselves. Some other customers might – doesn’t have&nbsp;that requirement. They want the software as a service solution, and we can provide that&nbsp;as well. So, that’s possible to do it that way.</p>
<p>The Digital Signing Service, containing the&nbsp;hardware secure modules, and everything around that, that we always operate ourselves,&nbsp;but that part is never hit by the documents to be signed. And then we have the&nbsp;Identification Service, which is basically SAML 2.0 IDP connecting to, to different. It can be&nbsp;used as a pure identification service only for logging into it, and e-service, for example,&nbsp;but not in this case, also for signing. So that’s how our service is split up with those&nbsp;four different components, and how we can meet all these requirements that we have from the&nbsp;customer. But it is possible to do it this way.</p>
<p>And for the signing portal, we – it is a rather simple web page, and it has a basic structure, but we can customise it for our customers. So, if a municipality use that, we can customise it for that municipality; so it states the name and everything. So, the user feels that they are in the same. But when connecting to the support service then the – our customers can fully integrate and have everything that is shown to the users and the e-service that the agency provide. So that’s a little bit how it works and how it’s set up.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Actually, one topic, I think you mentioned a little bit, maybe to&nbsp;understand even better is the self-supporting signed document. Right? So, you said – tell&nbsp;us a bit more about that, how it works.</p>
<p>Magnus: If taking a PDF, for example, the&nbsp;standard we use are PDF advanced electronic signatures. When I say that agency for digital&nbsp;government, the technical framework is based on eIDAS. So, it’s international standards that&nbsp;is based on. And when I say self-sustaining, then I mean that it should be able to validate the&nbsp;document to the person who has signed it, using only the document.</p>
<p>It isn’t really through, but&nbsp;you don’t need SignPort in order to validate it. You just need the public key from our signing&nbsp;service. And that’s the only thing you need, then you can validate the signature to the&nbsp;person who has signed the document. And the public key is – it can be downloaded, it can&nbsp;be stored, so that you have it. But it’s public service, so it’s, once it’s out, it is possible&nbsp;to achieve later on. But if you have that, you can validate the document to the person.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;then you can do, for example, if a government, an agency received a signed document, you&nbsp;can validate it and extract the person, electronically, that has signed a document&nbsp;provided that you rely on our public key. But then you also include the verification list in&nbsp;the document, so you can see that when it was signed, the identity wasn’t revoked. So, it’s sustainable also over time, together with a signed timestamp as well. So, basically, that makes it, self-supporting.</p>
<p>There might be other ways to&nbsp;do this onwards, the standards aren’t really set&nbsp;yet. But this is how we do it, in order to achieve this. Possibilities there are very replaceable,&nbsp;but it’s a good thing, I guess, if looking at.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. You have mentioned also that, a big part of your requirements come from the public service, and you’re following what needs to&nbsp;be comply in Sweden. So, let’s focus on that. So, what are signature service must comply in Sweden?</p>
<p>Magnus: It is for the public sector. In Sweden, the agency for digital government, they have&nbsp;set up a technical framework and a normative specification, and this setup addresses all&nbsp;the requirements that I listed above. So, it’s not a requirement on the public sector in&nbsp;Sweden, but it is the recommendation. And if following it, it will be much easier when,&nbsp;for example, different agencies collaborate and send documents between each other, if the signed&nbsp;documents follow the standard, the same standard. And there is also a requirement to&nbsp;connect to foreign eID, eIDAS.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you – it isn’t that many&nbsp;countries that is connected foreign eID yet. But, for example, if someone from Germany would like&nbsp;to use e-services in Sweden, it’s possible. Also, Denmark and several other countries, and there&nbsp;are more upcoming. So, there is a possibility to use also within Europe, both for identification&nbsp;and signing.</p>
<p>For the private sector, it isn’t – of course, there are requirements that the service&nbsp;has to be easy to use. I think that’s the main thing. But otherwise, there aren’t that,&nbsp;must have requirements as I believe on, when it comes to security or sustainability, and so on that. Maybe companies would like such things, but it isn’t a real requirement. So, you can use more or less whatever signing service you like. And there are many, and that’s OK. So, what we’ve seen in private sector is mainly, we have some customers, but they are mainly connected to either health care or law, when you’re more close to the public sector. So that’s what we’ve seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Definitely a good overview&nbsp;how signatures have being applied in Sweden. I would like to ask a final question. So, for all&nbsp;business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that&nbsp;they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Magnus: Yeah. I think if you do not yet&nbsp;have a digital signature service, get one. It’s so much more efficient and sustainable than&nbsp;paper. So, if you don’t have one, get one. And when getting one, think about the future, how is&nbsp;the validity of the signed document proven over time? What happens in collaboration with other&nbsp;parties? And also, what happens when replacing the supplier, what’s next? I think those things you&nbsp;should consider when choosing a signature service.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, excellent. Excellent, Magnus,&nbsp;for this final recommendation. So please, yeah, let us know if someone would like to follow the&nbsp;conversation with you, or follow the work you’re doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Magnus: If you want to reach me, I think it’s easiest on an email address, which&nbsp;is magnus.kardell@knowit.sc, M-A-G-N-U-S dot K-A-R-D-E-L-L @knowit.sc. So, you can reach me&nbsp;there. And I believe we’ll set up a home page for SignPort, there is one, but I think we will update it soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Again, thank you, Magnus, for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Magnus: Yeah, thanks a lot.</p>

  <p>Decentralized Identity protection is important in data collaboration because it helps to protect the privacy and security of individuals and organizations involved in the supply chain. By ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information, identity protection helps to prevent data breaches and other security incidents. &nbsp;A chain of trust establishes a series of checks and verifications that ensure that the data being shared is accurate and trustworthy. This is critical in the context of supply chain regulations, where inaccurate or incomplete information can have serious consequences for compliance and risk management.</p>
<p>In the second part of the talk, we will explore the concept of adaptive protection for identities in Microsoft Purview. By using a combination of machine learning, behavioral analysis, and risk-based decision making, we can create a dynamic system that adapts to new threats in real time. This approach offers a more proactive and effective way to safeguard identities, and can be applied across a range of industries and contexts. Together, we can work to develop a more robust and resilient digital identity ecosystem that protects individuals and organizations alike.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/adaptive-protection-for-identities-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Authorization in modern applications is becoming increasingly complex, particularly when it comes to managing access to resources at the individual user and group levels. OAuth has become a widely-used standard for granting access to resources on behalf of a user, but it is not well-suited for these more nuanced use cases. In this talk, we will explore the confusion surrounding the use of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization in applications. We will discuss the standard meaning of authorization in OAuth, which is to grant access for an application to call APIs on behalf of the user, and how misusing OAuth for this purpose can lead to bad architecture and bloated JWT tokens. We will also introduce alternative standards like UMA (User-Managed Access) and GNAP (Group-Based Nested Access Protocol) as potential solutions for user and group-controlled resource delegation. These standards provide a more fine-grained and dynamic approach to access control and can be integrated with policies created by a PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control) server for a more comprehensive solution. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the limitations of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization, and with a clear understanding of the potential of UMA and GNAP as solutions for these use cases.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-modern-applications-eic2023"></a>

The digital wallet will also ad to the way we get ready to travel and add verifiable credentials that travellers can share in advance of their trip.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallet-travel-tourism-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The Common Ground movement of the Dutch municipalities is developing innovative solutions for greater interoperability. An important part of this is the data landscape, where functionality is accessed through microservice API’s. In the analysis of this architecture, one aspect is barely touched upon: The Access Control aspect in API’s is not appropriately co-developed.</p>
<p>The Municipality of The Hague has performed a Proof Of Architecture (the POA) to demonstrate that it is possible to unlock an existing API in which access is not explicitly modeled, or that still uses traditional Role Based Access Control methods internally, restricting interoperability across contexts.</p>
<p>The POA is done in an effective and efficient way through innovative 'zero trust architecture' concepts, such as Policy Based Access Control. Security and privacy are thus demonstrably realized in accordance with legal requirements. The POA proves that it is technically feasible to add input-filtering of access requests to ignore the restricting RBAC method and thereby open doors for municipalities for interoperability in an autonomous and secure way.</p>
<p>During the presentation the working principles of API access from a perspective of Identity &amp; Access Management are explained, but also how these principles can be applied in practice in an existing application landscape.</p>
<p>The presentation will be a joint presentation between the lead architect of the City of The Hague, Jan Verbeek, and access strategist André Koot.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/access-control-microservice-architectures-for-zta-eic2023"></a>

But it tends to be time consuming and costly due to lack of expertise to do so. Buying a heavy-weight solution is another considerable option, but it reluctantly leads dependency on the particular vendor of the solution, which may have redundant features and may not accommodate to customize in a cost-effective and timely manner. In this session, we will discuss a third option to “buy and build” that can combine the best of both worlds and give you control by building from scratch, as well as minimize the time and resource by leveraging “Identity Components as a Service.”</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/security-enterprises-gain-control-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The shift to multi-cloud introduces a wide range of cloud security risks that remain unaddressed due to the siloed approach and limited focus of existing cloud security tools. Most cloud security tools offer highly focused solutions that are limited in scope and capabilities to address the growing spectrum of multi-cloud security risks. The convergence of IAM and multi-cloud security tools (CSPM, CWP and CIEM) offer a cloud security platform that takes an integrated approach to securely manage identities and their access entitlements to cloud resources for cloud-native application development, deployment and operations in the cloud. In this session, we will discuss:</p>
 
 What are the emerging archetypes of IAM and multi-cloud security tools convergence? 
 What are the essential building blocks to effectively address your code-to-cloud security risks in a multi-cloud environment? 
 What are the industry best practices and recommendations to deploy and operationalize multi-cloud security tools for best results?

  <p>Common Web3 narratives go like this: Web1 was decentralised. Web2 is centralised and dominated by GAFAM/BigTechs. Web3 will be decentralised.<br><br>Is this real?<br><br>Let us look back. Web1 was about publishing web pages that were linked to other pages. The publishing sites were decentralised all over and were connected by links. Schematics resembled spider webs. Thus, the name “web”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web2 was the read-write web. In other words, API Economy. Was it a centralised architecture? Definitely not. What we imagined as Web 2.0 back in 2004 was that instead of monolithic systems, each site provides a function as REST API, and new services quickly emerge by combining these APIs like LEGO. APIs were decentralised and distributed all over the internet. API calling relationships connected those sites; the schematics resembled a spider web. Thus, the name Web 2.0.<br><br>Note, in 2004, none of Google, Amazon, Facebook/Meta, or Apple resembled what we have now.<br>Google just acquired Double Click, but it still had the banner word “Do not do evil.” The size of the company was 1/10 of Hitachi. Amazon still was an internet merchant. Facebook was just founded, but it still was primarily confined to Harvard and other American university students. Apple was an iPod and Mac company. Were they BigTechs? No! Big guys were IBM, Hitachi, etc., and Google, Facebook etc. were carrying the liberation torch!<br><br>Then, how come we end up here, despite the fact that the architecture was completely decentralised?<br><br>It was the combination of free market competition and technology that exhibited increasing returns. Any IT technology has decreasing cost/increasing return on investment. Under the circumstances, it will end up in Cournot equilibrium in a fashionable vocabulary - in a common word; winner takes all - monopoly/oligopoly. That’s how we ended up.<br><br>What about web3 and decentralised identity? Would the decentralisation dream finally come true?<br><br>Well, they still are IT. They still exhibit increasing return necessarily. Then, how can you believe that it will not be dominated by large players just like it happened to Web 2.0? If you let the free market play, it will certainly be. Unlike in the case of Web 2.0 where there still were 100s of thousands of IdPs, we may end up with two Wallets where the wallet provider can come in and decide to delete your verified credentials or ban your account. How decentralised!<br><br>Wait, there is more.<br><br>How can you believe that code that runs on your phone adheres to what it says?<br>The data stored on your wallet that runs on your phone may be extracting your data and sending it to criminals. We have seen many times that the initially benign code turns malicious with an update.<br><br>According to the Devil's Dictionary of Linguistic Dark Patterns compiled at IIW 2022b, “Decentralised” means “We run our code on your machine at your own risk”. Yes, at your own risk. If it is completely “decentralised” and there is no “provider”, then there is nobody to go after from the point of view of a regulator. Having a “centralised” provider is much better from a consumer protection point of view in this respect.<br><br>Is there no light? Are we going to live in the darkness of decentralisation?<br><br>Let us briefly think about what web3 was supposed to be. Forget about something that is found between A and Z. I am not talking about that. I am talking about cypher-punks' idealistic dreams.<br>Many people believe that blockchain is just an immutable ledger. No, it is not! That’s not the innovation of blockchain. Chained immutable records were there long before Satoshi’s invention. It is called Hysteresis signature and was invented in 1999.<br>Then, what was the innovation? it was the committing of the code into the it to make it immutable and executing it by multiple machines to exclude the result from changed code. In other words, it was the establishment of trust in the running code.<br>The light could be diminishingly small, but it still is light. That’s the light that I see in web3 that’s not between A and Z.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/fallacy-of-decentralisation-eic2023"></a>

<p>The resulting vulnerabilities can have significant consequences therefore, it is essential to be able to monitor the true permissions at any time, regardless of how the permissions have been set.

  <p>The EU funded Next Generation Internet (NGI) Atlantic project "Next Generation SSI Standards" and the Walmart funded Jobs for the Future (JFF) Plugfest, both have the same aim of fostering wide scale adoption of Verifiable Credentials. They are doing this by funding global interworking of Verifiable Credentials products from many different suppliers located in Europe, the USA and Asia. The NGI Atlantic project is committed to using the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OIDC4VCs) draft standard specifications, whilst JFF is allowing the 30+ participants to decide amongst themselves which protocols to use. Three protocol suites have been chosen: OIDC4VCs, VC-API with CHAPI, and DIDComm.<br><br>This presentation will provide an overview of the two projects, will provide an overview of the 3 protocol suites that have been chosen, and will present the results of the interworking trials.<br><br>The NGI Atlantic project will finish in December 2022, and besides interworking trials, will deliver an open source test suite that suppliers can use to test their implementations for conformance to the OIDC4VCs protocol suit for both credential issuing and verification. Some tests are being added to the W3C CCG Traceability test suite (written in POSTMAN) and some are being added to the Open ID Foundation's existing OpenID Connect conformance test suite (written in Java).</p>
<p>The JFF Plugfest will finish in 1Q2023. In November 2022 each VC Issuing software supplier must demonstrate the issuing of a verifiable credential to the wallets of at least two different wallet software providers, whilst each wallet software provider must obtain a verifiable credential from at least two other VC Issuing software providers. In February 2023 VC wallets must demonstrate the presentation of a Verifiable Presentation/Verifiable Credential to at least two different verification software suppliers, and each verifier must demonstrate that it is capable of accepting a VP/VC from at least two different wallets.<br><br>The success of these projects should catapult the acceptance of inter-workable verifiable credential products to the market.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/verifiable-credential-products-eic2023"></a>

Today identity provider solutions for finance, healthcare and other regulated markets follow central approaches for the management of identities and consent in high secure data center environments and using legacy standards (e.g. OIDC, central public key infrastructure).</p>
<p>eIDAS 2.0 creates a EU wide identity ecosystem with adapted new standards, new stakeholders and a focus on using mobile devices. The existing roadmap allows to anticipate three to five years (or more) transition. For banking, insurance, healthcare or the public sector it is time to adopt these standards in their digital transformation strategy.</p>
<p>Based on the Gematik requirements for a federated identity provider with central OIDC compliant resource and authorization server Comuny shifted relevant identity provider functions (data storage + token generation) on the mobile device.</p>
<p>The speakers will describe challenges and solutions for this regulated market. They also discuss the chance to combine existing central OIDC flows with mobile decentral, wallet based principles as a bridge into the new eIDAS 2.0 governance framework. The audience will get a clear understanding about requirements, opportunities and practice details to create the transition into eIDAS 2.0 identity ecosystem.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eu-wallet-eidas2-european-identity-framework-eic2023"></a>

   OAuth is a widely used authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user. However, it has been historically difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last five years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.

  <p>OAuth is a widely used authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user. However, it has been historically difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last five years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.<br> <br> There are challenges when trying to achieve high security and interoperability with OAuth 2: Many potential threats need to be addressed, some not part of the original OAuth threat model. To seamless authorizations, optionality must be minimized OAuth itself and also in any extensions<br> used.<br> <br> Six years ago, the IETF OAuth working group started work on the Security Best Current Practice document and more recently on OAuth 2.1. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation has created FAPI1 and FAPI2 security profiles.<br> <br> We will introduce these specifications and help you understand the focus of each document and when to use which. We show how to achieve on-the-wire interoperability and high security through the use of techniques like asymmetric client authentication and sender-constraining via DPoP and MTLS. We highlight the benefits for implementers and the role of conformance testing tools.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/high-security-interoperable-oauth2-eic2023"></a>

  <p>OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC) is a set of protocols that enables issuance and presentation of verifiable credentials expressed in any format including but not limited to W3C vc-data-model and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mDL. The power of the protocols lies in its demonstrated simplicity, security, and the implementer's ability to make choices across the tech stack - not just for credential formats, but also entity identifiers, trust model, crypto suites, revocation mechanism, etc. However, this also means that to be interoperable and enable certain use-cases(s), implementers need to agree on the sets of choices across the tech stack, usually referred to as interoperability profiles. <br> <br> In this talk, we will share implementation experience of OID4VC specifications, and introduce existing interoperability profiles based on OID4VC. Of course we will also provide updates to OID4VC specifications, how they have evolved from the last year based on an overwhelming amount of implementation feedback.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/interopeable-decentralized-identity-openid-eic2023"></a>

  <p>OpenID Connect Federation enables trust establishment at scale and is being deployed to do so in Europe.</p>
<p>A key question when granting access to resources is “Who do you trust?”.&nbsp; It’s often important to know who the party is that you’re interacting with and whether they’ve agreed to the terms and conditions that apply when accessing a resource.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect enables identities of participants to be securely established but doesn’t answer the question of whether a participant is trusted to access a resource such as your personal data.&nbsp; A complementary mechanism is needed to do that.&nbsp; In small-scale and static deployments, it’s possible to keep a list of the trusted participants.&nbsp; However, in large-scale and dynamic deployments, that doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe how the OpenID Connect Federation protocol enables scalable trust establishment with dynamic policies.&nbsp; It does so by employing trust hierarchies of authorities, each of which are independently administered.&nbsp; Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations, departments within organizations, and individual sites.</p>
<p>Two OpenID Connect Federations are deployed in Italy, enabling secure access to digital services operated by Italian public and private services with Italian digital identities.&nbsp; This presentation will also describe why OpenID Connect Federation was selected for them and how it meets their needs.&nbsp; OpenID Connect Federation is being used by the GAIN PoC.&nbsp; A public deployment is also being planned in Sweden.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/who-to-trust-eic2023"></a>

There has never been more urgency than now to focus on strategy and technology to meet the demands of the privacy-conscious consumer.&nbsp; The collection of data and its management is core to this challenge, but current identity methods are missing the opportunity to solve it with legacy approaches and risk-based thinking. At IndyKite, we believe that facing this mounting challenge requires us to make leaps in both our thinking and technology implementations. Join us as we challenge the current operating state and discuss what the world might look like when we have the tools to power a truly customer-centric ecosystem - one where consumer data ownership and personalized services that fuel growth are no longer at odds.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ahead-of-the-curve-eic2023"></a>

This keynote, by the inventor of CAEP, goes into the pain points that led to the development of CAEP, the process to recast it as a part of the Shared Signals working group in the OpenID Foundation and the trends that make it an indispensable component of any zero-trust architecture. CAEP’s non-prescriptive nature makes it easy for anyone to implement their own policies and the Shared Signals Framework makes communicating changes efficient and nearly instantaneous.

  <p>Deciding what constitutes appropriate access to sensitive information is a growing challenge for today’s enterprise. Whether it is regarding securing mission critical enterprise data or protecting the privacy of data gathered about the organization’s customers, an often-overlooked element is capturing and documenting the reasons why a given access request or entitlement is necessary and appropriate for the continued operation of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizations are required to manage the data that they are entrusted with in a secure, purpose-based, and privacy-compliant manner.&nbsp; Identity Governance processes can help the enterprise review the current state of access, make decisions regarding the validity of this access state, and attest to its accuracy.&nbsp; Identity Governance processes are also ideally suited to also document the reasons why this access state is appropriate and necessary for business operations.</p>
<p>This session will cover how Identity Governance processes can help enterprises refine their security, make better access control decisions, and provide much clearer accountability around why access is granted – all in better alignment with Zero Trust initiatives.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-governance-with-purpose-eic-2023"></a>

<p>In this session, we look at the intersection of IAM and Zero Trust, and provide a mapping of IAM capabilities to Zero Trust requirements. We also look at the need for modern IAM, from adaptive, passwordless authentication to continuous authentication, ITPR (Identity Threat Detection and Response), PBAM (Policy Based Access Management), but also Data Governance and the intersection of IAM and Code Security. This will help you in aligning your IAM and ZT strategies and give you a concrete understanding of technologies you will need (or not).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-first-zero-trust-implementation-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Cash.App is the #1 financial app in the US. It started out with a password-less authentication paradigm back in 2013, built around OTP verifications. We are now transitioning to the next generation password-less experience built around passkey. While the transition offers many promises, the path comes with several challenges, around security guarantees, backward compatibility and seamless user experience. We share insights we learned along the journey.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/challenges-next-gen-passwordless-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The Zero Trust paradigm, the approach of eliminating inherent trust in an IT architecture and always verifying, has been discussed for over a decade. It is well known that Zero Trust is a team sport, with Identity in the center. The many components, from IGA to Device Management, Network-segmentation to contextual awareness and beyond can be fulfilled by as many vendors, bearing the question about how to integrate these for a secure and convenient user experience. While there may be integrations available for some components, they will most likely be disjointed and/or require custom development, making it a challenge to be agile and innovative.<br> <br> An alternative to the described problem would be Orchestrating Zero Trust, applying the approach of "Detect, Decide, Direct". Through Orchestration the task of gathering all signals and relevant information (Detect) for an appropriate authorization decision (Decide), and continuing with the proper next step(s) (Direct) can be fulfilled in a flexible manner, facilitating customization in a future proof manner.<br> <br> In this session we will describe the "Detect, Decide, Direct" approach and see how Orchestration can be a key enabler of Zero Trust.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/orchestrating-zero-trust-eic2023"></a>

Adversaries simply copy, break, or brute-force their way in. Why, then, have we spent decades with passwords as the primary factor for authentication?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry needs to trust passwordless authentication (FIDO2). Adversaries and then criminals have circumvented our authentication controls for decades. From the very first theft of cleartext passwords to the very latest bypass of a second-factor, time and again improvements in defenses are met with improved attacks.</p>
<p>What holds us back from getting rid of passwords? Trust. In this session, we will propose a framework of technical controls to ensure only trusted sessions authenticate, regardless of faults or failures in any one factor, and to reassess based on shared signals (CAEP). We will share a path forward for increasing trust in passwordless authentication.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/trust-in-passwordless-authentication-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Identity and access have always been joined at the hip. In the age of LDAP, authenticated users were granted permissions based on group membership. But this mechanism hasn’t transferred into the federated identity landscape. <br><br> Instead, modern identity systems try to generalize permissions into scopes that are embedded into access tokens. But this doesn’t facilitate fine-grained authorization - a “read:document” scope doesn’t typically mean the user can access every document! <br><br> While identity has moved to the cloud, we still don’t have fine-grained, scalable mechanisms for generalizing authorization. So every application builds its own, and IT ends up administering every application differently.<br><br> Fixing this is arguably the most pressing challenge for the IAM industry. In this talk, we propose a set of principles, inspired by zero-trust and the latest work in cloud-native authorization, that should underlie the solutions we build:</p>
 
 Support for fine-grained authorization (both ABAC and ReBAC), delivering on the principle of least privilege. Google’s Zanzibar provides an important blueprint. 
 Managing authorization policy-as-code, enabling separation of duties and policy-based access management. Open Policy Agent is a good building block. 
 Performing real-time access checks for continuous verification. This function should be downstream from authentication. 
 Collecting fine-grained decision logs, providing the underpinning for comprehensive offline auditing and access analysis.

  <p>The adoption of multiple clouds is accelerating across all industries. While multi-cloud brings many benefits, it also results in new challenges. Organizations must manage platform-specific access policies in the bespoke policy syntax of each cloud. <br> Security and risk gaps arise between cloud identity systems due to the increased policy fragmentation and technical complexity that can obscure visibility and make it difficult to determine who has access to what. <br> These challenges grow exponentially when you consider the various access policies (and system languages) associated with each data, network, and platform layer (and vendor) in an organization’s tech stack.<br> This session will describe an open-source solution to multi-cloud access policy fragmentation: Identity Query Language (IDQL) and Hexa Orchestration. IDQL and Hexa are two sides of the same coin that together perform policy orchestration across incompatible cloud platforms. <br> IDQL is the universal declarative policy language that can be translated into a target system's proprietary or bespoke access policy format. Hexa is the open-source reference software that brings IDQL to life and makes it operational in the real world by connecting to target systems and performing the three main functions of discovery, translation, and orchestration.<br> Hexa Policy Orchestration was recently accepted as a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project. The session will include a technical review of Hexa plus a demonstration of current capabilities.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standadizing-access-policies-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Every cloud-native application needs some form of access control. Most applications provide role-based access control (RBAC), which has limitations when it comes to enterprise scale and fine-grained access control.&nbsp;<br>Zero trust architectures require us to go further. Following the principle of least privilege, modern cloud apps can implement just in time authorization with fine-grained controls. With a fine-grained model, access rules can be defined on the application’s resources, often down to individual items. And a just-in-time model helps ensure the user has access to what they need, when they need it.<br><br>Two ecosystems are emerging around modern authorization: Policy-as-code and policy-as-data. Open Policy Agent (OPA) brings a policy-as-code approach to fine-grained authorization, and Google’s Zanzibar is the most known representative of the policy-as-data camp.<br>Join the panelists to discuss new developments in modern authorization, and compare the strengths and weaknesses of policy-as-code and policy-as-data as foundational models for a robust access control system.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/modern-authorization-eic-2023"></a>

<p>It was a huge puzzle to identify and solve all the critical actual and future needs of the different business use cases for e-signing across the company to come up with a singe corporate solution and move gradually away from the very fragmented and mainly technically driven landscape of signing solutions.</p>
<p>Traditionally those have been introduced as the ad-hoc remedy to some local needs in isolation from other initiatives and without proper validation of both short and long term legal impact to the company.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/e-signing-insurance-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>The term “Identity Fabrics” stands for a paradigm and concept of a comprehensive and integrated set of Identity Services, delivering the capabilities required for providing seamless and controlled access for everyone to every service. Identity Fabrics support various types of identities such as employees, partners, consumers, or things. They deliver the full range of identity services required by an organization.</p>
<p>Identity Fabrics are not necessarily based on a technology, tool, or cloud service, but a paradigm for architecting IAM within enterprises. Commonly, the services are provided by a combination of several tools and services, with up to three solutions forming the core of the Identity Fabric. Most organizations that are using this paradigm as a foundation for the evolution of their overall IAM tend to build on a strong core platform for delivering major features and complementing this by other solutions.</p>
<p>We will look at what must be in every Identity Fabric, and how to evolve from a foundational Identity Fabrics approach towards a higher level of maturity. The session will look at concrete capabilities per maturity level and service group within Identity Fabrics.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-fabrics-maturity-levels-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>Managing access is a critical capability for the IT infrastructure of any enterprise, especially when dealing with over 6,800 integrated applications used by millions of authentication requests. Due to the increasing demand for availability, scalability, and support for market-specific customizations, as well as the migration of more products and applications to the cloud, we had to migrate our infrastructure and application stack to the AWS cloud. This stack had been introduced in an on-premises setup in 2017 and now follows modern paradigms such as GitOps, Everything as Code, and highly automated processes based on Service Layers and ForgeRock. Our main concern was ensuring that the integrated application landscape remained functional during the migration without experiencing any impact or downtime.<br><br> During this presentation, we will share our experience and discuss the key takeaways from our successful large-scale production system migration to the cloud, including:</p>
 
 Understanding the target architecture for the migration project 
 Identifying the challenges that arise during cloud migration 
 Discovering strategies for minimizing the impact on integrated applications during the migration process.

  <p>Engineers across organizations struggle with increased anxiety and stress every time they hit the push button to make complex system changes. One mistake can hinder business as usual, introduce unnecessary risks, and cause non-compliance with policies that can cripple the whole organization.</p>
<p>Simulations could be the answer engineers are looking for. They are used in various fields to study complex systems and help engineers create hypothetical scenarios to see the impact of certain changes before implementing them.</p>
<p>In this presentation, the Evolveum Development Team Leader, Katarina Bolemant, will explain the motivation and common pain points of deploying an IGA solution. She will show you the endless possibilities of using simulations to evaluate the impact of changes and how to identify potential issues and reduce the risks of errors. Using simulations will lift the burden off engineers’ shoulders, increase confidence in their decisions, and build stronger relationships with other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Offer a peek into the future, and both technical personnel and decision makers will appreciate you for providing the possibility to review the simulated results and make necessary adjustments before implementing changes in the production environment.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-iga-eic-2023"></a>

   In 1994, Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti discovered something: cities expand as a function of transportation speed.

  <p>In 1994, Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti discovered something: cities expand as a function of transportation speed. In short, “transportation is the lifeblood of a city.” Innovation in transportation has driven the expansion of cities—from small, walkable areas to the sprawling, car-based metropolises, presenting a challenge for urban planners.</p>
<p>Identity in the modern organization faces a similar challenge: if transportation is the lifeblood of cities, then identity is the lifeblood of organizations. And our organizations are not ancient, walkable Rome, but modern, sprawling Atlanta—with identities and resources widely strewn around the globe.</p>
<p>Like urban planners, we face a nearly-intractable challenge: how can we provide access to resources and data easily while still meeting the stringent demands of security and compliance?</p>
<p>Thankfully, there appears to be a solution for both urban planning *and* identity, albeit from an unexpected source: Ordinary slime mold. Aka, “The Blob.”</p>
<p>We’ll learn from this simple organism, describe how its simple actions create complex systems that solve these sorts of “unsolvable” problems, and see how the Blob might “think” about identity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/urban-planning-identity-eic-2023"></a>

You've been told that a well-developed identity architecture plan is the best way solve business challenges and produce concrete results but your research and fully-notated diagrams have failed to engage your peers.<br> <br> Many times this is because the architecture was designed by architects for architects without inout from those who are most impacted by the existing legacy technololgies. Architects tend to be more isolated from the actual business so focus more on things like ArchiMate notation and TOGAF frameworks.<br> <br> Steve "Hutch" Hutchinson will share his own decades of architecture experience and provide attendees with proven methods to make your architecture artifacts relatable to your front-line business workers, understandable by your technical peers from across cyber/IT, and provide demonstratable value to your organization's senior leadership. These same methods will allow you to shepherd your organization to a modern identity econsystem on a budget and timetable purpose fit for your organization's needs and culture.</p>

  <p>IDaaS, the SaaS-delivered IAM, helps organizations &nbsp;&nbsp;releasing themselves from a considerable part of the burden that IAM brings. They don’t need to care for software installation and running servers. However, IDaaS is only part of the answer&nbsp; here. Customers still must&nbsp; &nbsp;managed and run their IAM environment.</p>
<p>This is where MSPs (Managed Service Providers) and their services come in . They help the organizations in managing major parts of IAM, from onboarding of systems to customization and configuration, but also for a good share of the business-oriented aspects.</p>
<p>MSPs also can help organizations in providing a real IDaaS in the sense of customers/tenants just ordering services, without even caring about the technology below. They buy the services delivered by an Identity Fabric that is built and run by their service provider (which then again might rely on one or more SaaS services).</p>
<p>In this panel, we will discuss how such a “managed Identity Fabric” can look like and what this means to both the MSPs and their tenants. We’ll specifically focus on what distincts such a managed Identity Fabric from just a standard IDaaS offering, and from a MSP operating the IAM the customer already has in place. We’ll discuss the main criteria and capabilities for selecting the managed Identity Fabric.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/managed-identity-fabric-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>Serverless technology eliminates the need for development teams to provision servers, and it also results in some security threats being passed to the cloud provider. This frees up developers to concentrate on building logic and producing value quickly. But cloud functions still execute code. If the software is written poorly, it can lead to a cloud disaster.</p>
<p>How can developers ensure that their code is secure enough? They can scan for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in open-source code. They can even scan their Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool to identify insecure configurations. But what about custom code? At many organizations, the application security team struggles to keep up with the speed of development in a serverless environment. Traditional testing tools not only provide very limited coverage, but also slow development cycles unacceptably. Serverless code contains a mixture of cloud configurations and application programming interfaces (API) calls. As a result, legacy solutions lack the context that is necessary in a serverless environment, and the consequence is a lack of observability and slower response times.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it does not have to be this way. Organizations can leverage robust security during serverless development, automatically—if it is done properly. In this talk, we will discuss common risks in serverless environments. We will then cover existing testing methodologies and why they do not work well for serverless.

  <p>For more than two decades, Microsoft Active Directory (AD) has been the de facto method organizations use to authenticate and authorize users for access to computers, devices, and applications within a company’s network. Most companies still rely on it and have further extended its reach into the cloud by synchronizing their on-prem AD with the Microsoft Azure AD to allow proper SSO to cloud-applications by their users. AD is celebrated for its extensive compatibility with various applications and Windows editions, but that compatibility comes with security downsides.</p>
<p>Compromises of Active Directory can occur as an entry point leading to a further attack or can arise at various other points along the kill-chain following an initial compromise via some other mechanism. Even in cases where a compromise is gained following an attack on applications or infrastructure directly, it is frequently infeasible for an attacker to progress further without elevating privileges, making Active Directory a primary target in an overall breach strategy.</p>
<p>It is therefore important that Active Directory defense tools are paired with a wider Zero Trust and XDR approach to provide full visibility over organizational infrastructure, enabling security teams to accurately identify the point of origin of an attack, and to perform the containment and remediation actions required to neutralize and prevent reoccurrence of an attack.</p>
<p>Join Principal Technologist, Guido Grillenmeier, to discuss AD access points used in recent cyberattacks, security risks to watch for in managing AD with Azure AD, how to look for warning signs that AD has been compromised and steps to take in the event of an attack.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/active-directory-as-cyber-attack-target-eic2023"></a>

 How Self-Sovereign Identity Can Protect Us from the Threats of AI and Digital Deception 
<p><a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=Artificial%20Intelligence%20%2DAI%2D">Artificial intelligence</a> has brought remarkable advances to various fields, including healthcare, finance, and education, among others. However, it also poses significant challenges in terms of cybersecurity and privacy. With the proliferation of deepfakes, bots, and other sophisticated digital deception tools, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish what’s real from what’s not. This has led to a surge in cyber attacks and identity theft, with devastating consequences for individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>In the age of AI, we need a new framework of trust and verification to combat these threats. Enter <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=S-,Self%2Dsovereign%20identity,-(SSI)">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, a decentralized technology that empowers individuals to own and control their identity data, without relying on centralized authorities. SSI is based on blockchain, a distributed ledger that records transactions securely and transparently, without the need for intermediaries. This makes it a perfect fit for protecting our identity and privacy in the digital realm.</p>
 SSI is built on a set of principles that ensure its security and reliability. These include: 
 
 User-controlled / <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=User%2Dcentric%20Identity%C2%A0%20Model">User-Centric</a>: Individuals have full control over their identity data and can choose who to share it with, when, and for what purpose. 
 <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=Decentralized%20(adjective)">Decentralized</a>: Identity information is stored on a distributed network of nodes, which makes it resilient to attacks and prevents single points of failure. 
 Interoperable: SSI systems can communicate and exchange data with other SSI systems, creating a universal standard for identity verification. 
 <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=interface%2C%20or%20system.-,V,-VC%20(verifiable%20credential">Verifiable</a>: Identity data is cryptographically secured and can be verified without revealing sensitive information, ensuring privacy and authenticity. 
 
<p>By leveraging these principles, SSI can provide a new level of trust and authentication, protecting us from the dangers of digital deception and identity fraud.</p>
 Here are some examples of how SSI can be applied in different fields: 
<p>Healthcare: SSI can enable patients to own and manage their health records, granting access to healthcare providers on a need-to-know basis. This can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive medical information and ensure data accuracy.</p>
<p>Finance: SSI can enable individuals to verify their identity and credentials for financial transactions, without relying on centralized intermediaries. This can reduce the risk of identity theft and improve the efficiency of financial processes.</p>
<p>Education: SSI can enable students to verify their academic credentials and qualifications, creating a secure and tamper-proof record of their achievements. This can prevent credential fraud and simplify the verification process for employers.</p>
An image generated with artificial intelligence on the web <a href="https://labs.openai.com/">DALL.E</a>
<p>In conclusion, the rise of AI has brought unprecedented challenges to our digital identity and privacy. However, with the power of SSI, we can reclaim control over our identity data. Also, we can create a new framework of trust and authentication.</p>
<p>By adopting decentralized technology, we can protect ourselves from the threats of digital deception and identity fraud. That’s helps to ensuring a safer and more secure future for all.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 24th April to 8th&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap, your biweekly dose of the latest crypto regulatory news and developments from around the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>In this edition, we delve into New York’s investor protection legislation, Liechtenstein’s updated blockchain laws, Montana’s mining-friendly measures, North Carolina’s stance on CBDC payments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Crypto Crossroads: Global Regulatory Shifts and Political Engagement Reshaping the Industry Landscape <p>Over the past two weeks, the cryptocurrency industry has experienced a series of interconnected regulatory developments and political engagements across various jurisdictions, including recent news about the New York Attorney General (NYAG) proposing new crypto legislation and Liechtenstein adjusting its blockchain laws.</p><p>The Bahamas’ SCB has introduced new regulations aligning with international standards, showcasing how governments strive to balance innovation with adequate oversight.</p><p>In Europe, Liechtenstein is adapting its blockchain laws in response to the evolving crypto landscape, including the Token and Trusted Technology Service Providers Act (TVTG) and the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. These efforts aim to create a more secure and regulated environment for crypto users and the industry as a whole, fostering regulatory certainty and direct communication with the Financial Market Authority.</p><p>Similarly, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced legislation that she insists would safeguard investors, consumers, and the economy from the under-regulated cryptocurrency industry. Political figures such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Governor Ron DeSantis are raising crypto-related issues, with a focus on topics like proposed taxes on crypto mining and concerns over CBDCs, highlighting the growing political importance of the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>On the local and state levels, governments like those in Montana and Arkansas have enacted crypto mining-friendly measures, illustrating the gradual adoption of cryptocurrencies across different levels of governance. These efforts create favorable environments for the growth of the crypto industry and its acceptance as part of the modern financial landscape.</p><p>North Carolina, on its part, has said no to CBDCs, rejecting their use for state payments. The implications of this decision on the broader discourse surrounding CBDCs in the United States are yet to be&nbsp;seen.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1654516575100104704?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The recent news stories underline a growing interplay between the cryptocurrency industry, political discourse, and regulatory developments in various jurisdictions, including NYAG’s proposed legislation and Liechtenstein’s blockchain law adjustments.</p><p>As governments and politicians continue to navigate and adapt to this emerging landscape, the industry will likely face ongoing changes and adjustments in the coming months and&nbsp;years.</p><p>The interconnected nature of these developments suggests that a smooth transition towards a more mature and regulated crypto ecosystem is taking shape, albeit with varying degrees of caution and enthusiasm across different jurisdictions.</p> NYAG Proposes Crypto Legislation: A Mixed Bag for the Industry? <p>NY Attorney General James announced legislation to safeguard investors, consumers, and the economy from the under-regulated cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>While the proposal focuses on transparency, conflict of interest elimination, and implementing measures akin to other financial services, it presents both positive and negative implications for the industry.</p><p>Enhanced investor protection, strengthened regulatory authority, and an improved market environment will likely foster a more secure and well-regulated environment for users and businesses. These measures, in turn, can boost investor confidence and help the crypto market&nbsp;mature.</p><p>On the other hand, increased regulation may stifle innovation and create barriers to entry for new players in the industry. This could lead to reduced competition and hinder the growth of the crypto ecosystem, as smaller businesses may struggle to comply with heightened regulatory requirements.</p> Liechtenstein Adjusts Blockchain Laws <p>Liechtenstein is adapting its blockchain laws in response to the evolving crypto landscape.</p><p>The Token and Trusted Technology Service Providers Act (TVTG) has drawn crypto service providers to the country, contributing to the growth of the crypto ecosystem. These adjustments present both opportunities and challenges for the industry.</p><p>The benefits include regulatory certainty, direct communication with authorities, and broader regional influence, as Liechtenstein’s experiences are expected to shape regulatory systems across the region. These factors can help create a stable environment for growth and innovation.</p><p>The downside of adjusting blockchain laws is that the evolving regulatory landscape may create uncertainties for businesses operating in Liechtenstein.</p><p>After all, as regulations change, companies may have to invest additional resources to ensure compliance, which could divert focus from their core business activities and slow down innovation.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-dev-deep-dive-monthly-april-2023">Shyft Dev Deep Dive Monthly — April&nbsp;2023</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/demystifying-the-fatf-travel-rule-your-most-googled-questions-answered-part-2">Demystifying the FATF Travel Rule: Your Most Googled Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;2</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/south-korea-approves-first-phase-of-crypto-regulations">South Korea Approves First Phase of Crypto Regulations</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In this edition of the Projects We Love series, we feature Blockenberg, a headless CMS built on IPFS.</p> Why Build A Headless CMS? <p><a href="https://twitter.com/vorcigernix">Adam Sobotka</a> and his ETHBrno hackathon teammates were building a completely decentralized website when they stumbled across a problem. They wanted to add a blog but realized that the only options were to use a centralized service or require users to write in Markdown or JSON files. </p><p>When using a centralized service, developers spend countless hours on formatting so that the content displays correctly on the site. Users are also subject to the decisions of the centralized service provider, which ultimately controls the user data. </p><p>Using Markdown or JSON files would require content creators to learn a new skill on top of the creative work they are already doing.</p><p>After watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDXacPphcY&amp;list=PLXzKMXK2aHh7qkiGv6yZqs8AsirOkfEAB">demo of Fission's ODD SDK</a> (formerly known as Webnative), Adam realized he could create a user-friendly UI to publish articles to decentralized storage. </p><p>Adam knew that a headless CMS would help make rendering more efficient or keep it separate from the rest of the system so that one wasn't reliant on the other. It would be completely customizable from the client side, thus allowing for more flexibility to tailor the design while offering protection from censorship.</p> Using Blockenberg <p>The user experience is very similar to what we expect of a CMS. However, one point of differentiation is the login process. Blockenberg actually doesn't use passwords. Instead, it uses cryptographic keys and stores them on the user's machine according to the <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN spec</a>. Users can also delegate access to collaborators.</p><p>Once the user drafts a blog post and publishes it, the data is stored on IPFS and persisted by Fission's pinning service (this is the default, but users can always choose how they want to pin their data). IPFS storage is made possible by Fission's WNFS, which enables both public and private file storage. While the front end renders the blog post, the back end uses Fission's client library to fetch the data. </p><p>In order to display blog posts on Blockenberg, a client web app must be configured. It is up to the user how they would like to set this up, but Blockenberg offers both a <a href="https://github.com/vorcigernix/cms-blockenberg">Next.js</a> option and an <a href="https://github.com/vorcigernix/blockenclient">Astro</a> option. </p> Next Steps <p>The plan is for Blockenberg to add more features to improve collaboration. For example, concurrent writing is an option, but there is a bit more work that needs to be completed before rolling this feature out. </p><p>Backward compatibility is another improvement Adam would like to make, as it would enable better filtering options in the future. </p><p>On a similar note, the ability to transfer data from another CMS to Blockenberg would be another handy feature to implement, as it would encourage more folks to move to a decentralized option that can grow with their needs (and not get tied down to a particular platform).</p> Getting Started <p>Blockenberg is a great tool for creating a personal website or blog, especially for those who value privacy, decentralization, and open and democratic information sharing. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about integrating Blockenberg into your own site, visit the <a href="https://blockenberg.xyz/">Blockenberg website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockenberg_dev">Twitter</a> for more information on how to get started!</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, business and IT leaders are turning to automation to improve operational efficiency, increase employee productivity and, ultimately, boost business performance.</p>



<p>At IBM, we believe that organizations need AI coupled with automation to help developers reduce time to productivity. By empowering employees with automation and AI technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a>, IT organizations can narrow skills gaps and enable developers to write quality code with greater efficiency.</p>



 Enhance code development with greater efficiency 



<p>At this week’s <a href="http://www.ibm.com/events/think">Think 2023 conference</a>, we are previewing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-code-assistant">IBM Watson Code Assistant</a>, an innovative solution that empowers developers across all skill levels to write syntactically correct code with AI-generated recommendations.</p>



<p>Powered by <a href="http://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">IBM watsonx.ai</a> foundation models, Watson Code Assistant will increase developer productivity by providing recommended code based on natural language inputs. We’re excited about this solution because it will make hybrid cloud code development more accessible to IT professionals and help those experienced with writing automation code to become even more efficient.</p>



<p>Intended to be generally available later this year*, Watson Code Assistant is designed to reduce the complexity of coding through AI-generated content recommendations. Additionally, organizations will be able to tune the underlying foundation model and customize it with their own standards and best practices, while data-source attribution will provide transparency into the potential origins of the generated code. These features will provide organizations the confidence and flexibility they need to scale and accelerate the impact of AI across their IT organization.&nbsp;</p>



 AI for Red Hat automation 



<p>The first available use case for Watson Code Assistant will be content generation for <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible">Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</a>. The solution will enable developers from entry-level to seasoned professionals to write Ansible Playbooks with AI-generated recommendations. This capability will make it easier for beginners to learn Ansible and faster for experts to build playbooks.</p>

 ‘Data wallets’: a trap waiting to be&nbsp;sprung? <p>This is one of an occasional series examining misconceptions that people have about personal data empowerment and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Right now, there is an explosion of interest in the concept of ‘data wallets’. The EU has launched an EU Digital Identity Wallet project for example, along with growing fascination with what is being termed <a href="https://www.mydata.org/2023/04/27/wallet-wars-its-the-war-of-ecosystems/">‘wallet&nbsp;wars</a>’.</p><p>In one sense, this is a very positive development. It shows that citizens being in control of their data, and being able to use it for their own purposes, is finally being recognised as important. But it also brings new dangers with it, especially in the form of First Step&nbsp;Fallacy.</p><p>The First Step Fallacy goes like this. Say you want to achieve a goal such as reaching the moon. If you climb to the top of a skyscraper, you’ve gotten closer to your destination. Therefore, you might conclude, if you built a skyscraper ten times higher than the current one, then you’d be ten times closer to your goal. Ergo: all you have to do is build skyscrapers that get taller and taller, and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p>In fact of course, adopting this strategy is a recipe for a) 100% misallocation of resources, investing available time, energy, effort and money in something that will never get you to where you want to get, and b) 0% investment of precious resources into doing what’s needed e.g. building&nbsp;rockets.</p><p>Much of today’s fashionable talk about organisations providing their customers with ‘data wallets’ is a classic example of the First Step Fallacy at work. It’s a trap waiting to be&nbsp;sprung.</p> A word on terminology <p>Before we get into the reasons why, a quick word on terminology. In the previous sentence we put ‘data wallets’ in inverted commas to alert you to the fact that there is much confusion about the difference between data wallets and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>That’s partly because people often use the two terms interchangeably, which is confusing. But what we need to bear in mind is the assumptions and implications generated by the two terms. Most people today use their wallet to do two things. They use it to carry some cash around with them, along with other means of payments such as debit and credit cards. They may also store other information needed for specific transactions, such as membership cards or an organ donor&nbsp;card.</p><p>But there’s one thing nobody does. They never actually carry all of their money around with them in their wallet, or all of their information. It’s just too risky, difficult and unnecessary. A wallet is not the same as a bank account. The wallet might provide a useful interface between your bank account and the outside world, but it is not the bank account&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Likewise with data wallets. A data wallet may help you carry some data ‘cash’ around with you — for example, a piece of information proving that you are over 18, or have a ticket, or a driving licence. It may also provide access to your personal data store. But the data wallet is not your personal data store, just as a wallet for money is not the same as your bank account. A personal data store holds all your data, safe and secure for your whole life. A data wallet may help you draw on your personal data store to interact with the outside world, but the two are not the&nbsp;same.</p> Differences between data wallets and personal data&nbsp;stores <p>This basic terminological confusion — between a wallet that carries some of your money/data and a personal data store/bank account that carries all of it (or much more of it, at least) — is now helping to generate yet another layer of muddle: the pretence that a ‘wallet’ service that retains and extends organisations’ access to, and control over, data is the same as a personal data store which operates independently of this organisation.</p><p>In the first organisation-centric case, an organisation offers a customer a ‘wallet’ where some or all of their data is deposited. Many wonderful claims can be made about such a service. This wallet gives the customer ‘control’ over their data. They can choose who to give access. They can decide who they want to share their data with — data sharing which, it is claimed, will help drive innovation and competition.</p><p>What’s not to like? Individuals are in control. Data is being shared. Markets are working better. It all sounds like an important first step towards the long term goal of citizens being in control of all their data, and improved data sharing driving improved economic performance.</p><p>But look a little closer and things quickly start falling apart. For a start, in this world, each organisation provides their customers with its own separate data wallet. So, if you have data relationships with 50 different organisations, you now have 50 different data wallets. And every time you want to use one with them, you have to sign in separately to do something.</p><p>This is like you needing a separate, different money wallet for every organisation you deal with. One for Sainsbury and a different one for Tesco. One for Amazon, one for the Government and a different one for Marks &amp; Spencer. And so on. Simply Ludicrous.</p><p>But there is an important wrinkle here, which helps explain the attraction of data wallets to some organisations. For historical reasons, some organisations hold data about their customers in a number of different databases where, for technical and regulatory compliance and broader data protection reasons, it’s very difficult to join the dots between the data in these databases. In this case, placing data in a data wallet may help data sharing within the organisation along with the ‘customer benefit’ of only one single sign-in to access data from all of these databases. For some entities like large banks and Governments, this looks like an important benefit.</p><p>But the main benefit is for the organisation (with the customer handed the work of overseeing the data sharing within the organisation), and, crucially, it keeps the data concerned firmly inside the organisation’s data walled garden. In other words, it’s a slightly extended MyAccount service tarted up by fancy new terminology. It’s not really about empowering citizens with their data or unleashing the broader benefits of data sharing beyond the organisation’s boundaries at&nbsp;all.</p> The problems&nbsp;deepen <p>The drawbacks of this approach are profound. Under this system of organisation-provided data wallets the data still sits on databases provided by the organisation, using processes for access and control provided by the organisation. This means the organisation can explicitly forbid or quietly hinder the individual’s ability to share and use their data as they&nbsp;wish.</p><p>At the same time, individuals’ data remains dispersed across dozens (more like hundreds) of different organisations. The individual never becomes the point of integration of their own data. They never build their own personal data asset. And the rich personal, social and economic potential of creating a single place where all of the individual’s data can be aggregated under their control never&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Indeed, if some data sharing happens, where some data is transferred from one organisation to another (as in Open Banking), the individual’s data gets even more dispersed. As a result they face even further loss of control over their data. This is because control can only be exercised by logging in to each separate data wallet, and the more wallets you have the higher the obstacles to exercising real control become. A bigger, taller skyscraper is not the same as a rocket. It’s the opposite.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is only the beginning. The organisation-provided data wallet means the data continues to be held by the organisation, not the individual. This means that across such a system, any data that is shared goes from one organisation’s database to another organisation’s database — never to the individual. In this way, the organisation-centric nature of our data system is not changed but perpetuated, extended and deepened.</p><p>It’s a bit like creating a new market for an exciting new means of transport called the motor car&nbsp;… but only allowing people to ride in taxis. They can order the taxi to go wherever they want (in theory). They are in control. But the one thing they cannot do is own their own car and use it independently. The resulting market would be distorted, truncated and in many cases aborted. Which is precisely what would happen with personal data if the First Step Fallacy of the organistion-centric data wallet was adopted at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>This deepening of the organisation-centric nature of the system brings its own problems with it. For a start, it replicates the incentives of the existing system. Under today’s system, no data controller collecting and holding data about individuals wants to share it with another organisation. Why would they? Doing so is all cost for them with all benefit going to the other organisation. If data is shared under compulsion (as is happening today with Open Banking) the new organisations holding the shared data have exactly the same incentives. They don’t want to share the data they’ve acquired&nbsp;either.</p><p>(Whereas, as we show in our White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, if individuals become the independent point at which data about themselves is aggregated, organisations have a very good reason to create a data sharing relationship with these individuals. These individuals now hold a lot of valuable, useful data that they could share if they wanted&nbsp;to.)</p> A complexity catastrophe <p>The problems pile up even higher if attempts are made to operate this organisation-centric approach to data sharing at scale. If the organisation continues to hold the data, it also continues to bear the responsibilities of doing so. It needs to ensure the safety and security of the data. It needs to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. It needs to manage fraud and security risks. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Take one example of data sharing via an organisation-held data wallet. For this to happen, the individual has to prove to the organisation that they are indeed the individual seeking the data sharing and not a fraudster. Then, when the new organisation turns up seeking access to the data that is to be shared, the original data controller has to make sure that this is indeed the right, reputable organisation that is accessing the data, and not a front for a fraudster.</p><p>It then has to manage the data sharing process itself. This may be manageable if it is a standard process for just a small handful of other organisations, but it becomes a complete nightmare if the data sharing grows to dozens, or hundreds, of other organisations. In this scenario, the organisation has to find a way of dealing with all the different software systems, formats, processes and so on used by these other organisations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the more organisations it opens its data wallet up to, the more it compromises the security of its own systems. (We explore the inevitable complexity catastrophe that arises as an organisation-to-organisation approach to data sharing begins to scale <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">in this&nbsp;blog</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, if organisations are only sharing data with individuals via personal data stores, the number of data sharing processes they have to oversee is limited to the very small number of personal data store operators, and most of the interoperability, governance and data security costs and risks are passed over to these operators.</p> Conclusion <p>In our White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> we show how empowering citizens with their own data via their own personal data stores will unleash immense personal, social and economic benefits: far reaching productivity improvements as all manner of friction, effort, risk and cost in removed from the workings of the system; the integration of different service elements to create better; more personalised services; a turbocharging of data-based innovation. But all this is based on a core design principle — that the individual is able to hold and manage their data separately and independently of the organisations that collect data about them; to become a hub for the sharing of their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>As our White Paper shows, this design principle avoids all the flaws and drawbacks described above. It is rocket building.</p><p>Organisation-provided data wallets may sound good, especially if they are surrounded with rhetoric about individuals being in control, increased data sharing, and so on. But they are just an example of the First Step Fallacy at work. All they will build is a bigger skyscraper. A bigger, more expensive White Elephant.</p><p>The First Step Fallacy is beguiling but dangerous. With ‘data wallets’ it’s a trap that could take many years and huge amounts of effort, energy and money to get out of. Much better not to fall into the trap in the first&nbsp;place.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-wallets-a-trap-waiting-to-be-sprung-857427ec70a">‘Data wallets’: a trap waiting to be sprung</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Today’s IT leaders are challenged to secure their complex multi-Cloud hybrid organizations while dealing with a severe cybersecurity skills gap and record levels of burnout and dissatisfaction from existing team members. The only way to overcome this challenge is more intelligent and pervasive automation to enforce policies governing access and behavior. IGA traditionally focuses on positive policies to grant access where appropriate, while Risk Management, as the other side of the coin, defines the negative; access, behaviors, and configurations to be prevented or at least identified and mitigated. In this talk, we’ll review how policies for granting and preventing access are complementary and form a balanced Yin and Yang for automation toward a Zero trust model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-based-automation-eic-2023"></a>

One Identity lives and breathes connected Identity, and we are happy to share our experience helping organizations achieve value from connected identity security models.&nbsp; Whether you are struggling to integrate your existing Identity silos, wondering what Zero Trust means for identity or looking to new Identity services like PBAC and decentralized identity, One Identity's innovative approach and design patterns shared in this session will be of interest.<br>Takeaways:</p>
 
 Connect your Identity services to each other 
 Connect your Identity Services to key systems and platforms 
 Exploit platform capabilities to ease integration 
 Go beyond point to point integrations...aim for High Value, Highly Secure Solutions

With operations in over 100 countries, 180,000 employees and contractors, 13,000 servers, 6,500 applications, more than 100 HR systems, and a complex Active Directory implementation, this was a challenging undertaking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session, attendees will learn how ABB leveraged its existing IT Service Management (ITSM) provider, ServiceNow, and Clear Skye, an identity governance and security solution built natively on the platform, to overcome the business complexities of implementing IGA. By aligning once locally managed systems across the business in one platform, ABB saves time, money, and frustration often associated with new tech integrations and onboarding processes. Stefan Lindner, Global Identity and Access Manager, will discuss how a strategic, platform-first approach to identity enables ABB to:&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Digital sovereignty has become an important topic for individuals as well as a strategic issue for countries and businesses, allowing them to operate in an environment that they trust and can control. This necessitates technology that is not overly reliant on third parties, where there is a risk of misuse of trust or non-compliance.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore 3 dimensions of digital sovereignty related to identity:</p>
 
 Sovereignty of the Individual: The need to protect the individual has triggered privacy laws around the world, like GDPR. Providing end users with more control is now taken one step further with the adoption of the so-called "Self-Sovereign identity (SSI)" and "identity wallets." With SSI, users are in powerful control of their personal data, resulting in a privacy-first user experience. 
 Geopolitical Sovereignty:&nbsp;According to geopolitical sovereignty, data about citizens is subject to the laws and governance of the nation or state to which they belong. As data and the behavior of people become more valuable for countries, the transfer of data is regulated by laws like the US Cloud Act and GDPR. Compliance with cross-border data transfers is becoming more important than ever.&nbsp; 
 Organisational Sovereignty:&nbsp;Organizations want to protect the interests of their employees, gig workers, customers, and business ecosystem. They also have to comply with multiple data sovereignty laws in various countries (for example, Schrems II, CCPA, LGPD, and so on). This leads to questions like, "Where is my data?" "Who has access?" and "Who holds the keys?" The more global organizations are, the more complex this process is due to the numerous local regulations they have to follow.

<p>Webnative is now ODD! Learn why we're renaming our SDK and what you can expect going forward.</p> Why The ODD Name? <p>We decided to rename Webnative to <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD</a> for a couple of reasons. The first was we recognized that there was some confusion between Webnative, the platform, and the Webnative File System protocol. We wanted to distinguish the difference between the two more easily.</p><p>The second reason was that while our SDK is excellent for building web apps, you can also use it to build native apps distributed via an app store, Internet of Things devices...basically, anything communicating over a network with a user interface! ODD SDK is a "learn once, write everywhere" development platform, and potentially even one day, "write once, deploy everywhere." We felt a name change would allow us to share that story more easily.</p><p>We picked ODD for four reasons:</p>  Memorable and Unique: ODD is concise, catchy, and sticks with you, making it easy for you to share with others.   Open Distributed Data: We love backronyms at Fission. The Open Distributed Data explanation fits perfectly as our tech stack fosters openness and collaboration, enabling you to harness the power of distributed data in your applications.   Embracing the Unconventional: Local-first edge computing challenges the status quo. While everyone else focuses on the cloud as the solution for serverless applications, we take the unexpected stand that decentralized tools and systems that inherently respect user privacy, grow with the developer's needs, and offer a credible exit are the answer.  Platform Agnostic: ODD's broad vision and platform-agnostic approach ensure our stack runs everywhere, adapting to the ever-changing tech landscape.   Distinguishing the SDK from the Underlying Protocols <p>It's important to us to distinguish the ODD SDK platform from the underlying protocols. Not everyone is comfortable working (or needs to work) at the protocol level. We wanted to clarify that when bundled in the SDK, you can access those protocols with additional implementations, templates, and libraries to assist you. &nbsp; </p><p>ODD is a true local-first edge application development platform, empowering you to create innovative, resilient applications using open distributed data. Join us on this exciting journey as we embrace the ODD way and shape the future of software development together!</p>

<p>Users will be able to create dapps with wallet-based authentication and equip digital assets with&nbsp;DIDs.</p><blockquote>“We’re thrilled that Apillon is integrating KILT Protocol and decentralized authentication as an essential building block for Web3.” — Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Press Release by&nbsp;Apillon</p><p>Apillon marks a new important milestone by introducing a next-gen Web3 authentication service, powered by <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a>, to the Apillon platform. As devs will be able to seamlessly incorporate decentralized digital authentication and verification into their projects, the end-users will be in total ownership of their data without the need to deal with complex technology.</p> What is KILT Protocol? <p>KILT Protocol is a blockchain identity protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials.</p><p>Anything can have an identity — people, machines, services, and even IoT devices. As credentials are linked to a DID, a digital identity is formed that enables authentication. A DID is at the core of a digital identity and can be added to a digital wallet, meaning the owner of the wallet’s private key is in total control of the stored&nbsp;data.</p><p>Learn more about how KILT Protocol works&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/how-kilt-works">here</a>.</p> In code we&nbsp;trust! <p>Historically, centralized entities have managed authentication for online services, while storing user credentials and monetizing personal data. KILT Protocol restores control and autonomy to the individual, empowering their online interactions.</p><p>As credentials are issued, a user’s data is never stored on the KILT blockchain; only a checksum (hash) representing the information is stored. When a user wants to unlock a service, they can verify their identity or the authenticity of their assets by sharing their credential.</p><p>With verified credentials and DIDs, businesses and app creators can provide a wide range of identity solutions. KILT Protocol use cases span NFTs, gaming, media, financial services, supply chain, IoT and energy. Most recently, KILT Protocol announced exciting partnerships with accounting firm <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/press-releases/articles/deloitte-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-creating-new-markets-with-reusable-digital-credentials.html?id=ch:2sm:3tw:4DMS::6cons:20230504140000::9830713630:5&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=DMS&amp;utm_content=cons&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;linkId=212869137">Deloitte Consulting AG</a>, global publisher <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/axel-springer-and-kilt-introduce-service-for-login-based-on-web3-technology-db41c2c0ad66?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------">Axel Springer</a>, and music marketplace <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/public-pressure-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-to-verify-nfts-and-users-on-its-music-92d9c77515af">Public Pressure</a>.</p> Apillon’s basic Web3 building toolkit soon&nbsp;complete <p>Besides <a href="https://medium.com/apillon/official-partnership-crust-network-to-be-integrated-into-apillons-web3-development-platform-25e49c742fa8">Web3 Storage and Hosting powered by Crust Network</a> on the Apillon platform and <a href="https://medium.com/apillon/partnering-with-phala-network-the-apillon-platform-soon-with-all-essential-web3-features-at-an-cad84bcca904">Web3 Computing to be powered by Phala Network</a>, Web3 authentication is one of the vital Web3 services a developer needs to build a decentralized project from start to&nbsp;finish.</p><p>“KILT Protocol provides one of the essentials for building any kind of application — that is user identification and authorization.

 What Are Threshold Signatures? <p>Threshold signatures are a type of digital signature that requires the agreement of multiple parties, rather than just one, on the message being signed. This makes them useful in a wide range of applications, from identity management to democratic decision-making.</p><p>Threshold signatures provide a secure and decentralized way of ensuring that multiple parties need to agree on a decision before it can be considered valid. These parties are often called "signers" and they each hold a share of a private key, which is necessary to generate the threshold signature. </p> Why Are Threshold Signatures Important?<br>  Decentralization <p>Threshold signatures can be used in decentralized systems where no single party has complete control. This is important for blockchain-based applications where the goal is to create a trustless and decentralized system. In traditional single-party signature schemes (a way to ensure the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document), the private key is held by a single entity, making it a single point of failure. If the key is compromised, an attacker can perform fraudulent activities and access sensitive data.</p> Fault tolerance <p>With threshold signatures, a system can still function even if some parties are unavailable or compromised. This provides greater fault tolerance and ensures that the system can continue to operate even in the event of an attack or failure.</p><p>Without threshold signatures, it may not be possible to create certain types of decentralized systems, such as those that require multi-party approval or voting systems. This can limit the potential use cases for a given system.</p> Threshold Signatures Use Case Examples  Distributed Identity Management Systems <p>In traditional identity management systems, a single authority is responsible for issuing credentials. Threshold signatures can be used in distributed identity management systems to allow multiple issuers to jointly issue “claims” about an identity (credentials). </p> Product Approvals <p>In industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, or equipment manufacturing, product approvals by regulatory bodies are crucial. These approvals signify that the product has been tested and meets certain safety and quality standards. Threshold signatures can be used in this context to ensure that a threshold number of regulatory bodies or inspectors have approved the product before it can be released to the market. This provides greater trust to consumers who rely on these approvals to make informed decisions about the products they use.</p> Health and Safety Inspections <p>In industries such as manufacturing, construction, or transportation, health and safety inspections are critical to ensure that workplaces are safe and comply with regulations. Threshold signatures could be used to ensure that a threshold number of inspectors need to sign off on the inspection before it is considered valid. This would provide greater assurance that workplaces are safe and compliant while potentially reducing the risk of accidents or injuries.</p> Petition Systems <p>Petition systems are often used in democratic decision-making processes where a group of individuals need to collectively agree on a decision before it can be made. Threshold signatures can be used in petition systems to ensure that a threshold number of individuals need to sign off on the decision before it can be considered valid. This ensures that decisions are made with the consensus of a group, rather than the opinion of a single individual.</p> How Threshold Signatures Work <p>Threshold signatures work by dividing a private key into multiple parts, or "shares," and distributing those shares among different parties. To create a threshold signature, a threshold number of those parties must come together and combine their shares in a way that produces a valid signature. </p><p>For example, let's say a private key is divided into five shares, and the threshold is set at three. This means that any three out of the five parties can come together and combine their shares to create a valid signature. However, if only two parties try to create a signature, it would be invalid and rejected.</p> Decide Which Threshold Signature Implementation Is Best for You <p>At Dock, we have implemented two variations of threshold signatures (anonymous credentials) with each having different tradeoffs. The first one is based on a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/011?ref=blog.dock.io">modified version of Coconut</a>, which uses a different signature scheme called PS. The second is a <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2023/933600c095/1Js0EDGb0n6?ref=blog.dock.io">threshold BBS+</a>, threshold variant of BBS+, our existing signature scheme. </p><p>The benefit of "modified Coconut" is that the threshold signing process is very simple and efficient and it requires no communication among signers. The signers independently generate their signature "share" and send it to the user (holder of the credential) and the user aggregates the shares and generates the final signature which can be verified. </p><p>The downside is that a lot more code has to be written and multiple layers in our system need to be modified to support creating and verifying presentations created from credentials using PS signatures. Another downside is that the size of the signing keys should be proportional to the credential size. This is unlike BBS+. </p><p>The benefit of threshold BBS+ is that only the threshold issuance process has to be built but credential presentation and verification are same as our existing credential implementation. The disadvantage is that issuance requires the signers to communicate among themselves and is much more resource consuming than Coconut. </p><p>Based on the tradeoffs above, applications can choose different implementations.</p> Code Links   <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/bbs_plus/src/threshold?ref=blog.dock.io">Rust implementation of threshold BBS+</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/coconut?ref=blog.dock.io">Rust implementation of Coconut</a>

<p>Liveness detection is a biometric authentication process that verifies whether the user is a live person or just a spoofed artifact. Liveness detection is crucial in preventing security breaches and fraud in biometric systems–an increasingly real threat.</p>
 What Is Liveness Detection and Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive: </p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking.  
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user.  
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition</a> system. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information).  
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake.  
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence.  
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface. </p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data. </p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>
 Liveness Detection with 1Kosmos LiveID 
<p>LiveID is the cornerstone for how 1Kosmos BlockID delivers advanced biometric authentication. Our strong biometric-based identity provides flexible identity assurance and a passwordless experience. With LiveID, users provide a selfie video to the program that can be used as a biometric template for BlockID to verify liveness. This system meets IAL2 verification standards. </p>
<p>Alongside these advances, 1Kosmos BlockID also provides the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.  
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.  
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.  
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>This is going to be a small Dev Pulse; I’m just going to update you on the status of three branches of Holochain. If you’re a developer, I hope you’ll find this useful for planning out your upgrade path.</p><p>Don’t miss the bit at the bottom! A scaffolding template for generating React UIs has been contributed by a thoughtful member of our community!</p> Holochain 0.1.x series: Skip 0.1.4, wait for 0.1.5 <p>In an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-matures/#holochain-011-to-014-bug-fixes-and-backports">update last week</a> to Dev Pulse 133, I reported that there were some ‘slightly breaking’ changes which resulted in some issues that broke the Holonix dev environment. The dev team has reverted part of the change, which may still require a tiny bit of code refactoring in your validation functions but will repair the dev environment.</p><p>There are also some database schema changes in 0.1.4. They don’t affect hApp code, but people using 0.1.4 won’t be able to import their hApp data from 0.1.3 and earlier.</p><p>There is an upcoming version, 0.1.5, which will include the fix for the dev environment as well as a migration path for older database versions. There’s already a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.1.5-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">release candidate for 0.1.5</a> which contains some of the fixes; the final version will contain all of them. We recommend you wait until 0.1.5 is released before upgrading your hApp code and asking your users to upgrade their Launcher.</p> Holochain 0.2.x series: Gossip fix in the works, dev tooling expected for 0.2.1 <p>So the <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1651699231583875077?ref=blog.holochain.org">big news</a> last week is that we released <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain 0.2.0</a> on schedule. This release series includes peer blocking and warrants, which form the foundation of Holochain’s immune system. It also comes with a raft of other updates, like a move to end-to-end-encrypted WebRTC for network communications.</p><p>But! While preparing the dev tooling, a gossip issue was discovered which is causing peers to become unable to communicate with each other. The core team is working on the fix for 0.2.1, after which the dev tooling (client libs, Tryorama, <code>hc</code> dev tool, Launcher, and Holonix dev environment) will be fully tested and released.</p><p>So we recommend you wait until then before updating your code for 0.2.x — and remember that you don’t have to if you don’t need the new features yet. Our six-month support promise for 0.1.x is still there.</p><p>When the dev tools are released, I’ll have a big Dev Pulse for you with all the release notes to help you update your code.</p> Holochain 0.3.x series: Moving right along <p>Although each point release comes with a feature freeze, the core dev team hasn’t stopped adding new ones. Holochain 0.3 and the accompanying dev tooling will include these new features:</p>  A conductor can make multiple WebRTC signal server connections, for increased resilience and availability on local and global networks.  DHT storage arcs can be resized, to let resource-constrained devices throttle their resource contributions or let powerful devices take a larger share.  Zero-sized storage arcs don’t participate in gossip, to allow the most resource-constrained devices to opt out completely.  The Holonix dev environment can pull binaries from a trusted cache on the localnet.  Link retrieval can be batched, and just the count of links can be retrieved.  The HoloPort Alpha network will be used to scale-test Holochain with certain hApps.  <p>Most of these features are in service of in-person hackathons, and more immediately, <a href="http://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a>’s <a href="http://dwebcamp.org/tomorrow/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tomorrow</a> event. On this last full day of the camp, the WiFi meshnet’s link to the global internet will be shut off. It’ll be an opportunity for all the participants to use the offline-friendly, local-first technology they’ve brought. Holochain’s offering (in addition to being a sponsor this year!) will be a hApp to help people organise and take notes for <a href="https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Open Space</a> sessions. We intend it as a gift to the DWeb community in keeping with the spirit of cooperation that I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">found so beautiful</a> when I attended last year.</p><p>You can read more about how Holochain plans to get involved this year in this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dweb-camp-discovering-flows/">recent article</a>.</p><p>So… Do you want to be part of dogfooding a real hApp? Do you want to get acquainted with wonderful folks who are trying to use digital technology, so often a cause of degeneration, to birth something new and inspiring?</p><p>There are early bird discounts for families and teams, but they end next Monday, May 8th. We also have a 25% discount code you can use: <code>FRIENDSANDFAMILY</code></p><p>We hope we get to <a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/gatheringsforgood/861532?ref=blog.holochain.org">meet you there</a>, in Navarro, CA, US, from 21 to 25 June!</p> React template for scaffolding <p><a href="https://github.com/nick-stebbings?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nick Stebbings</a>, a developer in the community, has shared a <a href="https://github.com/nick-stebbings/holochain-react-scaffold-template?ref=blog.holochain.org">React UI template</a> for use in the <code>hc scaffold</code> command. You can use it by passing the GitHub URL and template name (there are two templates, <code>app</code> and <code>module</code>):</p> <code>hc scaffold web-app \
    --templates-url https://github.com/nick-stebbings/holochain-react-scaffold-template \
    --template app \
    my-awesome-app</code> <p>It’s pretty great to see contributions like this. It shows the dev community is growing (and generous), and it allows the dev community to grow even more by meeting UI devs where they’re at.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@stefanolombardo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Stefano Lombardo</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/XpZaBZqG_og?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>
