  <p>On July 11, 2023, we introduced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-expands-into-security-service-edge-with-two-new/ba-p/3847829">Microsoft’s identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution</a> and two new services: Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access, which are now in public preview. In this blog, we take a deeper look into Microsoft </p>
<p>Entra Private Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Traditional network security stacks and legacy VPNs are no longer sufficient</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional network security approaches that use legacy VPNs simply cannot scale to modern demands. Once your remote users connect to your corporate network through VPN, they are granted excessive access to your entire network, all it takes is a single compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to gain entry, move laterally, and access your most critical assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access, an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), reduces the operational complexity and cost of legacy VPNs, while eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. It modernizes access to private applications and resources, helping users quickly and easily connect to private applications from any device and any network, whether they’re at home, remote, or in their corporate office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What makes Private Access unique&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of Microsoft’s SSE solution, Private Access is built on Zero Trust principles. It verifies every user and enforces least privilege, giving users access only to the private applications and resources they need. Private Access significantly expands Entra ID Application Proxy capabilities in Microsoft Entra to a complete ZTNA solution that shares the same connectors but offers so much more, it helps you simplify and secure access to any private resource on any port, and protocol. You can apply policies that enable secure, segmented, and granular access to all your private applications in your corporate network, on-premises, or in the cloud. For customers already using Application Proxy, they can seamlessly transition to Private Access – all existing use-cases and access to existing private web applications would continue to work with no disruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create and enforce per-app, least privilege access controls based on the granular Conditional Access policies that are enriched with context about users, devices, and their locations. You can also terminate ongoing sessions in response to anomalies or changes in user context or device health. For example, if a user connects from one part of the world and then immediately connects from another part of the world (what we call “impossible travel"), you can enforce re-authorization or step up to a stronger authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access enables secure access to any application, on-premises or cloud-based, and it works across any port or protocol, including RDP, SSH, SMB, FTP, and anything else that uses TCP or UDP. In addition, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using SAML or http headers or even legacy Kerberos authentication for both web and non-web applications, without making any changes to those applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>, your private applications are not only more secure, but your employees can also access them faster compared to legacy VPNs. The unmatched scale and vast global network edge presence enables you to optimally connect your users and devices to private resources, especially those who work in a hybrid or remote work environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Secure access to all private applications, for users anywhere, with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Private Access key capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access can help you enable secure access to all your private applications and resources. Key capabilities include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access. Replacing legacy VPNs with an identity-centric ZTNA minimizes the risk of implicit trust and lateral movement. Using Quick Access, you can easily configure broad private IP ranges and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to quickly enable identity-centric, Zero-Trust-based access to all private resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications. With Private Access, you can create Conditional Access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that require modern authentication for accessing any private application, even those using legacy protocols such as Kerberos and NT LAN Manager (NTLM). This brings policies based on the sensitivity of the application, level of user risk, network compliance, and so forth to legacy applications. For example, you can easily require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device compliance checks for users trying to access remote desktop (RDP), secure shell (SSH) or SMB applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic private application discovery and onboarding. You can discover private applications, including existing App Proxy private web applications, whether the applications are hosted locally in a private network, in an on-premises data center, or in the cloud.&nbsp; You can then onboard them to Microsoft Entra ID, group them, and define granular access policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Automatic private application discovery and onboarding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granular segmented application access. Instead of granting remote users access to your entire network, as traditional VPNs do, you can define granular segmented access policies for each application or group of applications based on user, device, or processes running on the endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Granular segmented application access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intelligent local access. Employees need a consistent security posture whether they’re accessing private applications remotely or on-premises. The intelligent local access capability enables fast and seamless ZTNA for users, whether they’re within the corporate network or connecting remotely from anywhere outside corporate network boundaries. For example, a user while on the corporate network can connect to on-premises private applications such as RDP or SMB while CA policies such as MFA are still enforced, and application traffic remains local on the corporate network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">Global Secure Access</a> (preview) is the centralized location in the Microsoft Entra admin center where you can configure and manage Microsoft Entra Private Access. Remote workers don't need to use a VPN to access these resources if they have the Global Secure Access Client installed. The client quietly and seamlessly connects them with the resources they need. The most current version of the client can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can install the client interactively, silently with the /quiet switch, or use mobile device management platforms like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management">Microsoft Intune to deploy</a> it to their devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickAccess makes it very easy to get started with a minimum configuration for Private Access, especially when you are planning to move from legacy VPN to ZTNA. After completing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access">initial configurations</a>, and once you deploy a connector agent on-premises, to enable quick access all you need to do is specify the IP address, IP address range, or FQDN and port number. You can then assign specific conditional access policies, which QuickAccess applies to ALL app segments you configured. For example, you can create a “myRDP app” and assign it an IP address-based app segment. You only need to provide a name for the private app, then select the connector you wish to use with the app, and then specify the IP address/range and port number. You can then access your destination by simply launching an RDP session from your remote client machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				  When it comes to decentralized identity, Indicio is technology agnostic. This enables us to offer customers the best possible solutions to meet their exact needs.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>In a rapidly expanding field, there are many approaches to solving a multitude of use cases and requirements. This is why Indicio’s approach is to solve the customer’s problem rather than sell them a specific protocol or single technology. Within the overall framework of decentralized identity and using verifiable data to create trusted digital relationships, we are and have always been technology agnostic.</p>
<p>At present, this agnosticism applies most of all to credential formats. There is no single format — at least not yet — that meets every customer’s needs or legal requirements. So we help our customers assess what is important to their use case, for example:</p>
<p>Does regulation require them to use a particular credential type?<br>Do they need to be able to use selective disclosure?<br>Do they need to be able to use predicate proofs?<br>Do they need privacy-preserving holder binding?</p>
<p>Where preserving privacy is critical, we recommend AnonCreds, as it is the most feature rich. If regulation or interoperability require a different credential format, we’ll support that as well.</p>
<p>The same situation also exists for the protocols in an ecosystem. Our clients often have requirements that are well met by the rich interaction models and power of DIDComm-based credential exchange and communication protocols.</p>
<p>Increasingly, our clients require interoperability with the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS 2.0 standards</a>, including the OID4VCs protocols. We support these as well, and advise our customers on the best way to achieve their goals within the limits of those protocols. If a customer is already using DIDComm for its rich interaction model and protocols, they are usually able to keep those features while adding additional protocols for compliance reasons.</p>
<p>Our mission is to always meet the needs of our customers and generate solutions that deliver the most benefits. For us, this means delivering a complete solution that works right “out of the box” and that they fully own and can develop on as technology evolves.</p>
<p>Providing this future flexibility is why we use and support open-source projects whenever possible. In the adoption of additional credential types and protocols, we are working with open-source collaborators to realize these goals. These collaborative efforts lift and support the community as a whole for a stronger, more capable, and broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>When it comes to deployment, we can do as much or as little as a customer’s development team needs. This is why our product range is available both as complete ecosystem solutions and as individual building blocks—and why we are continually adding blocks, new features, and full ecosystems to our product range.</p>
<p>Our most recent addition is an update to Aries Cloud Agent-Python (ACA-Py) so that it can handle <a href="https://indicio.tech/breakthrough-in-didcomm-mediation-indicio-achieves-significant-scale-with-new-solution/">thousands of interactions per minute</a>, thereby enabling verifiable credential ecosystems to rapidly scale.</p>
<p>For those curious about the technologies we have on our roadmap, here are the technologies we are asked about most often:</p>
<p>Credential types: SD-JWT, JSON-LD, OpenBadges 3.0, mDL/mDOC<br>Protocols: DIDComm v2, OID4VCI/OID4VP, WACI<br>DID Methods: did:web, did:indy, did:ion<br>Governance: DIF CredentialTrustEstablishment, eIDAS PKI, TOIP Trust Registries<br>Signature Types: RSA, ECDSA, Secp256k1</p>
<p>There is no single technology choice that will rule the entire decentralized identity landscape in every environment and across time. The important thing is that we keep our eyes on the overall value proposition: solutions that create trusted digital relationships.</p>
<p>If you have questions or would like to learn more we encourage you to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to our team.</a></p>

  <p>Just today I received an email from one of my financial services providers warning me about imposter scams and fraudsters. Their warning was to alert me that fraudsters are impersonating financial institutions and contacting their customers. My institution’s goal was to help me understand how to identify someone taking the first steps to perform<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_fraud"> identity fraud</a>, which involves gaining some user credentials or parts of my identity to commit fraud. It’s a good first step in fraud prevention, but more is needed.</p>

<p>Attackers are innovative and highly motivated to use new technologies and techniques in pursuit of a big payoff. With data from prior breaches and publicly available information, they have access to a wealth of identity tidbits, if not rich data, that they can use to commit identity fraud.&nbsp;</p>

 Our personal information is everywhere, ripe for misuse 

<p>Every month my identity monitoring service warns me about pieces of my personal information turning up on the dark web, enriching the information fraudsters need to execute their plans. This didn’t come as a huge surprise to me. According to the ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report"> 2023 Identity Breach Report</a>, users’ names and physical addresses were in at least 99% of breached records and, in the last year, there’s been a sharp increase in more valuable information, such as date of birth and protected health information (PHI). And an eye-opening 72% of U.S. breaches contained Social Security numbers.</p>

<p>With all this information, layered with artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, perpetrators gain fidelity and higher-quality information to use in their activities. They can analyze and predict the credentials I might use for one account based on what they have seen with my other accounts. What is my password selection process and what might I have created?&nbsp;</p>

<p>With bots, fraudsters gain scale and speed to carry out identity fraud attacks. In the event that I opt-in for multi-factor authentication (MFA), they can attempt to get me to click the wrong button through<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them"> MFA prompt bombing</a> attacks.</p>

<p>The fraudsters’ goal is to garner login credentials to do harm, mostly for financial purposes. If they are successful in an<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover"> account takeover (ATO)</a> attack, they can fraudulently purchase goods and services, abuse healthcare processes and claims payments, steal tax refunds, or open new bank accounts and move money around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the help of AI, cybercriminals are also creating synthetic identities using pieces of information gleaned from identity theft. A synthetic identity may use a valid Social Security number and birthdate and combine it with fraudulent information, such as a fake name, to obtain a new credit card. Using bits of information either stolen or obtained from public sources (social media posts can be a rich source for pet names, schools, birthdays, and much more), can enable identity fraud if organizations do not have controls in place to help prevent it — whether the fraudsters have pieces of information or even full credentials.</p>

 How IAM can stop identity fraud 

<p>In addition to facilitating the login process, identity and access management (IAM) systems can perform a variety of actions to detect and prevent identity fraud and other misuse of a user's identity that results from a successful ATO attack.</p>

<p>IAM systems can generate risk scores during the login process, calculated based on IP address, geolocation, and other user behaviors. These and other access patterns can also identify and block bot attacks, such as credential stuffing, password spraying, and MFA prompt bombing.</p>

<p>Even if a bad actor has the right credentials, IAM can detect anomalous behavior, such as an unusual location or device, and demand further proof of identity, known as step-up authentication. With MFA, the identity system moves from basic authentication to include an out-of-channel factor from, say, a mobile device authenticator app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Implementing<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication"> passwordless authentication</a> can reduce the risk even further, making one piece of the authentication a cryptographic function instead something on a sticky note. With different factors to reduce risk in the user authentication process,<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-orchestration"> identity orchestration</a> comes into play to build a workflow that integrates risk factors and tailors the user experience based on the goal of reducing identity fraud.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year we took a big step towards improving customers’ experience with Apple devices by providing companies with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices</a>. This plug-in enables&nbsp;Microsoft Entra ID users to have device-wide single sign-on (SSO) for all apps and websites in a consistent, secure, and seamless way. Best of all, it always stays up to date with the latest Microsoft technologies as they evolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we're announcing a powerful enhancement to these capabilities - Platform SSO for macOS. This enhancement is designed to make using your macOS devices more seamless and secure than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO is an enhancement to the existing SSO Extension capabilities for macOS, which allows users to sign into their Macs using passwordless credentials or passwords managed and validated by Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabled by Platform SSO and powered by Microsoft’s Enterprise SSO plug-in, Platform Credentials for macOS allow users to go passwordless by using Touch ID to unlock their device and be signed into Entra ID under the hood using a device bound cryptographic key. It uses phishing-resistant credentials, based on the technology we use for Windows Hello for Business, and backed by Apple’s hardware already in your device. This will save your organization money by removing the need for security keys or other hardware. Once you sign in, the existing Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in continues to do its magic keeping you signed into&nbsp;the apps you use for work, but with a credential that’s safer and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those not ready to completely remove passwords from Entra ID sign-ins, Platform SSO for macOS allows organizations to synchronize their local account password and their Entra ID passwords so users can use one credential across their macOS device. No more remembering separate passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO for macOS also allows admins to configure the end-user authentication method, specifying either the phishing-resistant credential or a traditional password as the authentication method.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplified Management&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this update, we’ve reimagined the employee onboarding experience on Macs for users of Microsoft Intune. Platform SSO for macOS simplifies the employee onboarding experience on Microsoft Intune by enabling a familiar and native macOS experience that Mac users will love. As an example, it eliminates the need to launch the Company Portal app to access resources protected by Conditional Access on Intune-managed Macs. To learn more about how Microsoft Intune is innovating in Apple device management, see <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-intune-blog/10-ways-microsoft-intune-improves-apple-device-management/ba-p/3766718">10 ways Microsoft Intune improves Apple device management - Microsoft Community Hub.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming public preview of Platform SSO for macOS will work with Microsoft Intune. Other MDM providers will be coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Helping You Go Zero Trust&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our integration with the Secure Enclave included in modern Macs, the passwordless authentication method offers a powerful means for enterprises to advance their zero trust security objectives. By eliminating passwords as a primary attack vector, organizations can significantly enhance their security postures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The credentials used in passwordless systems are bound to physical hardware. This requires attackers to gain physical access to specific hardware rather than steal login information, making unauthorized access even more challenging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Prepare&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently in private preview with select customers today with public preview coming soon. If you’d like to be considered to be added to the private preview, please contact <a href="mailto:macos-sso-feedback@microsoft.com">Platform SSO for macOS feedback</a>. Spaces are limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can prepare your organization for Platform SSO for macOS by taking the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Deploy the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in.</a>&nbsp; 
 Ensure users are registered for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted">Microsoft Entra ID multifactor authentication;</a> for the best experience, we recommend using Microsoft Authenticator.&nbsp; 
 Update macOS devices to macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Summing up&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO for macOS is a big step towards enhancing the SSO experience and security of the Macs in your organization. Users benefit from SSO through a hardware-bound key or by signing in to a Mac using their Microsoft Entra ID password. The integration with the Secure Enclave enables hardware-bound, passwordless, phishing-resistant authentication on macOS devices advancing enterprises' zero trust security objectives. At public preview launch, Platform SSO for macOS can be natively managed with Microsoft Intune, with support for other MDM providers coming soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A superior customer experience (CX) is built on accurate and timely application performance monitoring (APM) metrics. You can’t fine-tune your apps or system to improve CX until you know what the problem is or where the opportunities are.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/application-performance-management">APM solutions</a> typically provide a centralized dashboard to aggregate real-time performance metrics and insights to be analyzed and compared. They also establish baselines to alert system administrators to deviations that indicate actual or potential performance issues. IT teams, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/site-reliability-engineering">site reliability engineers</a> can then quickly identify and address application issues.</p>



<p>Application performance monitoring is the initial phase of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-performance-management">application performance management</a>. Monitoring tracks app performance and enables the management of that app. An APM solution brings administrators the instrumentation tools needed to quickly gather data and conduct root cause analysis; they then isolate, troubleshoot and solve that problem.</p>



 Key APM metrics to monitor 



<p>There are a number of metrics you can choose from, but we recommend focusing on these eight metrics to reap the most benefits within your IT organization.</p>



 1. Apdex and SLA scores 



<p>Let’s start with application performance index (Apdex) and service level agreement (SLA) scores, since they are the foundation of superior customer experience. The speeds and feeds you’ll measure are the specific aspects that ought to add up to fast performance, but they are the means, not the end. Happy customers are your goal—hopefully leading to increased sales. </p>



<p>The Apdex and SLA scores are the most popular way to view end-user experience monitoring. The Apdex score tracks the relative performance of an app by specifying a goal for the time a web request or transaction should normally take. The SLAs are the metrics in your customer contract and anything lower than the defined SLA risks a drop in CX (and possibly predefined penalties).</p>



 2. Application availability (also known as uptime or web performance monitoring) 



<p>This is the most basic metric: Are the lights on? You are monitoring and measuring if your application is online and available. Most companies use this to measure service level agreement (SLA) compliance. Uptime is often a shorthand for assessing overall system reliability and health. Excessive downtime can negatively impact user satisfaction for organizations delivering online services. For a web application, you can verify availability with a simple, regularly scheduled HTTP check.</p>



 3. CPU usage (also known as resource usage) 



<p>A high percentage of CPU capacity being used by an application can be a sign of a performance problem. A sudden spike in CPU usage can result in slower response times. Fluctuations in demand for an app might also be an indication that you need to add more application instances. A general rule is if CPU usage exceeds 70% more than 30% of the time, you could be running out of CPU capacity.</p>



<p>Resource usage can also include memory and disk usage.&nbsp;Tracking RAM helps identify memory leaks that could lead to failure or the need for greater memory. Disk usage metrics can help prevent an app from running out of persistent storage, which could cause it to fail. High disk usage could also be a sign of inefficient backend data storage or faulty data retention policies.</p>



 4. Error rates 



<p>Your APM metrics software should monitor applications to record the percentage of requests that result in failures. This helps to identify and prioritize the resolution of issues that impact the user experience. Application errors can include server errors, a 404 response or timeout in a web app. You can configure your APM solution to send notifications when an error rate goes above a set parameter. For example, send an alert when 2.5% of the previous 25 requests have resulted in an error.</p>



 5. Garbage collection 



<p>Garbage collection (GC) can improve performance by identifying and eliminating the ongoing heavy memory usage of Java or other languages.&nbsp;The good news is that GC automation reclaims memory&nbsp;devoted to unused or redundant objects or data that are no longer being used by an application. Unused objects or data are deleted and live objects are copied to a later-generation memory pool. This is a metric you want to keep in the happy middle. If GC is run too often, it might require too much overhead; but if GC is not run often enough, then your system could be left with too little memory.</p>



 6. Number of instances 



<p>Tracking instances enables you to scale your application to meet actual user demand, based on how many app or server instances are running at any time.&nbsp;This can be especially important for cloud applications. Auto-scaling can help you ensure modern applications scale to meet demand and save budget during off-peak hours. This can also create infrastructure-monitoring challenges. For example, if your app automatically scales up on CPU usage, you might not ever see your CPU usage rise—instead, you could see the number of server instances rise too far, along with your hosting bill.</p>



 7. Request rates 



<p>You can measure the traffic received by an application to identify any significant decreases, increases or coinciding users. Correlating request rates with other application performance metrics will help you understand the scalability of your software applications. APM software can also monitor traffic to identify anomalies. User monitoring showing an unexpected increase in requests could be a denial of service (DoS) attack. A large number of requests from the same user could be an indication of a hacked account. Even unusually low requests could be bad—inactivity or no traffic at all could mean a failure in almost any part of your system.</p>



 8. Response times (also known as duration) 



<p>By tracking the average response time to a request—that is, how long it takes an application to return a request for resources—you can assess app performance. These requests can be inclusive of transactions initiated by end-users, such as a request to load a web page, or can include internal requests from one portion of your application to another, such as a process or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservice</a> requesting data from disk or memory. The total response time includes server response time (the time it takes your server to process a request) plus network latency (the total time it takes the request to move across the network).</p>



<p>A related metric is page load time, which measures the time it takes a webpage to load into a browser. Tracking page load times enables your application performance monitoring tools to identify the issues causing slow-loading pages and then improve the digital experience. Slow page loads can mean page abandonment and lost business. APM solutions can be set for a baseline of performance for this metric and then alert you when that benchmark is not met.</p>



 Additional application metrics 



<p>For those who are looking for a more comprehensive set of metrics related to application performance monitoring, you might want to consider the following metrics:</p>



 
 Database queries:&nbsp;Measures the number of queries requested from a database by an application. Your APM tools can then help identify slow or inefficient queries that may be slowing overall performance of your application. 



 I/O (Input/output): I/O shows the rate at which apps read or write data. You can track the performance of persistent storage media (such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/hard-disk-drive-vs-solid-state-drive/">HDD or SSD</a>) and I/O rates for memory or virtual disks. 



 Network usage: Network usage represents the total network bandwidth used by an application. Increased network usage might indicate performance problems slowing the application’s response time or creating bottlenecks. 



 Node availability: A measurement similar to the number of instances is node availability, but it’s specific to cloud. When you deploy apps to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> cluster, the number of nodes available and responding (of the total nodes in a cluster) can help identify problems within your infrastructure. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-spend-management/">Cloud spend</a> metrics can also be important, giving you real-time visibility into cloud costs by tracking <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">API</a> calls, running time for cloud-based <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a> and total data egress rates. 



 Throughput: Throughput is the volume of data that can be transferred between an app and users or other systems. It can be used to determine if an app is able to handle the expected traffic volume. 



 Transaction tracing: This gives you a picture of single transactions carried out by an application. Data captured can include database calls, external calls and function calls—monitoring the transaction request from start to finish. 



 Transaction volume: Transaction volume measures the number of transactions processed by an application. This enables APM tools to identify issues with scalability and capacity planning.

These threats can range from ransomware attacks to phishing campaigns and insider threats, potentially resulting in data breaches. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated and their tactics more varied, it’s essential for businesses to adopt advanced security measures to protect their sensitive data and digital assets. Two crucial tools in the modern cybersecurity arsenal are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/siem">Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</a> solutions and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-intelligence">threat intelligence</a>. By leveraging these resources, organizations can stay current on trending threats and proactively defend against potential attacks and adversaries.</p>



 Understanding SIEM and threat intelligence 



<p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions play a pivotal role in maintaining an organization’s cybersecurity posture. They collect and analyze vast amounts of security-related data from various sources within an organization’s IT infrastructure. Event log data from users, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/endpoint-security">endpoints</a>, applications, data sources, cloud workloads, and networks—as well as data from security hardware and software such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=options-firewalls">firewalls</a> or antivirus software—is collected, correlated and analyzed in real-time. By centralizing and correlating this information, SIEM solutions can provide a comprehensive view of an organization’s security status.</p>



<p>Threat intelligence is data and insights with detailed knowledge about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a>&nbsp;threats targeting an organization. It involves the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about current and potential cybersecurity threats. This information can include indicators of compromise (IoCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cybercriminals, and vulnerabilities in software or systems. Threat intelligence teams consistently monitor various sources, including forums, dark web marketplaces, and malware samples, to provide organizations with near-real-time insight into emerging threats. According to <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/hub/security/documents/how-to-use-threat-intelligence.pdf">research conducted by Gartner</a>, utilizing threat intelligence can enhance security teams’ detection and response capabilities by increasing alert quality, reducing investigation time, and adding coverage for the latest attacks and adversaries. &nbsp;</p>



 The synergy between SIEM and threat intelligence 



<p><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/hub/security/documents/how-to-use-threat-intelligence.pdf">SIEM solutions are built to perform rule matching on log data from many sources</a>. With the integration of threat intelligence, SIEM solutions can stay one step ahead of emerging threats and advisories. Let’s explore some benefits of <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/hub/security/documents/how-to-use-threat-intelligence.pdf">incorporating threat intelligence within a SIEM platform</a>:</p>



 
 Real-time threat detection: Integrating Threat Intelligence feeds into a SIEM solution enhances its capabilities. By cross-referencing internal data with external threat intelligence, organizations can identify patterns and anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed. This enables faster detection of vulnerabilities, new malware strains, or targeted attacks. 



 Proactive defense: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-hunting">Threat hunting</a> is key to effective cybersecurity. Instead of reacting to threats after they’ve caused damage, organizations can use SIEM and Threat Intelligence to identify threat actors that may already be lurking in an environment and thwart attacks before they continue. By staying informed about evolving tactics and vulnerabilities, organizations can adjust their threat hunting techniques to find and counter threats before they materialize. 



 Improved incident response: When a security incident occurs, the combined power of SIEM and Threat intelligence is invaluable. SIEM solutions provide a timeline of events leading up to the breach, while Threat Intelligence supplies insights into the attacker’s TTPs and associated IOCs that can accelerate the investigation. This aids in incident response, containment, and recovery efforts. 
 



 How can the combination of QRadar SIEM and X-Force Threat Intelligence help organizations combat modern threats? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-siem/threat-intelligence">The IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence</a> included with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-siem?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074872917625&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwldKmBhCCARIsAP-0rfyck3m6qxnLt95VtojmHqvE6WM0KXLFMbFQnu9WXcztHSrM0D3MVA4aAo7TEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">QRadar SIEM</a> uses aggregated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/xforce-exchange">X-Force® Exchange</a>  data to help your organization stay ahead of emerging threats and exposure from the latest vulnerabilities. X-Force Threat Intelligence detects various events such as communication between endpoints and known malware distribution sites. Integrating X-Force Threat Intelligence with QRadar enables seamless ranking of new types of incidents by risk value. This data empowers you to establish distinct rules and watch lists for different threats. QRadar SIEM incorporates the latest malicious IP addresses, URLs and malware file hashes from IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence and other threat intelligence sources, enabling your SIEM platform to instantly detect critical and advanced global threats. Stay head of emerging threats without spending hours on research.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th August to 28th&nbsp;August <p>Welcome to the latest edition of our Veriscope crypto regulatory newsletter, where we navigate the intricate maze of rules and developments shaping the future of digital currencies worldwide.</p><p>In today’s edition, we kick off with the United Kingdom’s stringent new rules following FATF guidelines and contrast that with New Zealand’s more cautious, observant stance.</p><p>We’ll also cover India’s call for global regulatory unity at the recent G20 summit and wrap up with the United Arab Emirates’ flexible approach centered on Dubai’s recent&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Now, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Unpacking the Global Patchwork of Crypto Regulations <p>The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation is as varied as it is intricate, with countries worldwide adopting distinct approaches. From stringent measures in the United Kingdom to cautious observation in New Zealand, the debate is global and complex. Add India’s plea for international unity and Dubai’s flexible stance, and it’s clear that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work for a foreseeable future.</p><p>The UK: The United Kingdom has set a strong regulatory precedent by imposing the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule on all crypto businesses. Under this rule, crypto firms must share customer data during transactions, a move reportedly aimed at combating financial crimes like money laundering.</p><p>New Zealand: However, not all nations are taking the U.K.’s hardline approach. New Zealand, for example, is advocating for restraint and careful study before enacting stringent regulations. This nuanced view, outlined in a report by the country’s Finance and Expenditure Committee, highlights the discord in international perspectives on crypto governance.</p><p>India: Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pressing for a global perspective. Calling for a broad regulatory approach that considers impacts beyond financial stability, PM Modi’s comments were a focal point at the recent G20 summit. His vision for international cooperation adds another layer to the ongoing discussions about how best to regulate the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>UAE: Dubai, too, is making waves in the regulatory sphere. The city’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority recently updated its rulebook, easing licensing requirements for staking services. This flexible approach further complicates the global regulatory landscape, showing that countries are far from unified in their&nbsp;methods.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1694786889838891210?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>So, where does this leave us? The quest for balanced, effective, and globally cohesive crypto regulation is ongoing. Each country’s unique approach adds another piece to an already complex puzzle. The challenge now is to find a way for these disparate pieces to fit together, promoting both innovation and security in the rapidly evolving world of digital currencies.</p><p>Now, let’s zero in on two of these major developments and analyze them in&nbsp;detail.</p> New Zealand Takes a Balanced Approach to Crypto Regulation <p>New Zealand is setting itself apart in how countries are dealing with cryptocurrency. A detailed report from its Finance and Expenditure Committee suggests watching and learning rather than rushing to set strict rules. The report sees the value and risks in crypto and recommends learning from what works and doesn’t work globally.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1694786889838891210?s=20">Image Source</a>) Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>The benefit of New Zealand’s approach is clear: it leaves space for new ideas to grow. By not setting up too many rules too quickly, the country could become a go-to place for crypto businesses looking for a more open environment.</p><p>But this careful approach also has downsides. Without set rules, things can feel uncertain. For investors and companies, clear guidelines often make it easier to plan for the future. New Zealand’s wait-and-see strategy could turn away those looking for quick, clear&nbsp;answers.</p><p>In short, New Zealand aims for a careful balance between letting the crypto market grow and keeping it in check. Whether this approach will serve as a strong model or a cautionary tale remains to be&nbsp;seen.</p> UK Adopts FATF Standards, Broad Implications Loom <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom is set to enforce the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing rules, popularly known as the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Starting September 1, UK-based crypto businesses must share customer information for transactions, aligning the country with 2019 FATF standards. This move comes as part of a slew of upcoming regulations in the UK’s crypto landscape, including new FCA marketing standards this&nbsp;October.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1692589864665928125?s=20">Image Source</a>) Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects   Global Trust: Aligning with FATF standards could boost international trust in the UK’s crypto&nbsp;market.  Risk Mitigation: The rules aim to curb illicit activities, thereby making the ecosystem safer for investors.   Negative Aspects   Compliance Burden: Companies, especially startups, may find the compliance costs burdensome.  Privacy Concerns: Sharing customer data may raise privacy issues, potentially deterring participation in the crypto&nbsp;market.  <p>This move is a telling sign of how nations are striving for a regulated yet thriving crypto environment. However, the increased oversight could serve as a double-edged sword, enhancing legitimacy while also stifling innovation and flexibility.</p><p>In navigating this complex regulatory landscape, Shyft Veriscope offers a solution that could ease the transition. Its automated features simplify compliance, mitigating risk without adding undue burdens on businesses. At the same time, its secure, peer-to-peer data sharing addresses privacy concerns, making it a noteworthy tool for a crypto industry in&nbsp;flux.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-crypto-regulations-the-south-american-way">The Shyft Perspective: Crypto Regulations — The South American&nbsp;Way</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-myths-debunked">FATF Travel Rule Myths&nbsp;Debunked</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-state-of-global-crypto-regulations">The State of Global Crypto Regulations</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

				 <p>Indicio’s new Google Marketplace product enables mobile devices to communicate with credential issuers and verifiers in decentralized identity solutions that are built using DIDComm. Reliable mediation is critical to building a successful Trusted Digital Ecosystem that supports rich, trusted interaction models including the exchange of verifiable credentials. Indicio’s mediator has proven itself in deployment, is capable of handling scale, and will accelerate your implementation.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, August 28, 2023/ <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the market leader in delivering enterprise-class verifiable data solutions, today announced the availability of the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-proven-aca-py-mediator?project=indicio-public">Indicio Proven™ Mediator on Google Cloud</a>. This is a critical product for decentralized identity infrastructure designed for rich interactions, as it provides a way for mobile devices, which lack fixed IP addresses, to reliably communicate with credential issuers and entities that wish to verify the information presented in those credentials. Now available in the Google Cloud Marketplace, the Indicio Proven™ Mediator solves an important development challenge for teams using DIDComm-based communications, accelerates solution deployments, and ensures operational success. In addition to the rich protocols within DIDComm, Indicio’s products also support protocols focused solely on credential issuance and presentation such as OID4VC.</p>
<p>A mediator provides a cloud-based connection point to send and receive requests between mobile holders and credential issuers and verifiers. As the ability to hold a verifiable credential on a mobile device is central to sharing and verifying data, mediation is a critical element of any decentralized identity deployment using DIDComm. DIDComm based protocols allow individuals using a combination of mobile phones and other internet-enabled devices to be full participants in trusted interactions. Reliable mediation ensures a smooth interaction between all parties. The Indicio Proven™ Mediator comes from Indicio’s extensive experience in building award-winning Trusted Digital Ecosystems for enterprise clients.</p>
<p>“Mediation is an essential component to any decentralized identity deployment designed for rich interactions,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “With the Indicio Proven Mediator, we’re providing Google customers with the result of our years of successful work on mediation — a product that reduces development roadmaps and deployment anxiety and enables you to grow your ecosystem solution to meet increased demand.”</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">open sourced the base code</a> for the Mediator to the Hyperledger Foundation Aries project in 2021 and subsequently deployed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">free Indicio Mediator</a> for shared use to develop and test solutions. A key operational difference between the public Indicio Mediator and the Proven Mediator on Google Cloud is that the former is shared with other users and is unsuitable for business deployment where 100 percent availability is essential. The Proven Mediator deepens Indicio’s commitment to bringing open-source, Web3, decentralized solutions to the hybrid cloud, making it easier for customers and partners to confidently deploy enterprise-grade solutions. Indicio also offers a <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/mediator-agent-training/">Mediator Agent Workshop</a> to help teams gain a deeper understanding of Mediator technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven™ Mediator joins <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-node?project=sunlit-apricot-360315">Indicio NoDe</a>, a quick-start solution for setting up and operating a node on any Hyperledger Indy network, on Google Cloud Marketplace, and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-proven-sandbox?project=indicio-public">Indicio Proven Sandbox</a>, the easiest way to create and build verifiable credential pilots, demos, and architectures. This is the first of several releases that support a variety of approaches for implementing decentralized identity. Adoption of Indicio Proven™ Mediator in Google Cloud Marketplace can count toward any existing committed spend agreements with Google.</p>

The case for infusing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> into your IT operations is compelling, with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-five-key-benefits-of-aiops-and-automation/">tangible benefits</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-six-strategic-uses-cases-for-aiops/">strategic use cases</a>.</p>



<p>First, let’s start with a basic premise—as IT systems become more complex and intertwined, automation is the most essential tool you have at your disposal. We define automation as the application of technology, programs, robotics or processes that help you realize outcomes with minimal human input and at a scale that exceeds human abilities.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at how automation—when applied to IT—helps you achieve better business results in three key areas, along with what every beginner should know to get started.</p>



 1. Better application and system performance through observability 



<p>AI-powered <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> solutions deliver advanced monitoring to provide you with the context you need to resolve incidents faster. Traditional monitoring tools might give you metrics and data, but they often lack the ability to provide a complete picture of the system’s behavior. Observability, on the other hand, focuses on collecting real-time data, logs and traces to create a holistic view of your IT environment.</p>



<p>What beginners should know about observability:</p>



 
 Observability is not an evolution of application performance monitoring (APM). APM delivers debugging of applications whereas observability delivers an understanding of applications. Watch the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXohgVATzDc">APM vs. Observability</a>. 



 Observability relies on advanced AI algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and identify patterns and anomalies. 



 Observability tools discover conditions you might never know or think to look for, then track their relationship to specific performance issues for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root cause analysis</a> and speedier resolution. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/automate/observability">Read the Enterprise Guide</a>. 



 Using observability early in development is a good thing because it allows <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> teams to identify and fix issues in new code before they impact the end user. 



 You can scale automatically with observability. For example, you can specify instrumentation and data aggregation as part of a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> cluster configuration and start gathering telemetry from the moment it spins up until it spins down. 



 Observability benefits systems of all sizes by proactively monitoring critical components and providing early detection of anomalies. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/debunking-observability-myths-part-1-why-you-cant-skip-monitoring-and-rely-only-on-logs/?c=Automation">Read about observability myths</a>. 
 



 2. Optimization and cost control through automated operations 



<p>While modern applications and IT systems are growing more complex, many cloud users still fall back on a familiar habit of overprovisioning resources to mitigate any risk to performance. Yet almost a third of organizations estimate that they <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-spend-management/">wasted their cloud spend</a>. Automated operations powered by AIOps can help you break that expensive approach and optimize your IT infrastructure, resource allocation, and cloud usage. By analyzing historical data and real-time metrics, AIOps can help you make intelligent decisions on resource provisioning, ensuring that you scale up or down depending on demand needs. The result is that you can assure application performance at the lowest possible cost.</p>



<p>What beginners should know about automated operations:</p>



 
 AIOps can help reduce unnecessary infrastructure costs by identifying underutilized resources and recommending their optimization or shutdown. Start by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/automate/rethink-cloudoperations">rethinking your cloud operations</a>. 



 By automating resource provisioning, you can avoid manual errors and optimize the overall performance of your IT systems. 



 A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-cloud-cost-optimization/">cloud cost optimization</a> platform allows you to continuously automate critical actions in real-time at a scale that can’t be matched by humans, no matter how skilled. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/finops">FinOps</a> (Finance + Operations) is an evolving financial management framework that can be included in automations operations to help deliver cost savings and faster innovation. Watch the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y1vpWDusoSs?feature=shared">FinOps for trustworthy cloud automation</a>. 



 AI-powered solutions that help you automatically manage operations can also help you create more sustainable IT by reducing waste. Read the guide: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51699">Accelerating FinOps and Sustainable IT</a>. 
 



 3. Faster incident management and resolution 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-incident-management/">Incident management</a> is a vital part of IT operations. The speed at which issues can be identified and fixed—the mean time to resolution or MTTR – is often the difference between IT fire drills or happy customers. AIOps uses AI algorithms and data analytics to automate the detection, analysis and resolution of incidents.<br><br>Implementing an AIOps platform is an excellent first step for any organization. For example, AIOps platforms can monitor server logs and network data in real-time, automatically identify patterns indicative of an incident and trigger an alert to the IT team. This proactive approach helps IT teams respond swiftly, minimizing disruptions and improving customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>What beginners should know about incident management and AIOps platforms:</p>



 
 Traditional incident management, which relies on manual time and effort, is quickly being replaced by AI-powered AIOps platform. <a href="https://aithority.com/machine-learning/ai-shifts-incident-management-from-reactive-to-proactive/">Read the AIThority article</a> on incident management. 



 This AI-powered approach turns incident management from reactive to proactive (and even preventative). <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51683">Get the Gartner Market Guide</a>. 



 AIOps platforms can ingest and correlate data from various sources to provide a comprehensive view of the entire IT landscape. 



 Users can share this comprehensive view on a single pane of glass, meaning operational silos and traditional (and time-consuming) war rooms are out and collaboration is in. Read the blog: “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/smarter-it-operations-management-with-ibm-aiops-insights/">Smarter IT operations management with IBM AIOps Insights</a>” 



 AIOps platforms may either be self-hosted or implemented as a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">SaaS</a> solution. That allows organizations of any size to find the solution that works best for them. 



 Self-hosted AIOps platforms offer more control and customization options and are a good option for complex operations, while SaaS-based AIOps platforms provide ease of implementation and scalability, allowing organizations to focus on using the platform’s capabilities rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>Or, Passwordless as the 0th Factor of Authentication</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication is kind of hot right now, even though “passwordless” predates the password—much like horse-drawn carriages predated cars (which were first known as “horseless carriages”). But after witnessing a groundswell of support for new passwordless methods such as <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/">YubiKey</a>, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO Passkey</a> (not to be confused with Apple Passkey), and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication">MS passwordless</a> authentication methods, I resolved to determine for myself whether that brave new world that has such security in it had in fact arrived. In short, we’re still not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, my recent search for KuppingerCole Analysts. As many of you are aware, I took some needed time off before joining KuppingerCole Analysts — a kind of self-directed sabbatical. During that time, when I found any job listing that seemed interesting, I’d naturally apply. That usually meant setting up an account with the employer and then connecting to LinkedIn to autofill my profile and work experience. But the authorization flow on LinkedIn requires username and password.</p>
<p>The risk of Zero Factor Authentication</p>
<p>I panicked! I didn’t know my password—Apple Keychain had it. So, I scrambled to authenticate to Keychain on my phone and then realized, “dang it! How do I transfer this ridiculous password that’s longer than my screen onto this web browser??” I thought about copying and pasting the password somewhere I could see it in a large, easy to read font—but then my Apple Passkey is out there in the universe! I then realized I could go get the MacBook I sync my Keychain to, start the flow over from there, then open Keychain on that MacBook and copy and paste from there (note: this is an embellishment—I don’t actually own a set of security-separated MacBooks, but it illustrates a point).</p>
<p>Hmm… I mean, I normally like having options, as long as one of them is good. But, in this case I realized that in pursuit of multi-factor authentication I had ended up with none—I now call it Zero Factor Authentication (ZFA). I guess that’s what is meant by Zero Trust? Anyway, after a couple such occurrences, I reset my LinkedIn password back to something I actually know.</p>
<p>What kind of factor is passwordless?</p>
<p>Now, some of you may be thinking, that if had only used a FIDO Passkey instead, things would have gone smoothly. But, allow the pun: not so fast. A FIDO Passkey uses a Private Key that resides on my device. This begs invoking the “practitioner’s refrain”: is this something I know? is it something I have? is it something I am? OK, it’s something I have, so that’s 1-for-3 and arguably stronger than something I know.</p>
<p>So, what kind of factor is passwordless? The way I see it, it’s a flow that provides evidence to a website you’re visiting that you have successfully enabled your device to sign a challenge that the site just sent. See? But again, what kind of factor is that? Well, it’s “something special you enable a pre-registered device to do,” which strongly implies to the website that it can consequently continue with the operation at hand … conveniently. So, maybe passwordless defies our decades-long adherence to the 3-pronged approach to identity verification; maybe passwordless is more of a root factor—say, a “0th“ factor?</p>
<p>The absence of a priori technology agreements</p>
<p>The quality of passwords that continually escapes our security consciousness is their utility; no other authentication method even comes close to the utility of a password. Passwords can be used anytime, anywhere, by anybody for whatever reason, and across any technology. Passwords don’t require a priori agreement on technology or standards. These qualities must also be part of any passwordless solution if it is to become ubiquitous.</p>
<p>This all reminded me of a Lex Fridman <a href="https://www.happyscribe.com/public/lex-fridman-podcast-artificial-intelligence-ai/124-stephen-wolfram-fundamental-theory-of-physics-life-and-the-universe">podcast</a> I once heard during which Steven Wolfram discussed his ideas on entropy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">2nd Law of Thermodynamics</a>. In Wolfram’s interpretation, this law predicts that closed systems prefer to settle in a state that appears chaotic from the human perspective, while eschewing states that we find much simpler and more organized.</p>
<p>To apply Wolfram’s definition here, passwords exist because that’s the state the system is most likely to be in, whereas passwordless is a state that requires vast amounts of energy or luck to arrive at and sustain. Why do we still use passwords? It’s elementary, everyone: entropy; or as I call it “The Second Law of AuthN Dynamics.”</p>
<p>For the record, I’m still working out the First Law, so stay tuned! One way you can do that is by attending my next (and first) webinar at KuppingerCole, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2023/09/digital-transformation-for-finance-with-biometrics">Digital Transformation in Financial Services Using Biometrics</a>” on September 19. I’ll be hosting Pascal Tavernier, Identity &amp; Access Management Architect, Executive Director at UBS, to get his insights on how to make strong forms of authentication ubiquitous. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me with questions or comments.</p>

<p>With nearly 5 billion users worldwide—more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/social-media-users/#:~:text=The%20global%20social%20network%20penetration,base%20with%202.99%20billion%20users">60% of the global population</a>—social media platforms have become a vast source of data that businesses can leverage for improved customer satisfaction, better marketing strategies and faster overall business growth. Manually processing data at that scale, however, can prove prohibitively costly and time-consuming. One of the best ways to take advantage of social media data is to implement text-mining programs that streamline the process.</p>



 What is text mining? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-mining">Text mining</a>—also called text data mining—is an advanced discipline within data science that uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> models, and data mining techniques to derive pertinent qualitative information from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/structured-vs-unstructured-data/">unstructured text data</a>. Text analysis takes it a step farther by focusing on pattern identification across large datasets, producing more quantitative results.</p>



<p>As it pertains to social media data, text mining algorithms (and by extension, text analysis) allow businesses to extract, analyze and interpret linguistic data from comments, posts, customer reviews and other text on social media platforms and leverage those data sources to improve products, services and processes.</p>



<p>When used strategically, text-mining tools can transform raw data into real <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a>, giving companies a competitive edge.</p>



 How does text mining work? 



<p>Understanding the text-mining workflow is vital to unlocking the full potential of the methodology. Here, we’ll lay out the text-mining process, highlighting each step and its significance to the overall outcome.</p>



 Step 1. Information retrieval 



<p>The first step in the text-mining workflow is information retrieval, which requires data scientists to gather relevant textual data from various sources (e.g., websites, social media platforms, customer surveys, online reviews, emails and/or internal databases). The data collection process should be tailored to the specific objectives of the analysis. In the case of social media text mining, that means a focus on comments, posts, ads, audio transcripts, etc.</p>



 Step 2. Data preprocessing 



<p>Once you collect the necessary data, you’ll preprocess it in preparation for analysis. Preprocessing will include several sub-steps, including the following:</p>



 
 Text cleaning: Text cleaning is the process of removing irrelevant characters, punctuation, special symbols and numbers from the dataset. It also includes converting the text to lowercase to ensure consistency in the analysis stage. This process is especially important when mining social media posts and comments, which are often full of symbols, emojis and unconventional capitalization patterns. 



 Tokenization: Tokenization breaks down the text into individual units (i.e., words and/or phrases) known as tokens. This step provides the basic building blocks for subsequent analysis. 



 Stop-words removal: Stop words are common words that don’t have significant meaning in a phrase or sentence (e.g., “the,” “is,” “and,” etc.). Removing stop words helps reduce noise in the data and improve accuracy in the analysis stage. 



 Stemming and lemmatization: Stemming and lemmatization techniques normalize words to their root form. Stemming reduces words to their base form by removing prefixes or suffixes, while lemmatization maps words to their dictionary form. These techniques help consolidate word variations, reduce redundancy and limit the size of indexing files.&nbsp; 



 Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: POS tagging facilitates semantic analysis by assigning grammatical tags to words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.), which is particularly useful for sentiment analysis and entity recognition. 



 Syntax parsing: Parsing involves analyzing the structure of sentences and phrases to determine the role of different words in the text. For instance, a parsing model could identify the subject, verb and object of a complete sentence. 
 



 Step 3. Text representation 



<p>In this stage, you’ll assign the data numerical values so it can be processed by machine learning (ML) algorithms, which will create a predictive model from the training inputs. These are two common methods for text representation:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Bag-of-words (BoW): BoW represents text as a collection of unique words in a text document. Each word becomes a feature, and the frequency of occurrence represents its value. BoW doesn’t account for word order, instead focusing exclusively on word presence. 



 Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF): TF-IDF calculates the importance of each word in a document based on its frequency or rarity across the entire dataset. It weighs down frequently occurring words and emphasizes rarer, more informative terms. 
 



 Step 4. Data extraction 



<p>Once you’ve assigned numerical values, you will apply one or more text-mining techniques to the structured data to extract insights from social media data. Some common techniques include the following:</p>



 
 Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis categorizes data based on the nature of the opinions expressed in social media content (e.g., positive, negative or neutral). It can be useful for understanding customer opinions and brand perception, and for detecting sentiment trends. 



 Topic modeling: Topic modeling aims to discover underlying themes and/or topics in a collection of documents. It can help identify trends, extract key concepts and predict customer interests. Popular algorithms for topic modeling include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). 



 Named entity recognition (NER): NER extracts relevant information from unstructured data by identifying and classifying named entities (like person names, organizations, locations and dates) within the text. It also automates tasks like information extraction and content categorization.&nbsp; 



 Text classification: Useful for tasks like sentiment classification, spam filtering and topic classification, text classification involves categorizing documents into predefined classes or categories. Machine learning algorithms like Naïve Bayes and support vector machines (SVM), and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a> models like convolutional <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> (CNN) are frequently used for text classification. 



 Association rule mining: Association rule mining can discover relationships and patterns between words and phrases in social media data, uncovering associations that may not be obvious at first glance. This approach helps identify hidden connections and co-occurrence patterns that can drive business decision-making in later stages. 
 



 Step 5. Data analysis and interpretation 



<p>The next step is to examine the extracted patterns, trends and insights to develop meaningful conclusions. Data visualization techniques like word clouds, bar charts and network graphs can help you present the findings in a concise, visually appealing way.&nbsp;</p>



 Step 6. Validation and iteration 



<p>It’s essential to make sure your mining results are accurate and reliable, so in the penultimate stage, you should validate the results. Evaluate the performance of the text-mining models using relevant evaluation metrics and compare your outcomes with ground truth and/or expert judgment. If necessary, make adjustments to the preprocessing, representation and/or modeling steps to improve the results. You may need to iterate this process until the results are satisfactory.</p>



 Step 7. Insights and decision-making 



<p>The final step of the text-mining workflow is transforming the derived insights into actionable strategies that will help your business optimize social media data and usage. The extracted knowledge can guide processes like product improvements, marketing campaigns, customer support enhancements and risk mitigation strategies—all from social media content that already exists.</p>



 Applications of text mining with social media 



<p>Text mining helps companies leverage the omnipresence of social media platforms/content to improve a business’s products, services, processes and strategies. Some of the most interesting use cases for social media text mining include the following:</p>



 
 Customer insights and sentiment analysis: Social media text mining enables businesses to gain deep insights into customer preferences, opinions and sentiments. Using programming languages like Python with high-tech platforms like NLTK and SpaCy, companies can analyze user-generated content (e.g., posts, comments and product reviews) to understand how customers perceive their products or services. This valuable information helps decision-makers refine marketing strategies, improve product offerings and deliver a more personalized <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a>. 



 Improved customer support: When used alongside text analytics software, feedback systems (like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a>), net-promoter scores (NPS), support tickets, customer surveys and social media profiles provide data that helps companies enhance the customer experience. Text mining and sentiment analysis also provide a framework to help companies address acute pain points quickly and improve overall customer satisfaction. 



 Enhanced market research and competitive intelligence: Social media text mining provides businesses a cost-effective way to conduct market research and understand consumer behavior. By tracking keywords, hashtags and mentions related to their industry, companies can gain real-time insights into consumer preferences, opinions and purchasing patterns. Furthermore, businesses can monitor competitors’ social media activity and use text mining to identify market gaps and devise strategies to gain a competitive advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Effective brand reputation management: Social media platforms are powerful channels where customers express opinions en masse. Text mining enables companies to proactively monitor and respond to brand mentions and customer feedback in real-time. By promptly addressing negative sentiments and customer concerns, businesses can mitigate potential reputation crises. Analyzing brand perception also gives organizations insight into their strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; 



 Targeted marketing and personalized marketing: &nbsp;Social media text mining facilitates granular audience segmentation based on interests, behaviors and preferences. Analyzing social media data helps businesses identify key customer segments and tailor marketing campaigns accordingly, ensuring that marketing efforts are relevant, engaging and can effectively drive conversion rates. A targeted approach will optimize the user experience and enhance an organization’s ROI. 



 Influencer identification and marketing: Text mining helps organizations identify influencers and thought leaders within specific industries. By analyzing engagement, sentiment and follower count, companies can identify relevant influencers for collaborations and marketing campaigns, allowing businesses to amplify their brand message, reach new audiences, foster brand loyalty and build authentic connections.&nbsp; 



 Crisis management and risk management: Text mining serves as an invaluable tool for identifying potential crises and managing risks. Monitoring social media can help companies detect early warning signs of impending crises, address customer complaints and prevent negative incidents from escalating. This proactive approach minimizes reputational damage, builds consumer trust and enhances overall crisis management strategies.&nbsp; 



 Product development and innovation: Businesses always stand to benefit from better communication with customers. Text mining creates a direct line of communication with customers, helping companies gather valuable feedback and uncover opportunities for innovation. A customer-centric approach enables companies refine to existing products, develop new offerings and stay ahead of evolving customer needs and expectations.

       Federated Learning 
<p>In addition to UNISOT’s blockchain prowess, federated learning plays a vital role in empowering large enterprises. <a href="http://(https://seafoodchain.no/federated-learning-in-the-fishing-and-seafood-industry/)">Federated learning</a> is a machine learning approach that enables training machine learning models across multiple devices or servers while keeping data decentralized and secure. This technology allows enterprises to collaborate and gain insights from collective data without sharing sensitive information.</p>
 Key Benefits of Federated Learning: 
      <p>Privacy Preservation</p>
<p>For large enterprises, data privacy is of paramount importance. Federated learning ensures that sensitive data remains on-premises, never leaving the organization’s servers. This way, enterprises can collaborate on improving machine learning models without compromising data confidentiality.</p>
      <p>Enhanced Model Performance</p>
<p>By pooling knowledge from various entities, federated learning enables the creation of robust and accurate machine learning models. The aggregated insights from diverse data sources result in better models that can benefit all participating enterprises.</p>

<p>Web3 technology is the next evolution of the internet, emphasizing decentralization, transparency and user ownership of data. UNISOT Web3 Supply Chain Traceability Platform, implementing Blockchain and AI in the form of Federated Learning, creates a powerful ecosystem that empowers large enterprises further.</p>
 Key Benefits of Web3 Technology: 
      <p>Decentralization and Transparency</p>
<p>Web3 technology leverages blockchain’s decentralization to create transparent and trustless interactions. In the context of supply chains, this means verifiable and auditable records of every transaction, providing unparalleled transparency for enterprises and their customers.</p>
      <p>User-Centric Data Control</p>
<p>With Web3, organizations and individuals have greater control over their data, deciding what information to share and with whom. For large enterprises collaborating on federated learning models, this user-centric approach ensures that data contributors have ownership and agency over their valuable information.</p>
       <p>UNISOT opens a world of opportunities for large enterprises seeking to optimize their supply chains, enhance operational efficiency and foster customer loyalty. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, businesses can create a seamless, transparent and secure ecosystem that drives growth and success in the modern digital landscape.</p>

<p>Framing matters. How you frame an issue or picture determines what you include and what you leave out, how the relationships between the different elements present themselves, and therefore what you focus your attention on.</p><p>The Mona Lisa’s hands are, no doubt, beautifully painted. But would this picture have achieved its iconic world-wide status if the hands were all we were looking&nbsp;at?</p><p>Today we’ve got a ‘Mona Lisa hands situation’ with personal data. The issues have been framed in such a way that the full significance and opportunity of what is unfolding is being left out of the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Two common narratives about personal data illustrate this problem. The first is the classic ‘corporate asset’ picture of personal data, which creates a story that goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Data, including personal data, is one of the modern corporation’s greatest assets because the analytics-driven insights it generates can drive innovation, improve marketing targeting, and provide competitive edge (especially if other corporations can’t get their hands on the data that you can). Therefore, the corporation needs to amass as much data as it can, and policy makers need to support corporations in these efforts as much as they can — because this is the route to economy-wide innovation and growth which will benefit us&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>This, basically, was thinking behind the current Government’s earlier (but now defunct) attempts to take data in “a new direction”. [LINK] It also lies behind many of today’s biggest problems as they relate to personal data including corporate agendas focused on data monetisation that drive them to invade peoples’ privacy and abuse of the power it provides. Cambridge Analytica springs to&nbsp;mind.</p><p>In response to this narrative, another counter-narrative has grown up. It goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Organisations’ unrestrained collection and use of data has resulted in multiple abuses of power and privacy and an unfair share of rewards. Therefore individuals should be given more control over the data that organisations collect about them and these rights should be legally enshrined in legislation such as&nbsp;GDPR.”</blockquote><p>At one level, these two different narratives are complete opposites. The first ‘corporate asset’ narrative focuses on commercial benefits unleashed for corporations; the second ‘human rights’ narrative focuses on laws and policies designed to counter and ameliorate the harms caused by corporations’ over-zealous pursuit of financial gain.</p><p>On the other hand, they are both organisation-centric in their underlying assumptions. They both assume that what happens in the world of personal data revolves entirely around how organisations collect and use it. To this degree, they are like the Mona Lisa’s hands. They come as a pair, the one being the mirror image opposite of the&nbsp;other.</p><p>And as narratives, neither is actually ‘wrong’. They are indeed part of the picture. But focusing on them alone means missing what it has really got to&nbsp;say.</p><p>Only if you zoom out to see the bigger picture — the one that includes the Mona Lisa’s face — can the limitations of this organisation-centric framing be seen. This reframing of the narrative goes like&nbsp;this.</p> A system trapped by its&nbsp;history <p>Our current data ecosystem is trapped by its history, with its total dependence on the organisation-centric database.</p><p>With the organisation-centric database, organisations collect and generate data which they place in their systems and use to add value in various ways. The organisation-centric database was a game-changing invention. It was how the data economy developed. It is still how organisations use data to add value and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. It is immensely valuable and important.</p><p>But it has a design flaw in its very foundations. At a certain point, it cannot help but run slap-bang into the essential nature of data e.g. that data doesn’t get ‘used up’ when it is used; that the same data points can be used by many different parties for many different purposes.</p><p>So the way our data ecosystem has evolved means that it has hit a systemic brick wall. For the full potential of data to be realised it has to be shared. But the organisation-centric database stands in the way of&nbsp;this.</p><p>People are trying to address this problem in many ways, for example by seeking to create data ‘markets’ or ‘Open Spaces’ or initiatives around Open&nbsp;Data.</p> The problem of personal&nbsp;data <p>However, all these ways of getting round the problem hit another fundamental snag when it comes to personal data. Data use and sharing raises important questions relating to privacy, ethics and human rights. Laws such as GDPR have been passed to establish and protect individuals’ rights in these areas. It has been determined that unlike virtually every other corporate asset, personal data is not the organisation’s private property that it can do anything it likes&nbsp;with.</p><p>These issues relating to privacy, ethics, human rights and data protection are big enough when data use is restricted only to organisation-centric silos. They explode out of control once we start trying to share personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Again, many attempts have been made to address these issues, virtually all of them based on the human rights narrative summarised above. But in the end, all these attempts really do is throw sand into the gears of efficient data operations.</p> A fundamental structural question <p>What’s needed is to find a way to share data that respects individuals’ rights and retains their trust, but which also works efficiently, so that they become mutually supporting rather than mutually opposing.</p><p>This is not just a moral, ethical, human rights and governance issue. It is also a structural issue. It relates to the structure and architecture of the data ecosystem itself.</p><p>The structure of today’s organisation-centric data ecosystem is a bit like a redwood forest, full of towering trees, each a vertical silo in its own right, but without any roots connecting them in the soil. (Or you could think of this structure as a set of buildings made up only of pillars with no floors connecting them.)</p><p>Within this system, when it comes to data, individuals are tied to the organisations they have data relationships with. Their data is held by the organisation and the individual cannot go elsewhere with it. This is like the feudal system where serfs were tied to the&nbsp;land.</p> The need for a new layer of personal data infrastructure <p>To unleash the full potential of personal data — to enable safe, efficient data sharing — we need end data serfdom so that individuals can collect, store, use, manage and share their own data independently of the organisations that collect and use data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This isn’t just about giving individuals the right to ask for their data to be ported from one siloed organisation to another, as in Open Banking. It is about equipping individuals with their own databases for their own data which operate independently of and outside of organisations’ software systems and estates. So that the data becomes the individual’s asset, as well as a corporate asset with shared rights as defined by terms of service and data sharing agreements approved by the individual.</p><p>As well as safely storing individuals’ data (for example for their own use), these personal databases need to do something else: they need to enable individuals to share their data with other parties if they wish to — including other organisations.</p><p>What this does is transform the architecture and structure of the data ecosystem. All the existing separate, isolated, parallel data silos remain just as they are, fulfilling their old functions. But a new ingredient — a new layer — is added to the system: a data sharing network with each individual acting as a data sharing node within the network, connecting that individual to all the entities she has data relationships with. This is what personal data store infrastructure does: change the structure of the system to enable safe, efficient data sharing that unleashes the full personal, social and economic potential of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>To continue the analogy from above, this new personal data store infrastructure places a new mycelial network under each of the redwood trees in the forest, enabling the exchange of nutrients and information between them — in a way that also empowers the citizen and slices through all the moral, ethical, human rights and governance issues that were previously blocking the system’s efficient working.</p> Win-win economic&nbsp;benefits <p>Economically speaking, this structural change opens the door to a productivity and innovation revolution which is potentially as big as that created by mass production in the early 20th century. (It operates by the same principles). But most people, stuck as they are with organisation-centric blinkers to their vision, simply cannot see it, just as craft producers could not see the potential of standardised parts and moving assembly&nbsp;lines.</p><p>The economic revolution arises because today’s organisation-centric silos generate massive, system-wide duplication of effort and cost. Just as craft producers were piling on cost by continually re-working every item they hand-produced in order to fit them together, so today’s organisations are each duplicating the effort and costs needed to do basically the same things with much of the same data. In the meantime, they are also massively restricting the potential uses of this&nbsp;data.</p><p>Mydex has outlined the economic opportunities opened up by the structural change we are talking about in our White Paper on<a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf"> The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>. Actually, there are seven different economic revolutions all bound up together in a mutually reinforcing way. But basically they boil down to a very simple insight. If individuals are equipped with tools that enable them to safely bring their own data with them to data relationships — including data previously generated and used by other organisations — then layer upon layer of duplicated cost and effort can be stripped out of the workings of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Of course, these tools are what is provided by the personal data&nbsp;store.</p> Conclusion <p>Different frames generate different pictures which in turn create different action agendas. The ‘corporate asset’ framing of personal data creates its own particular ‘therefore’: therefore organisations need to accumulate and monetise as much data as they can. The human rights framing of personal data creates a mirror-image opposite: therefore individuals need to have legally backed rights to exert some control over what these organisations do with their data. These, together, are the Mona Lisa’s&nbsp;hands.</p><p>But if you reframe the personal data picture to include her face, in context, a very different picture emerges with an equally different ‘therefore’: therefore we need to build a person-centric, citizen-empowering view where personal data also becomes a personal asset; where every individual is equipped with their own, independent personal data store. Equipping citizens in this way should be seen as a vital 21st century infrastructure project, just as providing water, electricity, road and rail transport were seen in their&nbsp;day.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-do-you-think-of-the-mona-lisas-hands-and-other-such-problems-bfc284bee919">What do you think of the Mona Lisa’s hands?

<p>You should own your thoughts.</p><p>This may seem like an odd statement. "Of course, I own my thoughts," you think to yourself. But when you take those thoughts and enter them into a notes app, are you always guaranteed access to those ideas?</p><p>Most note-taking apps are centralized tools. If a company that runs the app goes out of business, users lose all of their content - that's years of valuable insights.</p><p>And what if you become unhappy with the direction the app is taking, and you wish to take your notes to one that has more of the features you desire? Good luck trying to switch seamlessly. It's unlikely that the apps will interoperate with each other, leaving you stuck spending countless hours trying to reconfigure your notes on the new platform.</p><p>Furthermore, since these centralized apps are walled gardens, your friends and connections are left behind, leaving you missing out on the social aspect of shared note-taking.</p><p>But the web wasn't always this way.</p><p>It started as a way for researchers and academics to share information worldwide. Distributed nodes were established at institutions and universities, enabling users to uncover important insights faster and make breakthroughs. Everything interoperated because it was built on open protocols, and data always stayed with the user first.</p><p>How can we return to this way of working and collaborating on the web?</p><p>That was the question <a href="https://twitter.com/gordonbrander">Gordon Brander</a> and <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@cdata@mastodon.social">Chris Joel</a> had two years ago. Brander and Joel wanted to find a way to build a worldwide knowledge graph that would empower users to own their thoughts and surface connections that they wouldn't have otherwise realized were there, all while connecting with others to work more efficiently.</p> Open Protocols and Their Benefits <p>Brander and Joel started building Subconscious, a local-first decentralized note-taking app. They began with the protocol that would power the app - Noosphere. Noosphere is permissionless and open source, like HTTP or IMAP; anyone can build on top of it. That means even if the Subconscious app goes away one day, anyone running the Noosphere protocol can resurrect it. Content AND contacts can also move with the user to another platform built on Noosphere, creating a <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fcredible%2520exit&amp;utm_medium=reader2">credible exit</a>. </p><p>All the content users create is stored on IPFS. IPFS uses content-addressable data created by a cryptographic hashing process that generates a unique identifier (CID). The CID acts as a hard link that points to a specific version of a file. This data structure enables two important things - distributed file storage and version control.</p><p>Distributed file storage makes the Subconscious app more resilient and able to work offline and local-first. And since IPFS is a shared resource with high adoption in both the Web3 and DWeb spaces, this is another reassurance that the user's notes are safe. </p><p>Version control allows Subconscious to create a daisy chain of edits synced across all devices. Furthermore, users can use this structure to review previous versions if they need to restore their notes or memo to an earlier state.</p><p>Data is linked using hypertext. These integrated hyperlinks enable users to build their knowledge networks. </p> The Heart of Subconscious - Notes, Memos, and Spheres <p>Noosphere is a protocol made up of networked "spheres." Your sphere is your portable data backpack. Spheres contain your content as "notes" and "memos". </p><p>Like a letter envelope, memos wrap your notes and add some additional metadata, including an IPFS content ID that points to the version history for that file (the previous version of that memo). Subconscious puts note files in memos, but you can put any file in a memo, making Noosphere a versatile tool. </p><p>Spheres also contain contacts, similar to an address book of other spheres you follow. </p><p>Finally, spheres are not a server. They are a data structure that lives on your device (local first) and on IPFS. That means your sphere is decentralized, and you always have your data. And spheres are signed with your cryptographic key, so they are secure and can be verified as belonging to you.</p><p>Subconscious users can delegate and revoke access to their spheres anytime because the tool utilizes <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>. Created by Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, UCANs handle authorization in distributed systems by leveraging capabilities rather than ACLs. Users delegate their capabilities rather than their keys, making it very secure. Each agent in the system identifies itself using a keypair, and the user delegates capabilities (permissions) to the keypair. </p> In Summary <p>Subconscious is open source and transparent and provides users with a credible exit. No walled gardens or predatory privacy policies leaving users feeling powerless with few viable alternatives. &nbsp;Open source protocols that bring transparency and trust are utilized to thwart centralization.</p><p>Users don't sacrifice the multi-player experience. Subconscious users will enjoy networked intelligence effects when they follow other users, making connections and gleaning insights that might have otherwise eluded them. This will amplify users' productivity, creativity, and ability to collectively solve big problems.</p> Getting Started <p>Subconscious is now in <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subconscious-beta">beta</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9l6eo5KQiEuT9JuomtTagd8DU37b6fXUrqlKbSWRfBBP-Bg/viewform">Join the waitlist</a>! </p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Planning and managing your cloud ecosystem and environments is critical for reducing production downtime and maintaining a functioning workload. In the “Managing your cloud ecosystems” blog series, we cover different strategies for ensuring that your setup functions smoothly with minimal downtime.</p>



<p>To start things off, the first topic in this blog series is ensuring workload continuity during worker node upgrades.</p>



 What are worker node upgrades? 



<p>Worker node upgrades apply important security updates and patches and should be completed regularly. For more information on types of worker node upgrades, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#vpc_worker_node">Updating VPC worker nodes</a> and <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node">Updating Classic worker nodes</a> in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</a> documentation.</p>



<p>During an upgrade, some of your worker nodes may become unavailable. It’s important to make sure your cluster has enough capacity to continue running your workload throughout the upgrade process. Building a pipeline to update your worker nodes without causing application downtime will allow you to easily apply worker node upgrades regularly.</p>



 For classic worker nodes 



<p>Create a Kubernetes configmap that defines the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time, including during an upgrade. The maximum value is specified as a percentage. You can also use labels to apply different rules to different worker nodes. For complete instructions, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker-up-configmap">Updating Classic worker nodes in the CLI with a configmap</a> in the Kubernetes service documentation. If you choose not to create a configmap, the default maximum amount of worker nodes that become unavailable is 20%.</p>



<p>If you need your total number of worker nodes to remain up and running, use the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_resize"><code>ibmcloud ks worker-pool resize</code></a> command to temporarily add extra worker nodes to your cluster for the duration of the upgrade process. When the upgrade is complete, use the same command to remove the additional worker nodes and return your worker pool to its previous size.</p>



 For VPC worker nodes  



<p>VPC worker nodes are replaced by removing the old worker node and provisioning a new worker node that runs at the new version. You can upgrade one or more worker nodes at the same time, but if you upgrade multiple at once, they become unavailable at the same time. To make sure you have enough capacity to run your workload during the upgrade, you can plan to either <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_resize">resize your worker pools</a> to temporarily add extra worker nodes (similar to the process described for classic worker nodes) or plan to upgrade your worker nodes one by one.</p>



<p>Wrap up</p>



<p>Whether you choose to implement a configmap, resize your worker pool or upgrade components one-by-one, creating a workload continuity plan before you upgrade your worker nodes can help you create a more streamlined, efficient setup with limited downtime.</p>



<p>Now that you have a plan to prevent disruptions during worker node upgrades, keep an eye out for the next blog in our series, which will discuss how, when and why to implement major, minor or patch upgrades to your clusters and worker nodes.</p>

 We sit down with the financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach to discuss why he left the police force, how criminal investigations have changed over time, the importance of education and accountability in an anti-fraud strategy, and why he would never become a KYC specialist. 



 



<p>Paul Stratton has always wanted to be a police officer. In fact, during a recent house clean-up, his wife discovered a childhood picture of Paul and his brother dressed up as characters from ‘Chips’ (an 80’s TV show about two motorcycle officers from the California Highway Patrol).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, after 22 years of working for Merseyside Police, including almost four years in the Fraud Unit, Paul knew he had to leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It got to the point where I was struggling with the lack of team ethos and internal politics. Before moving to the Fraud Unit, I was investigating domestic abuse, violent crimes, and sexual offences, and was starting to feel like an Uber driver, where the next job would just pop up in my inbox. I just didn’t have time to follow up as much as I wanted to with the people I had helped and that always bothered me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Victim care is something that the police talk a lot about and I think it’s just become a soundbite. I don’t think we are doing as well as we could with victim care in certain areas of policing, and it frustrated me to just follow up with phone calls.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then, that Paul left the police to pursue a career in fraud and financial crime training and raising awareness of the harm of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of education, accountability, and tangible messaging in the battle against fraud was a recurring theme in our discussion, as Paul believes a lack of consistent education – to the public, to the police, and the wider public sector – is a significant issue in the UK’s fight against fraud attacks. These rates, Paul believes, will not go down until that education gap is filled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referring to the UK’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">recently-released fraud strategy</a>, Paul said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>You can create the best strategy in the world, but it’ll just collect cyber dust unless there’s tangible messaging that is shared with the public. There’s no real messaging, and that’s where I fear it’ll fail.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>“We can’t hold departments accountable because, besides the general aim to reduce fraud by 10% by 2025, there are no specific figures [that they wish to hit] or how they’re going to do it,&nbsp;and no one knows what they’re tangibly supposed to be doing. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-outlines-his-five-key-priorities-for-2023">British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out his five priorities for 2023</a>, and, like them or not, they are clear, so why aren’t we doing something similar with the UK’s fraud strategy?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss everything from Paul’s skepticism regarding the strategy’s 400 promised new fraud officers, why he hates words like ‘scams’, ‘white collar crime’, and ‘money mules’, and why we’re still probably one or two generations away from fully recognizing the impact of social media and acting upon the dangers of online crime.</p>



 From detective at Merseyside Police to fraud specialist at Liverpool City Council, and currently, a full-time fraud apprenticeship coach and fraud and financial crime trainer, why the career change, and what are the main differences and similarities in roles, if any? 



<p>I spent 22 years with Merseyside Police, and never wanted to leave, in fact I still consider myself police, but I had to leave as I knew there had to be something better out there. Somewhere where a work/life balance is achievable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I brought the same principles and work ethic into my role at Liverpool City Council. In fact, it was working at the Council where I learned the most about fraud, corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest, gifts and hospitality, social media, KYC, and all the other typical red flags you look out for in police investigations.&nbsp;</p>



 What did a typical day look like at Liverpool County Council? 



<p>I oversaw the Whistle Blowing process, reviewing, and allocating cases, and I was the lead investigator for all allegations of internal fraud and potential criminal activity. I was also part of the council’s effective Due Diligence Group and developed the council’s new Fighting Fraud &amp; Corruption Together strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020-2021, Liverpool City Council received a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/25/scale-of-problems-at-liverpool-city-council-revealed-in-commissioners-report">bad press</a> due to claims of widespread corruption, which led to numerous police investigations and government intervention.</p>



<p>I started my role just after the controversy started, so a lot of my work was focused on trying to bring Liverpool City Council to a point where there was that awareness of fraud and best practices. So, I would work virtually every day on building and delivering educational and engaging training sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We talk a lot about anti-fraud culture, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/counter-fraud-culture-uk/">counter-fraud culture </a>– that’s a phrase that’s bandied around. But anti-fraud culture is a difficult thing to achieve, as that would mean everybody knows about fraud, and how to prevent it and protect themselves from it.</p>



 What led you to leave the Council and launch your fraud and financial crime training and consultancy business? 



<p>It’s something I’ve always wanted to do. I am committed to providing quality training to delegates. Long gone are the days when trainers could just sit in front of a PowerPoint and talk for an hour. It must be immersive, with tasks, real-life examples, and problem-solving sessions. People want, need, and deserve more. This is especially true in the public sector, where there’s very little money to train people, so when a trainer does come in, it’s vital they deliver the best learning they can.</p>



 How have criminal investigations and intelligence operations changed in the two-plus decades since you began? 



<p>Since I started, back in 1998, it’s changed dramatically. For example, when I joined there was very little education on evidence-gathering at a scene, but now, with technology, recruits are even receiving Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and social media training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether it’s over Facebook (which it inevitably is), or Instagram or Twitter, investigators need to know and understand how to secure digital evidence. That’s where a lot of the crime exists now. It’s not in person anymore – it’s online.</p>



 Would you say the perception of fraud has changed over the years? 



<p>Yes and no. When I started in the police, the Fraud Unit, which was called the Cheque and Fraud Wing, would only deal with cases of a certain amount; it had to be of high value for them to even become involved.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Some police forces, like Merseyside Police, have now shifted to harm-based assessments, where they look at the harm caused by fraud. Yes, the monetary amount is important, but it’s not everything.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>For example, £1 million in losses to a huge organization is a speed bump in relation to a single parent losing £500 in a month and being unable to pay the rent. You see this with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance frauds</a>, where people lose everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the perception of fraud can be too rarefied; we think ‘fraud’, we think “white collar crime,” and it’s a phrase I can’t stand, because many equate “white collar crime” with a business crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last suspect I ever interviewed before I left the police was a young lad involved in a gang that were dealing drugs and other types of criminal activities like selling fake Liverpool and Everton tickets. And they were doing all that through a bank account they’d created with the name of a vulnerable neighbor, and had done it horrifically easily at the time. There are increasing numbers of gangs moving into fraud and money laundering now.</p>



 What are your thoughts on the UK’s recently-released fraud strategy? Do you think it goes far enough, and is dedicating resources in the right place? 



<p>I think anything that looks at reducing fraud is a good thing. However, [in the strategy] there are a lot of new names for old teams, and reinventing the wheel somewhat, but that’s often law enforcement’s way. We go from priority to priority. You won’t have a burglary team for two years, but then you have a huge burglary problem, so you assemble a burglary squad and solve that problem, then move onto something else. Such is the lack of resources to specialize in everything at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the things that I’m skeptical about is the government’s pledge to get 400 new specialist investigators. I don’t think these can be existing police officers, as no police force has enough staff to do what they need to do right now. So, I’m not sure where any new fraud specialists are going to come from, and whether they’re going to be trained or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also don’t think the fraud strategy factors in the educational component. The strategy may be on gov.uk, but are people seeing it in any kind of usable format?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are we doing enough education-wise with the public? I can’t ever remember seeing an advert on fraud prevention from the government. I see adverts about giving to charity and how people can spend money, but I don’t see adverts on how people can protect their money.</p>



 In the Foreword to the strategy, Home Secretary, Suella Braverman spoke of the need for coordinated collaboration between the police, the public and private sectors, as well as allies abroad. In your opinion, what is the most important component of a successful fraud strategy? Conversely, what hinders or can negatively impact the strategy, or a fraud investigation? 



<p>Intelligence sharing between the public and private sector and international arena is nothing new. The fact that, in 2023, we’re still talking about better intelligence sharing shows how far behind we are. From an investigator’s point of view, the mechanisms already exist for effective intel sharing. We have the National Crime Agency, which does a lot for police forces when they’re investigating abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if I was investigating bank accounts or looking to get an IP address, we have Financial Intelligence Units that can act in the international arena. We have the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force</a> for money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to look at how this affects investigators, and how we can make their jobs easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know they’ve assigned an MP (Member of Parliament) with the role of Anti-Fraud Champion [Anthony Browne, MP], which is fantastic, but I think it needs to be more effective than just naming someone a champion. Is giving this role to one MP enough? How is he going to do that amongst his constituency work, and other responsibilities? (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Read more about the UK’s Anti-Fraud Champion, Anthony Browne here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Fraud accounts for 40% of all crime, 80% of that fraud is cyber. If this was burglary (or firearms), I can guarantee there’d be more press, and people would understand what steps the government is taking, and people would be more educated.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>But, for some reason, fraud is just not considered as severe. It’s almost perceived as a sort of invisible crime, where a lot of victims may report it but be too embarrassed to tell people about it.</p>



<p>For example, with romance fraud, many people may think the victim has brought it on themselves and should have been wiser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t like the term ‘money mules’; I call them money movers. I also don’t like the word ‘scam,’ people do not ‘fall for scams.’ They are defrauded by criminals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People may have a lack of empathy when they hear “falling for a scam,” and think how could they send £500 pounds to someone they’ve never met? Well, that’s the way of the world now – that’s how we meet people in 2023. We’ve moved on; we’re probably one or two generations away from a full understanding of the impact of social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People now spend their lives online; on LinkedIn, on Instagram, everything’s done over email, if someone even rings you now, you think there’s a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it’s the same with fraud and understanding the full effects of it. I don’t think we’re going to get over the “How could they fall for that scam” for a couple of generations because people just think, “Well, I met my partner in person or I still bank in branch,” and it doesn’t work like that. Those days are gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s for the same reason that people don’t like to be called “victims.” In the police, we call them complainants because they are complaining about a crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Words matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 Apparently, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1154660/Fraud_Strategy_2023.pdf">just </a>1% of police resources are dedicated to tackling fraud, despite fraud accounting for 40% of all crime in the UK.&nbsp; Why do you think fraud is such a neglected area? 



<p><a href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk">Action Fraud</a> has had a lot of bad press, and I don’t think people actually understand what they do. Not to diminish their work at all, but Action Fraud is like a call center and data warehouse. People call up and make a complaint; they’re not staffed by experts, or detectives or fraud experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What hinders the effectiveness of Action Fraud is that we don’t tell people what Action Fraud is or manage people’s expectations enough to say that the complaint may not be investigated. So, when they get a letter a few weeks later, saying that the complaint is not being investigated, with no explanation, it’s tough. Whether it’s £50 or £5 million, you deserve a reason why the suspected crime isn’t being investigated, and you would get that if you were assaulted, for example.

 And that understandably has an impact on future reporting habits? 



<p>Of course, people just won’t bother reporting fraud. For years, victim support has been around the physical: assaults, sexual offenses, murders. But what do we do for people suffering financial and emotional loss because of romance fraud? Not enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What most hinders an investigation, however, are the low numbers of staff, and inadequate training. Officers, detectives, and investigators all need to be trained, whether that’s in document fraud, cybercrime, or how to find an IP address from an email. Unfortunately, this is not always the case in the public sector, with local authorities. Although this is being changed with the recent <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/503">Counter Fraud Investigator Apprenticeship</a>.</p>



 I suppose if complainants believe they are unlikely to receive any of the stolen funds back, then this would also have a knock-on effect in reporting rates? 



<p>Yes, you’re right, the ease with which <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/proceeds-of-crime-act-poca/">Proceeds of Crime </a>(stolen funds) can be moved around into multiple bank accounts is scary.&nbsp; A lot of people may think that if it’s only £100, they won’t report it, because they’re not going to get their money back, and it’s more effort than it’s worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once that money is spent, even if the perpetrator is caught, it’s very difficult to get it back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say the perpetrator resides in the UK, and you get them, the likelihood is they’re doing it for a reason: because they have no money or they’re greedy, so they’ll just spend it. It may not bother them if they get convicted, because they’re not going to get a job where they need a DBS check anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of how much money has been lost, that shouldn’t necessarily factor into the decision to a) report it, and b) investigate it. We must look at harm. Unfortunately, currently, Action Fraud just does not do that.</p>



 The fraud strategy has earmarked £100 million for additional police resources. Is that enough? 



<p>No, it’s not; we lose millions of pounds every day to fraud. Again, it’s not the amount, it’s where it’s going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putting maybe one more detective into a fraud squad will take the pressure off, and really help get more positive outcomes, but I think there needs to be real education, and refresher courses on, for example, the blockchain. Can some of the money be used to procure external services, and bring someone in to talk about it? We just don’t know. Can we bring experts in to help the police with investigations, because we don’t know everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there’s a balance to strike, and you don’t want to saturate people with information on fraud and get people scared. Perhaps the best approach would be to properly publicize new fraud initiatives that show how the money is being used. Help teachers get training on fraud prevention, train doctors in how to deal with the mental health ramifications of fraud.</p>



 Education is a recurring theme, as is responsibility. Responsibility of the government to educate people, responsibility of victims to report complaints. What about companies and service providers, where does the responsibility lie there? What role will technology, and in particular KYC and identity verification services, play in the future of fraud prevention? 



<p>They bear a huge responsibility, don’t they? Having recently been onboarded by a company, it’s all completely digital now, isn’t it? One of the cases I dealt with before I left the police was with a new online bank, where a lot of criminals were using their friends’ photographs, passports and licenses to open bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Knowing Your Customer (KYC)</a> is everything really. And, it’s not just knowing your customer, it’s knowing your applicants, and knowing your staff. It’s having all these things in place, especially in recruitment, as document fraud is rampant, so it’s a huge responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll have KYC specialists in banks, but what about the public sector and other private companies? In recruitment, for example, you’re relying on recruitment staff – are they getting the training they need? Are they all aware of the threats of fraud? Do they understand what KYC is?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can only speak from the public sector, but the public sector and local authorities can learn a huge amount from banks and a huge amount from the private sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a fraud investigator’s point of view, I think it’s going to get harder and harder, because long gone are the days where an applicant or consumer must come to a business, and if you’re opening a bank account nowadays, it’ll be online, and you don’t have to see anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t envy KYC staff – let’s put it that way. It’s not a job I’d like to do; there’s a lot of risk on their shoulders to develop, keep themselves regularly updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this technological age, it’s also important to remember that fraud is about people as much as it’s about AI and machine learning. Someone must press that button at the start, and someone must be a victim at the end.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF51 rewards. DF52 runs Aug 24–31,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 51 (DF51) has completed. 150K OCEAN was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Aug 17, 2023 and ended 12:01am Aug 24. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF52 is live today, Aug 24. It concludes on Aug 31. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF52   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF52 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.

<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/">Macmillan Publishers</a> is a global publishing company and one of the “Big Five” English language publishers. If you’re a reader, chances are good you’ve read a book from Macmillan. They published many perennial favorites including Kristin Hannah’s The Nightingale, Bill Martin’s Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see?&nbsp;and some of the more recent bestsellers such as The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides, Identity by Nora Roberts and Razorblade Tears by S. A. Cosby. It’s no wonder then that Macmillan needs sophisticated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> (BI) and data analytics.</p>



 Data analytics in the publishing industry 



<p>With such a widespread global operation, Macmillan Publishers has a long history of investing in technology that can source deep analytical information about sales, inventory and transportation of their titles in the market. For more than 10 years, the publisher has used <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics">IBM Cognos Analytics</a> to wrangle its internal and external operational reporting needs. This encompasses their finance, sales, supply chain, inventory management and production areas. And in the last few years, the team realized there was an opportunity to expand beyond centralized operational reporting to enable further business growth. Users have become increasingly hungry for quicker access to trusted and timely data, and a way to access that data with less reliance on the busy Central Analytics Technology team.</p>



<p>The publishing industry is a heavy user of analytics and a broad use of metrics, from commonly used measures such as shipments, orders, revenue, point-of-sales and costs to more focused metrics such as pricing, inventory status and countless others. This data is leveraged by departments throughout the organization and is essential to their business operations. Such data helps decide how many books to print initially and in which format, how many to print in the future, key pricing decisions and a host of other important business decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As business processes grew more complex, the data transparency and visibility suffered. What’s more, data was not always stored in a way that facilitated the reporting process required to make informed business decisions. This contributed to the need for more analytics by our users. Additionally, the users’ demand for more and more analytics grew organically over time, to the point where it far exceeded our technology team’s bandwidth to support it on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 A new strategy for data analytics and business intelligence 



<p>Factors like this ultimately led the Macmillan team to realize that a new “modernized” approach around data analytics and business intelligence was needed. This approach would center on a “self-service” model, empowering users to source and share key data. Ultimately, the goal was for the users to “fish for themselves.”</p>



<p>Prior to the operating model shift, the Central Analytics team was tasked with creating a report or set of reports when a business user needed information about a title, an operational process, or any general analytics request.&nbsp;These requests result in specific, time-consuming reports, that often drill down on granular data from multiple sources. Ultimately, the demand for more analytics across the company grew beyond the capacity of Macmillan’s data analysts and report developers. At the onset of the transformation, the team decided to implement their plan on a department-by-department basis. Over time, adopters to the new model included Sales, Operations, Production, Inventory Management, Finance, Editorial and HR.</p>



<p>Building on this new strategic direction, the team focused on deploying the greatly enhanced self-service Cognos Analytics capabilities to supplement the current and successful operational reporting platform. This meant gravitating to many of the newer features included in the latest releases of IBM Cognos Analytics. As part of this effort, the team made the strategic decision to migrate all on-premises Cognos Analytics operations to IBM’s hosted and managed SaaS platform. This allowed Macmillan to focus on what was most important — supporting data-related activities — without having to host, pay for and support an on-premises data center for business intelligence.</p>



<p>To further add value, the team brought Cognos Analytics end-user training in-house. The aim was to show and teach users “how to fish for themselves”, speed the time to market for all BI deliverables and make more timely decisions. This training focused on topics such as:</p>



 
 How to easily find relevant data within Cognos Analytics through&nbsp;enhanced searches 



 How to build reports on the fly 



 How to share reports simply and securely 



 How to leverage the newest Cognos Analytics features 
 



 Creating a user-driven data analytics model 



<p>To accomplish many of these tasks, the team also worked with IBM’s technology partner, Sterling Technology Group. Together they assisted in redesigning the platform with the focus on a user-driven model. Sterling remained steadfast and proactive, offering consulting and services to ensure Macmillan completed the migration thoroughly and successfully. This included the migration to the IBM Cognos Analytics SaaS environment and helping the team leverage the latest features within Cognos Analytics that support self-service. The Sterling team ensured the transformation of legacy systems supported the project goals including driving cost savings, reduced administrative maintenance and helping with the transition to a new, more effective operating BI model.</p>



 The key to successful business intelligence projects 



<p>It is important to note that the key to being successful in any BI project is first understanding the data challenges that may exist within an organization, whether its data complexity or the volume of data. The Macmillan team realized the need to grow its data culture alongside its revamped BI strategy. Without a robust data culture, seeing success in a self-service data and analytics initiative is difficult. This is where some of the latest features of Cognos Analytics played an integral part in the transition.</p>



<p>For example, Cognos Analytics Data Modules allow users to connect to multiple data sources, handle quick modeling, apply business rules, and imbed calculations and custom groups. All of this is done seamlessly and simultaneously via an easy-to-use drag and drop interface. One deployment now allows users to generate customizable reports to track orders, view the health of any published title, see shipping history and see how a title is performing in-market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From an end-user support perspective, the Macmillan team also realized the need for internal “report champions” who can support individual lines of business. Champions were provided additional training to perform many of the legacy functions IT once supported. These power-users now answer questions for their teams and offload work that would otherwise become too time-consuming for IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the team has seen a 50% reduction in administrative costs and a 100% reduction in hardware costs. They realized a 40% reduction in overall administrative maintenance tasks and efforts. But most importantly, the team has seen the holistic value that a well-designed analytics platform can bring, enabling more timely and accurate decision-making at all levels of the organization.</p>



 Macmillan’s future with Cognos Analytics 



<p>Currently, around one thousand Macmillan employees across Macmillan’s business units consume data from Cognos Analytics. The Macmillan analytics team wants as many users as possible to provide feedback — positive and negative — on how the system is meeting their needs. More end-user input will lead to better success as they move forward and refine their model. The Macmillan analytics team has already seen a 20% growth in the number of users authoring their own reports. In another next step, the team is looking to roll out Dashboarding on a broader scale and expect it to add great value. Dashboarding was limited initially because they have been waiting on more progress with our complimentary initiative of migrating the underlying data warehouse to Snowflake. Along with Dashboarding, they are looking to add value with AI-based Cognos Analytics features to various user groups, including subscriptions, AI-based explorations, and the use of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) features within the platform.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about switching to the cloud or trying many of these new AI-based Cognos Analytics features, Richard Babicz, Business Intelligence Senior Manager &amp; Architect at Macmillan, recommends starting small to identify the key issues and pain-points. Build a prototype in an on-premises sandbox environment and evaluate with production in-house application data.&nbsp;Invoke key BI supporters and sponsors within the organization to work together with your team to set up project goals and overall plan of action.&nbsp;This collaborative approach will lead to new ideas and a true understanding of what your business community needs to be successful.</p>

<p>It looks like an easy day for James, an IT Administrator. It is vacation time and most of his end users are out of the office, so he thinks it is time to have a look at some of the backlog tasks—maybe even procrastinate a bit. But then, the phone rings.</p>



<p>It’s Robert, one of the end users in his company. Robert is very nervous—he’s calling from the hotel because he has lost his iOS smartphone on the beach. Their company has both corporate devices and a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maas360/byod">BYOD</a> (bring your own device) policy. Robert is enrolled in the BYOD program, so it was his personal device but with corporate data stored, including the latest financial projections he has shared with his team for a presentation.</p>



<p>James opens the mobile device management software that his company is using, immediately finds Robert’s iOS smartphone in the tool, and does a remote wipe. He wants to get back to the backlog tasks.</p>



<p>But, it’s not over. He sees a real-time notification that a user has tried to download a gaming app on the corporate device, which is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mobile-security">not in policy.</a> An automatic notification to the end user was left. It is his friend, Mary; Mary’s flight was delayed and her kid was bored and asked for her Android smartphone to watch YouTube. He clicked on an ad promoting a gaming app and tried to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mobile-security">download it</a>.</p>



<p>What James has done with Robert’s lost iOS smartphone is part of mobile device management (MDM). In Mary’s case, the access settings for apps that are not in policyare part of mobile application management (MAM). Both MDM and MAM are part of unified endpoint management solutions. Whether a company has BYOD policies, uses only corporate-owned devices or both, and whether the users have iOS smartphones, Android smartphones or tablets, all devices and apps need to be managed and protected. Mobile security strategies need to be put into place, otherwise one can lose corporate data, personal data and sensitive data.</p>



 What is mobile device management (MDM)? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mobile-device-management">Mobile device management (MDM)</a> is a solution that manages smartphones and tablets—no matter the operating system—and protects them against cyber threats and data loss. MDM has become a very popular technology after Apple launched the first iPhone. As the technology has evolved, MDM has transformed into enterprise mobility management (EMM) and is now part of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/uem">unified endpoint management (UEM)</a>.</p>



<p>MDM software is used to manage both BYOD devices and corporate-owned devices that run on any mobile operating system (iOS, Android, iPadOS, Windows or purpose-built devices). MDM solutions use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization">containerization</a>—which separates the corporate apps and data from the personal ones—to maintain device security and the security of mobile apps.</p>



 What is mobile application management (MAM)? 



<p>Mobile application management (MAM) has emerged with the rise of mobile app usage. It is software used to manage and protect the mobile apps available on users’ devices. It is usually part of MDM software and UEM (unified endpoint management) solutions.</p>



<p>When using MAM software to protect company data either on BYOD policies or company-owned devices, James and other IT admins use the containerization features and security policies to make sure that the right users have the right access to the right enterprise apps—usually part of an app store available in the MAM solutions. This comes with features like access management, multi-factor authentication, granular permissions and control to protect users and ensure data security and control.</p>



<p>James has MDM and MAM software available at hand, which made sure that the data available on Robert’s and Mary’s smartphones are safe. When thinking about MDM vs. MAM, IT admins would need to think about their objectives. They both offer granular control, both have containerization and both use access management and identity management technologies.</p>



<p>So what sets them apart?</p>



 Top 5 differences between mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) 



<p>1. What they manage:</p>



 
 MDM is performed at the device level for enrolled devices and users, including device settings, security policies and apps. 



 MAM focuses on managing and protecting mobile enterprise applications and the business data available to them. 
 



<p>2. What they control:</p>



 
 MDM controls the entire device, allowing actions like wipe, selective wipe, lock, locate, enforce passwords and more. 



 MAM has control over the apps themselves. While it also enforces security policies, it does so at the application level. 
 



<p>3. What they secure:</p>



 
 MDM focused on device security, user security, encryption, VPN and app security. MDM solutions use functions like wipe, remote wipe and geo-location, and may have threat management features against <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing">SMS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/phishing">email phishing</a>, jailbroken and rooted devices, and many more. 



 MAM focuses on app security, including functions like setting up automatic app removal conditions to prevent unauthorized access. Some MAM software has app wrappers or software development kits (SDK) as security add-ons. 
 



<p>4. How they handle app deployment:</p>



 
 MDM technologies usually allow IT teams to push and install apps. 



 MAM technologies allow IT teams push and install apps from an app catalog, but also allow end users to install the approved enterprise apps. 
 



<p>5. How they manage:</p>



 
 MDM has standard app management capabilities related to installation and updates. There are also UEM solutions that have MDM and mobile application management capabilities included. 



 MAM offers granular and advanced app management spanning across all the application lifecycles. For example, it enables actions like installation, deployment, patching, integration with public app stores (like the iOS App Store and Google Play Store). IT Admins can also distribute apps and track the installation of apps remotely, over-the-air (OTA), to all users, groups of users or personal devices. 
 



 Get started 



<p>Mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM)are both used in mobile management but for different purposes. They are both very useful for IT administrators to make sure that the mobile devices, users and data remain protected.</p>



<p>IBM Security MaaS360 is a modern, advanced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maas360/unified-endpoint-management">unified endpoint management</a> platform that merges MDM with MAM, helping IT teams be both efficient and effective and keeping the total cost of ownership under control.</p>

  <p>Divestitures, dissolution of partnerships, and other business <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-up.asp">split-ups</a> are rarely fun, but they do happen and can have significant implications for your digital assets. Whatever the reason for a business split-up, it's important to prioritize digital security.</p>

<p>The average <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">data breach in the U.S.</a> costs a company $9.4 million. Your digital assets need to be protected before, during, and after the split.</p>
	
 What are digital assets and why are they vulnerable to cyberattacks? 
	
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-asset-framework.asp">Digital assets</a> are any virtual item created and maintained/stored online. They're identifiable to your particular company or someone within your company, and they're of a certain value. Digital assets also must be searchable and discoverable, typically through metadata.</p>

<p>During business split-ups, you have to take inventory of all of your digital assets and who may have access to them. You also have to preemptively determine how hackers could exploit vulnerabilities to find and exfiltrate data and assets that could be of value to bad actors — or damaging to your company. You never want to think your former business partner would use sensitive information against your company, but it happens, often accidentally.</p>
 Best practices for protecting your digital assets 

<p>When separating your business, it's wise to implement <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-and-access-management">identity and access management</a> (IAM) best practices. Some of these include:</p>

  Requiring <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) 
   Implementing single sign-on (SSO) 
   Managing authorization 
   Ensuring the right identities have access only to the appropriate resources, and nothing more, through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> 
  Strategies for enhancing your security posture 
	
<p>You may already have a strong foundation of IAM best practices in place. Even so, there are tools that help you keep your accounts secure, particularly in the instance of a business split-up.</p>
	
 Institute a cybersecurity policy 
	
<p>A shareable, company-wide cybersecurity policy should be available in times of dissolution. Set it up as soon as possible, even if there's no business split-up planned for the foreseeable future. In the event that one does happen, you'll then have something to refer to and mark off as a sort of checklist to ensure all your cybersecurity bases are covered.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity policy for digital assets during business split-ups should include some of the following:</p>

  A list of all accounts managed by your organization 
   A list of all third parties with and their access privileges 
   A guide for managing account access 
   When to revoke account access upon dissolution 
   Risk assessment instructions 
   An acceptable use policy (AUP) that parties have to sign 
   A response plan in the event of a data breach 
 <p>You can find variations of these types of policies online, but tailor them to your specific situation. Have an overall cybersecurity policy and include a section on business divestiture or dissolution, or make a separate document for this entirely. The important thing is that the right people in the organization have access to this policy to refer to as needed.</p>
	
 Implement strong authentication 
	
<p>Strong authentication practices are a hallmark of cybersecurity. While many organizations continue to rely on username and password combinations for authentication, this practice is known to be risky. For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been unauthorized access, which is another way of saying the use of stolen credentials.</p>

<p>For environments where passwords remain in use, the first line of defense is to require strong and unique passwords for every account, and changing them regularly (and immediately in the event of a business split).</p>

<p>Attackers often use "brute-force" techniques to guess weak passwords, including using random password generators to guess passwords rapidly, or by simply guessing the password due to its weak nature — for example, if the password is "password1234" or "Qwerty!" Despite stronger enterprise policies, employees commonly use such weak, guessable passwords, and use them for multiple accounts. These practices expose your organization to risk, as hackers also frequently turn to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/glossary-page#Credential-Stuffing">credential stuffing</a>, which is the practice of using credentials for one account to gain access to other accounts.</p>

<p>A better approach to strong authentication is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, which can reduce the risk of a data breach following a business dissolution. By eliminating passwords and replacing their use with biometrics, like fingerprints or facial scanning, passwordless offers are far more secure way to ensure that only the right account holders can access your digital assets.</p>

<p>Another way to strengthen security is through risk-based authentication, which uses AI to detect unusual behavior. For example, a legitimate employee may sign in to an account using the correct credentials and a trusted device, but the location is unusual. An <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven tool</a> would automatically flag such a request and require additional authentication steps during that first attempt. If the login attempt is deemed a high risk, it is automatically blocked or redirected for analysis.</p>

 Eliminate identity silos 
	
<p>Identity silos occur when different systems, applications, or business units have disparate identity systems that don't talk to each other. What you need is an enterprise-wide view of all your identities and their access permissions, no matter where they are connecting or where the assets they seek are hosted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">Hybrid IAM</a> is the way to unify and secure all your digital identities and access requests whether your data and resources are running on-premises, in public and private clouds, or all of the above.</p>
	
<p>By implementing a modern <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">identity platform</a>, you can manage and protect digital assets, even if you have a hybrid work model or are moving to a different business workflow process along with the divestiture.</p>

<p>Blog post by Apillon&nbsp;below</p> The joint initiative by Apillon, KILT Protocol, and Nova Wallet marks another step towards simplification of Web3&nbsp;UX.   What is&nbsp;w3ndi?  How does w3ndi&nbsp;work?  Apillon, KILT Protocol, and Nova Wallet joining&nbsp;forces   What is&nbsp;w3ndi? <p>w3ndi (you can call it Wendi, too) is an Apillon-built decentralized index of digital accounts that links your web3name (w3n) by KILT Protocol with your digital addresses. It currently supports Polkadot (including KILT and other parachain address types) and other popular chains, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>With w3ndi, you can browse digital wallet accounts tied to your web3name, KILT’s human-readable format for DIDs (decentralized identifiers). The addresses can be differentiated by chains and tags, and thanks to easy browsing via w3n, replace copy-pasting of lengthy, meaningless strings of alphanumeric characters and simplify crypto transfers.</p><p>The first app to integrate w3ndi is Nova&nbsp;Wallet.</p> Why w3ndi and how does it&nbsp;work? <p><a href="https://blog.apillon.io/why-web3-needs-a-ux-framework-e0db6806a579">UX is a huge friction point of Web3</a>. Everyone is familiar with using lengthy strings of characters and numbers, double-checking just the first and the last few ones, if at all. Too often, users neglect their responsibility to verify addresses, which could even lead to <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1686764372616515585">funds drain</a>. Or, they verify a recipient’s address by first transferring a small test amount before moving larger crypto numbers. But users are hardly to blame. Clumsy UX&nbsp;is.</p><p>The user interface of dapps has come a long way since the early days of Web3, with new solutions that stay true to the principles of decentralization while going easy on end users. KILT has redefined how we think of decentralized digital identity by introducing W3C-compliant DIDs, how we attach and attest its components (digital addresses included), and how we represent DIDs in a human-readable, memorable form with <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/web3names/">web3name</a>(w3n).</p><p>A few months ago, KILT <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/send-funds-to-a-web3name-via-nova-wallet-b3182457c90b">partnered with Nova Wallet</a> to allow for easy user and digital address search. However, <a href="https://docs.novawallet.io/nova-wallet-wiki/help-and-support/associate-address-with-web3name">the initial process of associating addresses with web3name</a> required users to master certain technical skills.</p><p>Now, a more user-friendly w3n-address linking method has come to life with&nbsp;w3ndi.</p><p>Link addresses once, and use them as you go with just a few&nbsp;clicks.</p> w3ndi app by&nbsp;Apillon <p>w3ndi simplifies the process of attaching digital wallet addresses to your DID and w3n by KILT, ultimately, your digital identity.</p><p>The first integration of the w3ndi app by Apillon is live on <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova Wallet</a>, a leading crypto wallet in the Polkadot ecosystem. With w3ndi enhancing the Nova UX, you can easily find peers in the Web3 community by their web3name, and initiate transactions without having to know or double-check the exact and complete alphanumeric strings of their addresses.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>The free-to-use w3ndi app is accessible at <a href="https://w3ndi.apillon.io/">w3ndi.apillon.io</a>.</p><p>Once you connect with your Sporran wallet from KILT and select the digital identity represented by your DID or w3n by KILT, you can start attaching your digital wallet addresses from multiple networks and create a self-sovereign wallet registry under a single&nbsp;name.</p><p>Using tags, you can differentiate between various-purpose addresses, e.g. Friends and family, Business, Charity, etc. You can also choose to make an address work on multiple&nbsp;chains.</p><p>In the process of linking w3n with digital addresses, w3ndi generates a JSON file containing identifiers for different wallet addresses that you attached to your web3name on the KILT parachain. To ensure unstoppable access, the file is stored on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> and pinned via <a href="https://crust.network/">Crust Network</a>. Find w3ndi on GitHub&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Apillon-web3/w3ndi-app">here</a>.</p><p>With w3ndi on Nova Wallet, your human-readable w3n nickname opens up an index of all your linked digital addresses. Thanks to added tags, you can easily differentiate accounts and mitigate the risk of interacting with the wrong&nbsp;one.</p><p>To send funds, simply type in the recipient’s w3n using “w3n:[name]” and select an account based on its tag. Or, to receive a deposit, let the sender know your w3n and the tag that defines the correct address. All in just a few&nbsp;clicks.</p><p>In Nova Wallet, w3ndi makes digital asset exchange seamless and user-friendly. When integrated into other apps, w3ndi could expand its usability of linking human-readable w3n with digital addresses.</p><p>Learn step-by-step how to use w3ndi&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.apillon.io/guide-use-w3ndi-to-connect-your-digital-addresses-to-w3n-by-kilt-and-use-it-in-nova-wallet-de98a1289aae">here</a>.</p> Fully decentralized <p>As you save and deploy an address in w3ndi, the address index file is pinned to IPFS via Crust with a unique CID, enabling the w3n name resolution service and keeping it fully decentralized.</p><p>Each time you change or add a new address, the address pointers change, too, and a new unique CID is generated.</p><p>If you decide to delete all addresses, you must deploy changes, resulting in an empty w3n name resolution. Keep in mind that the minimal period of file pinning is six months, so files are deleted only after that period has&nbsp;passed.</p> Apillon, KILT, and Nova Wallet joining&nbsp;forces <p>w3ndi is a result of collaboration among three Polkadot projects, each contributing its distinct qualities:</p>  <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> powers decentralized digital identities via DIDs and web3names (w3n)  <a href="http://w3ndi.apillon.io/">w3ndi by Apillon</a> builds up registries of digital addresses linked to a user’s w3n by&nbsp;KILT  <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova Wallet</a> integrates w3ndi’s w3n registries as an enhanced UX functionality  <p>In addition, Crust Network supplies <a href="https://wiki.apillon.io/build/2-web3-services.html#web3-storage">decentralized storage</a> and pins w3ndi’s index JSON file on IPFS, ensuring permanent access to the owner of the file’s&nbsp;link.</p><p>Try w3ndi on Nova Wallet today, and use your w3n by KILT for seamless crypto transfers.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise, government and consumers.

 Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) — Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication  Written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer of the Verus Protocol.  How it&nbsp;started <p>Bitcoin proved that decentralized, secure, permissionless and provable agreement on a worldwide blockchain network of participants is possible.</p> How it’s&nbsp;going <p>Beyond Bitcoin, most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol. In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Instead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared “computer” or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else’s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of “dApps”, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.</p><p>As a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don’t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain “bridge” design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.</p><p>The lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile&nbsp;up.</p> The solution <p>Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>It has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.</p><p>To ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.</p><p>By grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.</p> A cross-chain protocol with same chain properties <p>VIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:</p>  Transactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.  VIP supports direct or indirect system&lt;-&gt;system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC&nbsp;calls.  Transactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today’s single currency blockchain networks.  Cross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle-&gt;export-&gt;import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.  In PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for&nbsp;all.  All cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:    Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)  Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)  Semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway&nbsp;proofs  <p>Full auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We’ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:</p>  “Earned” and “Accepted” notarizations — VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.    Generally, one side of a connection will create “earned” notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further “confirmation” rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are “auto”, centralized, or “notary confirm”.  Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the “notary” system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an “accepted” notarization, and is entered as “agreeing” with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.  <p>2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.</p><p>3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point&nbsp;behind.</p><p>The primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, “notary confirm” always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof&nbsp;root.</p><p>Once a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">PATRICIA Trie</a> proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)</a> method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>Transactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level&nbsp;bundles.</p> What witness / notaries do NOT&nbsp;do <p>Witnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.</p><p>Witness notaries’ primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators’ earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof&nbsp;root.</p> Do auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations? <p>Yes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a&nbsp;quorum.</p><p>Determining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Currently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.</p><p>Since Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat&nbsp;models.</p><p>As new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.</p><p>Auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.</p> Improvement over common cross-chain protocols <p>Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.</p><p>Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private&nbsp;keys?</p><p>If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:</p>  Colluding, malicious notaries  Fake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain  <p>While you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.</p><p>To enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.</p><p>Meanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p> Try the Verus Protocol Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Arthur C. Clarke, the famous English science fiction writer, had once noted that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Back in the 1960s, he was probably thinking about space exploration, which was the hottest and most impressive topic of that decade. Since then, however, spacecraft have unfortunately lost a large portion of their glamour, becoming instead reliable workhorses for the industry. A few other revolutionary technologies have met the same fate during the later decades as well – the Internet, mobile communications, electric vehicles, etc. The buzzword du jour, Artificial Intelligence, will become another part of our daily routines pretty soon as well.</p>
<p>Quantum computing, however, is still viewed by the public as something truly magical and simultaneously completely unrealistic. Perhaps, this can be explained by the lack of a “killer app” that would demonstrate immediate usefulness of the technology to average people, like ChatGPT did for generative AI. Or simply because quantum mechanics is something that requires substantial effort to wrap your head around. Sure, most of us still vaguely remember from school that subatomic particles can exhibit properties of both particles and waves, and some might even have heard about quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a>, but how exactly does it make extremely fast computing possible?</p>
<p>Well, it does not. Quantum computers are not supposed to replace classical ones, which are based on binary logic implemented with semiconductor-based logical gates. They won’t make existing algorithms any faster. They do, however, allow us to design entirely new algorithms that can solve mathematical problems that were previously impossible. Such developments started to emerge back in the 1980s, but remained largely an academic exercise until Peter Shor devised a quantum algorithm for breaking popular encryption methods. Finally, quantum computing caught the interest of businesses. And intelligence agencies, of course.</p>
<p>Sure, there are many other potential applications for this technology – modeling natural processes in physics and chemistry, creating new fuels and batteries, designing more efficient drugs, and so on. Quantum computers are also great for modeling quantum processes, helping us understand the origins of the universe. Businesses are ready to invest, and vendors are busy developing hardware to run all those workloads.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even a single quantum bit (qubit) – a basic element of a quantum computer – is an extremely sophisticated and fragile device that depends on things like liquid helium to operate. The largest currently existing prototypes contain up to 1000 of such elements, and yet, it is projected that future “proper” quantum computers might need millions of them. Quantum computers are also prone to noise caused by insufficient isolation from the environment – noise that reduces the reliability of hardware and introduces errors into calculations. To put it simply, quantum computing nowadays can be compared to the early days of aviation – experts just cannot agree how many more years it will take until we see practical, working, error-proof computers. But it definitely won’t happen tomorrow. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/error-correction-codes">Or will it</a>?</p>
<p>A more interesting question, however, is how all this is related to cybersecurity. We already know that quantum computing can potentially make existing cryptography obsolete overnight. This would have massive implications on the entire digital economy of the world – everything from secure network connections to public cloud services to distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies depends on the inability of a malicious actor to break this encryption. Modern cryptography relies to a large degree on the fact that classic computers cannot solve the underlying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">mathematical challenges</a>. Yet, it has been established that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer can do it easily using Shor’s algorithm. The only open question is when such a computer will become available to malicious actors.</p>
<p>Even though many experts are still quite skeptical about the probability of this happening anytime soon, it is worth noting that the “better safe than sorry” camp is also quite substantial. The entire field of post-quantum cryptography emerged years ago to develop new encryption methods that are resistant against quantum attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is leading a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">standardization program</a> for quantum-resistant encryption methods since 2016 and the publication of new standards is planned for 2024.</p>
<p>However, you don’t have to wait until working quantum computers emerge to start implementing the new standards. In fact, by that time it will definitely be too late. For any business that relies on encryption to safeguard its processes and products (and nowadays, it’s basically any organization, regardless of its size or industry), the notion of cryptographic agility has become a critical part of business continuity.</p>
<p>Cryptographic algorithms become outdated all the time. DES, MD5, SHA1 – they are no longer considered strong enough even against classical brute force attacks and should be replaced everywhere. Sometimes, weaknesses are discovered in specific implementations – remember the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident">Heartbleed incident</a>? Being able to respond to these challenges quickly and to replace cryptographic primitives across your entire organization without massive impact to your business – that’s what crypto-agility is about. Quantum resistance is just another good argument for selling this idea to the board.</p>
<p>One should also not forget about other applications of quantum mechanics to cybersecurity as well. After all, the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography">quantum cryptography</a> proper is also quite fascinating. One particular technology relies on the properties of quantum entanglement to implement secure communications between parties that are impossible to eavesdrop on. This can be used to produce a shared secret key that is resistant against any man-in-the-middle attack. Surprisingly, practical implementations of this technology are already available, with record-breaking speeds and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230615710544/en/Terra-Quantum-Breaks-Records-in-Quantum-Key-Distribution-Paving-Way-to-Offering-Unprecedented-Security-Over-Existing-Fiber-optic-Networks-Globally">distances over 1000 km</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, quantum technologies will be a part of the agenda at our upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference that will take place this November in Frankfurt, Germany. If you are interested in expanding your quantum computing horizons, come and meet the experts there!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to establish a central database, or “single source of truth,” where all customer data is managed and stored. This source of truth is known as “a single view of the customer,” and it’s like having an all-access pass to a customer's inner world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Think of it like this: Each customer data point is like a puzzle piece, and the central database is the box where all of the pieces are kept. However, instead of loose puzzle pieces tossed in a box with no sense of organization, a database categorizes and organizes pieces of customer data into searchable categories and subcategories for precise retrieval and exploration. </p>

<p>When it comes to hosting applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the most important decisions you will need to make is which Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance type to choose. EC2 instances are virtual machines that allow you to run your applications on AWS. They come in various sizes and configurations—known as instance families—each designed for a specific purpose. Choosing the right instance offering and instance size for your application is critical for optimizing performance and reducing costs. However, as the demand profile of every application is unique—and can change over time—this task is much easier stated than solved. The 2xlarge instance of a given family may not be necessary, but when application teams task cloud operations with maintaining uptime, the larger, costlier instance size becomes attractive—that is, until cloud bills balloon.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we will explore the challenges of selecting the best Amazon EC2 instance type for your application and provide you with some best practices for how to make the right decision. Additionally, we’ll explain how a solution like IBM Turbonomic can help rightsize your aws cloud apps using machine learning, auto-scaling, and automation.

 Understanding Amazon EC2 Instance Types 



<p>EC2 instances are classified based on their characteristics such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. Each instance type is designed to optimize for specific workloads such as general-purpose computing, memory-intensive applications, or compute-intensive tasks. Here are some examples of EC2 instance types and their primary use cases:</p>



 
 General Purpose Instances (A, T, M, and C series): General-purpose instance types are designed for a variety of workloads, including web servers, small databases, and development and testing environments. This group includes the m5 instance, the latest generation of General Purpose Instances powered by Intel Xeon® Platinum 8175M or 8259CL processors. These instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and network resources, and is a good choice for many applications. 



 Compute Optimized Instances (C and R series): These instances are optimized for compute-intensive workloads such as high-performance computing, batch processing, and scientific modeling. These instances maximize compute power using GPU and high core count CPU. 



 Memory Optimized Instances (X, Z, and R series): These high memory instances are optimized for memory-intensive workloads such as high-performance databases, distributed in-memory caches, and real-time data processing/big data analytics. 



 Storage Optimized Instances (I, D, and H series): These instances are optimized for storage-intensive workloads such as big data, data warehousing, and log processing. They leverage high capacity caching and solid state drives (SSD) to support the intense read and write activities of the workloads. 
 



 Challenges in Choosing the Right EC2 Instance Type 



<p>Choosing the right EC2 instance type for your application can be a daunting task. Here are some of the challenges you may face:</p>



 
 Complexity: With so many instance offerings to choose from, it can be challenging to determine which one is the best fit for your application. Additionally, Amazon consistently introduces new instance types to its service catalogue, implying that the best fit for your application today may not necessarily be the best fit for your application several months from now.
 
 How Turbonomic helps: Turbonomic continuously ingests the specifications of the entire AWS service catalogue and maps the resource consumption profile of your workloads—both their baseline and percentiles-based peaks—to the best fit instance type. 
 
 



 Workload Type: What type of workload will your application be running? Is it a compute-intensive workload, or does it require a lot of memory or storage capacity? Once you have a clear understanding of your workload, you can narrow down your options to instance types that are optimized for your workload. 



 Performance Requirements: Do you need a high-performance instance type to handle large workloads or a smaller instance type to handle light workloads? Does the workload support a customer-facing, low-latency application, or an internal administrative application? What data locality requirements will you need to abide? Keep in mind that the performance of an instance type can vary depending on the region and the usage pattern of your application.
 
 How Turbonomic helps: Determining workload type across an entire hosting environment is a significant task, but made easy with the help of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic/cloud-optimization">cloud cost optimization software</a>. Turbonomic automatically detects the current and historical utilization of your workloads’ vCPU, memory, storage access (IOPS), net throughput, I/O throughput, storage amount, reserved instance coverage, database vMemory, database vCPU, database storage amount, database I/O throughput, RI inventory, and RI coverage—and determines the best instance family and instance type to support the workload. 
 
 



 Scalability: You need to ensure that the instance type you choose can scale up or down as needed to handle changes in traffic and workload. Furthermore, you need to know how the applications each EC2 instance will host are designed to scale. If the application is composed of microservices, scalability and performance requirements must be considered together.
 
 How Turbonomic helps: Depending on how each application is designed to scale, Turbonomic can drive the most economic scale up / scale down actions available, as well as ensure scale out / scale in actions are conducted in the most cost-effective manner possible. 
 
 



 Cost: Cost is among the most important considerations and challenges when choosing an EC2 instance type. You need to consider the hourly cost of the instance type, as well as any additional charges for data transfer, storage, and other AWS services. Additionally, the various pricing models including reserved instances and savings plans (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/managing-aws-ec2-pricing-and-usage-with-ibm-turbonomic?utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=TURWW&amp;utm_term=%2030AY5&amp;utm_id=ec2instancetypes">explained in this blog post</a>) add to the complexity of the cost calculation.

 Best Practices for Choosing the Best EC2 Instance Type 



<p>Now that you understand the most common challenges of choosing the best EC2 instance, here are some of the best practices we encourage our clients and partners to follow.</p>



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understand Your Workload 



<p>The first and most important step in selecting the right EC2 instance type is to understand your workload. Every application has different requirements in terms of CPU, memory, network, and storage, and it is essential to know what your application needs to run smoothly.</p>



<p>For example, if you are running a database application, you may need a large amount of RAM to handle queries efficiently. On the other hand, if you are running a compute-intensive application, you may need a high-performance CPU.</p>



<p>To get a better understanding of your workload, you can use tools like AWS CloudWatch or third-party monitoring solutions to gather data on resource utilization. This data can then be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic/cloud-optimization?utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=TURWW&amp;utm_term=%2030AY5&amp;utm_id=ec2instancetypes">used to determine the optimal instance type</a> for your application.</p>



 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the CPU 



<p>The CPU is one of the most critical components of an EC2 instance, as it determines the instance’s processing power. If your application requires high CPU performance, you should look for an instance type that has a higher CPU count and clock speed.</p>



<p>AWS offers a variety of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized">CPU-optimized instance types</a>, such as the C5, M5, and R5 families, that are designed for high-performance computing workloads. These instances feature the latest generation custom-built <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/">AWS Graviton3&nbsp;</a>processors (significant upgrades to the Graviton2) and are optimized for applications that require high CPU utilization. However, if your application does not require high CPU performance, you can opt for a cheaper instance type with no GPU and a lower CPU count, such as the T3 family.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the Memory 



<p>Memory is another critical component of an EC2 instance, as it determines how much data the instance can process at a time. If your application requires a lot of memory, you should look for an instance type that has a larger memory capacity.</p>



<p>However, if your application does not require a lot of memory, you can opt for a cheaper instance type that has a smaller memory capacity, such as the T3 family.</p>



<p>AWS offers a variety of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Memory_Optimized">memory-optimized instance types</a>, such as the X1, R4, and z1d families, that are designed for memory-intensive workloads. These instances feature large amounts of memory and are optimized for applications that require high memory utilization, such as in-memory databases.</p>



<p>However, if your application does not require a lot of memory, you can opt for a cheaper instance type that has a smaller memory capacity, such as the T3 family.</p>



 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the Network 



<p>The network is another critical component of an EC2 instance, as it determines how fast data can be transferred to and from the instance. If your application requires high network performance, you should look for an instance type that has a higher network bandwidth.</p>



<p>AWS offers a variety of network-optimized instance types, such as the C5n and the high-performance compute HPC families, that are designed for network-intensive workloads. These instances feature high-speed network interfaces and are optimized for applications that require high network utilization.</p>



<p>However, if your application does not require high network performance, you can opt for a cheaper instance type that has a lower network bandwidth, such as the T3 family.</p>



 5. Consider the Storage 



<p>Storage is the final critical component of an EC2 instance, as it determines how much data can be stored on the instance. If your application requires a lot of storage, you should look for an instance type that has a larger storage capacity (Elastic Block Store, or EBS). However, proceed with caution—storage is also among the most costly cloud resources and can easily generate unnecessary spend through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic/cloud-optimization?utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=TURWW&amp;utm_term=%2030AY5&amp;utm_id=ec2instancetypes">idle and unattached EBS volumes</a>.</p>



<p>AWS offers a variety of storage-optimized instance types, such as the I3 and D2 families, that are designed for storage-intensive workloads. These instances feature large amounts of SSD storage and local storage and are optimized for applications that require high IOPS throughput.</p>



<p>However, if your application does not require a lot of storage, you can opt for a cheaper instance type that has a smaller HDD-based storage capacity, such as the T3 family.</p>



 6. Consider the Pricing Model 



<p>AWS offers several pricing models for EC2 instances, including On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it is essential to choose the one that best fits your workload and budget.</p>



<p>On-Demand instances are priced by the hour and do not require any upfront commitment. They are best suited for workloads that have variable demand or short-term projects.</p>



<p>Reserved Instances provide a significant discount on the hourly rate in exchange for a one-time upfront payment. They are best suited for workloads that have predictable usage and require long-term commitment.</p>



<p>Spot Instances allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity and can provide significant cost savings. However, they are best suited for workloads that can handle interruptions and have flexible start and end times.</p>

 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test and Optimize 



<p>Once you have selected an EC2 instance type, it is essential to test and optimize your application to ensure that it is running efficiently. You can use tools like AWS CloudWatch or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana?utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=TURWW&amp;utm_term=%2030AY5&amp;utm_id=ec2instancetypes">IBM Instana</a> to monitor your application’s performance and identify any bottlenecks or areas for improvement.</p>



 Conclusion  



<p>Selecting the right EC2 instance type is crucial for the performance and cost-effectiveness of your AWS infrastructure. By understanding your workload, considering the CPU, memory, network, and storage requirements, choosing the right pricing model, and testing and optimizing your application, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your EC2 instances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember that selecting the best instance type is not a one-time decision, as your workload and infrastructure needs can change over time. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic/cloud-optimization?utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=TURWW&amp;utm_term=%2030AY5&amp;utm_id=ec2instancetypes">Continuously evaluating and optimizing</a> your EC2 instance types can help you achieve optimal performance and cost-effectiveness for your AWS infrastructure.</p>

<p>The United States faces numerous challenges when it comes to balancing supply v demand in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The intricate nature of the pharmaceutical industry, coupled with the country’s diverse healthcare system, regulatory framework, and evolving market dynamics, contribute to a complex landscape that presents both opportunities and limitations. Here, we will explore some of the key challenges that the US encounters in managing pharmaceutical supply and demand.</p>
<p>One of the primary challenges is ensuring a steady and adequate supply of pharmaceutical products. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Pharmaceuticals/U.S.-dependence-on-China-for-lifesaving-drugs-grows#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20imported%20%246.95%20billion,the%20annual%20tally%20from%202021">The US relies heavily on imports</a>, with many active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drugs being manufactured overseas, particularly in countries like China and India. This dependence on foreign sources can make <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/08/the-u-s-needs-to-reimagine-its-pharma-supply-chain">the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions</a>, such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or regulatory issues. A single interruption in the supply chain can lead to shortages of essential medications, potentially compromising patient care and public health.</p>
 Challenges posed to pharmaceutical demand by the US healthcare system 
<p>The complex and fragmented nature of the US healthcare system presents challenges in predicting and meeting pharmaceutical demand. Unlike many other countries with centralized healthcare systems, the US has a diverse array of payers, including private insurance companies, government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and self-pay patients. Each payer operates differently, with varying formularies, coverage criteria, and reimbursement rates. This diversity makes it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to accurately forecast demand and allocate resources efficiently.</p>
<p>Moreover, the high cost of pharmaceuticals in the US poses a challenge in meeting demand. Prescription drug prices in the US are significantly higher compared to other countries, partly due to the number of intermediaries involved in the supply chain, the absence of government price controls and negotiation mechanisms. The high prices can create barriers to access for patients, particularly those without adequate insurance coverage or with high out-of-pocket costs. This can lead to underutilization of medications, compromising patient outcomes and exacerbating health disparities.</p>
 Falsified and substandard drugs in the US market 
<p>The issue of substandard and falsified drugs also affects the pharmaceutical supply chain in the US. Counterfeit drugs, which can be ineffective or even harmful, pose a serious risk to patient safety. While the US has robust regulatory mechanisms in place, including those managed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), illicit online pharmacies and other illegal channels continue to thrive, making it challenging to ensure a safe and secure supply of medications.</p>
 How technology is reshaping the pharma landscape 
<p>Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancements in pharmaceutical research and development introduces challenges in matching supply with evolving demand. The emergence of innovative therapies, such as gene therapies and personalized medicines, necessitates agile and adaptable manufacturing processes. Ensuring that the supply chain can accommodate these novel therapies, including scaling up production and maintaining quality control, is a complex task.</p>
 ARTiFACTS Verify’s role in ensuring the integrity of the US pharmaceutical supply chain 
<p>To address these challenges, various stakeholders in the US healthcare system are taking steps to enhance pharmaceutical supply and meet growing demand. Efforts include diversifying sources of drug manufacturing, encouraging domestic production, strengthening regulatory oversight, promoting price transparency, and fostering collaboration among manufacturers, payers, healthcare providers, and policymakers. In 2013, the US government implemented the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-supply-chain-integrity/drug-supply-chain-security-act-dscsa">Drug Supply Chain Security Act</a> (DSCSA) with the aim of achieving interoperable, electronic tracing of products at the package level to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. Manufacturers were given 10 years to adapt their processes, ample time to meet evolving requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, advancements in digital health technologies and data analytics are being leveraged to optimize supply chain management and improve forecasting accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">ARTiFACTS Verify</a> supports these latter efforts through our cloud-based platform for monitoring drug quality across the pharmaceutical supply chain. Currently, Verify is capable of the following (with more in development):</p>
 
 Collecting chemical analyses of drugs obtained through destructive testing of samples at any point in the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
 Applying Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies that improve the accuracy, speed, and data-integrity of scientifically generated results. 
 Monitoring and reporting results for a growing set of active pharmaceutical ingredients with the capacity to address nearly all <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MHP-HPS-EML-2023.02">World Health Organization Essential Medicines</a>. 
 
<p>In conclusion, the US faces multifaceted challenges in balancing pharmaceutical supply and demand. These challenges stem from the complex nature of the healthcare system, dependence on foreign sources, high drug prices, counterfeit drugs, and the need to adapt to evolving therapies. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration, innovation, and policy reforms to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of pharmaceutical products that meet the needs of patients across the country.</p>

  <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thrilled to announce that Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning is now in public preview!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With today’s announcement, we’re expanding our support for HR-driven provisioning to address the most common customer asks, including:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Automatically provisioning cloud-only users and hybrid users (users that require an on-premises Active Directory account) from any trusted source&nbsp; 
 Importing data from sources like CSV files and SQL staging tables using the automation tool of your choice&nbsp; 
 Simplifying the integration by using standard SCIM schema attributes to abstract schema differences across systems and provide a consistent mapping experience 
 Leveraging <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/lifecycle-workflows-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/2466931">Lifecycle Workflows</a> to automate joiner-mover-leaver workflows for users sourced from any system of record&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one common customer scenario, organizations use a cloud human capital management (HCM) platform for managing employees and extracting nightly flat files/CSVs to manage vendor and contractor data. Both of these sources can send information to Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning using your automation tool of choice. Then, the provisioning service will automatically determine the right operation to perform for each user, and Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/lifecycle-workflows-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/2466931">Entra ID Governance Lifecycle Workflows</a> will automate the joiner-mover-leaver processes configured by your IAM admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning data flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Let’s walk through the steps involved in configuring this integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Bring identities into your directory from any source in three easy steps&nbsp; 
<p>Step 1 – Configure API-driven provisioning app&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Microsoft Entra Portal, sign in as a user with Application Administrator and Hybrid Identity Administrator role. You will see two new provisioning applications in the Enterprise App gallery:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 API-driven provisioning to Microsoft Entra ID: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-configure-app">Configure this app</a> if you’d like to provision cloud-only user accounts from your authoritative source. 
 API-driven provisioning to on-premises Active Directory: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-configure-app">Configure this app</a> if you’d like to provision user accounts first to your on-premises Active Directory and then sync them into Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync / Connect Sync.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your provisioning target is an on-premises Active Directory domain, download and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/cloud-sync/how-to-install">configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent</a>. Once configured, you can select the Active Directory domain in the provisioning app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Connect to your on-premises Active Directory domain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>By default, the provisioning app maps attributes from the standard <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643.html#section-4.1">SCIM Core User schema</a> and the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643.html#section-4.3">SCIM Enterprise User schema extension</a> to the corresponding Microsoft Entra ID / on-premises Active Directory user attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: SCIM schema attributes to on-premises Active Directory attribute mapping</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra provisioning service creates a unique API endpoint for your provisioning app. You can copy this API endpoint from the “Overview” blade. Select “Start provisioning” to accept inbound provisioning requests at this API endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4:API endpoint for your provisioning app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inbound provisioning API endpoint has the format:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/%7bservicePrincipalId%7d/synchronization/jobs/%7bjobId%7d/bulkUpload">https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/{servicePrincipalId}/synchronization/jobs/{jobId}/bulkUpload</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where {servicePrincipalId} is the object ID of your provisioning app and {jobId} is the provisioning job id.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2 – Grant permission to your application or service to upload identity data&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this step, you create an entity in Microsoft Entra ID that represents your application or service calling the inbound provisioning API and grant it the necessary permissions. You can use one of the following options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-grant-access#configure-a-service-principal">Configure a service principal</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-grant-access#configure-a-managed-identity">Configure a managed identity</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grant the following Graph API permissions with admin consent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 SynchronizationData-User.Upload&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 AuditLog.Read.All&nbsp;<br> 
 
<p>Figure 5: Permissions required to perform API-driven provisioning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 3 – Upload identity data using any automation tool of your choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now securely upload identity data to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/synchronization-synchronizationjob-post-bulkupload">provisioning /bulkUpload API endpoint</a>. The great thing about API-driven provisioning is that you don’t need to implement custom logic to figure out whether an operation in your system of record requires creating or updating an identity. Just upload the data from your source systems and the Microsoft Entra provisioning service will automatically determine the right operation to perform for each user record based on mapping rules configured by your IAM admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unlock more integration scenarios&nbsp; 
<p>In the set of steps above, we showed you how to provision to Microsoft Entra ID in the cloud, and to Active Directory on-premises. You can apply these steps to implement several enterprise HR integration scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 1: IT teams can import HR data extracts from any source&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flat files, CSV files and SQL staging tables are commonly used in enterprise integration scenarios. Employee, contractor, and vendor information are periodically exported into one of these formats, and an automation tool is used to sync this data with Microsoft Entra ID. With API-driven provisioning, IT teams can use any automation tool of their choice (example: PowerShell scripts or Azure Logic Apps) to modernize and simplify this integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 2: HR ISVs can build direct inbound sync with Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, HR ISVs can ship native synchronization experiences so that changes in the HR system automatically flow into Microsoft Entra ID and connected on-premises Active Directory domains. For example, an HR app or student information systems app can send data to Microsoft Entra ID as soon as a transaction is complete or as end-of-day bulk update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 3: System integrators can build more connectors to systems of record&nbsp;</p>
<p>System integrators can build custom HR connectors to meet different integration requirements around identity data flow from systems of record to Microsoft Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What customers and partners are telling us&nbsp; 
<p>We got some great feedback from customers and partners like you during the previews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning will allow us to achieve our cloud-first vision by provisioning identity directly in the cloud and on-premises, integrating with our HR application. We will be able to remove legacy infrastructure and automate many fragmented workflows and reduce dependency on on-premises Active Directory infrastructure. This will enhance our security, efficiency, and user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sachin Desai, Sr. Director at Avanade Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, HR has better control over the identity lifecycle &amp; data in Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. When combined with Lifecycle Workflows, onboarding and offboarding becomes easy and seamless, and with that, no more manual work and always an up-to-date identity!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pim Jacobs, Principal Consultant at InSpark and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra API-driven inbound provisioning is a game changer for customers constrained by existing technologies, opening the possibility for any customer to start the journey for joiner, mover, and leaver automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martyn Gill, Senior Architect and Team Lead at Kocho&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, our customers can link employee information in SmartHR with Microsoft Entra ID. This will reduce the time and effort required to manage accounts as employees join, move, or leave the company. SmartHR is excited to partner with Microsoft in building this integration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Takumi Kanzaki, Product Engineer at SmartHR&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance by automating payroll, expenses, and benefits in one integrated platform. With Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning, we can now extend this automation to streamline access to more workforce apps, regardless of whether it’s in the cloud or on-premises. We look forward to enabling this seamless experience for our customers by partnering with Microsoft!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam Gnesin, Product Lead at Rippling&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a try&nbsp; 
<p>With this new capability, you now have even more flexibility on how to keep identity data in sync with your authoritative sources, regardless of whether they are hosted in the cloud or on-premises. Working with your HR/IT teams, you can select from a range of automation tools like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview">Azure Logic Apps</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/getting-started">PowerAutomate</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview">Azure Functions</a> or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction">Azure Data Factory</a> to retrieve, transform and merge HR data and simply upload the data to the new provisioning API endpoint.</p>

<p>Passwords are still the most common form of authentication but are more problematic than ever.</p>



 The first big problem with passwords is that most people manage them poorly. 



<p>Most people choose weak (guessable) passwords, don’t store them securely (sticky note, anyone?), regularly forget and have to reset them, and reuse the same one (or even different variations of it) across all accounts (which is <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">100</a> on average for Americans). In a 2020 study of Microsoft users across only three months, a massive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/12/06/microsoft-finds-password-security-problem-affecting-44-million-users/#356efc3c67c4">44 million users</a>&nbsp;had used the same password on more than one account.</p>



<p></p>



 The second big problem with passwords is that they are the most attractive target for cybercriminals. 



<p>Verizon’s <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/infographics/2023-dbir-infographic.pdf">2023 data breach report</a> reveals 49 per cent of breaches by external actors used stolen credentials. Its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">2020 report</a> noted 80 per cent of hacking-related breaches were linked to passwords. Well-meaning advice to frequently change passwords is just a band-aid on a gaping wound.</p>



<p><a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">PC Magazine</a>’s recent list of 12 simple things consumers can do to be more secure online had some valuable recommendations for passwords:</p>



 
 Make them unique for every login. 



 Turn off the save password feature in browsers. 
 



<p>But while consumers are increasingly aware of the dangers of these poor practices, few do anything about it. It seems doing the right thing is difficult, and most people don’t know where to start.</p>



<p></p>



 Doing the right thing 







<p>Among the practices that make using passwords infinitely safer, the most recommended are:</p>



 
 Make sure they are complex and hard to guess. The more characters and variety in those characters (letters, numbers, special characters, upper and lower case) the better. 



 Don’t reuse them over and over again. To be safe, every place that requires a password should have its own unique, complex version. The days of simply iterating on an already-used password by increasing the final number by 1 are long gone. 



 Store them securely. Ditch the sticky notes—don’t write them down. 



 Don’t use the save password feature on browsers. Enter it each time it is needed. 
 



<p>No-one can follow that advice without help. And the best way to make those suggestions a reality is by using a password management solution. Unfortunately, very few consumers are inclined to research, acquire, install, configure, and maintain yet another piece of technology on top of what they are already doing. That’s where you can ride in on your white horse and save the day for the customers of your online <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/5-predictions-for-data-privacy-in-2023-and-beyond/">data privacy</a> and security offering.</p>



<p></p>



 Here’s the opportunity to make it easy 







<p>The password manager that you could offer should have these capabilities to deliver maximum value:</p>



 
 Secure, encrypted storage of passwords and other data (such as banking information, driver license, and social security number) 



 The ability to create unique, un-hackable passwords for each login (fun fact: a 12-character password takes <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mathematics-of-hacking-passwords/">62 trillion times</a> longer to crack than one with six-characters) 



 Enforcement of password complexity rules including preventing the reusing or iterating of older logins 



 The ability to securely auto-fill passwords for all logins 



 Functionality on all the devices a customer would need – mobile, desktop, etc. 



 Ability to import and export from other password managers or data sources 



 Ability to share vaults and credentials. 
 



<p>Fortunately, Anonyome Labs is leading the charge for making online privacy and security a no-brainer for regular folks. Anonyome’s <a href="https://sudoplatform.com">Sudo Platform</a> offers you the ability to easily add important password management to your products – branded and packaged the way you want.

 From ancient bone etchings to blockchain brilliance: Discover how 20,000 years of data revolution is reshaping our world, why you should care, and how it impacts&nbsp;you. <p>This blog will synthesize a 20,000-year timeline between ancient Babylon, record keeping, AI DAOs, machine-to-machine payments, and everything from then, to 2040 and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>TLDR: Data has been here and is here to stay. It’s always been about the data. Walk through what it has been and why now is the time to pay attention.</p><a href="https://365datascience.com/trending/history-of-data/">Image Source</a> 19,000 BC: The Great&nbsp;Baboon <p>Evidence of early data collection dates back to the earliest known human civilizations. The first use and record of a ‘data point’ can be found in 19,000 BC when our Paleolithic ancestors used a baboon tool called the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ishango_bone#/media/File:Ishango_bone.jpg">Ishango bone</a> to perform simple calculations. Back then, there were no calculators, pencils, or chat GPT— imagine how people got around or knew what coffee to order?! For this, we consider this invention as the first evidence of tallying or recording information.</p><p>2,500 BC Sumerians &amp; Bookkeeping</p><p>Ancient Sumerians, who lived in what is now modern-day Iraq, kept written records of harvests and taxes on clay tablets over 5,000 years ago. The evolution of writing helped shape data collection, as written records became more widespread and sophisticated. Libraries, which first appeared in ancient Egypt around 2,000 BCE, were instrumental in the curation and preservation of written records. The earliest libraries were typically housed in temples and contained religious texts, but over time, libraries began to expand their collections to include works on various subjects.</p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485">Image Source</a> History of Data in 1640: The GodFather of Public Health Statistics <p>In 1640, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graunt">John Graunt</a>, a hat maker, started collecting information regarding deaths in London. John noted down statistics such&nbsp;as:</p>  The number of&nbsp;deaths  The mortality rate among age&nbsp;groups  The causes of&nbsp;death  <p>By this seemingly mundane tallying, he revolutionized how we use medical data and human organization records to this day. In fact, Graunt was the first person to use data analysis to understand and solve a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>In 1665, he published his book, <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A41827.0001.001?view=toc">Natural and Political Observations Mentioned in a Following Index</a>, and made upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bills_of_mortality#:~:text=Bills%20of%20mortality%20were%20the,Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Parish%20Clerks.">Bills of Mortality</a>, as the collective result of his research. In it, the innovator stored information in tables and even attempted to predict life expectancy.</p><p>As a result of Graunt’s publication, the city started issuing a weekly report called “Bills of Mortality”. Knowing the number of deaths and births better-prepared people for a possible plague outbreak at that&nbsp;time.</p> History of Data in the 1880s: The Era of Data Processing <p>Speeding through centuries into the 1880s, the German-American statistician Herman Hollerith saw a train conductor punching train tickets for passengers. That’s how the idea of using punch cards in writing and processing data was born. Hollerith started working on the design of the <a href="https://www.hnf.de/en/permanent-exhibition/exhibition-areas/hall-of-fame/herman-hollerith-1860-1929.html">tabulation machine</a> that uses punch cards, based on a previous model invented by the silk weaver Joseph Jacquard in the&nbsp;1800s.</p><p>A punch card is normally a type of stiff paper, onto which a machine would create holes in specific locations. The cards are moved between brass rods so that the data is read electronically. With this great breakthrough, Hollerith helped the American government complete the US census within the same year — after it took them nearly a decade of trial and&nbsp;error.</p> Data in 1928: The Concept of&nbsp;Storage  Pfleumer’s Magnetic&nbsp;Tape <p>In 1928, German engineer Fritz Pfleumer patented a <a href="https://historyofinformation.com/image.php?id=6719">magnetic tape</a> that he used to replace wire recording for storing data. Essentially, he coated very thin paper with iron oxide powder and glued it with lacquer. The idea of storing information on magnetic tapes actually inspired the invention of floppy disks and hard disk drives later&nbsp;on.</p> Present-Day: Here comes the Internet&nbsp;Era <p>The rise of the internet consequently came with its counterpart of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-science/#:~:text=Data%20science%20is%20the%20study,analyze%20large%20amounts%20of%20data.">big data</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web">Sir Tim Berners Lee</a>, hypertext and hyperlinks made it easy to share information and connect resources globally.</p><p>The introduction of Google in 1997 took Lee’s work and scaled to the masses. Data became even more widely available to everyone with access to a computer or mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>For the context of this topic, we can point readers to inquire on <a href="https://caseybotticello.medium.com/life-after-google-f9dcb639b087">Life After Google</a> by George Gilder, highlighting the rise and fall of Big&nbsp;Data.</p><p>Most people believe the internet is here to stay, specifically, those who’ve yet to think about digital ownership, blockchain, or privacy as any concern, nor the rise of AI. Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 allowed us to have the ability to read and write…creating data points every second we update the screen. Reading and writing are certainly not the final destination on the history of the data timeline graphic shown above. With every innovation in technology, data science, <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained">machine learning</a>, &amp; artificial intelligence comes a new way of creating and spreading information, knowledge, or&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Data has altered the way we view and assume the world, and continues to shape our reality in different ways. Industries like Finance, Insurance, Supply Chain, and Natural Sciences benefit from employing data-driven thesis &amp; techniques to improve their operations.</p> Internet Era -&gt; Blockchain Era (2023, 2040, and&nbsp;beyond) <p>As mentioned above, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 allowed us to read and write. Web 3.0 states the ability to read, write and&nbsp;own.</p><a href="https://elevatex.de/blog/web3/web1-web2-and-web3-explained/">Image Source</a><p>Web3 is positioned to Decentralize the Internet and bootstrap a more multidimensional and immersive environment (ie: the “metaverse”) designed for more participation, reward, engagement, and privacy by/for&nbsp;users.</p><p>The first question to this is how? Shorthand's answer is Blockchain technology. The distributed ledger technology changes how information is shared and stored. Deliverables: provide verifiable, trustless, distributed data on peer-to-peer nodes or servers that can enable the creation of new economic sectors and new forms of commerce.</p><p>Furthermore, decentralized applications (dApps) are the vehicle to transfer much of the power and control back to the public and consumers, marking a shift to a more user-owned web. Remove middlemen, expose bad actors, and streamline business processes to tailor to users and creators, rather than for-profit entities. DApps built inside the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem">here</a>.</p><p>Peer-to-peer buying and selling of assets are just the beginning. The peer-to-peer ownership of data, assets, information, and algorithmic scriptures is executed through the standard of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and ever-expanding mobile eCommerce has effectively cut the middlemen out of parts of the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Infamously, we will use credit card fees as an example. Consider the transaction fees charged to retailers by credit card companies. The seemingly small 1 to 4% adds up moving through the <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/s/supply-chain">supply chain</a>. The inefficiency of small transactions forces many companies to purchase in bulk and effectively shuts out smaller businesses.</p><p>Advocates of ‘DeFi’ or decentralized finance lobby for more personalized financial models and even a future without banks and centralized stock exchanges.</p><p>Pioneers in the space include OpenSea, the most prominent digital marketplace for crypto collectibles and NFTs, Coinbase for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrency, and Ocean Protocol, an open-source tool kit to own and deploy web-native applications, algorithms, and assets on the blockchain.</p><p>Ocean Protocol combines the ownership of data and payment rails into one. This takes the digital payment providers (Stripes of the World) and data storage (Snowflake of the World) and wraps ownership into one rail. The cost reduction, efficiency, and scalability of this mesh will be quantified in years to&nbsp;come.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">average cost of a data breach</a> is USD 4.35 million, and 83% of organizations have had more than one breach (of which 45% occur in the cloud). With these increases in the frequency and costs data breaches, an enterprise’s data protection and privacy in the cloud is more important than ever.</p>



<p>The data protection needs of organizations are driven by concerns about protecting sensitive information and intellectual property and meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption&nbsp;is named the&nbsp;largest&nbsp;cost mitigation,&nbsp;and&nbsp;as such,&nbsp;mandated by many regulators. The effectiveness of encryption depends on the assurance of the keys.</p>



<p>When hosting data with cloud providers,&nbsp;enterprises&nbsp;want to&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;complete authority over their valuable data and associated workloads. This includes no access to sensitive data from the outside, specifically including their cloud providers.</p>



 How can you properly protect sensitive data in the public cloud? 



<p>Deploying extensive encryption&nbsp;is considered&nbsp;the most&nbsp;substantial cost-mitigating factor in the event of a data breach. In fact, the average total reduction in the cost of a breach due to extensive encryption was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">USD 252,000 in 2022</a>.</p>



<p>Yet, data protection through encryption is only as strong as your ability to protect the keys used to encrypt the data.&nbsp;Clients can either rely on trusting the cloud provider with operational assurance or apply zero-trust principles with technical assurance.&nbsp;</p>



 Technical and operational assurance:&nbsp;Technical assurance delivers the highest level of privacy and protection in the cloud-native space 



<p>Operational assurance means your cloud provider will not access your data based on trust, visibility and control. Technical assurance, on the other hand, makes certain your cloud provider cannot access your data based on technical proof, data encryption and runtime isolation (and can protect your keys from bad actors).</p>







<p>So, who do you have to protect against?&nbsp;You want to have the highest technical assurance that primarily attackers—but also cloud administrators, vendors, software providers and site reliability engineers (SREs)—can’t access the keys you are using to protect encrypted data from bad actors. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-crypto">IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services</a> allows you to leverage technical assurance for your keys in a cloud-native way to keep your keys secure without the need of on-premises deployments or HSMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It enables enterprises to have complete authority over their sensitive data, workloads and encryption keys. It’s called <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-key-encryption#kyok-overview">Keep Your Own Key (KYOK)</a>, and not even IBM Cloud administrators have access.</p>



 Enhance the level of control over data in the cloud:&nbsp;Your data security journey begins with your keys in your hands 



<p>While technical assurance (as provided with KYOK for integrated IBM Cloud Services) is not available cross-provider, there is another way to gain control over keys, enhance data privacy for sensitive data, reduce risk in the cloud and establish a high-security ecosystem across hyperscalers with customer-managed keys. This is also known as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK).</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/customer-managed-keys-overview">Securing sensitive data in Microsoft Azure</a>&nbsp;takes a significant stride forward with the adoption of the BYOK or customer-managed key option. This approach empowers businesses to maintain an elevated level of control over their data encryption keys, bolstering the protection of their invaluable information. BYOK ensures that organizations can dictate who accesses their data, mitigating the risk of unauthorized breaches. By retaining ownership of encryption keys, enterprises align with stringent compliance regulations and bolster their security posture. The BYOK option extends beyond conventional security measures, offering end-to-end encryption that safeguards data at rest and in transit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing BYOK comes with its share of challenges that organizations need to navigate. One notable hurdle is the conflict between on-premises deployments and a cloud-native, cloud-first strategy. BYOK can be at odds with the seamless and flexible nature of cloud environments, potentially impeding the scalability and cost-effectiveness that businesses seek. The process of BYOK itself can be complex and resource-intensive, often requiring considerable effort and investment. Additionally, while cloud solutions aim to enhance security, the division of trust between two vendors might not necessarily translate to a substantial reduction in risk. As businesses look to achieve <a href="https://www.ibm.com/zero-trust">zero trust</a> while becoming and staying <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-native">cloud-native</a>, they must seek innovative approaches that balance the benefits of BYOK with the need for simplicity, scalability and a holistic security posture. Can we forge a path towards zero trust without compromising the agility and efficiency that cloud-native strategies offer?</p>

   Security teams have been focused on protecting their customers and their business for quite a while now, but the job is never finished. Bad actors are always finding new ways to exploit IT infrastructures, and they aren’t interested in slowing down. As digital commerce and operations have shifted online, so have the bad actors.

<p>Security teams have been focused on protecting their customers and their business for quite a while now, but the job is never finished. Bad actors are always finding new ways to exploit IT infrastructures, and they aren’t interested in slowing down. As digital commerce and operations have shifted online, so have the bad actors. Nobody is holding up banks anymore; all the fraud now happens online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters a bit more complicated, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/privacy-consent.html">customer privacy and consent</a> have also grown in demand, and they often fall on security teams to implement. This adds yet another set of requirements that these teams have to learn, implement, track, and update, often requiring a consent management platform (CMP). And it’s not a simple switch that can be turned on. Privacy and consent requirements vary by region, regulatory standards, customer preferences, and other factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long gone are the days when convenience was the main customer driver. “You’d like access to all of my personal data for one-click access? Sure, why not, what’s the harm?” Do you still wonder what happens to those pictures you upload to social media sites and who ultimately owns them? For the longest time, it seemed like social media companies owned them, but fortunately, this trend is starting to shift as customer concern about privacy and data collection continues to grow. And the main driver of this shift is often companies’&nbsp; bottom line. Customers don’t do business with companies they don’t trust, especially when there are numerous substitutions available just a few clicks away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Authentication security remains a significant vulnerability in most organizations' security posture. Even individuals without technical expertise can easily acquire and employ pre-made hacking tools. Microsoft, for instance, fends off an astonishing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/01/26/2023-identity-security-trends-and-solutions-from-microsoft/">1,000 authentication attacks a second</a>. Furthermore, the dark web is flooded with over 24 billion username and password pairs available for purchase, perpetuating the constant onslaught of these malicious activities.</p>  
<p>Security systems have incorporated measures like <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> to deter attackers. However, several MFA methods, including push notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs), are easy to circumvent. Adaptive authentication is a promising advancement to enhance authentication protocols, leveraging diverse parameters to conduct a risk-based evaluation of authentication requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In this blog, we’ll delve into adaptive authentication, exploring how it is deployed and how it can enhance your authentication security.</p> 
 What Is Adaptive Authentication?  
<p>Adaptive authentication, also knowns as risk-based authentication, is an intelligent system that dynamically determines when to step up authentication and request additional factors to prove identity. The system makes risk-based assessments for determining what level of authentication must be provided, moving towards continuous assessment rather than a user simply authenticating at the start of their session.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A common example of adaptive authentication is banking applications, where users can freely view their account balance. However, the authentication process may require additional factors if they want to initiate a transfer. Likewise, within an enterprise setting, risk-based assessments can determine what data or apps a user can access with the authentication factors they’ve provided. It is also apparent on a smart device, where a low-risk request, such as checking the time or seeing the subject of an email, can be done without entering a password or using a biometric identifier.</p> 
<p>Adaptive authentication serves two primary objectives. Firstly, it aims to enhance authentication security by eliminating the “break once, run everywhere” scenario, where an attacker gains continuous account access by overcoming a single authentication challenge. Secondly, it strives to strike a balance between security and user experience. Since the strength of authentication is often associated with its duration or complexity, adaptive authentication allows low-risk requests to be granted swiftly without burdening users with excessive time-consuming processes.</p> 
 How Adaptive Authentication Is Deployed  
<p>The driving force of adaptive authentication is risk assessment, with the authentication requirements increasing linearly as the risk to the user or organization increases. The following “rules” govern how adaptive authentication is deployed in real-life applications.&nbsp;</p> 
 Static Rules  
<p>This ruleset has a clear relationship between actions, risks, and authentication requirements. This means, for example, that every time a user seeks to submit changes within an internal app, they must pass an authentication challenge. Standard rule policies cover role-based access, the importance of the data or application, or the action they are looking to take. In these cases, a defined rule will correspond to a defined authentication protocol.</p> 
 Dynamic Rules  
<p>These are where the users’ actions and behavior will set the baseline for system access, and any deviations from that norm trigger authentication challenges. For example, if you log on every day from Southern California but now it says you’re in Brazil, this would cause the system to ask for further identity verification. Similarly, if your account normally interacts with product development but now it’s seeking access to the sales team’s client list, it would be flagged.</p> 
<p>Some adaptive authentication technologies incorporate even more sophisticated dynamic risk signals such as device status, user behavior anomalies and risk data from SIEM tools or other corporate security systems.</p> 
 Hybrid Rules  
<p>This sees the adaptive authentication process use both dynamic and static rules. This might look like increasing authentication requirements for certain apps but lowering them if a user logs on with their recognized device on a company VPN rather than an unknown device on a public network. However, as machine learning improves in capabilities mixing static with AI-driven authentication policies could become very common.</p> 
<p>The stepped-up authentication requests that the system makes can be the same as those of your MFA system, which could include:</p> 
  
  Biometric identifiers (face or retina scans, fingerprints)  
  <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTPs sent to SMS/email</a>  
  Security keys  
  Smart cards  
  <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">Push notifications</a> sent to a personal device  
  
<p>Depending on the risk level of the user’s request, a system can also require different factors than what they logged in with to improve security. As mentioned, contextual indicators, such as IP, device MAC address, or geolocation, can also play a role in deciding the risk level of the request.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, many MFA methods aren’t all that secure so adding in an additional layer may not sufficiently secure against the increased risk level. Ideally, your baseline authentication would already use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant mfa,</a> with the step-up requirements either being a re-authentication request or another highly secure factor.</p> 
 Benefits of Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Implementing adaptive authentication provides several key advantages for organizations, including enhanced security and bottom-line savings.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improves Security  
<p>Adaptive authentication protocols should improve the detection of <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">account takeover attacks</a> or at least compartmentalize how far they can spread. Requiring several more layers of authentication factors as the privilege level escalates makes it unlikely that anything bar highly targeted attacks could succeed. In addition, building a behavioral anomaly identifier into the system for dynamic rulesets can identify unauthorized intrusions as they occur.</p> 
 Balances User Experience and Security  
<p>If an authentication system is too demanding, users will get frustrated and try to take shortcuts, such as sharing authentication factors, to save time. If it is a customer, they may abandon their transaction and take their business elsewhere. An advantage of adaptive authentication is that it seeks to find the best for both, with low-risk requests treated with a lighter touch. This way, users understand there’s a reason for heavier security for higher-risk requests.</p> 
 Saves Time and Money  
<p>Not only do demanding, heavy-handed authentication systems frustrate users, but they also take up a lot of their time, both in the actual authentication process and during resets if factors are forgotten, lost or not accessible. Adaptive authentication reduces friction, improves productivity and lowers help desk calls by providing the right level of authentication security.</p>

 The Shyft Perspective: Crypto Regulations — The South American&nbsp;Way <p>South America, home to over 440 million people across twelve nations and three territories, comprises roughly 5.47% of the global population. Yet, when discussions turn to cryptocurrencies, attention predominantly shifts to the Western World and the emerging Asian economies. This oversight is surprising, given that South America is leading the charge in digital currency adoption and pioneering central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><p>Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador notably rank among the top 20 nations for global cryptocurrency adoption. The rise of crypto in South America isn’t just about global rankings — it’s deeply rooted in pressing economic challenges.</p><p>The continent grapples with high inflation, increasing social unrest, waning trust in public institutions, and stagnant job and economic growth. For instance, Venezuela is suffering from hyperinflation that has left its currency worthless, catapulting cryptocurrencies to a favored position in the nation and shedding light on similar trends throughout the&nbsp;region.</p> Crypto Adoption in South&nbsp;America <p>Taking a closer look at South America’s stance on crypto, it’s clear the region is not just active but thriving. The 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis echoes this sentiment: Brazil is positioned at the 7th spot, followed by Argentina at 13th, Colombia at 15th, and Ecuador rounding off at 18th. The figures paint an interesting narrative.</p>(<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Image Source</a>)<p>South American nations, in fact, boast higher crypto adoption rates per capita than some of the most developed economies, including the likes of the US and EU. This perspective is further emphasized by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202468/global-cryptocurrency-ownership/">Statista’s findings</a>: Argentina leads with crypto ownership of 21%, trailed by Colombia at 15%, Chile at 14%, and Peru and Brazil both at 13%. In contrast, economic titans such as the US could muster only 10%, Russia 8%, China 7%, Germany 7%, and Japan at a mere&nbsp;4%.</p><p>It’s evident there’s a solid demand for cryptocurrencies in these nations, particularly showcased by the surge in peer-to-peer (P2P)&nbsp;usage.</p><p>To contextualize this momentum, the <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/PP/2023/English/PPEA2023004.ashx">International Monetary Fund’s February 2023 report</a> highlights several catalysts: the allure of efficient cross-border transactions, the appeal of crypto as a bulwark against hyperinflation, challenges stemming from fiat currency depreciation, and the overarching need to navigate strict capital controls. These elements, in tandem, underline the region’s steady pivot towards crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Crypto Regulations in South&nbsp;America <p>South America has been at the forefront of crypto adoption, yet it lacks a region-wise comprehensive regulatory structure like the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA). As such, crypto regulation diverges widely across the region, ranging from crypto acceptance to prohibition.</p><p>Looking into the latest major developments in South America’s crypto regulatory landscape, we can easily identify trends emerging in this&nbsp;region.</p> Argentina <p>Amidst an escalating annual inflation rate of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/argentina-inflation-likely-sped-back-up-ahead-primary-vote-analysts-say-2023-08-11/#:~:text=Argentina%20has%20one%20of%20the,dollars%20to%20protect%20the%20peso.">116%</a>, its highest in over three decades, Argentina finds itself at a crossroads. Interestingly, this financial turbulence coincides with the rise of pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate Javier&nbsp;Milei.</p><p>This isn’t surprising, given an interest rate of 118%, unpredictable currency fluctuations, strict capital controls, and a general wariness towards the government. In this climate, approximately 12% of the population is adopting&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Buenos Aires even facilitates tax payments via&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>However, the nation’s engagement with crypto doesn’t stop at usage. Argentina is also a significant hub for Bitcoin mining. And while the central bank maintains a cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, public regulators are more optimistic. They <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-regulatory-recap-19th-june-to-4th-july">have expressed interest</a> in fostering the growth of the crypto sector and building a structured regulatory environment.</p><p>As the landscape evolves, Argentina is all set to roll out new crypto rules, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argentina-regulate-crypto-firms-fight-145745814.html">aligning with IMF’s strategies</a> to counter money laundering.</p> Bolivia <p>In the case of Bolivia, the country’s central bank has prohibited the use and commercialization of crypto assets, making such means of payment for the purchase and sale of products and services illegal in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>However, recently, Bolivian National Deputy Mariela Baldivieso spearheaded an initiative to legalize cryptocurrencies in Bolivia by introducing a proposal to lift the current ban on crypto assets. The proposal urges the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance to establish regulatory norms and “embrace new technologies as a transformative opportunity to strengthen our economy, promote financial inclusion, and open the doors to technological innovation.”</p> Brazil <p>The 10th largest economy globally with an <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/brazil-inflation-returns-to-target-range-64cd849c#:~:text=The%20annual%20inflation%20rate%20in,the%20national%20statistics%20institute%2C%20IBGE.">inflation of 4.65%</a>, Brazil is the 5th largest crypto market in the world. Approximately 7.8% of its citizens are now crypto&nbsp;owners.</p><p>What’s more, their trading activities have been bustling. Only in 2022 alone, they transacted a staggering $11.4 billion in stablecoins. The primary drivers that have motivated Brazilians to turn to cryptocurrencies are price speculation, their purported role as a reliable store of value, and streamlined international remittances.</p><p>Taking note of this momentum, in June 2023, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva t endorsed a decree, carving out a solid legal foundation for the country’s burgeoning crypto economy. This legislation entrusts the central bank with the mandate to keep a keen eye on virtual asset service providers, known in industry parlance as&nbsp;VASPs.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>And for those tokens that parallel securities? They remain under the oversight of Brazil’s Comissão de Valores Mobiliários, or CVM, akin to the US’s SEC. It doesn’t end&nbsp;there.</p><p>The central bank, in tandem with payment giants like Visa and Mastercard, is gearing up to roll out a pilot for their own digital currency: the digital&nbsp;real.</p> Chile <p>Chile has a small but rapidly growing crypto market, with around <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-chile-2021/">2.6%</a> of the population owning crypto. The country has a thriving P2P trading market and perceives crypto positively, with 36% of Chileans in favor of crypto being recognized as an official kind of currency. There’s also the possibility of a Digital Chilean&nbsp;Peso.</p><p>Currently, there is no formal regulatory framework, but tax guidance is available for those trading digital assets or those doing business in virtual assets. Under Chile’s tax guidelines, crypto assets are classified as virtual assets, which are not considered securities or foreign currencies, which means investors need to pay capital gains&nbsp;taxes.</p><p>The nation has been debating a “Bitcoin Law,” which was presented to Congress in late 2021 and aimed to generate a safe environment and provide protection for involved parties while making the central bank responsible for regulating cryptocurrencies.</p> Colombia <p>This country, home to hundreds of crypto ATMs, is the 4th largest crypto market by volume for P2P trading worldwide. It is estimated that <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-colombia-2021/">6.1%</a> of its citizens own cryptocurrency. This adoption is due to strict taxation policies for crypto within Colombia and a lack of regulatory clarity for exchanges and crypto businesses.</p><p>In Dec. 2021, Colombia’s Financial Information and Analysis Unit mandated cryptocurrency exchanges to report user transactions. Notably, all Bitcoin transactions above $150 were required to be registered after April 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The nation has also created a regulatory sandbox, a pilot program that enables exchanges to interoperate with banks. But it hasn’t been the most successful due to the 40% of the population being unbanked.</p> Ecuador <p>Interest in cryptocurrencies is clearly rising in Ecuador, with <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-ecuador-2021/">2.73%</a> of its residents now holding such&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Ecuador, which operates its own electronic money system anchored to its official currency, the US dollar, has set firm rules for the crypto scene. Although the National Assembly once outlawed Bitcoin, it has since revised its position, as it clarified: while cryptos aren’t official payment methods, buying and selling them remains&nbsp;legal.</p> Guyana <p>In Guyana, cryptocurrency regulation is still in its infancy. Even so, the government is actively laying the groundwork for a regulatory framework. As part of this initiative, they have established a task force dedicated to studying the crypto landscape, aiming to both regulate the industry and safeguard investors.</p><p>Building on that, <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llglrd/2021687419/2021687419.pdf">the Library of Congress pointed out in November 2021</a> that although Guyana places restrictions on certain cryptocurrency activities, there isn’t a complete ban. Furthermore, the sector remains untouched by tax laws and measures against money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CFT).</p> Paraguay <p>Paraguay is yet another crypto-friendly nation where crypto is widely used in everyday life. However, in Dec. 2022, Paraguay failed to pass a bill that would have regulated crypto and mining. The bill titled “Regulating the industry and marketing of virtual assets — crypto assets” was approved <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/paraguayan-president-vetoes-virtual-assets-regulation-bill-citing-energy-intensive-nature-of-crypto-mining">only to be vetoed later by President Mario Abdo&nbsp;Benítez</a>.</p><p>This comes at a time when some of the world’s largest Bitcoin miners have set up operations in Paraguay, having been attracted by the cheap energy rates it&nbsp;offers.</p> Peru <p>Much like Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia, inflation is the primary driver of crypto and stablecoin adoption in Peru. And although its annual inflation has eased somewhat in July 2023 at <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/peru/inflation-cpi#:~:text=to%20Slow%20Down-,Annual%20inflation%20rate%20in%20the%20capital%20of%20Peru%2C%20Lima%2C%20fell,bank's%201%2D3%25%20target.">5.88%</a>, it is still above the central bank’s target band of 1%-3%. Political turmoil is another factor that has led to Peruvians buying crypto as a hedge against financial crisis.</p><p>The country has been taking a slower approach to adopting a regulatory framework. Only recently, it has begun debating the creation of a public registry of crypto service providers that aims to report what it terms “suspicious operations.” Profits from trading crypto, however, are&nbsp;taxed.</p> Suriname <p>Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the law in Suriname, and there are no mechanisms to regulate their use or tax the income derived from them. However, trading and investing in crypto assets is possible through P2P and crypto exchanges.</p><p>Located in the northern part of South America, Suriname is one of three carbon-negative countries in the world, seeing growing interest in crypto among its citizens with a couple of projects looking to connect its indigenous communities with global markets through&nbsp;crypto.</p> Uruguay <p>In Sept. 2022, Uruguay’s executive branch <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-bill-introduced-in-uruguays-parliament-what-you-should-know">submitted a bill to Congress</a> to give the country’s central bank legal powers to regulate crypto. The bill proposes to treat crypto assets as securities that can only be issued by a registered entity per the laws and regulations. It further aims to create a new category of companies for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and seeks to amend the organic charter of the Banco Central Del Uruguay or Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) and put VASPs under the supervision of the Financial Services Superintendence.</p><p>The country’s central bank has started working on a plan to lay the foundation for regulating cryptocurrencies and companies that provide related services. For now, however, there is no explicit tax regulation in Uruguay for cryptocurrencies.</p> Venezuela <p>With its national currency, the Bolivar, depreciating more than 100,000% from 2014 to 2022, Venezuela has been pro-crypto for a while now. Over the last few years, Venezuela formed the national crypto department, created a framework for crypto mining, institutionalized the registration of crypto exchanges, and in 2021, launched its own cryptocurrency called The&nbsp;Petro.</p><p>But challenges arose when people accused the country’s crypto regulator of corruption. This controversy led to the arrest of the Superintendent of Cryptoassets, Sunacrip. Subsequently, Anabel Pereira Fernández, a lawyer who served as president of the Fondo de Garantía de Depositos y Protección Bancaria, the Venezuelan version of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, took the reins and closed multiple crypto exchanges and mining farms. The national crypto group, Asociación Nacional de Criptomonedas (Asonacrip), opposed her decisions, emphasizing that private enterprises shouldn’t bear the brunt of internal regulatory issues.</p><p>José Ángel Álvarez, Asonacrip’s president, conveyed his concerns about the indiscriminate crackdown on mining farms, especially those fully compliant with required permits. And while the organization respects the need for a thorough anti-corruption probe, Asonacrip urged a more nuanced approach that doesn’t hamper the nation’s burgeoning crypto infrastructure.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>A perfect storm of challenges — weak national currencies, climbing inflation, political upheavals, capital restrictions, large unbanked populations, and a surge in remote work — has set the stage for crypto’s broad acceptance in South American&nbsp;nations.</p><p>While some countries have not yet specified any laws regarding crypto, most economies are contemplating regulation as the adoption of crypto assets continues to rise. A few countries have made significant advances toward establishing a regulatory framework, particularly those with the highest crypto adoption.</p><p>Across South America, legislation to oversee crypto has entered the discussion phase, each at varying progression levels. Yet, a unified and all-encompassing set of standards remains elusive, making it challenging to both harness crypto’s advantages and mitigate its associated risks.</p><p>Numerous countries in this region are taking strides to bring crypto under the rule of law, but the journey stretches far ahead.

				  In a previous article we discussed <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-does-the-ledger-do-anyway/">what exactly a ledger does.</a> In this article we will seek to understand why you would want to use one, and what your options are.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>For a brief recap, the ledger offers four important elements when building a decentralized ecosystem, these being:</p>
<p>1) Immutability: The data cannot be changed — by anyone.<br>2) Tamper resistance: A distributed ledger makes it very difficult for a malicious actor to break in and change material.<br>3) High availability: If one node on the network goes down for any reason, there are plenty of others to receive data from.<br>4) Geopolitical and infrastructure diversity: By hosting the ledger on servers located in multiple geographic areas and by diverse organizations, network resilience to technical problems is maximized — and this contributes to high availability.</p>
<p>While there are other options available, ledgers provide all these aspects in one convenient place; oftentimes, efforts to provide all the necessary features end up resembling a ledger anyway.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that while other options such as web infrastructure (did:web or similar) can provide some of the combination of immutability, tamper resistance, and high availability, they often fall short in one of them. For example, did:web doesn’t provide features universally, leading to a deficit in the high availability / diversity category.</p>
<p>When creating a decentralized network, using a ledger is often both the easiest and most effective choice. Once you have decided on using a ledger there are several different types that you can employ, all with slightly different specialties.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work Networks</p>
<p>The most well-known proof-of-work network is Bitcoin, which was also the first widely-known application of blockchain technology. Beginning as a protocol for peer-to-peer financial transaction, Bitcoin evolved to become a store of value, known generically as a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Without a central authority to authorize and record transactions, a decentralized financial network needs to establish a way to ensure that everyone agrees on what is written to the ledger, not least to prevent money being spent twice.</p>
<p>Bitcoin solves this with “proof of work.” It turns the verification of a new block of transaction records into a numeric challenge, the solution of which writes the block to the chain and earns the winner Bitcoin (which expands the amount of currency in circulation). Those that compete to solve the problem are called “miners,” and the complexity of the problem increases the more miners there are and decreases the fewer there are. The first miner to complete a proof of work for a new block, broadcasts the block to the rest of the network, where it is <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-is-bitcoin-mining/">verified</a> as following the rules of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
<p>This process ensures that a new block is written to the ledger roughly every ten minutes and that the effort expended to solve the problem is evenly balanced to the Bitcoin earned. The easiest way to think of all this is that the effort required to verify transactions serves as a deterrent against fraud. This proof-of-work methodology, however, is not without controversy, as the effort is measured in computing power and hence energy to do the work. This excess usage of energy is frequently criticized as being wasteful.</p>
<p>If you want to use a proof-of-work network — such as Bitcoin — you will need to have your transactions verified by a miner, typically for a small fee. This fee can fluctuate and be unpredictable, but generally the more you are willing to pay, the quicker your transaction record will be verified.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Stake Networks</p>
<p>Some networks are controlled through proof of stake networks, often referred to as smart contracts, which are digital programs that mirror the functions of a traditional contract in the form of “if this, then that” rules. Once the terms of the contract are met, the program automatically executes the predetermined outcome. A popular analogy is that of a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/">digital vending machine.</a> As a smart contract program cannot be altered and automatically executes the terms of the contract, it can be trusted to continually execute the code it was created with.</p>
<p>While smart contract networks can do a lot more than finance-oriented, proof-of-work networks, this greater flexibility creates complexity. When a smart contract is not read and understood correctly by the user, or the contract parameters are defined poorly, the code may do things you were not expecting or don’t want to happen. And once the code executes it can’t be undone.</p>
<p>The transaction fees on this type of network pay for the execution of contracts (Ethereum calls this fee “gas”) and keeps the contracts to be kept active and running on the network. The fees required are subject to market forces, and makes this fee unpredictable.</p>
<p>Public-Permissioned Networks</p>
<p>A public permissioned network allows anyone to read the data written to it but requires authorization by the network to write to it. This is because the ledger is a permanent record and writing personal data to the ledger would breach data privacy law, such as the right to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to write to this type of ledger (typically called a “Transaction Author”) must go through a “Transaction Endorser,” an organization that has a signed legal agreement with the network for approving writes to the ledger. Endorsers may charge a transaction fee for approving writes and pay a fee to the network for writing to the ledger. These fees can change, but are far less volatile than the fluctuating fees charged by other ledger technologies.</p>
<p>A good example of this type of network would be <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy-based identity networks.</a> These networks are ideal for decentralized identity as they are compliant by default with many rules and regulations put into place by governments that have run into issues with blockchains in the past. These ledgers do not require proof of work to establish consensus. They are not set up to create tokens or currencies and can’t handle complex smart contracts, focusing instead on the fundamental needs of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>No Network?</p>
<p>Some of the goals of decentralized identity may be accomplished without using a ledger at all. There is, for example, some support for hosting the assets necessary for an identity ecosystem on web infrastructure, a well-understood technology stack which avoids all the complexities of a ledger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, web technology does not meet the requirements necessary for a stable decentralized ecosystem. While immutability and tamper resistance can be achieved with the proper application of digital signatures, and high availability in web infrastructure can be gained by using clusters of servers for redundancy (often by the use of a content delivery network, or a large, distributed collection of servers for delivering web content), these must be provided on a per-identifier basis. Some web infrastructure will have high availability, and some will not. This creates an uncertain environment when it comes to accessing the assets required for data verification.</p>
<p>Infrastructure diversity is partially solved using the same methods as high availability, but the need to continue hosting assets when a company or organization ceases to exist remains unmet. This also adds uncertainty when retrieving assets using web infrastructure.</p>
<p>The decision to use web infrastructure must be made with these deficiencies in mind and a plan to address them.</p>
<p>So how do I choose?</p>
<p>When choosing a network to host your solution the answer comes down to functionality and seeing if your goals align with what the network is good at. As we have outlined above, despite all falling under the umbrella of “blockchain,” these networks have very different ways of establishing consensus, creating blocks, and executing code.</p>
<p>A brief recap and slight oversimplification may be helpful here:</p>
<p>If you are looking for token or financial exchanges, and can handle heavy computation costs, a proof-of-work network is probably best suited for you.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a trustworthy way to broker deals and execute code when certain conditions are met — “if this, then that” — then a smart contract network is your best bet.</p>
<p>If you are looking to create a solution that needs to be highly visible to anyone, but exclusive about who can write to the network — such as anyone being able to check an ID but very few being able to create one — then a public-permissioned network will meet your needs nicely.</p>
<p>Need something free that meets credential holder needs and you don’t care about issuing capabilities? Did:peer could be an option for you.</p>
<p>Lastly, if high availability and infrastructure diversity are not major concerns, you might be able to use did:web.</p>
<p>This technology is new and highly nuanced. If you aren’t completely sure which network will be best for you, figuring it out before you start building can help you avoid costly mistakes.</p>

<p>The CA/Browser Forum released <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/05/24/ballot-csc-18-update-revocation-requirements/">Ballot CSC-18 to update the code signing certificate revocation requirements</a> in the Code Signing Baseline Requirements (CSBRs). The purpose of the ballot is to align the revocation reasons with the TLS BRs and to provide stricter requirements for revocation due to private key compromise and use in suspect code.</p>
<p>Revocation reason consistency will allow the CAs to have the same response and processes for most revocations regardless of certificate type. The revocation reasons are also similar to those with the S/MIME BRs. CAs issuing code signing certificates also need to address where a certificate has an associated private key that has been compromised or where the private key has signed suspect code. Suspect code may contain malicious functionality or serious vulnerabilities, such as spyware or malware. Suspect code may install without the user’s consent or may resist removal. The code may compromise user security or could be exploited in ways not intended by its designers.</p>
<p>The CSBRs will require certificates associated with compromised private keys or suspect code to be revoked within 24 hours. This will stop any future use of a compromised key or signing of more suspect code. The requirements also allow the CA to change the revocation date to a time earlier than when the revocation occurred. The purpose of backdating the revocation date is to choose a time before the key was compromised or suspect code was signed. With the earlier date, any timestamped signature by the compromised key or on suspect code performed after the date would no longer be trusted.</p>
<p>There is an exception to the certificate revocation requirements. This may apply when an application software supplier, such as Microsoft, requests a delay where immediate revocation has a potentially large negative impact to the code signing ecosystem. An instance may occur where revocation of the certificate will also impact good signatures, which will prevent the associated good code from being installed. A delay would allow the good code to be re-signed with a new private key.</p>
<p>The ballot includes reasons for a root CA to revoke a subordinate CA. These reasons are the same as those specified in the TLS BRs.</p>
<p>Entrust will update its practices to reflect the new ballot, which is effective April 15, 2024.</p>

 The illicit trade in fentanyl – a powerful opioid between 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine – is a deadly enterprise that spans organized crime groups in China, Mexico and much of the western world. And in 2023, American enforcement agencies seized enough fentanyl to kill every citizen of the United States.

<p>The illicit trade in fentanyl – a powerful opioid between 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine – is a deadly enterprise that spans organized crime groups in China, Mexico and much of the western world. And in 2023, American enforcement agencies seized enough fentanyl to kill every citizen of the United States.</p>

<p>Keith Uber, VP of Sales Engineering at Ubisecure, recently joined Riley Hughes on <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">The Future of Identity Podcast by Trinsic</a>. Keith discusses the role of verifiable credentials in organisational identity and vLEIs (Verifiable Legal Entity Identifiers), emphasising how verifiable credentials have implications for both consumer identity and organisational identity, whilst presenting new business opportunities and operational efficiencies. Keith highlights the European Identity Wallet (EUDI) initiative as a pivotal development for consumers, enabling streamlined authentication to government and third-party services. He also covers how Ubisecure’s RapidLEI service issues Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), which have the potential to enhance business transactions, document signing, and verification processes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Keith and Riley discuss various key topics around organisational identities and vLEIs, including:</p>
 Verifiable Credentials and the Identity Landscape 
<p>Keith delves into verifiable credentials and their multifaceted impact on consumer and organisational identity. These credentials not only present an avenue for streamlined authentication, but also pave the way for new business opportunities and enhanced operational efficiency.</p>
 European Identity Wallet and the Consumer Identity Revolution 
<p>Keith highlights the European identity wallet initiative as a landmark development that has the potential to revolutionise consumer identity. This initiative is set to provide consumers with a unified approach to authentication across government and third-party services.</p>
 Navigating the Identity Ecosystem 
<p>Ubisecure closely monitors initiatives like eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI and has a proactive approach to related developments. Keith highlights Ubisecure’s commitment to staying at the forefront of identity technology trends and understanding how these trends might impact its services and offerings.</p>
 The Power of Organisational Identity 
<p>Delving deeper into organisational identity, Keith highlights the role of vLEIs in transforming business transactions, document signing, and verification processes. These credentials provide a unique opportunity for businesses to enhance their operations by creating a seamless and secure environment for transactions and interactions.</p>
 A Vision for the Future of Identity 
<p>Keith explains how he envisions a future where verifiable credentials play a pivotal role in shaping the identity ecosystem. He emphasises the need for a governing actor to ensure the widespread adoption and standardisation of these credentials.</p>
<p>The podcast episode provides a fascinating glimpse into the potential of verifiable credentials, particularly vLEIs, in transforming the identity landscape. The evolving consumer identity landscape, combined with the opportunities presented by organisational identity, showcases the far-reaching impact of this innovative technology.

 Interview with interested.fyi Team: Implementing Veramo in Buildathon at EthDenver 2023 EthDenver2023<p>We had the pleasure of interviewing the interested.fyi team after their participation in the last Buildl hackathon at EthDenver 2023. The team integrated Veramo into their project, and we were excited to learn more about their experience.</p><p>The Buildl hackathon is a renowned blockchain hackathon that brings together developers, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enthusiasts to collaborate and build innovative blockchain solutions. The Buildl hackathon was held recently at EthDenver 2023. The hackathon saw the participation of several teams, including interested.fyi.</p><p>The team consists of eleven (11)&nbsp;members:</p><p>Product: Alec.eth Gutman (Venture Contributooor) — Peeple DAO / Ex ConsenSys Mesh &amp; Matt Mulford (Engineer)</p><p>With contributions from Kate Yeh (Product)—Scroll/ Ex Arbitrum + DoorDash, Chester, LaCroix (Design)—Free agent / Ex Sushi + Component.fi&nbsp;, Charles Walsh (Design)—Free agent / Ex, John McClure (Engineer)—Inuition/ Ex Ethereal Ventures + DRW and Alexis Bednarick (Venture Contributooor) — Peeple&nbsp;DAO</p><p>Day2Day Venture Contributooors:</p><p>Alec.eth Gutman, Alexis Bednarick — Peeple DAO, Alexis Perez — Peeple DAO, and Manny Narang — Peeple DAO + Developer DAO</p><p>We wanted to know more about interested.fyi’s experience using Veramo and how it helped them in their project. Let’s dive into their journey and see how they #builtwithveramo!</p><blockquote>Veramo is an open-source modular framework that simplifies the process of building decentralized identity solutions.</blockquote> Q1. <p>Can we meet you? (Tell us about the team and your roles within the project.)</p><p>At our recruiting Service DAO, we are developing Interested.fyi, a product that enables us to contribute to the products we are most passionate about getting to market. Our goal is to improve the process of venture contribution and support the growth of innovative products.</p> Q2. <p>Tell us a bit about your solution. How did you come up with the idea for your project, and why did you build it? (Read: What problem were you trying to&nbsp;solve?)</p><p>As curators of conversations, we’ve often found that interests drive the best discussions. We are making it simple to express interest in working with and/or learning more about a specific&nbsp;team.</p> Q3. <p>How did you come across Veramo, and why did you choose it for your&nbsp;project?</p><p>I came across Veramo after struggling with another SDK that couples all of its features tightly to its storage layer. Googling DID solutions led me to Veramo. The Veramo tools existing independently of any other technology is what makes it appealing. We are free to set up a web resolver and then add on chain elements to enhance the experience as it makes sense, rather than going all in on a beta, decentralized storage solution. Also, the documentation was spot&nbsp;on.</p> Q4. <p>How did our framework help you achieve your project&nbsp;goals?</p><p>By only focusing on the DID/VC layer and allowing us to implement our own storage, we were able to ideate and test implementations more efficiently.</p> Q7. <p>How do you see this project going&nbsp;forward?</p><p>We will likely seek funding to build&nbsp;more</p> Q8. <p>If people are interested in collaborating, how can they reach&nbsp;you?</p><p>In the weeks to come, you’ll be able to attest to your interest in learning more about People DAO with ease. Until then, you can get in touch with us at @chipagosfinest on Twitter or Telegram.</p><p>___________________________________________________________</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about Veramo and connecting with others in the community, we invite you to <a href="http://discord.gg/sYBUXpACh4">join our community</a>.

<p>Liquid Avatar Technologies provides shareholder update.</p>



<p>August 21, 2023 –Toronto, Canada / Bridgetown, Barbados –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has received a non-binding offer for its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) and its Liquid Avatar Mobile App from a private Swiss based Metaverse and virtual experience organization.&nbsp; Contingent on financing in an amount to be agreed, final agreements and financial terms being agreed, and all necessary approvals, the transaction, should it come to fruition, is expected to provide Liquid Avatar Technologies with cash, primarily for debt reduction, and an expected significant amount of equity in the new parent company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Management and the Board of Directors believe that this opportunity provides long term optimal value for shareholders and is working with all parties to complete due diligence. The teams have undertaken to begin working on definitive agreements. Completion of the transaction will require all necessary corporate, shareholder and any regulatory approvals.&nbsp; Additional information will be provided on this potential transaction upon definitive agreements being executed. During this period, the Company will remain focused on completing this opportunity as it does not have the resources to finalize its outstanding financial statements in order to seek a revocation of the existing cease trade order.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands Metaverse may continue to pursue its own, non-dilutive financing efforts in the short term.&nbsp; As announced in April 2023, Aftermath Islands received an executed share purchase agreement from a Family Office in the UK and EU but has yet to receive any funding.&nbsp; As a result of these unfulfilled obligations on the part of the Family Office, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited is in the process of terminating that agreement and may seek other financing opportunities.</p>



<p>As part of its ongoing marketing and business efforts, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited has achieved almost $3 Million USD in gross retail and commercial sales since the start of the program in November 2021, which have been recorded as Deferred Revenue in accordance with IFRS, with approximately 8,000 purchases made through the Shopify store, and the Company is continuing to execute its business plan to the best of its abilities under the current circumstances, including meeting a number of key technology milestones.&nbsp; Lost Kingdom of T’Sara users have generated, since late October 2022, almost 8 million Resource Pack NFTs for use inside of Aftermath Islands.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands is currently developing an Artificial Intelligence powered creator program, allowing users to perform Karaoke songs through their Avatars.&nbsp; Users can sing into a phone or web cam and the platform will take their facial gestures and head movement and using AI, map that to their Avatar, which can sing any one of over 10,000 licensed Karaoke songs.&nbsp; This program is expected to debut later this year and has already received interest from a number of major platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ten years ago, if you had said ‘Individuals should have control over their data’, it might have seemed controversial. Nowadays it’s commonly accepted. But as one door opens, another door closes. We need to be&nbsp;aware.</p><p>What people understand and mean by the word ‘control’ differs, and the consequences of these differences are far-reaching. One interpretation of ‘control’ could unleash a once-in-a-lifetime social and economic breakthrough. But there is another, very common understanding of what it means, and if pursued it could make our lives a lot worse. We need to look beyond glib slogans to understand their real&nbsp;content.</p> Two meanings of ‘control’ <p>Most people, when they think about issues relating to personal data, focus on how the world currently works. Quite understandably. But these workings are the product of a particular history that has resulted in today’s status quo. This history revolved around the organisation-centric database.</p><p>‘Organisation-centric database’ sounds like a bit of a mouthful but actually it’s very simple. Organisations collect and generate data about individuals and use this data to provide services. To do this they need a place to keep this data — in their systems: the organisation-centric database.</p><p>In this context, when people talk about individuals exerting more control over their data, they mean individuals having more control over what organisations can do with their personal data: what data they can collect, what they can use it for, who it is shared with, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>That’s great. But it is also very limited. It doesn’t, for example, actually allow individuals to collect and store their own data in their own databases and to use it for their own purposes. It’s like creating a personal mobility system where people can order taxis to take them places, but where they are not allowed to own their own&nbsp;cars.</p><p>It also creates a rather specific agenda. If people want to control the data that organisations have about them, they need to understand what this data is and what it is being used for. They also need to understand how to exert control via each different organisation’s own systems. For this agenda to work, people need to be ‘educated’ and ‘informed’ (for example, about the meaning and content of long and detailed terms of service and privacy policies). They need to invest the time and effort needed to get informed and to act on the conclusions of their investigations.</p><p>The net effect of this agenda is that it imposes new burdens on individuals, the implication being that if they are too ‘lazy’ to get themselves informed and to act on what they discover, then they deserve everything they get. People, we then get told, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/do-people-really-want-to-manage-their-data-bac784b98be1">don’t actually want to manage their&nbsp;data</a>.</p><p>In short, this organisation-centric form of control actually reaffirms the primacy of organisations in their role as the effective rulers of the data&nbsp;economy.</p> The person-centric view of the&nbsp;world <p>Under the person-centric view of the world, individuals are empowered to collect and use their own data for their own purposes, independently of any organisations that may be collecting data about them e.g. in their own personal data store. This personal data store holds their data safely, under the individuals’ complete control, outside of and beyond the systems of the organisations they have data relationships with.</p>Person-centred is a different design creating different outcomes<p>As the figure shows they can use this data however they wish (not just the purposes that the organisation wants to put it to). And they can share this data with whoever they wish (including other organisations wanting to use it to provide them with services).</p><p>Previously, we’ve talked in great detail about the immense economic benefits this approach to personal data creates. You can see what we said about this in our <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">White Paper</a> and in our special blog series on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/economics-of-personal-data/home">The Economics of Personal Data</a>. But for now, let’s just note that this approach creates a completely different action&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>Instead of demanding that individuals get themselves ‘educated’ and ‘informed’ it operates on the basis of safe by default (the data sharing agreements referred to in the illustration). When you share data with an organisation why shouldn’t you ‘just know’, because the necessary safeguards have already been built in to how things work, that the organisation will only collect the data it needs to provide the service in question, that it will only use this data to provide the agreed service, and that it won’t share this data with anybody not involved in delivering this&nbsp;service?</p><p>Requiring people to inspect privacy policies and terms and conditions before doing business with an organisation is akin to expecting them to do their own safety checks on a plane before embarking on it (after which it’s their own fault if anything goes&nbsp;wrong).</p><p>Also, instead of focusing on the mechanisms of how individuals should assert control within each organisation’s different systems, it focuses on providing them with the tools and infrastructure they need for independent control of their data, including a single dashboard by which they can change settings and permissions for every organisation they deal&nbsp;with.</p><p>In other words, the two different interpretations of control lead in entirely different directions. One interpretation reaffirms the primacy of the organisation as the power-holder in data relationships and places new burdens on individuals; the other empowers individuals via the provision of new personal data store infrastructure and makes their lives&nbsp;easier.</p> Two meanings of ‘individual as point of integration of their&nbsp;data’ <p>This chalk and cheese contrast between the two different interpretations of the word ‘control’ has other implications, potentially with even more damaging consequences.</p><p>There is now a growing movement of people and organisations (such as <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData Global</a>) that seek to give individuals more control over their data. One much discussed aspect of this is making individuals the point of integration of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s a great idea. Currently, data about us is dispersed across dozens — probably hundreds — of different organisations, each collecting a different set of details about us: about our money, our health, our activities online, what we buy, and so on. Just imagine what could be done with this data if it was all put into one place, to create a rounded picture of our lives! The potential benefits are enormous. But so are the potential dangers.</p><p>Under the first, organisation-centric interpretation of the word ‘control’, individuals are confined to exercising control over the data that organisations collect about them. The more data the organisation has, the more things it can do with this data, the more value it can add — or so the argument&nbsp;goes.</p><p>But on the other hand, the more data it has about you (that is, the more information about you that has been ‘integrated’ into one organisation’s database) the more intrusive it can become, and the more power it can exercise over&nbsp;you.</p><p>Currently, in Government and other circles, there is much discussion about the potential efficiency and other benefits of ‘more data sharing’ whereby more information about individuals can be ‘integrated’ into different organisations’ databases from multiple different sources.</p><p>These initiatives have an initial veneer of citizen ‘empowerment’ and ‘control’ because individuals have to ‘consent’ to these new agglomerations of data being created. But what they add up to is the further centralisation of data power in a few large organisations’ hands along with the risk of turbocharged invasions of privacy and abuses of data power. Current attempts to create Super MyAccount systems that aggregate data from many sources are an example of this. They are doing the exact opposite of what they pretend to&nbsp;do.</p><p>The alternative interpretation of individuals being the point of integration of their own data is where individuals are able to access all the data that is currently held about them in different organisations’ databases and to place this data in their own personal data store. This includes certified copies of data held by the organisation, copies that are kept up to date or just delivered and updated when&nbsp;changed.</p><p>This data is kept beyond the sight of or control of any organisation that collects data about them; where only the individual can see what the full personal database contains; and where individuals are in complete control of what they use this data for and who they share this data with. This is the approach which we at Mydex are operating and extending, initially the UK: a secure personal data exchange network that is safe, secure, consensual, distributed and resilient.</p><p>As our work on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> shows, this approach to making individuals the point of integration of their own data puts them in charge of, and in control of, the most valuable personal data asset in the world: a complete, rounded picture of the individual’s life — one that is independent of the organisations the individual deals with and that genuinely empowers that individual.</p><p>In doing so, it fundamentally alters the balance of power in the personal data economy, as individuals, rather than organisations, exercise distributed control of the economy’s most powerful data&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Once again, the two different interpretations of the same words couldn’t be more different.</p> Two meanings of ‘portability’ <p>The differences continue. It is now almost universally recognised that the unique characteristics of data — the fact that it doesn’t get ‘used up’ when used, and that many different users can therefore use the same bits of data for different uses — means that, to realise its full potential, it has to be shared. Improved data sharing is now a big and growing policy theme across all Governments.</p><p>But here again, the same fundamental differences in meaning and implication arise. Under the organisation-centric assumption — the assumption that data about individuals will always and only be held by organisations — ‘data sharing’ means data sharing between organisations, with data being passed from one organisation to another but never back to the individual. This is how Open Banking currently works, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>Such data sharing is supposed to be fine, because it only happens with the individual’s consent, so they are deemed to be ‘in control’. But what this approach actually does is a) disperse individuals’ data even further across even more organisations, making it even more difficult for individuals to exercise real control over this data and b) create the new points of data integration that increase the power of these organisations, as just discussed.</p><p>The second, person-centric interpretation of data portability / sharing takes us in exactly the opposite direction. Here, data sharing means organisations that have collected data about individuals sharesi this data with the individuals that this data relates to. By doing this it puts the individual at the heart of the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This sort of data sharing genuinely empowers individuals, making them the point at which data about them is integrated. But the implications reach much further than this, because in doing so, it transforms the structure of the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Currently, our data economy is organised around a long series of separate parallel data silos, each of them collecting data about the individual, each of them doing their own thing. Genuinely empowering, person-centric data sharing transforms this structure by adding individuals to its workings, making each individual an independent data sharing node within a broader data sharing&nbsp;network.</p><p>Imagine the existing data ecosystem as a redwood forest full of giant trees soaring separately and in parallel into the sky, each of them doing its own separate thing. With citizen-empowering data sharing, individuals are made into a sort of mycelial network within the soil that supports these trees, feeding nutrients and information to each other and with other trees to create a new vibrant, interconnected ecosystem.</p><p>Once again, the two meanings of the same words couldn’t be more different.</p> Two meanings of ‘interoperability’ <p>But we haven’t finished yet because the differences continue. For data sharing / data portability to work, different parties’ data systems (their software, formats, standards etc) need to be able to ‘talk’ to each other. They need to be interoperable.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: In the UK we do dates with the day first, the month second, and the year third. So 02.09.2023 means the second of September 2023. But the Americans do the day and the month the other way round, so that 02.09.2023 means the ninth of February 2023. If there isn’t a way to ‘translate’ from one format to the other chaos will&nbsp;ensue.</p><p>But here’s the thing. Under the organisation-centric interpretation of control, of individual as the point of control of data portability, the more individuals’ data is dispersed across many different organisations the more barriers to interoperability rise.</p><p>In fact, direct organisation-to-organisation data sharing generates a complexity catastrophe as it scales, as each organisation has to find ways to interoperate with the systems, formats and standards of every other organisation. The diagram below explains the simple maths behind this: if every node in a network is going to connect to every other node, each time you add a new node, the number of connections that are needed multiplied exponentially. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">This blog</a> provides chapter and&nbsp;verse.</p>Why organisation-to-organisation data sharing creates a complexity catastrophe<p>This complexity catastrophe is avoided if, aided by their personal data stores, individuals become the hubs by which data about themselves is shared. Now the only entity that organisations have to deal with in terms of data sharing is their own existing customers, via their&nbsp;PDS.</p><p>In this person-centric approach to data sharing, it is not the job of existing data holding controllers to deliver interoperability. It is the job of the personal data store operator to manage the interoperability challenges that arise from different organisations sharing their data with individuals. Far from imposing huge, added risks and costs on organisations, it greatly simplifies their lives while adding immense benefits to the individuals receiving this&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data stores can undertake this interoperability challenge very efficiently because once they have solved the problem of translating one format or software system to another, this solution can be applied — automated — every time such a translation needs to be made. This make-once-use-many times approach to interoperability is order-of-magnitude times more efficient than the immense duplication of effort that is required for direct organisation-to-organisation data&nbsp;sharing.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are old enough, you may remember the early days of social media when, it was commonly claimed, peer-to-peer information sharing would change the world. News would flow instantaneously across borders empowering people with ideas and knowledge and that would spread democracy and bring down hierarchies, tyrannies, the&nbsp;lot.</p><p>Then came Cambridge Analytica-style manipulation of information feeds, fake news, hate speech and trolling. The new utopia was gamed out of existence by those who saw an opportunity to turn it into its opposite.</p><p>Today, there is near universal agreement that individuals should have ‘control’ over their personal data and many well-meaning people are working hard to make this happen. That’s great. But it needs to be done in the right way. We need to think through the how and the why, and be wary of unintended consequences. We need to avoid glib but counterproductive solutions.</p><p>Beware of what you wish for is age-old advice. But in this case, this advice is as fresh and relevant as ever. We do not want to perpetuate the mistakes of the past as we solve the future today. To avoid remaking old mistakes, clarity on terminology and meaning is&nbsp;vital.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-what-you-wish-for-e59dd1975f79">Beware what you wish for!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council recently updated their Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for protecting payment card data. The latest version, <a href="https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf">PCI DSS 4.0</a>, introduces more than 60 new or updated requirements, with new directives around passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) among the most consequential.</p> 
 What is PCI DSS 4.0?  
<p>First introduced in 2004, the PCI DSS guidelines apply to any organization that stores, processes or transmits cardholder data. To demonstrate PCI DSS compliance, organizations undergo assessment on all systems that interact with the cardholder environment.</p> 
<p>In March 2022, the Council announced PCI DSS version 4.0, providing guidelines that aim to better secure account holder and payment card data within today’s evolving cyberthreat landscape. The current reigning version, PCI DSS 3.2.1, will be officially deprecated in March 2024, and organizations will be required to implement the PCI DSS 4.0 guidelines in a phased manner over twelve months.</p> 
<p>While version 4.0 contains updates across the board, some of the most significant relate to strong authentication requirements, specifically password usage and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Weak forms of authentication leave organizations and data vulnerable to brute force attacks, credential phishing and multiple other <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">password-related attacks</a>. Understanding these new requirements is key for PCI DSS compliance. We look at five critical areas as well as their potential impact for your business.</p> 
 1. PCI DSS 4.0 Password Requirements  
<p>One of the biggest changes in PCI DSS version 4 is the very strict specifications regarding passwords. PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements (sections 8.3.4-8.3.9) include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Passwords must be long and complex: Under PCI DSS 4.0 requirements, passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters&nbsp;  
  Passwords must be reset every 90 days and cannot be reused: An exception is made if continuous, risk-based authentication is used, where the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access automatically determined accordingly.  
  Login attempts should be limited: According to PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements, after a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users should be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means.  
  
 Potential impact of the PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements  
<p>Longer passwords are more onerous for users and are more likely to be written down or insecurely saved in files on a device. Forced updates also tend to trigger unsafe user behaviors as people often make only minor changes that hackers are likely to guess. Moreover, all these requirements are likely to result in higher help desk calls. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">Recent research from Forrester and HYPR</a> shows that the average help desk call costs organizations $42.50/call.</p> 
 2. MFA Required for All Access to the CDE  
<p>Under PCI DSS 3.2.1 guidelines, MFA was required only for administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE). Under the new PCI DSS MFA rules (8.4.2), all access to the CDE must be gated by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>. The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers and endpoints.</p> 
<p>Multi-factor authentication is defined as using two independent factors from the categories:</p> 
  
  Something you know, such as a password or passphrase.&nbsp;  
  Something you have, such as a token device or smart card.&nbsp;  
  &nbsp;Something you are, such as a biometric element&nbsp;  
  
<p>In its guidance on authentication factors, Version 4.0 specifically says to look at <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/benefits-of-fido-authentication">FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)</a> for the use of&nbsp; tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as authentication factors. While it stops short of requiring FIDO-based factors, some of its other guidance, as you will see below, points to a clear preference.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>The new regulations make clear that multi-factor authentication must be used every time the CDE is accessed, even if a user already used MFA to authenticate into the network under the remote access requirements (see below). This will add significant friction for workers, with potential consequences for both productivity and employee satisfaction. Moreover, most organizations, even if they already use some form of MFA, do not have the correct technology or systems to address the requirement for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktops</a>, workstations and servers.</p> 
 3. PCI DSS Now Requires MFA for All Remote Access  
<p>Previously, MFA was required for remote access to the cardholder data environment. With this updated PCI DSS MFA guidance, anyone logging in from outside your secured network perimeter, even if they are not actually accessing the CDE, must use multi-factor authentication. This includes all employees, both users and administrators, and all third parties and vendors. This also means that any web-based access must use MFA, even if used by employees on site.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>Effectively this means that all of your workforce that are remote, hybrid or have supporting roles outside the organization must use MFA at all times. It also means that any employee using a web-based application to access your networks and systems must use MFA, even if they are on site. In addition to the cost and IT burden of implementing MFA, cumbersome MFA procedures can negatively impact both employee productivity and satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 4. PCI DSS MFA Configuration Requirements  
<p>The new standard doesn’t just cover who must use MFA and when, it also introduces guidelines on how MFA systems must be configured to prevent misuse. Many traditional MFA solutions are susceptible to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, push bombing and other attacks that bypass MFA controls. Requirement 8.5 specifies weaknesses and misconfigurations to assess for PCI compliance. These include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Your MFA system must not be susceptible to replay (aka man-in-the-middle) attacks.  
  MFA must not be able to be bypassed unless a specific exception is documented and authorized by management  
  Your MFA solution must use two different and independent factors for authentication  
  Access cannot be granted until all authentication factors are successful  
  
<p>As discussed earlier, the PCI DSS guidance on types of authentication factors makes reference to FIDO-based authentication. FIDO authentication is phishing-resistant, eliminates replay attacks and, depending on the FIDO solution, is inherently multi-factor.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your MFA solution uses SMS, OTPs or other insecure methods, it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 5. Strong Cryptographic Protocols  
<p>While earlier versions of PCI DSS required the use of strong cryptographic protocols to protect transactions and cardholder data, PCI DSS 4.0 extends the cryptographic requirement. With the new rules, any stored sensitive authentication data (SAD) must be encrypted using strong cryptography.&nbsp;</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your authentication system doesn’t properly encrypt and securely store authentication data, then it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 Meet PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance With HYPR  
<p>The new PCI DSS framework now aligns much more closely with the NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines, guidance from CISA and the OMB, and other regulatory agencies that urge the adoption of FIDO-based phishing-resistant MFA and a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> approach.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-pci-dss-compliance">HYPR helps organizations comply with PCI DSS</a> MFA requirements as well as multiple other provisions included in the standard. HYPR replaces the traditional password-based approach with secure passwordless authentication that is certified by FIDO and based on passkeys. Core elements of the solution, such as the incorporation of biometric authentication, possession of a trusted device, and cryptographic tokens securely stored on the device TPM or secure enclave, ensure strong, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication that meets PCI DSS requirements.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;At the same time, HYPR greatly improves the user experience, eliminating the need for long, complex passwords and streamlining multi-factor authentication to a single user gesture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For disaster-prone areas, fragile connectivity remains a major problem, often going offline in critical moments.&nbsp;Aerospace enterprises face a similar challenge when trying to run consistent high-altitude connectivity while operating in remote locations, which can also be very expensive. This is where <a href="https://www.project-owl.com/">Project OWL</a> comes into play: developing new technologies to help address these challenges.</p>



<p>Formed in 2018 to compete in the inaugural <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/">Call for Code</a> Global Challenge — which it won — Project OWL is a global team of entrepreneurs focused on creating radically cost-effective and easy to use aerospace technologies. In June, we took a major step in our journey by conducting a series of air bound tests dubbed “SpaceDucks 3” in San Luis Obispo, CA. We’re pleased to report that we successfully launched six balloons, including a group of five mesh SpaceDucks at one time.</p>



<p>We believe these balloons can make a difference during a natural disaster situation (e.g., an earthquake, hurricane or wildfire), and when we can deploy our technology to the skies and even space. This makes it easier to connect to the communities that have been devastated by disaster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our sensors are designed to be less susceptible to being destroyed as they sit far beyond the reach of hurricanes, wildfires and earthquakes. This enables them to provide more complete, global connectivity and reduces the risk of being destroyed by all the bad things that happen here on earth’s surface.</p>



 How SpaceDucks 3 enables the future of disaster connectivity 



<p>There are huge markets for aerospace technology, not to mention the societal impact we can make providing remote or disaster-struck regions with basic, low cost, simple communications when it is needed most. We are developing solutions that we believe can have a wide-ranging commercial and defense-focused impact on the world.</p>



<p>Collaboration was key during our mission. We were accompanied by a full <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly</a> Research team who assisted in the launch. We also worked with students from <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/">The University of Texas at Dallas</a>, and received support through our partnership with <a href="https://www.rtx.com/">Raytheon Technologies</a>. OWL has <a href="https://www.af.mil/">U.S. Air Force</a> to thank as part of the R&amp;D funding as well.</p>



<p>We successfully completed our primary goal of establishing network links from the ground to our air-bound SpaceDuck sensor, and back down to a separate ground station. We covered 60 miles of total distance at 90,000 feet altitude. In fact, one of OWL’s SpaceDucks, TARAQUR-1, broke our previous altitude record and reached 91,863.5 feet.</p>



<p>IBM and the Call for Code team have been key to fueling our company’s growth through funding, the support of technical team members and countless resources over the years. We have been collaborating with IBM to use the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-speech-embed-libraries">IBM Watson Text to Speech Library for Embed</a>. OWL used a cloud-based analytics dashboard, powered by IBM Watson, to intuitively observe and communicate with the balloons while air-bound. The AI-powered chatbot was able to read out the status of the balloons throughout the three-hour flights and keep our team informed.</p>



 OWL’s unique technical solution and problem-solving approach 



<p>Comms equipment that is lightweight, easy to use and radically cost effective are all characteristics needed during natural disasters. OWL can help enterprises control their applications with a resilient network floating above our heads.</p>



<p>During our test, we proved 915mhz LoRa communications at high altitude on atmospheric weather balloons.&nbsp;While doing so, we collected a variety of sensor data — including temperature, pressure, altitude, humidity and accelerometers — and visual media for analysis and publication.</p>



 Follow along with OWL’s test and journey 



<p>The <a href="https://medium.com/project-owl/from-whimsical-beginnings-to-soaring-heights-the-power-of-relationships-in-owls-journey-b93ae50dc0e2">growth</a> of the team across OWL and our partners working on SpaceDucks has been sensational.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future, our technology could help you message a loved one in a disaster scenario when other networks are down. We are now one step closer to making that vision a reality. We hope you’ll join us. </p>

<p>While there’s never been doubt about the importance of digital security, over the last few years it seems to have garnered a lot more attention – specifically by governments across the globe. That’s no surprise given some of the issues being looked at such as the growth of connected devices and services in the IoT space, for example. But one area that is seeing an increase in calls to action these days is mitigating the threat quantum computers will pose to traditional public key cryptography in use today.</p>
<p>Late last year, we saw an abundance of specific direction coming out of the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/how-government-action-is-providing-a-blueprint-for-post-quantum-preparedness/">United States</a>. This direction came in the form of the NSA releasing the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/the-nsa-releases-a-post-quantum-preparedness-timeline-that-begins-immediately/">CNSA 2.0 Timeline</a>, which outlined the timeline for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The timeline spans several years and acknowledges the need to plan and budget for the transition, but it also states that – at least for software and firmware signing – the transition needs to begin immediately. Further, the White House issued not one, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf">but two</a> clear calls to action for government agencies to begin preparing for the quantum threat by designating a lead for collecting cryptographic information systems by December 2022, and then they must have also performed a cryptographic inventory by May 4, 2023.</p>
<p>But attention around the quantum threat and the need to migrate to post-quantum cryptography isn’t limited to the United States. This is a global issue, and as such, has garnered global attention. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 The General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands very recently <a href="https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2023/04/04/the-pqc-migration-handbook">released a handbook</a> that advises all organization to start preparing for the quantum threat now, and it also provides some clear steps to begin on that journey. 
 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) produced a <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/post-quantum-cryptography-current-state-and-quantum-mitigation">report</a> that outlines what organizations can implement now to ensure their data remains secure, including the strategy of choosing a hybrid implementation, which would mix traditional cryptography with quantum-safe cryptography. 
 The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany published its own <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Brochure/quantum-safe-cryptography.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">guide</a> with the intent of outlining the threat, demystifying PQC, and making recommendations on how to prepare. 
 The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) in France has a <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2022/01/anssi-technical_position_papers-post_quantum_cryptography_transition.pdf">position paper</a>. The paper expresses France’s views on the quantum threat – including that the threat should be considered today to address the current threat of “harvest now, decrypt later,” where sensitive data is being collected by bad actors today, with the intent of decrypting it once a quantum computer is capable. 
 
<p>One thing all the above countries and more (such as Canada, the UK, and Australia) have in common is everyone is awaiting the results of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) competition and the subsequent standards. NIST kicked off a post-quantum cryptography competition, announced the first set of winners in the summer of 2022, and is expected to release draft standards any day now. Although a few European countries have been looking at other algorithms, that’s merely to have options on top of what NIST recommends. A recent <a href="https://www.epc.eu/content/PDF/2023/Cybersecurity_DP.pdf">discussion paper</a> out of the European Policy Centre drives home the importance of a coordinated European action plan, but really this needs to be a global coordination to avoid fractured standards. NIST is seen as the gold standard for independent, open, and transparent competitions, so ideally once NIST comes out with its final recommendations, that will result in international standards and adoption.</p>

<p>Creating a strong and trusted organisational identity is fundamental to secure and efficient business. A highly assured organisational identity can help to differentiate an organisation from its competitors by presenting a verified, recognisable touchpoint that builds trust in your interactions. This blog explores the value of a highly assured organisational identity, as discussed by Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, when he joined Michael Becker of Identity Praxis and Randy Warshaw of Provenant at the recent Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF) event in London:</p>
<p></p>
 Organisation Identity builds trust and opens up efficiencies 
<p>In a previous blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/corporate-identities-trustworthy/" title="Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy">Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy</a>, we considered how a lack of trust can impact an organisation, and also the true cost of organisational misrepresentation. There are many examples of the negative impact caused by bad actors faking an organisation identity. For example, the infamous case involving a fake Eli Lilly Twitter account declaring free insulin, which caused a $15b fall in the company’s market cap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Utilising strong organisation identity helps avoid these kinds of misrepresentations.</p>
<p>Embracing organisation identity also has a positive impact on an organisation’s bottom line. This is highlighted in the case of the Finnish Government where Ubisecure provided the Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) solution that connected the Finnish business registry (containing the organisation identities) with verified individual identities. The solution allowed individuals to assert their legitimate representation of their organisation, or delegate digital representation onwards to other organisations or individuals, such as external accountants or payroll providers. Tax filing transactions could then be automated, resulting in 99% cost reductions over the traditional in-person approach. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="See the case study">See the case study</a>.</p>
 <p>Delegation Tree Example</p> 
 The Legal Entity Identifier is the most compelling Organisation Identity 
<p>There are a number of Organisation Identifiers available today (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/comparing-organisation-identifiers/" title="read more about the comparisons">read more about the comparisons</a>). Some are regional, some vertical, some closed to the public… but only one is truly global, standardised and trustworthy to be the one Organisation Identity on which we base all future identity services – and that is the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).</p>
<p>There is considerable value in combining Organisation Identity (via the LEI), verified Individual Identities (via BankID, eIDs and other initiatives), and delegation capabilities (via IAM services). The combination enables businesses to express:</p>

<p>The DI (or self-sovereign identity) industry is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">predicted</a> to explode in value from USD 0.65 billion in 2022 to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decentralized-identity-market-worth-102-130000466.html">USD 102.0 billion</a> by 2030, and Forbes recently listed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">50 smart companies</a> investing in blockchain (beyond crypto) to make their businesses operate better, faster or cheaper. Blockchain is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">“anchor of trust”</a> for DI.</p>



<p>The leading DI solution anchored in blockchain is a fully user-controlled <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">digital identity wallet</a>, in which the user accepts, securely stores, and shares <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">digital identity and other verified documents</a> to prove their identity or credentials with services.</p>



<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_14zTBLJ_Y">short video</a> about the new European digital identity wallet as an example.</p>



<p>Digital wallets and other DI applications can deliver immediate business value from:</p>



 
 new revenue opportunities (e.g. a customer wallet offering) 



 cost saving opportunities (e.g. replacing inefficient processes) 



 solving common business problems (e.g. easing the regulatory compliance burden). 
 



<p>Read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a>.</p>



 DI has the potential to benefit all industries and sectors. Here are 17 industries that can leverage Decentralized identity technology right now: 



<p></p>



  
 1. Banking and finance:  



<p>DI has massive application in this industry, including for customer-controlled onboarding, consent and data management; streamlined AML and KYC processes; secure and tamper-proof authentication, including for cross-border transactions; and fraud prevention. The <a href="https://www.itsme-id.com/en-BE">itsme</a> app in Europe, built by Belgium Mobile ID, a large consortium of Belgium’s leading banks and mobile network operators, is a great example.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 2. Healthcare:  



<p>COVID-19 accelerated the already real need for secure and private interoperable e-health. Scope for DI applications includes in secure patient identity management; secure and standardized health information exchange, data privacy and consent management; better clinical trial recruitment and data integrity and transparency; simpler medical credentialing and licensing; and more efficient health insurance processes, including claims processing. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9907408/">US</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/nhs-digital-staff-passport">UK</a>, and other jurisdictions are well ahead this work.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 3. Farming and mining:  



<p>Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. These two industries generate significant greenhouse gas, and must therefore regularly submit greenhouse gas emission reports to government agencies. Cost of compliance to regulation can be significant, especially when dealing with multiple government agencies. DI-based <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a> are a very promising solution for compliance regulation, and are already used in a number of regulatory environments including <a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance New Zealand</a> and the <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">Energy Mines and Digital Trust project</a> in British Columbia.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 4. Government and public administration:  



<p>Governments are one of the pioneers of secure and portable digital identities for identity verification and KYC processes for functions such as issuing official documents, accessing public services, or conducting financial transactions. DI is also applicable for border control and travel processes using digital passports and travel credentials; managing public health initiatives and crises including vaccinations; more efficient financial inclusion and aid distribution; and secure and interoperable data sharing. This <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">article</a> lists many examples of government digital ID at various stages of implementation, including the United Nations (UN) and World Bank&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/">ID4D</a>&nbsp;initiative which aims to provide everyone on the planet with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/inspired/legal-identity">legal identity</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 5. Education:  



<p>Another of the most common early use cases for DI is education. DI offers a secure and tamper-proof way to issue and manage digital credentials and certificates and to authenticate identities for online learning in the education sector. Institutions can issue diplomas, degrees, or certificates as <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>, which students and alumni can easily share with employers, other educational institutions, or credential verification services. DI also simplifies the hiring process, promotes trust, boosts cross-institutional research, reduces administrative burdens, simplifies consent management, and limits fraud risk. Read this <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2022/4/self-sovereign-identity-user-scenarios-in-the-educational-domain">deep dive</a> on developments and benefits to date.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 6. Travel and hospitality:  



<p>This is a booming use case thanks partly to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re already seeing applications of DI to streamline traveller verification processes, such as airport security checks and immigration procedures as well as hotel check-ins, to bolster security, free up resources and ease congestion. Travelers store data and biometrics as a digital travel credential on a device or in the cloud. The idea is to create a single sign-on experience for travellers for a seamless journey across all different aspects of travel. There are already around <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">1.2 billion ePassports</a> in use worldwide and smart borders are progressing rapidly. And check out the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">Aruba Happy One Pass (Aruba HOP) app</a> which allows an air traveler to create a digital travel credential (DTC) from their passport, and is a collab between Indicio, SITA and Aruba.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 7. Identity and access management (IAM):  



<p>This is a foundational area for DI and you can read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">Innovating Identity and Access Management with Decentralized Identity</a>. DI transforms IAM systems by providing people with their digital IDs and credentials, to improve authentication processes, and simplify user access across different platforms and services.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 8. Supply chain and logistics:  



<p>DI can deliver reliable product authentication, verification, transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain; streamline the process of verifying supplier identities and credentials; enable secure data sharing and collaboration; limit counterfeiting; streamline customs and border control processes to reduce paperwork and fraud and speed up customs clearance procedures; aid compliance; and support financing, insurance, and recall processes.</p>



<p></p>

 Introduction 
<p>Businesses today are at a crossroads of limitless prospects and invisible obstacles like fraud and money laundering as they navigate the exciting but treacherous seas of digital innovation and global development. Step into the protective embrace of Know Your Business (KYB), a pivotal rudder for the ship of contemporary business. We invite you to join us in this illuminating investigation of know-your-customer (KYC) checks as we reveal their critical function, regulatory insight, and the promising future of this important field.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
<blockquote><p>Risk Management: Implementing rigorous KYB checks can help businesses identify potential risks and avoid financial crimes, legal issues, and damaged reputations. It’s an essential step, not an option.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Tailoring to Regulatory Landscape: KYB requirements vary across regions and industries. Therefore, businesses must tailor their KYB strategies to unique legal and compliance needs, especially when planning global expansion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Leverage Technology for Efficiency: AI, blockchain, and big data analytics can automate and streamline KYB checks, making them more efficient, accurate, and comprehensive. Businesses should explore these technologies to stay ahead in the competitive market.
</p></blockquote>
 What is Know Your Business? 
<p>Know Your Business (KYB) is a compliance and risk management process that businesses undertake to verify the identity of beneficial owners and assess the risk profile of their business partners. This process includes checks on business registration, licenses, physical address, source of funds, and other vital components. KYB helps businesses mitigate financial and legal risks, comply with international regulations, and foster stronger business relationships.</p>
 Benefits and Outcomes of Rigorous KYB Checks 
<p>Implementing robust KYB checks can lead to numerous benefits:</p>
 
 Risk Mitigation: KYB checks help identify and avoid potential risks related to fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. They safeguard the company’s reputation and profits from potential financial losses and legal consequences. 
 Regulatory Compliance and Penalty Avoidance: KYB checks ensure businesses comply with relevant legal requirements, thereby avoiding non-compliance penalties. 
 Strengthened Business Relationships: Thorough KYB checks build transparency in our business relationship relationships, which fosters trust and supports these relationships. 
 Protection of Business Reputation: By avoiding associations with fraudulent or corrupt businesses and financial institutions, companies can protect their reputation, an invaluable asset in today’s competitive business landscape. 
 
 Understanding the Regulatory Landscape for KYB Checks  
<p>Compliance with KYB checks by shell companies and financial institutions isn’t just a strategic business decision but is necessitated by numerous regulations worldwide. Several anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures, such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the European Union’s 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, clearly mandate rigorous KYB checks. Businesses that fail to comply with these legal requirements may face significant consequences, including monetary fines, revocation of business licenses, and even imprisonment of involved officials.</p>
<p>However, the regulatory landscape for KYB needs to be more monolithic. It varies across regions, unregulated industries, and jurisdictions, each with specific rules and nuances. This variability necessitates businesses to understand and effectively tailor their KYB strategies to each region’s unique legal and compliance requirements. This becomes increasingly crucial for multinational corporations and those seeking global expansion.</p>
 The History of Know Your Business Regulation 
<p>The concept of KYB originated from the broader regulatory landscape of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations, which began to gain prominence in the late 20th century.</p>
<p>This came as a response to growing concerns about the misuse of the global financial system for illicit activities. Over time, these regulations evolved, and the need for businesses to ‘know’ their customers and other companies became clear. This resulted in the Know Your Customer (KYC) and, subsequently, the KYB regulations aimed to verify the identity of individuals and businesses involved in financial transactions.</p>
 Detailed Breakdown of KYB Check Components 
<p>A thorough KYB check comprises a detailed investigation into several key components, which form the bedrock of comprehensive customer due diligence:</p>
 
 Business registration or license verification is a fundamental step in a KYB check. It involves validating the legality and legitimacy of business activities of a business entity by examining its business registration status or other licensing documentation. This step helps confirm that you are dealing with a legitimate, legally recognized business and not a fraudulent entity. 
 Physical address verification: Verifying a business’ beneficial owner’s declared physical address adds security. It ensures that the business exists beyond mere paperwork and isn’t a shell company. Thus the bank secrecy acts minimize the risk of fraudulent partnerships. 
 Phone number verification involves validating the official phone numbers registered under a business’ beneficial owner’s name. While it may appear as a straightforward check, it is crucial to affirm the business’ beneficial ownership and the legitimacy of the owner and business relationship. 
 Source of funds investigation: To ensure that the ultimate beneficial owners of a business aren’t involved in any illegal financial activities such as money laundering or financing terrorism, it’s vital to investigate its sources of funds. It provides insights into a company’s financial integrity, beneficial owner’s reputation, business partner, or financial institution. 
 Business risk analysis based on location: Geographical location can significantly impact a business’s risk profile and due diligence further. A company operating in a region known for high corruption levels or financial crime rates may pose a higher risk, and additional due diligence requirements may be required. 
 
 Know Your Business Checks During Onboarding 
<p>During the onboarding business, KYB checks serve as a critical first line of defense against fraudulent associations. After initial business registration and verification, detailed KYB checks are performed. These checks include verifying the onboarding business customers’ physical addresses, official phone numbers, and sources of funds.</p>
<p>The collected information is then cross-referenced for validation. Based on this verified data, a risk assessment is conducted to gauge the potential risk associated with the prospective business partner. The entire business onboarding process becomes a crucial phase where rigorous KYB checks are pivotal.</p>
 The KYB Process: A Technical Walkthrough 
<p>Successfully conducting KYB checks involves following a strategic, step-by-step process:</p>
 
 Initial research and data gathering: This first stage involves the meticulous collection of detailed information about the business. This includes legal name, physical address, contact information, and information about corrupt business owners and key management personnel. 
 Verification of provided business information: The second stage involves validating the collected information. This is typically achieved by cross-referencing the data with reliable sources, such as government databases, financial institutions, or trusted third-party data providers. 
 Risk assessment: Once the data has been verified, models are applied. These models consider various factors, including the business or customer’s identity, location, industry, financial health, and management. The resulting risk profile can guide subsequent decision-making regarding potential partnerships or collaborations. 
 
<p>Ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment: KYB isn’t a one-off process. Businesses must establish procedures for regularly and continuously monitoring and reassessing business compliance with their partners. This ongoing scrutiny ensures timely identification and management of changes in a business relationship’s status or risk profile.</p>
 Automating Your KYB Checks 
<p>Technological advancements have introduced novel approaches to KYB checks, enhancing their efficacy and scope:</p>
 
 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: These technologies can automate data collection, the verification process, and risk assessment, making KYB checks more efficient and accurate. They can also learn from patterns and improve their predictive accuracy over time. 
 Blockchain Technology: Blockchain provides a decentralized, transparent, and immutable ledger, offering a trustworthy platform for data validation and electronic identity verification. It aids in enhancing the security and reliability of verification processes. 
 Big Data Analytics: Leveraging big data can help businesses perform more comprehensive KYB checks. It allows for analyzing massive data sets, helping to identify patterns and insights that more straightforward checks might overlook. 
 
 Best Practices and Industry Standards in KYB Checks 
<p>To derive maximum benefits from KYB checks, it’s essential to adhere to industry best practices:</p>
 
 Reliable and vetted resources for data verification: Businesses should ensure that the data they use for KYB checks maintain compliance and is sourced from reliable and vetted resources. 
 Automation and digital tools: Automation can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of KYB checks for business entities. Businesses should leverage digital tools for data collection, verification, and risk assessment. 
 Regular updates and reassessments: Since businesses continually evolve, KYB checks should not be a one-time activity. Regular updates and reassessments are necessary to maintain an accurate understanding of the legal status of business partners. 
 Consulting with legal or regulatory experts: Considering the complexity of foreign transactions, other regulations, and the regulatory landscape, it can be helpful to consult with legal or regulatory experts when designing and implementing KYB checks for cash transactions. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Wrapping up, KYB checks are vital, providing defense against financial misconduct and fostering transparent business relationships. As the world embraces digital transformation and global expansion, KYB checks are becoming central to operations. The horizon for KYB checks looks promising, with technologies like AI, blockchain, and big data analytics paving the way for efficient, insightful screenings.</p>

   Learn about three AM initiatives topping IT project lists 
	<p>Access management is the front door to your organization, network, and applications and services. "Must have" initiatives that rely on access management (AM) are now on nearly every organization's IT priority list. But to get the most from these initiatives, it is essential to have the right AM solution and components in place. (Read how <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-overall-leader-access-management">KuppingerCole</a> rated ForgeRock Access Management in its 2023 Leadership Compass report.)</p>
	
	<p>In this post, we'll cover the three areas where access management is set to transform and grow in influence for users both inside and outside your organization.</p>
	
	
	 1. Passwordless Authentication is Making the Password History 
	
	<p>For years — for generations! — the user-selected password has held sway over the login experience. Alternative solutions have come along, like multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens and biometrics, but they often proved clunky, expensive, and less-than user-friendly. Market acceptance of these purpose-built devices never reached more than 30% of internal users, and consumers were often left with only weak two-factor authentication using passcodes sent via SMS (text messages).</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> — the act of logging in without a password — is based on industry standards, including FIDO2, WebAuthn, and SAML, so you're not staking your career on an unproven protocol. From a high-level perspective, passwordless moves us away from a world where it's necessary to store and protect a huge centralized password database, a magnet for malicious actors. In the passwordless world, an individual generates asymmetric cryptography key pairs and stores the private keys on a mobile device or browser. The attack surface is reduced and user satisfaction skyrockets as people can use familiar devices and the convenience of biometrics to log in to their applications.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Here's where it is essential to get access management right. There are two audiences for passwordless authentication: your consumers and your internal users. For consumers, replicating the experience they have with their mobile devices or browsers is a no-brainer — you can just use FIDO2. Where things get challenging is doing the same thing for your internal users on desktops, workstations, VPNs, mainframes, VDIs…and so on. Your access management solution needs to be able to handle all of it. Approaching your passwordless project with consumer and workforce users in mind will help ensure that you've got it right.</p>
	
	
	 2. Orchestration, Maestro! 
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-orchestration">Identity orchestration</a> is the creation of dynamic login journeys for users — those that minimize friction while maintaining high security. In other words, journeys get people where they need to go, quickly and securely. In the past, all users had essentially the same login experience. These login pathways were hard-coded by developers over weeks and months and were rarely changed.</p>
	
	<p>But times have changed and now a single login pathway no longer works for everyone. Users need different enrollment options, anti-fraud checks, identity-proofing for new users, MFA enrollment, and more. Scenarios vary by whether it is an end-user customer logging in or an internal employee. Some large enterprises have hundreds of journeys designed to support their various applications and use cases they run.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>A strong AM solution includes a graphical orchestration engine that has a drag-and-drop interface so the components listed above — the identity-proofing, anti-fraud, MFA, etc. — can be dropped in, moved around, and adjusted as needed.</p>
	
	<p>One user journey can be copied, tweaked, and set up as another journey to support a different set of users. Risk assessment can be made dynamically and in real time as signals from a user's device or location are shared with the orchestration engine, enabling access decisions that allow/block the request or require supplemental authentication. When the threat environment changes, even non-technical, non-IT people, like application owners, can be authorized to make changes to their user journeys, taking the burden off IT.</p>
	
	 3. Decentralized Identity and the Digital Wallet 
	
	<p>While they are two technically separate concepts, decentralized identity and the digital wallet (DI/DW) are inextricably joined in both usage and technology (the mobile phone), where they reside.</p>
	
	<p>The concept of decentralized identity is this: since the beginning of time, if you wanted to gain access to a website or application, you had to provide information about who you are, usually in a cumbersome form-fill, to the identity provider (IdP). The IdP represents the organization (bank, corporation, healthcare entity, government entity) that owns the digital asset you want to access. This identity information usually includes your email, mobile phone number, name, address, password, but can also include myriad other items such as preferences and personalizations. The IdP acts as the central repository for this information, abiding by applicable regional privacy laws — some do this better than others.</p>
	
	<p>With decentralized identity, individual users take back control and can decide how much or how little identity-related information to share from the safety of their mobile phone's secure vault. The digital wallet concept follows the same contours with the user being able to authorize payment directly from their mobile device.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Organizations are looking for ways to accommodate digital users with DI/DW to help them facilitate lightning-fast transactions and reduce abandoned shopping carts that result from burdensome account signups. At first glance, it would appear that DI/DW solutions would have less need for access management than traditional "centralized" identity approaches, but that's not so.</p>
	
	<p>The traditional functions of access (who gets in) and authorization (what they get to do) are every bit in play with DI/DW, and may be more important than ever. They help ensure that enough identity information is received to be able to enact a transaction, that enough know-you-customer (KYC) data is shared, that the user is still logging in with appropriate passwordless MFA, and that authentication is still logged for audit purposes. AM even plays a role in ensuring that user access and authorizations are revoked in a timely manner.</p>
	
	<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">ForgeRock Access Management</a> solution — part of the ForgeRock Identity Platform — helps organizations achieve passwordless authentication, create and drive seamless user journeys through orchestration, and supports organizations accommodating decentralized identity and digital wallet users.</p>

<p>It's been just over either months since OpenAI released ChatGPT, and already the new platform has become a household name. With artificial intelligence (AI) being one of the hottest topics in the world today, everyone from techies to the layperson is taking notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ai-statistics/">Forbes</a>, “Over 75% of consumers are concerned about misinformation from AI.” While this new technology doubtlessly has exciting potential, it also poses new cybersecurity risks. For reasons such as this, the US Senate is getting started on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/tech/senate-ai-plan/index.html">new legislation</a> that specifically regulates the use of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adapting to the challenges posed by AI in identity and access management is crucial. As security professionals, we know that we can’t protect against everything. Long ago, Ping Identity learned that as soon as we detect what bad actors are doing, they find a novel way to circumvent detection methods. Today, we are just beginning to see how advanced machine learning is being used to penetrate established authentication methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there will be challenges ahead, it’s evident that Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR) and Decentralized Identity (DCI) can be used in conjunction with one another to combat security threats in the age of AI.</p>

 What is Fund Ring? <p>Fund Ring is a Web3 funding primitive that seeks to help Filecoin and IPFS-connected open source projects get long-term support for maintenance, security, and feature updates with monthly or annual funding. </p><blockquote>When you join Fund Ring as a supporter or a maintainer, you join a broad community of FLOSS projects. It’s like a good ol’ fashioned web ring for funding projects you rely on.</blockquote><p>Supporters can contribute to Fund Ring projects by selecting <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">"Fund the Ring" in the app</a> and connecting any EVM-compatible wallet that allows users to add the custom FEVM network, such as MetaMask. Whenever a supporter decides to "Fund the Ring," the contributed FIL (less the gas fees) is deposited into the verified project wallet. </p><p>Open source maintainers join the ring by visiting the Fund Ring app, verifying the ownership of their Git repo with a funding proof, and deploying their own contract. We created a Fund Ring widget that the user can embed on their app's page to solicit contributions for their specific project. Only the contract owner, who has also verified that they have commit access to the Git repo, can withdraw the funds.</p><p>As a maintainer, let the ecosystem know what you need on a monthly or annual basis so you can dedicate the time to keep code maintained and secure. Run one-off campaigns to support new features.</p><p>Watch Fund Ring creator and Fission engineer Andy take us through the Fund Ring demo:</p> Why Build Fund Ring? <p>While we love <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Open Collective</a> and are an active fiscal sponsor and contributor on their platform, we wanted to create a solution designed with Web3 audiences in mind. One where a contributor can switch between FIL, ETH, Matic, and more to fund their favorite projects and get their own projects funded as well.</p><p>We wanted to create a self-sustaining and distributed option that empowers developers to get recurring funding on a monthly or annual basis that helps with long-term maintenance.</p><p>As well, much like Open Collective enables projects to send funds to other projects, we see a ring of projects promoting and funding each other. </p> Test the Ring <p><a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">Fund Ring</a> is available on Filecoin Calibration Testnet. As we gather more feedback and onboard various projects, we will transition to Filecoin Mainnet.</p>  As a project owner, register your project, sign and commit your funding proof to Git, and ask supporters to fund with sweet sweet testnet tFIL.  As an ecosystem supporter, get some <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/get-test-tokens/">testnet tokens from the faucet</a>, and fund some projects. You can try this by <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/fund/">funding the Fund Ring itself</a>.   Future Plans <p>Some of the upcoming features and ideas include:</p>  Support for native FIL accounts: Use <a href="https://filsnap.fission.app/">Filsnap</a>, Brave, or other native Filecoin wallets to fund (🗓 planned)  Filecoin vesting support: Use the built-in vesting features to send FIL over a month or year (💡 idea)  Filecoin multisig: Use the built-in Filecoin multisig (💡 idea)  Split support for dependencies: Show other projects in your funding widget, and allocate sending a percentage of funds to a ring of projects (💡 idea)  <p>There are many other ideas to layer on top of these basic contracts and on-chain events. For example, you could aggregate projects and allocate funds across them, present a UI for stack ranking or voting, or as an individual, create a project where you curate projects in a ring and help gather funds that go to all of them directly! </p><p>Explore the <a href="https://github.com/FundRing/fundring">GitHub repo</a> to get involved with Fund Ring, or drop by the <a href="https://filecoin.io/slack">#shared-fission channel in the Filecoin Slack</a>.

<p>As digital transformation continues to change the way we do business and interact with various entities and organizations, cyberattacks continue to intensify and compromise user accounts and identities. Identities are the largest attack vector with weak/compromised credentials and phishing attacks being two of the most successful type of attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations are taking notice, and many have implemented various security controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on, and training employees to identify a phishing attack. Additionally, many run ad-hoc simulated phishing attacks to evaluate employees and retrain them to identify phishing attacks on an ongoing basis. While these trainings have been found to be effective in educating employees on what a phishing attack is, how phishing emails look, and what to look for when trying to evaluate the authenticity of an email, quite often employees are engrossed in their daily tasks and activities and will at some point get tripped up and click on a phishing link, whether simulated or real.</p>
<p>At the same time, threat actors are getting better at disguising phishing attacks, with entire criminal organizations dedicated to building services like phishing-as-a-service for other cyber criminals to use in their targeted phishing campaigns. In addition, AI technologies are also being adopted by bad actors to aid in the development of cyberattack campaigns, with services like <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/wormgpt-new-ai-tool-allows.html">WormGPT</a> (a generative AI tool for bad actors similar to ChatGPT) that allow adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise attacks with relative ease. These malicious AI tools use the latest marketing and branding from your websites and learn from previously successful phishing campaigns to create highly accurate phishing campaigns that can evade even the most trained eye from identifying the phishing email.</p>
<p>How can organizations protect against phishing attacks?</p>
<p>Organizations need to stop relying on employees to identify phishing emails and move to implement security solutions and controls that can prevent phishing attacks from compromising an individual’s identity. They can start by moving to a completely passwordless solution, eliminating one of the largest attack vectors – namely weak or compromised credentials. In addition, not all MFA is the same and offers varying levels of protection against MFA bypass attacks. Moving to phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA along with single sign-on (SSO) capabilities will help prevent phishing campaigns from successfully compromising a user’s account.</p>
<p>What is phishing-resistant passwordless MFA is and how does it prevent phishing and other MFA bypass attacks?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Phishing-resistant MFA</a> involves high assurance authentication with the use of cryptographic keys and digital certificates, as well as requiring the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/should-physical-proximity-be-a-required-mfa-factor/">physical proximity</a> of the user to the device from which they are requesting access to a resource. There are a few passwordless MFA options that offer phishing-resistance, namely FIDO2 keys, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/02/goodbye-passwords-hello-passkeys/">passkeys</a>, and certificate-based authentication with Bluetooth proximity detection.</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is considered the highest assurance of these options. It involves the use of verified digital certificates assigned to a user and devices from which a user authenticates themselves, along with a Bluetooth proximity requirement. This ensures the user is in close physical proximity to the device from which they are accessing a resource and that the device itself is also a trusted device with a known valid digital certificate assigned to it by a certificate authority.</p>
<p>How to protect against common <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-good-enough/">MFA bypass attacks</a> with CBA</p>
<p>SIM Swap Attack – This type of attack involves taking over a user’s mobile number by having it transferred to a SIM card owned by the attacker. However, with CBA, the certificates tied to the user and device reside on the original device owned by the user and protected with biometrics, ensuring that attackers will not be successful in compromising the user’s identity.</p>
<p>MFA Prompt Bombing – In this scenario, an attacker will trigger MFA push authentication notification on a victim’s mobile device in the hopes of a user accepting one of the many prompts and granting access. With CBA, an attacker will not have access to the digital certificate on the user’s mobile device and in addition will not satisfy the physical proximity factor requirement as they initiate such attacks remotely.</p>
<p>Adversary in The Middle (AiTM) – In this type of attack, cyber criminals set up a reverse web proxy with a phishing site in between the victim and the legitimate application, or webpage. With CBA, attackers cannot successfully compromise a user’s identity as they will not have access to the certificate assigned to the user, as well as the certificate issued to the user’s device to make it a trusted device, thereby protecting against an AiTM attack.</p>
<p>Holistic and layered defense with Zero Trust</p>
<p>Given identity is one of the largest attack vectors, protecting against most common identity-led attacks with phishing-resistant authentication is a critical part of a Zero Trust framework, which provides organizations with a comprehensive set of controls to implement a strong proactive defense to protect against and reduce the impact of a breach when one occurs.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s recent introduction of a new system for LinkedIn members marks a significant step towards strengthening workplace verification. By leveraging Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn now offers a credential issuance system that provides members and organizations with greater confidence in the authenticity of their work connections and profile information. This expansion of Microsoft’s digital identity technology to LinkedIn introduces a new feature that empowers businesses to enable their employees to validate their employment details publicly. The implications of this feature extend beyond individual profiles, as it fosters trusted interactions and informed hiring decisions. Verifiable work histories on LinkedIn make it easier for employers to verify candidates’ qualifications and experience, leading to more efficient hiring processes. According to LinkedIn, this feature is currently operational with over 4,000 companies on their platform, and they have further plans to expand its availability to additional companies in the future. Through the utilization of verifiable credentials, LinkedIn members can establish their credibility and authenticate their work affiliations, thereby providing additional assurance to their professional connections.</p><blockquote>In this blog, we will explore the concept of verifiable credentials, their numerous benefits and the transformative impact they can have on the overall LinkedIn ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Image Credits:&nbsp;LinkedIn</p><p>Verifiable Credentials: A Game-Changer for Digital Identity:</p><p>Verifiable credentials represent a groundbreaking development in the realm of digital identification. These tamper-evident digital records contain key information about an individual, such as their name, date of birth, and contact details. Unlike traditional digital records, verifiable credentials offer a unique advantage: they can be trusted by third parties without relying on a central authority for verification. This groundbreaking feature ensures greater privacy and security for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Here is a typical process for creating and verifying a verifiable credential:</p><p>Issuer: The issuance of verifiable credentials is a straightforward process. Any entity, such as a government agency or financial institution, can create a digital record containing relevant information about an individual. The issuer then signs and encrypts this record using their private key, creating a tamper-evident credential that can be verified by&nbsp;others.</p><p>Holder: The holder of the credential, whether an individual or an organization, has full control over its management. This includes deciding who can access it and when it can be shared or&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Verifier: The verifier, on the other hand, can check the digital signature on the credential using the issuer’s publicly available public key. If the digital signature is valid, the verifier can trust the information contained in the credential without relying on a centralized authority, thereby ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering or falsification.</p><p>Revolutionizing Efficiency with Verifiable Credentials:</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> represent a remarkable innovation in the realm of digital identification. By granting individuals more control over their personal data while enhancing security and privacy, verifiable credentials have the potential to revolutionize how we manage digital identity. Verifiable credentials not only enhance security and privacy but also redefine operational efficiency. This transformative technology has the potential to reshape resource-intensive processes, resulting in substantial time and cost savings. The implementation of verifiable credentials empowers businesses to accomplish tasks that would typically take several days in a matter of mere minutes. This streamlined process stands to yield substantial time and monetary savings for these organizations.</p><p>Platforms like LinkedIn benefit greatly from the implementation of Verifiable Credentials. In traditional hiring processes, recruiters invest considerable time in verifying candidates’ claims. Verifiable Credentials streamline this process by granting instant access to verified data, reducing administrative burdens, and expediting decision-making.</p><p>For businesses, the onboarding of new hires becomes simplified through Verifiable Credentials. Swift authentication of qualifications, training achievements, and credentials ensures the presence of necessary skills and endorsements.</p><p>Elevating Security and&nbsp;Trust</p><p>Built on a foundation of robust security and privacy principles, Verifiable Credentials uphold data integrity and prevent tampering and unauthorized access. This cryptographic security layer ensures data reliability, minimizing identity fraud risks and misinformation.</p><p>The decentralization of Verifiable Credentials eliminates the need for a single central authority. This empowers individuals to selectively share their credentials, addressing privacy concerns and fostering unwavering trust in digital interactions.</p><p>Conclusion: LinkedIn’s Stride Towards Trust and Transparency</p><p>The introduction of verifiable credentials on LinkedIn marks a significant stride towards enhancing trust and identity verification in the professional realm. By utilizing Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn members now have the opportunity to validate their employment details, ensuring greater transparency and credibility. <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> revolutionize the way we manage digital identity, providing individuals with control over their personal data while maintaining security and privacy. This innovative technology has the potential to transform digital wallets and reshape the entire landscape of verifiable data. As we embrace the digital era, <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> stands ready to support organizations and individuals in leveraging the power of verifiable credentials. Embrace the future of trusted and secure interactions with verifiable credentials.</p><p>For further updates and inquiries, reach out to <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/contact-us">AyanWorks</a> and stay tuned for the latest advancements in this exciting field.

  <p>In today's digital landscape, businesses face an increasing threat of fraud that can lead to significant financial losses and damage to their reputation. To effectively combat fraud, businesses need Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms (FRIPs). These advanced technologies leverage multiple data sources, data analytics, and ML detection models to proactively detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time. FRIPs empower organizations to stay ahead of fraudsters by uncovering hidden patterns, identifying anomalies, and generating alerts. By implementing FRIPs, businesses can mitigate risks, reduce false positives, and safeguard their financial well-being and brand image. Stay one step ahead of fraud with FRIPs and ensure a secure future for your business.<br><br>John Tolbert, Director of Cybersecurity Research at KuppingerCole, will give an overview of fraud trends and the tools businesses and other organizations can use to detect and prevent fraud. This webinar will highlight our research methodology, evaluation criteria, and some findings from the recently released Leadership Compass on FRIP. We will also show how you can view and drill down into the results of our FRIP research in our new <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/open-select/">KC Open Select tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms"></a>

   New capabilities fix security issues with MFA push notifications 

<p>Zero Trust security models call for the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users may access protected IT resources. Many organizations are adopting MFA to add a layer of security for remote workers. Customer-facing organizations are also implementing MFA to mitigate identity-based attacks, such as phishing, and to help quash the rise in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> fraud.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords. MFA renders the use of stolen credentials futile, as attackers are highly unlikely to have access to a user's other authentication factors, such as a mobile phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks">Microsoft</a> has stated that using MFA may stop 99% of password-related attacks within an enterprise, so an increasing number of enterprises have begun to require MFA before granting account access. That's the good news. The bad news is that attackers are now trying to undermine the effectiveness of MFA with some success.</p>

 MFA is under attack 

<p>While MFA is a vast improvement over a simple username and password combination, there are ways that MFA can be compromised, including:</p>

<p>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: Fraudsters position themselves between organizations (such as financial institutions) and users to intercept, edit, send, and receive communications without being noticed.</p>

<p>SIM-card swapping attacks: A cybercriminal uses social engineering tactics to transfer a user's mobile phone number to a new SIM card owned by the criminal. If such an attack is successful, the victim's apps, including banking apps, can be activated on the impersonator's phone.</p>

<p>Pass-the-cookie attacks: A session or authentication cookie can be stolen and injected into a new web session to trick the browser into thinking the authenticated user is present and does not need to prove their identity.</p>

<p>MFA fatigue attacks (aka MFA spamming or MFA prompt bombing): The MFA fatigue attack relies on people to be distracted, careless, or frustrated by frequent requests to authenticate. As a new form of social engineering, MFA fatigue raises considerable security concerns.</p>

 What is MFA fatigue? 

<p>Sometimes, as a means to an end, people will engage in behavior that they know is borderline unsafe. Who amongst us hasn't disabled a smoke alarm to make the low-battery alert stop its intermittent screeching? MFA fatigue attacks rely on similar human impulses, which ultimately make users vulnerable to schemes such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>.</p>

<p>With MFA prompt bombing, attackers attempt to get access to an account or device by flooding a user's authentication app with push notifications. Some attackers send a few push notifications a day thinking they will fly under the radar, while others bombard the user with continuous messages, but the intended outcome in either approach is the same: to get users to authorize access in order to make the notifications stop, thereby granting access to the attacker.</p>

 Preventing MFA attacks 

<p>Push authentication is one of the most secure, simple, and convenient user authentication methods and a popular MFA choice. To avoid attacks on push notifications, ForgeRock has developed two features: MFA push authentication with context and push authentication with number matching.</p>

 Push notification with additional context 

<p>The push notification with context feature lets you keep your users safe from MFA attacks by sending them additional context. When users are presented with a push notification request, they are provided contextual information about the request, such as where the request came from, information about the device, the user agent, or other signals.</p>

<p>When the push notification is received, the user can review the contextual authentication information, decide whether it is legitimate, and accept it or reject it.</p>

    
MFA push notification with additional context Push notification with number matching 

<p>With number matching in a push request, the user is presented with a number on the login screen and must select that same number in the authenticator app.</p>

<p>For more secure logins in the near term, we advise enabling push notifications with number matching. This method prevents an attacker from gaining access to an account if the user accidentally hits "Approve" on an MFA notice.</p>

<p>This technique also minimizes friction for users. When compared to other MFA techniques, such as entering a six-digit number from a software token or SMS message, matching a two-digit code doesn't significantly add to the login process.</p>

    
MFA push notification with number matching Why enterprises should use these MFA approaches 

<p>If you've implemented MFA using an authenticator app for your workforce users or your customers, you want to be sure it isn't vulnerable to MFA fatigue. With the ForgeRock Authenticator's additional context or number matching, you will no longer have to worry about users who unintentionally approve MFA requests.</p>

<p>For over 45 million Americans, the weight of unyielding student loan debt is a major cause of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-cope-with-stress-of-student-loans/">stress and anxiety</a>, a barrier to homeownership and can be a lifelong impediment to building wealth. Nationwide, the total student debt level stands at a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/student-debt-is-a-main-obstacle-for-millennials-wanting-to-buy-a-house.html">$1.7 trillion</a>. Managing that debt has proven to be complicated and inefficient for borrowers and lenders alike.</p>



<p>Bottom line: Access to consumer-permissioned student loan data presents a unique opportunity. Innovators can step in and create apps and build better services that leverage student loan data through Finicity’s open banking platform, to help consumers with student loan debt.</p>



 Introducing Normalized Student Loan Data 



<p>For fintech innovators, lenders, refinancers, employers and institutions of higher education, working with student loan data has been challenging. Until now, the data hasn’t been normalized. Higher learning institutions have used different naming conventions for data fields, making documentation harder to read, compare or translate. Lenders and servicers have to navigate a forest of screenshots, phone calls with lengthy hold times and unsecure paper documents in their efforts to verify loan information.</p>



<p>These time-consuming manual processes incur labor costs to lenders and servicers. This can cause stress, revenue loss, time loss and negatively impact the lender’s operational efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finicity has normalized the data across data fields, vocabulary, naming conventions and applications of rules, resulting in a modernized ecosystem for all stakeholders through its open banking platform. This significantly reduces the time to market for your student loan solutions.</p>



 Innovation Platform Using Student Loan Data 



<p>Student loan data doesn’t have to be confusing or complicated. With Mastercard Open Banking (some services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company), an optimized API call can help reduce costs, and is delivered in a formation that doesn’t require additional coding. Our API endpoints can yield the complete loan details, and the full payment details of a student loan account, including up to 24 months of transaction history.</p>







 99% Data Coverage&nbsp; 



 
 Normalized, comprehensive data covering most student loan accounts. It’s delivered through our open banking platform, with connections to student loan accounts that include federal Direct Loans, FFEL &amp; Perkins, and some of the largest private lenders and servicers (e.g. Aidvantage, Navient, Nelnet, Sallie Mae, Discover, Firstmark, Commonbond, LendKey, etc). 
 



 Quality of Data 



 
 Extensive Loan Account Details:&nbsp;&nbsp;API calls to the Finicity open banking platform can yield a primary account, transactions by account, loan payment details, statements, account owner and much more.&nbsp;Data is aggregated at the three largest levels of the student loan hierarchy; student loan, student loan group and student loan account, while also being able to provide customer &amp; institution-level details. 



 Transaction lookback period&nbsp;has been extended to one year in order to accurately capture transaction additions or changes. Up to twenty-four months of transactions can be offered for an extended view of account history. 



 Complementary data insight solutions&nbsp;with analytics of a borrower’s credits, debits and balances to deliver smarter credit decisioning. 



 Reliable Uptime Data Monitoring: Multi-tier data integrity and student loan-specific data monitoring. 
 



 Create Winning Borrower Experiences 



<p>Innovators can quickly develop and scale new and improved financial services with Finicity’s open banking platform. Student loans are the second-largest debt sector in the United States. There is a massive opportunity to develop new apps and services to help individuals with student loan debt. Through partnering with our clients, Finicity’s open banking platform is powering solutions to help over 45 million Americans who carry student loan balances.&nbsp;</p>



 Some of the ways innovators can upgrade the borrower experience, using permissioned student loan data: 



 
 Create&nbsp;frictionless onboarding&nbsp;and account setup for borrowers to apply for loans, set up accounts, manage repayment and distribute funding to students. 



 Better data for better credit decisioning. It’s pretty simple. Student loan borrowers want a better experience. Lenders want the most accurate and real-time data for better credit decisioning. So we’ve combined the best data with smart insights to transform the lending experience. 



 Finicity data powers leading&nbsp;personal finance management&nbsp;(PFM) apps. These tools allow borrowers to view, monitor and manage their debt in near real time by pulling smart, categorized and permissioned loan data into the app. If borrowers can easily understand their financial position and repayment options, they may reduce stress and more effectively manage their debt.&nbsp; 



 Attracting and retaining the best talent in today’s job market is a challenge for any company. Leveraging permissioned student loan data, some employers are taking advantage of the SECURE 2.0 Act, creating benefits like&nbsp;401k accounts that match student loan payments&nbsp;and direct matching of student loan payments back to the student loan. 



 By using the account details endpoint, it’s possible to verify that a student is enrolled in at least half-time coursework by the National Student Loan Data System. Using this data, a rich field of possibility opens up for student-specific benefits.&nbsp;Discounts, rewards and loyalty programs&nbsp;can be built specifically for current students. 



 Even the more administrative aspects of student loans can be modernized by open banking technology. Student borrowers can be offered the ability to easily and securely&nbsp;apply for federal programs&nbsp;like Public Service Loan Forgiveness or an Income-Driven Repayment plan. No&nbsp;wading through W2s, paystubs and long, frustrating calls to student loan servicers.&nbsp;Quick and secure. 
 



 Step Into the Future 



<p>Break out of the spider web of paper documents, screenshots, phone calls and mismatched data. Replace countless lost hours of productivity with optimized API calls that offer the comprehensive, relevant, normalized data to build solutions on.</p>



<p>Innovate with us to create knowledge-based services that empower students, so they can manage, consolidate, refinance and repay their obligations with the level of transparency that they deserve.&nbsp;</p>

  Crypto regulations vary globally: Japan embraces it, China resists, the EU introduces MiCA for uniformity, and the US grapples with overlapping jurisdictions.  Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and Bermuda are pioneering progressive crypto approaches, blending innovation with robust oversight.  Despite the global patchwork of regulations, a cohesive international framework remains elusive, though it’s a prominent G20 discussion topic.  <p>Crypto is changing how the world thinks about money. But when we look at the rules for crypto, every country is different.</p><p>While Japan likes crypto and has initiated several initiatives to position itself as a crypto-friendly destination, China has not been so accommodating. And just south of China, India has decided to adopt a wait-and-watch approach, although the country’s Central Bank is strongly against giving any legal recognition to virtual currencies.</p><p>Europe, on the other hand, has already started implementing provisions from its comprehensive regulatory framework called Markets in Crypto Assets, known as MiCA. In comparison, the world’s largest economy, the United States, is yet to reach a clear consensus over who will control what, as there are frequent overlaps and clashes of jurisdictional capacity between agencies like the CFTC and&nbsp;SEC.</p><p>(<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Image Source</a>)</p><p>Here, we delve deeper to understand where the world currently stands regarding regulating crypto. This is crucial because the industry can only thrive if regulatory differences are at their minimum. And only then could we see the seamless exchange of resources and capital — mandatory for a global crypto economy to stand on its own&nbsp;feet.</p> Europe  The EU <p>When it comes to crypto rules in the EU, MICA or Markets in Crypto Assets often take center stage. The public first got a glimpse of this proposal on 24th September 2020. Fast forward to 16th May 2023, and the EU has officially given the go-ahead to these&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The core objective of MiCA is to safeguard investor interests and enhance transparency by setting out a comprehensive framework for issuers and service providers. Specifically, utility token issuers, stablecoins (also termed asset-referenced tokens), trading platforms, and wallet service providers will all fall under MiCA’s oversight.</p><p>Recognizing this, the EU views the adoption of MiCA not merely as an isolated regulation but as a strategic move. It’s their way of progressing toward a cohesive global crypto regulatory standard, a significant improvement over the varied national laws previously in place across member&nbsp;states.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">For more details on the MiCA: MiCA Paving the Way — From Liability to Transparency</a></p> Switzerland <p>The Alpine nation treats cryptocurrencies as assets, fostering tax clarity and pioneering early adoption.</p><p>Zurich introduced Bitcoin ATMs in 2014, and by 2016, Zug was accepting Bitcoin for services. Their forward-thinking approach is further evidenced by Lugano’s ambitious plan to use cryptocurrencies as legal tender and Zug’s facilitation of tax payments in crypto. Switzerland’s stance exemplifies the diverse approaches to crypto regulation in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Asia <p>Unlike Europe’s MiCA, Asia does not have a single continent-wise regulatory structure. However, there are several crypto-friendly countries in Asia, such as Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, with their own set of rules and regulations.</p> Hong Kong <p>The vertical city-state took a more conservative approach, aligning with China’s 2021 ban on crypto services earlier. But that changed recently, as Hong Kong decided to open its doors to crypto exchanges, paving the way for organized crypto retail trading, albeit with a few conditions.</p> Japan <p>The country, often called the “Land of the Rising Sun,” has crafted a detailed crypto framework, with its Financial Services Agency (FSA) collaborating with the JVCEA and JSTOA, ensuring robust oversight for crypto exchanges and token offerings. With the Payment Services Act and stringent anti-money laundering measures in place, Japan’s intent is clear: to foster a transparent and safeguarded crypto environment.</p> South Korea <p>On the Korean peninsula, South Korea’s crypto regulations are defined by the Electronic Financial Transactions Act and the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Information. These laws categorize cryptocurrencies as “electronic assets” and set the rules for their utilization. As South Korea seeks to refine its stance on digital currencies, the National Assembly is actively deliberating on a range of crypto-related regulatory proposals.</p> Singapore <p>Shifting our lens southeast, Singapore stands as a beacon of balanced crypto regulation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) championed the Payment Services Act (PSA) in January 2020, which enveloped both traditional and crypto exchanges under a unified framework.</p><p>Within the PSA, digital currencies earn the designation of “digital payment tokens,” elevating approved cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether to legal asset status. Coupled with rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures and the imposition of licensing requirements for crypto activities, the city-state’s approach underscores a commitment to both innovation and security in the digital asset&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Overall, Asia’s approach to crypto regulation demonstrates a trend toward a more structured and promising future.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>Navigating to the Middle East, the UAE offers a mosaic of crypto regulations that reflects its unique federal structure. With seven distinct emirates, each potentially wielding its own rules, the central narrative began in 2017 when the UAE emphasized authorized exchanges and anti-money laundering protocols.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, and Dubai, a pivotal emirate, spotlighted its commitment by introducing the Virtual Assets Law. This legislation not only defines the scope of virtual assets but also ensures traders operate transparently, aiming to prevent financial malpractices.</p><p>To anchor this initiative, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) was established, marking Dubai’s ambition to be a global hub for digital assets. Through these measures, the UAE seamlessly interweaves tradition with innovation, creating a balanced crypto landscape.</p> North America  The United&nbsp;States <p>As the most representative economy of the region, the United States boasts a multifaceted and evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) holds jurisdiction over crypto exchanges trading Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for overseeing Initial Coin Offerings or&nbsp;ICOs.</p><p>Supplementing these agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has a primary role in monitoring digital assets, especially concerning Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>Given the multifarious classifications of digital assets, determining the correct regulatory agency can be intricate, sometimes involving multiple bodies. Each state, further adding to the complexity, possesses the autonomy to design its individual regulations on digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In line with this dynamic regulatory backdrop, it’s notable that the US Congress is actively considering legislation to further define and shape the crypto landscape.</p> Crypto-focused Bills in the&nbsp;US <p>Two crypto-focused bills have recently been reintroduced. The first, known as the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill, is spearheaded by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. This revised legislation aims to demystify decentralized finance regulations, bolster the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) authority over crypto entities, and specify the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>Within its provisions, the bill underscores definitions for “crypto asset” and “crypto asset exchange,” ensuring these terms are categorized under commodities law, thereby strengthening the CFTC’s jurisdiction. A significant highlight of the bill is the introduction of a de minimus tax exemption, which seeks to alleviate the tax burdens from minute transactions, challenging the current tax mandate that treats all crypto transactions equally, irrespective of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>The second bill reintroduced in the US Congress comes from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall, titled the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023. Should it pass, all crypto stakeholders would be mandated to report transactions that eclipse the USD 10,000 threshold. Initially put forth in December 2022, the bill’s objective is to have US cryptocurrency operations adhere to the same know-your-customer standards as traditional banks, a move aimed at curtailing money laundering.</p><p>With these factors in play, entities in the US must be vigilant and continuously update their operational strategies to stay compliant. It’s also crucial for crypto exchanges to align with AML/CFT regulations, and users should be cognizant of potential tax implications. As federal directives lay out the broader guidelines, understanding the nuances of state-specific regulations becomes paramount.</p> Canada <p>Shifting attention northwards to Canada, the country’s approach to cryptocurrencies differs significantly. Digital assets, primarily treated as securities, are regulated provincially and territorially under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). This classification is due to the unique “Crypto Contract” concept, wherein a user’s contractual right to a crypto asset can be placed under securities regulations, even if it isn’t a traditional security.</p><p>Hence, platforms such as cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets need to be registered with the corresponding securities regulator. These businesses must continuously disclose vital information, from third-party dependencies and associated risks to measures against theft or&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Every cryptocurrency offering undergoes an “Investment Contract Test” to determine its classification as a security. Non-compliance can result in punitive actions, from financial penalties to bans on operations.</p><p>However, some gray areas persist in Canada’s crypto regulations. Notably, assets like stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) don’t have a clear regulatory framework, leading authorities to evaluate them on a case-by-case basis. Despite these nuances, Canada’s mature approach has garnered praise from crypto entities worldwide, marking it as a notably crypto-friendly nation.</p> Bermuda <p>Bermuda is a leader in the cryptocurrency landscape and is a likely beneficiary of the much-reported US crackdown against crypto firms, with firms like Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/20/crypto-exchange-coinbase-receives-license-to-operate-in-bermuda/">obtaining a license</a> to operate in the country recently.</p><p>With laws like the Digital Asset Business Act (DABA) and the Digital Asset Issuance Act (DAIA), they’ve built a comprehensive regulatory framework treating all forms of digital assets uniformly. But their commitment doesn’t stop there. They’ve also paved the way for banks serving the digital asset sector and have launched innovative projects, like a blockchain-based stimulus&nbsp;token.</p><p>Guided by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the island balances innovation with globally recognized regulatory standards, creating an environment ripe for growth and security.</p> A Regulatory Comparison <p>As far as the comparison of the US with other parts of the globe is concerned, the lack of regulatory clarity in the US is leading crypto traders to take their bets on Asia. This is despite China and India — two of the most populous nations globally — maintaining a cautious stance on&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>In Europe’s case, it is evidently far ahead of the US when it comes to providing regulatory clarity to the crypto landscape. However, as per Albert Isola, the minister for Digital and Financial Services at HM Government of Gibraltar, the effects of MiCA “will not come into play overnight. To create effective frameworks, transitional testing will be required.” What MiCA, introduced to the EU, aims to achieve is enhanced transparency and better protection for retail investors in the short term and significantly improved security and stability in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>According to Isola, many global crypto players are also expressing interest in the EU because it has made sure that regulatory frameworks do not overregulate the space and thwart innovation.</p> What to&nbsp;Expect <p>Crypto regulations will definitely go through a lot of ups and downs, proposals and rejections, and trials and errors in the days to come. Countries that are not particularly encouraging the private crypto industry to thrive might change their opinion after introducing Central Bank Digital Currencies or&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>However, the emergence of a global regulatory framework from all these churnings still seems a distant possibility, for now, despite crypto regulations becoming a key point of discussion in the G20 under India’s presidency.</p><p>___________________________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>Indicio recently had a breakthrough in work to scale the mediator we have been using for issuing and verifying credentials. This new mediator greatly reduces a huge problem decentralized identity faces — accommodating all the people that want to use the technology.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Alexandra N. Walker</p>
<p>A mediator is a critical part of any decentralized interaction between the holders of decentralized identifiers. This technology is the “middle man” that facilitates messages between decentralized entities using mobile devices (which don’t have fixed IP addresses for easy connection). You can almost think of a mediator as a mailbox; it provides an endpoint for parties that cannot otherwise connect with each other to send and receive messages. Importantly, these “messages” can include issuing and verifying credentials.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the amount of messages your mediator can process in a given period of time has a significant impact on performance, limiting how many people can use your services concurrently which, in turn, will limit adoption. People today expect technology to “just work;” if they perceive the interaction to be slow, the likelihood of them trying again is very low. To put this into perspective, <a href="https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/#:~:text=following%20key%20findings%3A-,47%20percent%20of%20consumers%20expect%20a%20web%20page%20to%20load,render%20before%20abandoning%20the%20site.">47 percent of consumers</a> expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40 percent will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site.</p>
<p>This obviously puts some pressure on your development team to make sure everything works quickly, and the mediator represents a key part of the process where people can get stuck. The option to pay for more, or bigger, mediations is always a viable solution, but it can be costly. This is the context for Indicio’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>The first thing we had to know were baseline numbers: using mediation, how many credentials could ACA-Py sustainably issue to new users in a minute? What about existing users? How about verification?</p>
<p>(Non-Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>issue 258 credentials per minute to new connections<br>issue 540 credentials per minute to existing connections<br>verify 282 credentials per minute to existing connection</p>
<p>These numbers represent our baseline numbers in a non-clustered environment; however, taking this architecture into a clustered environment—where we have the same architecture as before, but now everything (user agents and ACA-Py agents) is abstracted away behind load balancers and managed instance groups—we get much better numbers.</p>
<p>(Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>The traditional mediator from before can sustainably</p>
<p>issue 300 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>issue 900 credentials per minute to existing connections, mediator, and<br>verify 600 credentials per minute to existing connections,</p>
<p>using the same mediator (with 2 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM) as before but now with 10 ACA-Py agents (1 vCPU and 4GB of RAM, each).</p>
<p>Using some new techniques and new technologies, such as the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">SocketDock</a>, our team was able to greatly improve these numbers.</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator:</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator can</p>
<p>sustainably issue 1,200 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>sustainably issue 1,680 credentials per minute to existing connections, sustainably verify 3,000 credentials per minute to existing connections.</p>
<p>Our team is hugely excited about this progress, given that high-volume verification will drive many seamless processes. For example, with Indicio’s Mediator, airport security will be able to verify 3,000 passengers per minute per mediator, shortening lines while saving airports expense.</p>
<p>While the Indicio Mediator is not quite ready for public use yet, our team wanted to share the news that ACA-Py (Aries Cloud Agent-Python) is able to scale to meet the growing interest in the technology. Once the Indicio team has fine tuned the codebase, we expect to open source and contribute it to the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Foundation</a> so organizations can build their own solutions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the new mediator or building your own verifiable credential solutions our team is always happy to help. You can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us here.</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In recent years, the question of a state's territorial sovereignty in cyberspace has been a major topic of discussion. The emergence of cyberspace has introduced new spatial dimensions and challenged our understanding of international law. When it comes to cyberspace, the solid and defined notion of territory does not necessarily apply there. Sovereignty has been unbundled in cyberspace, both in practice and in legality.</p>
<p>At its core, the notion of sovereignty in cyberspace encompasses a state's authority and control over the digital activities that take place within its borders. While all states would claim some degree of sovereignty over the internet, countries such as Russia and China have embraced a broader interpretation of cyber sovereignty. Both states define cyber sovereignty in ways that are consistent with their respective political and security objectives.</p>
<p>Technology, geopolitics, and cyber sovereignty </p>
<p>According to the Chinese cyber sovereignty principle, cyber sovereignty is the idea that each country has the right to exercise control over the Internet within its territory and the right to choose its own digital development path. The Chinese Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2016 has further promoted this idea and defined the security obligations that Internet providers and services must follow. As a result, the concept of cyber sovereignty has become China's guiding principle in its domestic digital policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russia's interpretation of cyber sovereignty, mirroring that of China, is characterized by the regulation of information and information flows and the ability to regulate, surveil, and influence digital activities occurring within its borders. For example, in 2018, Russia proposed a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly, which some argue legitimizes state surveillance and censorship through its emphasis on sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries.</p>
<p>Although liberal democracies have also intervened in the digital realm to counter the threats of disinformation, terrorism, and cybercriminal activity, their approach tends to balance the protection of citizens' rights and privacy with the need to maintain a secure online environment. Consequently, their interventions in the digital sphere often come with checks and balances and public discourse to ensure that security measures do not impede upon the democratic values they seek to protect.</p>
<p>Semiconductors and national security </p>
<p>In addition to the principle of cyber sovereignty, the concept of supply chain sovereignty has recently gained traction in economic and political circles. Since the spring of 2018, the trade conflict between the United States and China has been in full swing. Dependence on imports and foreign producers is now considered a national security risk in many states. Global supply chains can be more efficient in delivering goods and services at lower costs while fostering international competition at the same time. However, states are wary of gaining economic advantage at the expense of national security.</p>
<p>Some countries have identified and subsidized key technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors; while the former is important in the long term, the latter has more immediate implications in the global supply chain. The semiconductor industry is a vital part of today's information age and a key component of today's global economy. As a result, new restrictions limiting China's access to chipmaking software and equipment continue to be imposed by the United States as part of its national security agenda.</p>
<p>There is more to this story than trade tensions between China and the United States. Many countries are claiming sovereignty over the shared digital technology space. For example, the European Union has been trying to reduce its dependence on the United States for years. Through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has achieved some measure of internet sovereignty via regulation. Nevertheless, the EU is likely to continue to seek greater convergence with the United States and to build digital alliances with like-minded countries.</p>
<p>Addressing challenges through cooperation </p>
<p>While technology continues to develop integrating forces, geopolitics is moving toward greater fragmentation, posing a serious dilemma for business leaders and policymakers. Despite different interpretations of cyber sovereignty or supply chain sovereignty, countries will need to cooperate at the international level and work together to address global challenges.</p>
<p>Data breaches, espionage, sabotage, misinformation, supply chain disruptions, and cyberattacks are just a few examples of the global challenges we face. Governance of cyberspace requires both shared values and trust to work, but this will ultimately depend more on consistent and enforceable legal understandings than on technology. It is therefore clear that cyberspace will continue to play a critical role in international law and geopolitics in the years to come.</p>

 Interested in entering one of the largest and most lucrative gambling markets in the world? You’ll first need a UK gambling license. Here’s everything you need to know about the application process, compliance requirements, UK gambling regulations, and much more. 



 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> (UKGC) operates as the UK’s gambling regulator, and is an independent regulatory body established under the UK Gambling Act of 2005. To operate legally in the UK, all gambling platforms are required to hold a license issued by the UKGC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC is also responsible for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">implementing changes t</a>o national gambling regulations, such as the recent proposals contained in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s gambling white paper</a>. Proposals target various aspects of the gambling industry, such as VIP customers, slot limits, and financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks).</p>



 Understanding UK gambling regulations. 



<p>The UKGC takes failure to comply with licensing requirements and social responsibility codes very seriously. Operators, therefore, must have robust systems and controls in place to prevent money laundering as well as a whole host of other nefarious crimes. They must also safeguard customers, take measures to prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, ensure fair play, and encourage responsible gambling to guarantee <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">gambling compliance.</a></p>



<p>There are essentially three main types of operating licenses:&nbsp;</p>



  Remote: This license allows licensees to provide casino games and gambling products to customers through an online site, TV, mobile phone, or any other type of online service.<br>  Non-remote: A non-remote gambling license allows the licensee to facilitate betting activities at betting shops, tracks, and/or courses.<br>  Ancillary: Ancillary licenses are for operators offering email and telephone betting.&nbsp;  



<p>Operators may need one or a combination of these licenses.</p>



<p>Licensing is mandatory, even if an operator’s online gambling platform is located in another region of the world. Essentially, if the services are being offered in the UK, operators must hold a license. (If you are interested in learning about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/do-i-need-an-online-gaming-license/">the need for an online gaming license</a> in general, click on the underlined copy).</p>



 Eligibility criteria for a UK gambling license. 



<p>The Commission <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/operating-licences">evaluates</a> applicants based on the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>



  The identity of the applicant and people associated with them. For example, if the applicant’s gambling platform is part of a bigger corporation, then the owner of that corporation also needs to be evaluated.<br>  The applicant’s honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness<br>  Financial statements that display the business is financially capable of operating successfully after obtaining a license<br>  The applicant’s expertise, experience, qualifications, history, and those of the people relevant to the application<br>  The applicant’s criminal record and those relevant to the application.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission also looks at the applicants’ policies to ensure that:&nbsp;</p>



  They incorporate and understand the legislation<br>  They follow the established licensing objectives<br>  They hold evidence that their arrangements will adhere to social responsibility requirements  



 Application process for a UK gambling license. 



<p>Applicants apply for an operating license from the UKGC via the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/service/apply-for-an-operating-licence">“Apply for an operating license” service</a>. It takes around 16 weeks for the Commission to process a license application, considering all the required information is submitted at the point of application. Applying for a UKGC license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-much-it-costs#:~:text=It%20costs%20%C2%A3370%20to,withdraw%20from%20the%20application%20process.">costs</a> £370, which must be paid via credit or debit card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators are required to provide an extensive array of documents, some of which depend on the type of business applying for the license. For instance, a sole trader may only be required to submit identity documents, whereas a limited company would be required to submit the following:</p>



  Ownership structure diagram<br>  Articles of association<br>  Management structures<br>  Certificate of incorporation<br>  Memorandum of association&nbsp;  



<p>Overseas entities must submit a credit report and, if they have licenses elsewhere, copies of licenses issued by the other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a remote license, an operator must provide the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Documents regarding remote policies and procedures<br>  Operational model map<br>  Gambling software supply method and details<br>  System diagram displaying the end-to-end process&nbsp;  



<p>Some requirements are considered core documentation and are mandatory in all cases. Such requirements include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  General policies and procedures–these must adhere to the standards outlined in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">LCCP (Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice)</a><br>  Rules of play<br>  Customer terms and conditions<br>  Bank statements for the past six months for all accounts<br>  Business plan<br>  Proof of funding<br>  Profit and loss projections for the next three years&nbsp;  



<p>Those responsible for managing the business must also submit a PML (Personal Management Licence) or an Annex A personal declaration form based on the circumstances.</p>



 Key considerations for license applicants. 



<p>Those applying for a license from the UKGC must have a comprehensive business plan for their application to be approved. A sound business plan shows that the operator understands their objectives and the steps required to achieve them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also focus on responsible gambling and protection practices. This includes offering tools like deposit limits, self-exclusion, and helpful resources for customers who may struggle with or be on the verge of developing a gambling addiction. Moreover, the operator’s platform must also be secure, employing technologies such as SSL encryption to secure their customers’ personal and financial information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing robust anti-money laundering and fraud protection strategies, such as KYC and AML solutions, is also essential. Operators can help identify and mitigate gambling fraud and crime by conducting due diligence and transaction monitoring. Keeping updated with industry regulations and best practices is also among the key considerations for license applicants.</p>

 Compliance and reporting obligations. 



<p>All UKGC license holders must adhere to regulatory obligations that must be observed at all times. Such obligations include upholding integrity in all aspects of their operations, maintaining accurate records, reporting crucial information promptly, and ensuring they offer fair, safe, and transparent services to customers while taking active measures to prevent problem gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Failure to comply with such obligations can lead to dire consequences, including heavy fines, license revocation, and strict legal action.</p>



 Licensing fees and taxation. 



<p>For licensing purposes, operators are divided into a total of nine categories according to their GGY (Gross Gambling Yield). For example, a gambling operator with a GGY under £550k will be required to pay an application fee of £4,224 and an annual fee of £4,199. On the other hand, operators with a GGY worth £1 billion must pay an application fee of £91,686 and a yearly fee worth £793,729.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/point-of-consumption-tax-rate-of-15-proposed-for-remote-gambling">Point of Consumption Tax</a> (POCT) introduced in 2014, the Commission requires all licensees to adhere to tax requirements to operate legally. This includes taxes on all profits from gambling activities, regardless of where the operator is based, and abiding by regulations regarding the collection and reporting of taxes. The POCT has profoundly impacted the UK’s gambling industry, urging operators to adapt and comply with the evolving tax requirements to remain compliant.</p>



 License renewal and revocation. 



<p>The procedure for license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-to-licensing-authorities/part-24-renewal">renewal</a> is like applying for an initial application. You need to submit a renewal application within six months before the license expires but no later than two months prior to its expiration. The Commission may refuse to renew a permit on the following grounds:</p>



  If the renewal is inconsistent with the licensing requirements. In this instance, the authority may consult the chief officer of the police. The authority will, therefore, be wary of any concerns regarding the use of the premises during the life of the license.<br>  If an authorized local government officer has been denied access to the premises without a reasonable excuse.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission may also <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/revocation-of-operating-licence-bet-butler-limited">revoke</a> a license holder’s permit under the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p>



  The license holder is unable to carry out licensed activities consistent with the licensing requirements.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s financial standing.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s competence.<br>  The Commission believes that one or more license terms have been breached&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission usually informs the license holder if it reaches a decision about their permit. The licensee is allowed to appeal against a decision if:&nbsp;</p>



  They receive a fine or warning.<br>  Their license application has been turned down.<br>  Their license has been revoked or suspended.<br>  There are changes in their license terms  



 What is the UK’s new Customer Interaction Guidance for Remote Gambling Licensees? 



<p>In August, following a year-long consultation period, the UKGC issued a revised version of its Customer Interaction Guidance for Remote Gambling Licensees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remote gambling operators in the UK have until October 31 to implement measures contained in the guidance. The chief aim of the new guidance is to minimize the risk of customers experiencing harms associated with gambling through the implementation of “effective customer interaction systems and processes”. It suggests doing so through the use of a three-step system:&nbsp;</p>



  Identify&nbsp;<br>Through an ongoing process of monitoring, licensees should utilize indicators of harm to flag signs that a customer may be at risk.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Act&nbsp;<br>Review indicators to tailor the action to the type of harm. This may require automated action, or manual intervention. Activities and interactions should be recorded. Ongoing monitoring may be required, alongside further, more intensive intervention.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Evaluate&nbsp;<br>Consider actions taken, and whether further intervention is required. These evaluation processes and systems should be baked in from the beginning, and “not an afterthought.”&nbsp;  



<p>The new guidance is incredibly important for any operator that wishes to hold a gambling license in the UK. From October 31, all licensees are required to build processes that can identify risk, take appropriate action, and evaluate the effectiveness of said action. This three-step approach is now considered essential throughout the customer’s relationship with the operator.</p>



 Marketing and advertising guidelines. 



<p>Licensed operators must be wary of the advertising standards and restrictions established by the Commission. Such standards exist to protect minors and the vulnerable from being unfairly targeted by gambling ads and ensure that all advertising is fair and transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding responsible marketing practices, operators must be mindful of the guidelines and undertake advertising in a socially responsible manner, including the stipulations on the use of certain messaging and imagery. This is to say that all licensees’ marketing communications must not <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/open-and-transparent-marketing">mislead</a> customers. Operators must adhere to the UK Advertising <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/advertising-marketing-rules-and-regulations">codes</a> published by CAP (the Committees of Advertising Practice) and governed by the ASA (Advertising Standards Authority).&nbsp;</p>



 International expansion and cross-border licensing. 



<p>Many operators explore other markets to increase their customer base and diversify their revenue streams. However, various legal stipulations are linked with cross-border licensing, including ones based on licensing, taxation, and regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As previously noted, operators based abroad must provide a credit report. If they carry a license from other jurisdictions, they must provide a copy of the licenses issued by other jurisdictions.</p>



 UK gambling license FAQs. 


 
 
 
 What is a UK gambling license? 
 

<p>Operators must acquire a UK gambling license to provide gambling services in the UK. The license includes facilitating remote gambling, online or through different means, and advertising (responsible) gambling to UK-based consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Who needs a UK gambling license? 
 

<p>Operators looking to offer gambling services and advertise gambling to consumers in the UK are required to hold a UK gambling license.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 How long does it take to obtain a license? 
 

<p>It can take up to 16 weeks to obtain a UK gambling license. The timescale can depend on several factors, with the most important being the strength of the application.</p>

 
 
 
 What are the costs involved in obtaining a license? 
 

<p>The costs for obtaining a license depend on the operator’s GGY. For instance, an operator with a GGY below £550k must pay an application fee of £4,224. This increases significantly for the highest earners in the industry.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 How can I ensure compliance with UK gambling regulations?&nbsp; 
 

<p>To ensure compliance with UK gambling regulations, the operator must ensure that their business is fully licensed by the UKGC. They must also have robust policies and procedures in place to address problem gambling and crime. It is also crucial to stay updated with any UK gambling laws and regulations changes.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Can a license be transferred to another operator? 
 

<p>No, operating licenses are essentially non-transferable. Meaning that every gambling platform is required to go through the same process in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 


 Game on. 



<p>Like other industries, gambling has seen significant digital transformation in recent years. Adhering to recently updated and upcoming gambling laws and regulations is essential to launching a gambling platform in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effective procedures such as KYC and AML solutions can also help operators guarantee compliance with international regulatory requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our highly configurable platform for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">identity proofing in the gaming market</a> allows operators to keep abreast of constantly changing regulations, and new fraud schemes and scams, while ensuring a safe, secure and seamless gaming experience. With our latest round of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/platform-automated-document-liveness-data-check-uk/">platform enhancements</a>, we now offer UK-specific data checks, and financial risk checks, which provide operators with insights into a player’s affordability indicators to comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act.</p>

As <a href="https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386-Catalyst-registration-and-voting-guide">voting</a> begins on August 31 and runs until September 14, 2023, we urge you to have your voice heard and contribute to the future of decentralized solutions. You can <a href="https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/catalyst-basics/how-to-register-as-a-voter">register to vote</a> until August 18, 2023. We’re excited to introduce you to the visions behind these ambitious endeavours:</p>
 Āhau: Decolonising Financial Compliance 
 Objective: Empowering Indigenous Tribes with Nation-building Technologies 
<p>The financial world often erects barriers that hinder indigenous tribes, such as the Māori, from accessing vital economic development tools. With <a href="https://ahau.io/">Āhau</a>, we’re striving to change this narrative.</p>
<p>Our solution involves creating ecosystem governance frameworks and technologies tailored explicitly for Āhau. Using the TribalDIDs methodologies, we aim to interconnect with existing financial and compliance systems. This seamless integration is our ticket to dismantling the systemic obstacles that indigenous tribes face in places like Aotearoa/New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>

				  Blockchain Advocacy Coalition (BAC): Setting the Stage for DeFi’s Success in California 
 Objective: Paving the Way for Compliant Decentralized Financial Tools 
<p>The rapid rise of DeFi tools has been staggering, yet they face a significant hurdle: the need for KYC compliance. This gap poses a potential limitation to the growth and broader adoption of DeFi.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">BAC</a>, our focus is threefold. Firstly, we will formulate a bill tailor-made for the California legislature to integrate dApps into the traditional compliance framework. Secondly, we’re working on crafting a governance framework for developers, enabling them to build with clarity and confidence. Lastly, we’re committed to open-sourcing our entire framework. This ensures that states beyond California can harness our insights and replicate our success.&nbsp;</p>

				  ZenGate: Crafting a Blueprint for Expanding Cardano’s Horizons 
 Objective: A Robust Guide for Deploying National-Level Solutions on Cardano 
<p>Cardano’s potential is enormous, but one challenge persists the absence of a systematic approach to tapping into new jurisdictions and executing national-level solutions. <a href="https://www.zengate.global/">ZenGate</a> aims to address this.</p>
<p>Our focal point is the Global Specialty Tea Sector, serving as a practical and scalable case study. Through ZenGate, we’re developing a detailed Ecosystem Building Blueprint. This playbook will provide a step-by-step guide to navigating and mastering the complex landscape of deploying national-level solutions on Cardano.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After more than 10 years, short-lived TLS certificates are finally permitted by the browsers based on <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/07/14/ballot-sc-063-v4make-ocsp-optional-require-crls-and-incentivize-automation/">CA/Browser Forum ballot SC-063</a>. Gerv Markham started a <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.security.policy/c/T11up58JkFc/m/Nph-8cFiuEMJ">short-lived certs discussion in 2014</a>, where he advised he was reviewing the 2012 CA/Browser Forum discussion on the topic. He advised that short-lived certificates was a plank of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Checking_in_Firefox#Short-Lived_Certificates">Mozilla revocation strategy</a>. There was also a paper prepared in 2012 called <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/W2SP/2012/papers/w2sp12-final9.pdf">Towards Short-Lived Certificates</a>. The paper stated OCSP is as good as dead, so the CAs should issue certificates with a very short lifetime. I suppose no one thought it would take so much time.</p>
<p>Short-lived certificates are designed to help address a certificate revocation issue. Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html">Adam Langley discussed the seat-belt issue</a>, where it works fine, but snaps when you crash. This was based on the fact the browser implements soft-fail revocation checks where the CRL or OCSP response is ignored.</p>
<p>Even when the CA certificate status is trusted, there may be other issues. A CRL may be valid for up to 10 days, so even if a certificate is revoked, an attacker may be able to provide a valid CRL for many days after the revocation.</p>
<p>There are also privacy concerns where <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/180T6cDSWPy54Rb5d6R4zN7MuLEMShaZ4IRLQgdPqE98/edit">OCSP requests reveal details of individuals’ browsing history to the operator of the OCSP responder</a>. As such, many browsers do not perform online OCSP checks by default.</p>
<p>Effective after ballot SC-063 completes intellectual property review, the CAs can issue short-lived TLS certificates, where the validity is less than or equal to 10 days. Effective March 15, 2026, the short-lived certificate validity period will drop to a maximum of 7 days. Since the validity period would be less than the effective period of a CRL or an OCSP response, the CA does not have to provide status of short-lived certificates. This means you may not find any CRL or OCSP information in a short-lived TLS certificate. In addition, the CA does not have to revoke a short-lived certificate.</p>
<p>To address the OCSP privacy issue, effective March 15, 2024, the CA does not have to provide an OCSP response. Note that most CAs will continue to support OCSP for all TLS certificates based on the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31633.microsoft-trusted-root-program-requirements.aspx">Microsoft Trusted Root Program Requirements</a>. We do expect Microsoft will address this policy issue in the future.</p>
<p>To ensure status continues to be provided to non-short-lived certificates, effective March 15, 2024, the CAs must provide a CRL for all non-short-lived TLS certificates. The ballot also addresses partitioned CRLs or sharded CRLs, which allows a CRL download to be smaller, so there is less delay for the browser user.</p>
<p>The ballot should not provide any impact to the services from your CA. If you do not get CRL support, it will be available in 2024. OCSP responses will stay available from all CAs that are trusted by Windows.</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support both CRL and OCSP for TLS certificates.</p>

<p>Symmetric <a>encryption</a> (or “private key” encryption) is the process of using a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. It’s called “private key” because the use of a single encryption key necessitates that the key is always kept private.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption is a widely-used form of cryptography that provides organizations and users with a faster, more readily deployable form of security for large data sets.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption is often used for high-volume data processing where speed, efficiency, and complexity are important. However, due to its nature as a single-key solution, it presents several security challenges when it comes to actually sharing encrypted data. For this reason, symmetric encryption is often combined with asymmetric encryption (which uses different keys for encryption and decryption) in many modern secure communication protocols.</p>
 
How Does Symmetric Encryption Work? 
<p>Generally, encryption works by translating plain text into encoded (cipher) text using an algorithm and a secret key that is, theoretically, computationally infeasible to crack.</p>
<p>The general process of encryption works as follows:</p>
 
 Key Generation: A secret key is generated using advanced mathematical equations that is used to encode data. This key is shared between sender and receiver to maintain the obfuscation of the data. 
 Encryption: The encoding process uses complex algorithms and random environmental data (called “entropy”) to transform the original data is usually complex and involves multiple rounds of transformation to ensure the ciphertext is not easily decipherable without the key. 
 Decryption: Upon receiving the data, the recipient uses the same key to decode the data–essentially, reversing the process with the key serving as the information needed to “unlock” that data. 
 
<p>Additionally, symmetric encryption algorithms will usually come in one of two forms:</p>
 
 Stream Ciphers: Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext messages one bit at a time. They create an arbitrarily long keystream of bits, which is then combined with the plaintext bits one by one to produce the ciphertext. 
 Block Ciphers: Block ciphers take a chunk, or block, of data and transform it. It then works through the data set block by block. Some block ciphers will repeatedly encrypt blocks for added security. 
 
 How Does Symmetric Encryption Compare to Asymmetric Encryption? 
<p>As the name implies, symmetric encryption works through a sense of symmetry between both ends (encryption and decryption) of the process. <a>Asymmetric encryption</a> is the opposite–it uses a different key for each process..</p>
<p>Accordingly, the biggest challenge in symmetric encryption is the secure distribution of the key. Since the same key is used by all parties involved, it must be shared… which presents its own problems in terms of securing keys.</p>
<p>Conversely, asymmetric encryption doesn’t require this kind of sharing. Only one key (the public key) is shared, and it is only used for encoding data and cannot be used to compromise encrypted data.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Symmetric Key Encryption? 
<p>This article has touched on the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods, differences that provide context for how symmetric methods benefit users and enterprises.</p>
<p>Some of the key bonuses of symmetric encryption include:</p>
 
 Speed: Symmetric algorithms are generally less computationally intensive as compared to their asymmetric counterparts. That makes them faster and less computationally intensive than asymmetric ones–perfect for encrypting large amounts of data. 
 Simplicity: Symmetric encryption involves only one key for both encryption and decryption, which can simplify key management, especially for contexts where key sharing isn’t a major concern. 
 Bandwidth: Data encoded with symmetric algorithms are generally smaller in size, which can help with bandwidth concerns if that is an issue. 
 
<p>It isn’t an “all-or-nothing” approach, however. Many systems or algorithms will combine both symmetric and asymmetric methods in a single process to leverage the strengths of both. combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption.</p>
 What Are Use Cases for Symmetric Key Encryption? 
<p>Generally speaking, there are a few cases where symmetric encryption is suitable. Namely, when a system needs to perform fast encryption, where there are large amounts of data to encrypt, and/or where key sharing isn’t a concern.</p>
<p>Within those criteria are several different use cases where symmetric encryption shines:</p>
 
 File and Disk Encryption: For encrypting files, databases, or entire drives, symmetric methods are the gold standard. 
 Bulk Data Encryption: In situations where large amounts of data need to be encrypted, symmetric encryption is typically the most practical method due to its speed and efficiency compared to asymmetric encryption. 
 Hybrid Algorithms: While asymmetric solutions solve some critical security issues, they are grossly inefficient when it comes to encrypting data efficiently. Thus hybrid systems will use asymmetric approaches to secure keys and verify user identities while using symmetric algorithms to actually encrypt data. 
 
<p>The most well-known application of a hybrid approach is Secure Socket Layers (SSL), currently renamed and refined as Transport Layer Security (TLS). These technologies are used as a “tunneling” method to create secure and persistent connection between machines. To accomplish this, SSL and TLS protocols actually use combinations of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to strengthen security.</p>
 What Are Different Types of Symmetric Encryption? 
<p>There isn’t a limit on how many encryption algorithms exist. Some of the more popular, or at least well-known, symmetric algorithms around include:</p>
 
 <a>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>: This is currently one of the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithms, supported for national security (by NIST) and industrial applications. There are several different complexities of AES (with 128-bit and 256-bit being the most common) that represent increasing levels of security. 
 Data Encryption Standard (DES): Primarily used decades ago, this symmetric algorithm has effectively been cracked and is no longer considered secure. It has been deprecated in favor of Triple DES or, in cases of federal or industrial encryption standards, AES. 
 Triple DES (3DES): This is an extension of the now-defunct DES algorithm that processes plaintext blocks three times for additional security, with a significant tradeoff with performance. 
 Blowfish and Twofish: These are block ciphers designed as alternatives to DES. Blowfish has a block size of 64 bits, while Twofish has a block size of 128 bits. Twofish was one of the finalists in the competition that selected AES. 
 
<p>Remember, no matter which algorithm or cipher type you use, the security of symmetric encryption relies heavily on keeping the encryption key secret and using a secure method to distribute the key when necessary.</p>
 1Kosmos BlockID and Encrypted Identity Management 
<p>Encryption is a critical part of identity management and authentication. With our private and permissioned blockchain, we leverage symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods to ensure that identity and authentication credentials (including <a>biometrics</a>) remain secure, that users are properly verified, and that decentralized devices can safely access the system.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you get the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure that there are no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out of the box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>When you hear business and crypto, chances are you might think of two totally different subjects.</p><p>The history of crypto has been a rocky one: much trial, error, and bad actors beating to the pulse to grab a share of a digital future. This paper outlines the future of business being crypto. Further, how cash flow, seamless transactions, and protocols as a service are catalysts for a global economy without borders, bank fees, or&nbsp;silos.</p><p>There persists a widespread misunderstanding that crypto assets hold 0 intrinsic value due to their absence of cash flows. This fallacy arises from a public tendency to equate crypto solely with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with digital gold — “Since gold does not produce cash flow, crypto can’t either” type of&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Below we look at the top 25 ‘crypto’ projects by revenue in the past year. In this graph, you can see layer 1 Blockchains &amp; DeFi Protocols. The latter includes Layer 2 solutions, NFT marketplaces, Liquid staking derivatives, and more. By this chart you will see traditional business “cash flow” is now replaced by&nbsp;fees.</p>Link to <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal">Token&nbsp;Terminal</a><p>Fees</p><p>The name of the game is now access to services and products, and contributing to sustainable practice by micro fees. No, this is not the bank sneaking surcharges into your account so they can make a quick $. This is clear as day, operating, and action-oriented production fees allow a certain mechanism to stay standing. You’ll see fees can be paid to end users and protocols alike. Below will grid different examples of fees, revenue, and cash flow mechanisms in Decentralized Finance&nbsp;today:</p><p>Interested in seeing where all these different cash flows go and exist in crypto? Websites like <a href="https://cryptofees.info/">https://cryptofees.info/</a> offer leaderboards on who has the most action going&nbsp;on.</p><a href="https://cryptofees.info/">https://cryptofees.info/</a><p>Revenue Models</p><p>Now that it is confirmed and shown that revenue does, can, and will exist on a blockchain — let’s jump into different revenue models shown from the examples&nbsp;above.</p>  Ethereum (ETH)  <p>Think of Ethereum as the world’s first mega, decentralized supercomputer. Applications can run on top of the network and facilitate a value exchange between two or more parties. This requires two key&nbsp;steps:</p>  Adding up who owes what to whom (i.e. compute) then&nbsp;⬇️  Validating / Verifying that a transaction has occurred -&gt; updating the new account balance of both interactors (i.e. consensus)  <p>Ethereum is the protocol of selling computation and consensus as two functions to settle transactions between&nbsp;parties.</p> How does this make money? It’s time to get&nbsp;gas. <p>Ethereum earns revenue through transaction fees, known as “gas fees”. Gas fees are paid by users of DApps to have their transactions computed and stored on the Ethereum&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>In the current state of the web, businesses bear the costs of computing and storage provided by cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the blockchain world, users themselves shoulder these expenses, which are essentially Ethereum’s revenues.</p><p>Just as revenues are determined by Quantity sold * Unit price, Ethereum’s transaction fees are calculated by Gas used * Price per unit of gas,&nbsp;where:</p><p>- Gas is the measure of how much computational resource is required to process a transaction. Simple operations, like a user sending some ETH to another, have low gas intensity. Complex operations, like pricing derivatives with the Black-Scholes formula for an options protocol, are more computationally intensive and require higher&nbsp;gas.</p><p>- Price per unit of gas is denominated in Ethereum’s native currency ETH, specifically in gwei (a subunit of ETH). 1 billion gwei is equal to 1 ETH. The price per unit of gas consists of two components: the base fee, dynamically set by the network based on demand (higher during network congestion), and the priority fee, set by the user as a tip to the validator. Validators have the authority to prioritize transactions based on the gas prices offered (see diagram below). This means gas prices are determined through a competitive bidding mechanism where users compete to have their transactions included in&nbsp;blocks.</p>GIF <a href="https://tenor.com/view/ethereum-ether-favor-exchange-favorex-bitcoin-meme-gif-21793117">link&nbsp;source</a><p>Wrapping the above text together, Ethereum’s transaction fee paid by users is Gas * (base fee + priority&nbsp;fee).</p><p>For example, let’s say Alice wants to send Bob 1 ETH. The transaction’s computational work is 21,000 gas, the base fee is 10 gwei and Alice includes a tip of 2 gwei. Then Alice’s total gas fee would be 21,000 x (10 + 2) = 252,000 gwei or 0.000252&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>Transaction fees and analytics on gas prices are a leading indicator to understand demand and network congestion on Ethereum. The primary driver of this demand and congestion comes from Decentralized Finance. For this, we will next look at the Unicorn of DeFi,&nbsp;<a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>.</p> 2. Uniswap&nbsp;(UNI) <p>Uni who swap? An Explanation:</p><p>Uniswap solved one simple problem in decentralized finance and has pioneered: Swapping ERC 20 tokens. Uniswap by profile is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and in 2023, has rolled out expansion products such as a <a href="https://wallet.uniswap.org/">mobile wallet</a> and <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol">UniswapX</a>.</p>Dex Metrics <a href="https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics">Image&nbsp;source</a><p>As you can see, Uniswap dominates trading on chain (DEX). Uniswap enables trading in a new-age fashion, as opposed to traditional centralized exchanges, with Coinbase as an example. Traditional exchanges utilize an order book, which lists the buy and sell orders of traders, then matches them based on compatible prices.</p><p>Uniswap, in opposition, relies on liquidity pools Liquidity pools are reserves of token pairs (e.g. ETH &amp; USDC) that are contributed by Liquidity Providers (LPs). Anyone can become an LP by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token. Traders then trade against these liquidity pools, rather than directly against each other. This design called an Automated Market Maker (AMM), has gained popularity in the DeFi ecosystem as an alternative to order book-based trading systems. Advantages of AMMs include no counterparty risk and lower barriers to becoming a market maker. A disadvantage however is that there could be a lack of price efficiency. AMMs operate based on a predefined<a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf"> mathematical formula</a> to determine prices. As a result, prices offered may not always reflect the true asset value (although in reality, much of the price differences get arbitraged away by traders). This can lead to slippage and potentially unfavorable trading prices, particularly for larger&nbsp;trades.</p><p>So, what about cash&nbsp;flow?</p><p>Uniswap fees are a function of trading volume and take&nbsp;rate.</p>  Trading Volume: Uniswap, since launching in 2018, has facilitated ~$1.5 trillion in trading volumes. Trading volumes, which are positively correlated with crypto prices, have been negatively affected by the crypto market downturn.  Take Rate: Uniswap’s take rate has changed with version upgrades. V1 and V2 had a model of fixed 30 basis point (bps) fees, while V3, released in May 2021, introduced a tiered system consisting of 5 bps, 30 bps and 100 bps for different pools. This mix shift has compressed the average take rate from 30 bps to approximately 15 bps. UNI token holders can propose and vote on additional fee&nbsp;levels.  <p>Currently, Uniswap directs all trading fees to LPs without allocating any portion to the Uniswap DAO/token holders. This strategy aims to strengthen its network effect and maintain a competitive edge over rivals, perhaps similar to traditional tech platforms’ reinvestment model of sacrificing short-term profitability to build a moat. The optimal allocation of protocol fees between providers of work (in this case LPs) and providers of capital (i.e. token holders) is a recurring debate in crypto communities.</p><p>The Uniswap DAO has also previously discussed implementing a “fee switch” to redirect some fees to UNI token holders, but the proposal was not passed due to concerns about timing and the resultant liquidity levels. An added concern, particularly in the US, is whether sharing fees with the UNI holders would classify Uniswap as an unregistered security. As Uniswap solidifies its network effect and regulatory clarity improves, the fee allocation strategy may&nbsp;evolve.</p> Conclusion, Ocean Protocol, and the&nbsp;Future <p>Ocean Protocol is an open-source toolkit to enable the next generation of value flow on a blockchain and surcharge a New Data Economy.

 Radicle Civics — Building Proofs of Possibilities for a Civic Economy and&nbsp;Society <blockquote>“Like an operating system, the medium of infrastructure space makes certain things possible and other things impossible. It is not the declared content but rather the content manager dictating the rules of the game.” — Keller Easterling, Extrastatecraft (2014).</blockquote><p>Our infrastructures are vital to enabling the complexity of modern life. Yet the role they have in creating technological, institutional, and behavioural path dependencies is often underestimated. Once they’re built, they continue to drive how we organise society for decades or even centuries through habituation, vested interests, and economies of scale and scope. This happens in often intangible, counterintuitive, and destructive ways. In other words, we shape our infrastructures and thereafter they shape us, and so&nbsp;on…</p><p>André Gorz describes this cyclical logic in his essay ‘<a href="https://unevenearth.org/2018/08/the-social-ideology-of-the-motorcar/">The Social Ideology of the Motorcar</a>’: “The car has made the big city uninhabitable. It has made it stinking, noisy, suffocating, dusty, so congested that nobody wants to go out in the evening anymore. Thus, since cars have killed the city, we need faster cars to escape on superhighways to suburbs that are even farther away…Give us more cars so that we can escape the destruction caused by&nbsp;cars.”</p><p>Economic infrastructures are no different from our roads and concrete jungles. They too have locked us into extractive and harmful pathways. Capital, markets, (intellectual) property regimes, land registries, GDP and other performance metrics, make up seemingly axiomatic cornerstones of our societies, yet they’re based on deliberately narrow, centralised definitions of value that encourage myopic, extractive behaviour. Looking through Eric Beinhocker’s lens of the “<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/gp/article-abstract/1/1/17578/112212/Toward-a-New-Ontological-Framework-for-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext">ontology stack</a>”, GDP unfolds itself as not just a metric, but the tip of the iceberg of a layered economic infrastructure with an embedded worldview: one that perceives and positions humans as rational, profit-maximising, disembedded beings.</p> Infrastructural and imaginative lock-ins <p>These structural constraints in our economies and societies are now locking us in. We are facing multiple, interconnected crises of the climate, ecosystem, economic inequality, and democracy. These crises are not a crisis of the world, but of our relationship with the world, and how we understand ourselves. We are facing a deep code&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Our current code was written by Enlightenment thinkers, who developed the narrative of autonomous beings, endowed with individual rights and liberty, abstracted from the world around us. To be human, is to think. Nature is a mere backdrop against which humans live out history (<a href="https://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/article/the-lifeworlds-of-law-on-revitalizing-indigenous-legal-orders-today/">Mills, 2016</a>), or even worse, an infinite resource to be mined and consumed. Industrialisation, capitalism, and consumerism have further abstracted humans from being human and remade us into “bad robots” through our alienated labour and that of others. As Edmund Burke cautioned the Enlightenment-inspired revolutionaries, “liberty, too, must be limited in order to be possessed.” And the erosion of these limits, whether these limits are our responsibility to our social or ecological bonds, are in turn, eroding our ability to enjoy liberty&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This centuries-long ontological division between human-nature and production-reproduction has been hardwired into our regulatory, financial, and built infrastructures. It has not only allowed us to dominate, exploit, discard, and waste, but structurally locked us into this reality. We are reaping the consequences in the form of a self-terminating crisis where the things we dismissed as externalities are now threatening our very existence. Whilst many propose patches and quick fixes to the symptoms, we hypothesise that the only way out is to recode ourselves and our being-in-the-world. To build on Easterling, when the “rules of the game” are broken, it’s time to change&nbsp;them.</p><p>What we need is to reconceptualise ourselves as inalienably interconnected and relational beings, as a knot of flows. We need a relational worldview that sees our lives, our cities, our societies, as complex organisms comprising socio-ecological systems and webs of relationships (<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003199816/sacred-civics-jayne-engle-julian-agyeman-tanya-chung-tiam-fook">Engle 2022</a>). We need to redesign our infrastructures so that they centre this complex entanglement and enable all beings — be they humans, future humans, and more-than-humans — to individually and collectively thrive.</p><p>What does it mean to see the world through the lens of ‘knots of flows’? Let’s explore this through a seemingly simple dining table. This table starts from soil to trees, from trees to lumber, from lumber through multiple stages of processing and transportation, to becoming a table, which then will be used for eating, playing, drawing, and working, providing numerous flows of social, economic, cultural, and emotional value. Over time, the table will be resold and recycled, enter into different homes with different flows of value, or be turned into materials for new tables, chairs, or paper, which will in turn be composted, returned to the soil, and transformed into new flows of&nbsp;value.</p> Germinating new civic futures with proofs of possibilities <p>Bruno Latour said, “Change the instruments, and you will change the entire social theory that goes with them.” Over the last six months, Dark Matter Labs has been trying to do precisely this with our Radicle Civics portfolio: changing instruments and civic infrastructures to enable a new social theory that recognises our entanglement and centres interdependence, care, and deep democracy.</p><p>The focus on civics is a fundamental one, because to address this deep code problem we must even preempt assumptions of a social contract with a state or a government. Civics for us extends far beyond conventional representative democracies, bordered places, and central jurisdictions. Civics starts instead with the most elemental of our social relationships: our mutual interdependencies from which forms of social organisation emerge. In this sense, reimagining civics is about both process and outcome. It requires us to expand our understanding of citizens who partake in these interdependencies to include humans and more-than-humans, and to reconfigure the ways in which we collectively relate and interact with one another, towards non-coercive, empathic, caring, and peer-to-peer systems. It is through this reimagining of civics that we can cultivate renewed civic capital and resilience that can serve to act as bulwark against any over-concentration of power, intentional or otherwise, while enabling collective thriving.</p><p>With the financial and strategic support of <a href="https://p4ne.org/">Partners for A New Economy,</a> <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/">Scottish Land Commission</a>, and <a href="https://weareopus.org/">Opus Independents</a>, Radicle Civics has been building a vibrant ecosystem of diverse partners including the River Dôn Project, Law and Political Economy Europe, and the Design Museum London (and more to be announced). Together, we have sowed the seeds for new civic infrastructures through a number of ‘proofs of possibilities’: visceral experiences and situated experiments that embody a new logic for how we can relate to each other and our environment, how we can recognize value beyond markets and money, and how we can nurture a deeper democratic agency. They are akin to what Erik Olin Wright has called “<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/2143-envisioning-real-utopias">real utopias</a>” or what Giorgos Kallis refers to as “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24537850">incubators of counter-hegemony</a>”: not distant fantasies but concrete and contextual manifestations of alternative futures that help render new paradigms part of our ‘everyday’. They do this not just by updating our shared civic protocols, but also through ‘common sense’ in Isabelle Stenger’s meaning of “making sense in common”, with communities in their contexts.</p><p>Our vision for a new ‘everyday’ focuses on our relationships with our homes, land, and rivers. These natural and built infrastructures are so foundational to our everyday lives that they provide the ideal leverage points in which we can explore, reshape, and practise different ways of being and relating in the world together. In particular, they aim to demonstrate how reshaping the dark matter of our systems reshape possible futures. It is in our everyday experiences that we can uncover, in the words of David Graeber, “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world, […] that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.”</p><p>So what would it look like to liberate our homes, land, and rivers from the logic of objectification, dominion, and extraction coded into our current economy? What would it mean to transcend alienation from our planetary entanglement and acknowledge that no-body and no-thing can be owned or dominated by another? How could our shared infrastructures be free, and in their freedom, generate freedom for us and the world around us? These provocations for emancipated civic infrastructures are embodied in four proofs of possibilities:</p>  FreeHouse (in collaboration with <a href="https://moos.space/about/">Moos Space</a> in&nbsp;Berlin)  FreeLand (in collaboration with <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/">the Scottish Land Commission</a> and <a href="https://halifax.citynews.ca/2023/06/27/funding-for-new-mikmaw-friendship-centre-in-halifax-close-to-50-million/">the new Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre</a>)  FreeRiver (<a href="https://www.theriverdon.org/">The River Dôn&nbsp;Project</a>)  FreeSpace (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------">Re:permissioning the&nbsp;city</a>)  <p>We will highlight our work on FreeHouse, FreeRiver, and FreeSpace in more detail below, while we will publish a separate piece on FreeLand in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>We’ve attempted to distil our collective exploration and experimentation into three critical shifts in worldview. We believe these form the embryonic shoots for a new social theory and its corresponding civic infrastructures: a shift from objects to agents, from externalities to entanglements, and from public-private to commoning. Each of our proofs of possibilities sits at the intersection of these foundational shifts as manifestations of this worldview.</p> Worldview shift 1: From objects to&nbsp;agents <p>Western law allows us to become property owners and through that gain exclusive control to exploit and extract economic value from things framed as ‘property’ such as homes and land. In <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Contract+and+Domination-p-9780745636214">Contract and Domination,</a> Carole Pateman shows how property rights were used to justify the colonisation of land, the monopolisation of scarce resources, and the privatisation of value extraction while commoning its consequences. Rather than simply tinkering at the edges of property ownership and circumscribing its social and ecological impacts, Radicle Civics is exploring a shift in the very roots of this system. Instead of seeing humans as subjects and the Earth as objects and commodities, can we recognise ‘selfhood’ and agency of everything, from flora and fauna, to rivers, the land, and the homes we build there? Instead of ownership, can we reimagine ties with the land and the Earth as part of a network of relationships built on care, mutuality, and reciprocity in a community of humans and more-than-humans?</p><p>Ownership is one theory of control and can only ever optimise for one output: the exclusive interests of the owners. It is structurally not designed to optimise for multiple entangled stakeholders, interests, and benefits. Instead, these are only considered when different owners’ rights are in conflict, or through regulations that limit the exercise of these rights in narrow contexts. These are blunt mechanisms for the complexity of our systemic crises. When we see the world from an entangled value proposition, we recognise a fundamental need to move beyond ownership to a relational model. The self-ownership of land, rivers, and houses allows us to subvert the existing system of ownership by ruling out the possibility of an owner. Without the owner’s dominating control, these beings can exercise agency for their own needs, in relation to one another. Rather than property contracts that would transfer exclusive rights, we would enter into care and stewardship relationships that would balance rights and responsibilities between the needs of equal&nbsp;beings.</p><p>So what could this self-ownership of land or rivers look like? How might we imagine their enfranchisement? For this, we are building on the wisdom of different Indigenous peoples that have traditionally granted great stature to nature and future generations and found ways to speak on their behalf, as well as the growing Rights of Nature movement. Radicle Civics is exploring how we can harness assistive technologies and alternative governance design to effectively realise the agency of more-than-human actors and usher in a cultural shift beyond Anthropocentrism.</p><p>Our current technologies of bureaucracy are still extensions of analogue models — ‘paperwork’ still has a literal meaning, even if the pages are digital. And the way we currently use these bureaucratic technologies to manage the world as objects has reductionist tendencies. With the availability of abundant data and our capability to process it orders of magnitude greater, this is no longer a constraint, but in fact an enabler of an agent-based worldview. With tools like digital twins, we now can dynamically and non-exclusively identify, organise, and interact with this information while ensuring it is constantly verified with reality. When applied to governance, computational bureaucracy can support plurality and coherence, as demonstrated by machine learning tools like <a href="https://pol.is/home">Polis</a>, and at planetary and hyperlocal scales simultaneously. Distributed protocols, such as blockchain, of verifying, transacting, making sense and decisions can be done with integrity without relying on central authorities. By treating these as assistive technologies that allow us to interact with an agent-based worldview, it serves an ennobling function, allowing humans, more-than-humans and machines to interact in a peer-to-peer way, and operationalise this new vision of&nbsp;civics.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeRiver — River Dôn Project and Interface for&nbsp;Care</p><p>Together with <a href="https://weareopus.org/">Opus Independents</a> and a group of partners, including Lawyers for Nature, Sheffield Hallam University, Urban Flows Observatory: The University of Sheffield, Sheffield Data for Good, Urban Flows Observatory, South Yorkshire Sustainability Centre, and Don Catchment Rivers Trust, we are working on the <a href="https://www.theriverdon.org/">River Dôn Project</a>. The project aims to create an alternative model for relating to the River Don through recognising its personhood and hopes to unlock new ways of seeing, understanding, valuing, empathising with and caring for the River as an&nbsp;agent.</p><p>Building on our <a href="https://civic-ai.org/connectedurbanforest/">CivicAI work</a>, Dark Matter Labs is working on designing an Interface for Care to engender new caring relationships and stewardship action for the river. Our Interface for Care will use a mix of interfaces, from chatbots to augmented reality, to feedback ecosystem data tangibly and meaningfully. This will grow our collective intelligence and cultivate deep empathy and a sense of belonging with the river ecosystem. Through different expressive media, we will explore how the river can best communicate its needs and values. Can a river write a poem to express its hurt over being polluted? Would a heart-to-heart conversation empower communities to take proactive action to care for the river? We will explore how an evolving empathic relationship built through the Interface can be leveraged for citizens entering into new types of stewardship agreements with the river around specific individual and collective actions of care. The Interface will capture input from citizens on their care actions, and complete the feedback loop by expressing the positive impact of their agency as part of an iterative process of learning to deepen and evolve care. The Interface also explores how a care economy around the river can be built, such as by guiding human behaviour towards better stewardship via social (rather than financial) incentives, such as thank you letters and&nbsp;art.</p> Worldview shift 2: From externalities to entanglements <p>The <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~jfarley/EEseminar/readings/energy%20myths.pdf">original sin of modern economics</a> according to Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen is the illusion that our economies do not depend on resources, energy, and waste sinks, and can thus continue to expand exponentially. Companies have been allowed to maximise profits by commandeering ‘nature’s gifts’ as cheaply as possible, while absolving them of any obligation to repair, restore, or replenish what they take. A <a href="https://grist.org/business-technology/none-of-the-worlds-top-industries-would-be-profitable-if-they-paid-for-the-natural-capital-they-use/">study by Trucost</a> found that none of the world’s top industries would be profitable if they paid for the natural capital they use. The total unpriced natural capital consumed cost our planet $7.3 trillion a year — 13 percent of global GDP in 2009. This damage is simply treated by our economic system as ‘externalities’, external to the interests and liabilities ascribed to the owner, with these true costs falling on everyone and everything else. In other words, externalities are convenient fiction enabled by property, the arbitrary premise that property and its value can be enclosed from the world around&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>“Categories such as ‘away’ have evaporated: one doesn’t throw a candy wrapper away, one drops it on Mount Everest” — Timothy Morton, Humankind.</blockquote><p>Externalities are not just an accounting glitch: they are a denial of our complex entanglement (as Barry Commoner stated in one of his laws of ecology, “Everything Is Connected To Everything Else” ) and a structural flaw in our economic theory of value. In realising we live in a resource-scarce world, we should also recognise that value should not be enclosable and alienated from the world around it, but that value is relational and entangled with the world. In a worldview that sees agents, not objects, value comes from relationships between agents (for example, the value of a tree as a habitat to an insect). But value can also be an emergent property of this complex system of relationships (for example, from individual relationships of habitation between flora, fauna, and geography emerges the biodiversity value of the ecosystem). Once we accept the complexity of entanglement, our theory of value also becomes necessarily complex. We are starting to sketch out loose taxonomies to help us transition our worldview and economy from an extractive to entangled understanding of value, starting with the&nbsp;house:</p><p>This entangled theory of value will in turn shape our decision-making: what should our civic infrastructures be designed to value, prioritise, and encourage? In turn, how might our <a href="https://www.civic.capital/">civic financial models </a>(across regulation, investment, accounting, taxation, insurance and procurement) evolve to account for this multi-dimensional, entangled and longitudinal forms of value, and leverage the institutional and private capital needed to solve the complex social and environmental challenges created by the legacy of externalities? For example, compare an uncomfortable, energy-inefficient, rent-seeking house built unsustainably to a house that is designed in harmony with the environment, its inhabitants, and society: does our current economic system truly account for the full difference in value between the two? If not, what would a new economy and housing model for the latter look like? We hope to explore these questions through our proof of possibility.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeHouse</p><p>The house is a widely familiar and relatable space; it also sits at the intersection of economic, social and environmental systems, making it an ideal site for experimentation for this entangled theory of value. What if the house is no longer a property to be bought and sold like any other commodity? Instead, the house is self-owning entity that embodies a knot of value flows: the value of materials into and out of the house when it is constructed and deconstructed; the value of flood risk reduction from sustainable urban drainage approach; the value of the energy the house generates, uses, and contributes back to the grid; the value of its role in the ecosystem of organisms that live in and around it; the value of its sustainable construction as a carbon store; the value of ‘home’ for belonging and mental well-being; and the value of being a constituent part of a wider community.</p><p>When the house is recognised as a knot of value flows, and that these flows have multiple beneficiaries and multiple liability holders, how can we reimagine and invest in the house, not as a vehicle for speculation and extraction but as a generator of common benefits? To realise this theory of value, we are testing these critical components:</p><p>1. Generative financing and decision-making driven by entangled common&nbsp;value</p><p>The house embodies the creation of multiple value through energy generation, food production, social interactions, ecosystem services, etc. Instead of extracting rent, this entangled theory of value is an opportunity to design a generative business model that maximises the house’s creation of this common value, while allowing the house to sustain itself in the long term, such as maintenance and servicing its own loans. We will be designing the frameworks needed to make these value flows and relationships legible, such as entangled value mapping. We will also be scoping the infrastructure needed to make this value operationalisable, both tradeable systems (such as outcome buying and multi-valent currencies) to non-tradeable systems (such as that of care and gratitude).</p><p>The theory of entangled value will influence our decision-making process. Short of the house being fully autonomous in exercising its agency, we will be designing the kind of governance and decision-making structures needed to help it achieve its generative mission, rather than serving the private interests of owners. These structures will also accommodate the participation of the house’s both human and more-than-human neighbours and interdependent stakeholders.</p><p>2. Commons governance for cohabitation</p><p>From an agent-to-agent perspective, use value is generated through the relationship between houses and their inhabitants. Currently, we are exploring the design of stewardship agreements, drawing inspiration from Michel Serres’ concept of <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/9725/natural_contract">The Natural Contract</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/traditional-ecological-knowledge">Traditional Ecological Knowledge</a> in order to actualise our entangled relationships with the systems that sustain us. These agreements would balance the right to live in the FreeHouse with the responsibility to care for it and the relationships it has with the world around it. In other words, this stewardship relationship is multilateral: in return for an affordable comfortable home, inhabitants may undertake responsibilities that involve maintaining the house, promoting the flourishing of wildlife, and also being a responsible member of the local community.</p><p>Housing inequality emerges from systemic misallocation: wealth accumulation enabled by property often leads to excluding others from fulfilling their fundamental housing needs and addressing broader societal and environmental concerns, including climate transition and mental wellbeing. In other words, property has a social function and the right of exclusion also comes at a societal opportunity cost. A self-owning house already exempts it from a market-based approach to resource allocation. But we are exploring alternative approaches to decide who gets to live in a FreeHouse, by moving beyond a mere reallocation of use rights to fostering a culture of cohabitation. We are starting a new civic conversation with potential residents over what is a fair balance between needs for ‘homeliness’ and opportunity costs for the wider community of agents, including those who may not reside in the house or immediate neighbourhood.</p><p>3. Materials on loan from the&nbsp;commons</p><p>Material value encompasses both the advantages of agents possessing materials for their function, the responsibility to avoid wastefulness, and the opportunity cost of those materials serving other functions. The choice of materials used in constructing a house can profoundly influence the environment and the well-being of its occupants.</p><p>What if the materials used in the construction of the house are leased instead of owned? A fully circular economy that avoids resource depletion has indisputably greater value than our current model of unsustainably extracting new resources without considering their subsequent reuse. How this full circularity emerges will require a system-level infrastructure for enforcing the long-term responsibilities of possessing materials. Currently, we are exploring the idea of a Carbon Storage Lease, which involves testing whether a long-term or perpetual instrument like a lease agreement can be utilised to ensure that carbon remains stored throughout the lifecycle of materials such as&nbsp;timber.</p> Worldview shift 3: From public-private to commoning <p>We’re continuing to use approaches designed for another era to tackle challenges of today, opting for one-size-fits-all or centralised responses that were limited by the quality and quantity of information and technology available. In the age of increased uncertainty with complex, interconnected challenges, these approaches are increasingly showing their age. These challenges transcend our constructs of boundaries, departments, and disciplines: global problems such as pandemics, climate change, or growing inequality can not simply be solved by one government, or even a coalition of governments. Simultaneously, the growing abundance of mass sensing and data has the potential to provide public benefits, but also bring with them the risks of power and information asymmetries, vulnerabilities, and abuse of privacy from the centralisation of such data. We have reached the edge of our theory of control: we need to reconsider the ways in which we make decisions over shared resources, beyond carving out domains of exclusive control.</p><p>Radicle Civics explores how commoning (or <a href="https://thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.927">“becoming in common</a>” as Andrea Nightingale describes it) can usher in a new age of planetary collaboration and unbounded fluidity in the way we use our resources, materials, and spaces and solution for our shared risks. This shift will simultaneously require and cultivate a major reorientation around new collective intelligence models and social and civic capital. We are already seeing the potential of these multi-capital systems manifested: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/12/31/trees-planted-councils-die-rush-job-show-green-credentials/">a tree planted by some local authorities has a chance for survival as low as 10%, while a tree cared for properly by a community should have over a 90% chance of survival</a>, an illustration of the difference between centralised management and distributed care. We are exploring how we can leverage technology to activate pre-existing economies of care and build new ones. Technologies such as distributed computing, ledgers, and smart contracts, can be used to both build new sense-making and learning capabilities, helping align actions among multiple stakeholders, reducing associated costs, and advancing the generative, plus-sum value of collaboration.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeSpace and Permissioning the&nbsp;City</p><p>Most of us are familiar with seeing rivers or land as commons: but how about commoning applied to vacant buildings? Our cities are full of under-utilised spaces as a result of the pandemic, the evolution of work, and demographic and economic restructuring. However, we currently do not have any fiscal incentives or regulatory frameworks in place to leverage these assets for our collective benefit, even though the ongoing underutilisation of these assets incurs a societal cost. With FreeSpace, we are exploring how we can unlock a city’s public and private spatial assets for civic use through new types of commoning, such as using micro-stewardship smart contracts and peer-to-peer deliberation with other agents. It asks how we can encourage a practice of commoning and culture of stewardship towards shared urban assets that goes beyond traditional rental or ownership models. For instance, can we transform a vacant office space into a partial commons by overlaying common ways of governing of a specific space — for instance a shared kitchen — or for a specific duration — such as monthly Tuesday evenings, and do so while measuring and ensuring the impact is net-positive on its interdependent stakeholders? Our Korea team recently published how they are building this experiment of new civic allocation in the context of Daegu city with <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4">Re:permissioning the&nbsp;City.</a></p> Three shifts towards a new&nbsp;economy <p>As Denise Hearn describes, “how we construct monetary, financial, and economic systems is not an exercise of cold calculation. Our systems, more accurately, are an expression of our cultural, philosophical, and even religious views about who we are as a species and how to best organise society.” We have identified three shifts in our worldviews that we believe to be critical in how we should relate to each other and the world as a reimagining of civics from its very roots. By recognising the world as interdependent agents, from which distributed and dynamic ways of organising and commoning can emerge, we hope this redefinition of civics can not only have implications for how we coexist, but also brings with it a new thesis of economics.</p><p>When we move beyond treating beings as economic objects for extraction (assets) to recognise the the subjecthood inherent in every being, when we unlock these beings’ capability to partake in decentralised monetary production to structure their own value flows, when we account for plus-sum behaviours such as care, trust, gifting, and collective knowing, these shifts in the axioms of our economic system open up new pathways of progress, and allow us escape out of the deepening rut caused by our previous system. And we believe the proofs of possibility we have chosen to work on, the self-owning economic agent (FreeHouse), interfaces for caring for agents (FreeRiver), and methods for agent-to-agent deliberation (FreeSpace), will be components critical for this agent-based economic system to become a&nbsp;reality.</p> What’s Next? <p>We hope that the framing of the ontological shifts and proof of possibilities provide a tangible sense of possible futures. In the upcoming months and years, we are continuing to collaborate with diverse partners in various locations, contexts, and lead markets to develop further proofs of possibilities. Through these initiatives, we seek to identify and demonstrate other strategic interventions that open up pathways towards recognising in our cultures and infrastructures the world as a complex relational system.</p><p>There are a few more projects we are cooking at the&nbsp;moment:</p>  FreeHouse Berlin: Creating opportunities for embodied experiences and meaningful civic conversations that foster societal-level imagination and drive profound structural and systemic transformations. This journey begins with the exploration of stewardship agreements, allocation systems, and innovative financial mechanisms, all of which lay the groundwork for the necessary and impactful shifts&nbsp;ahead.  FreeSense: Self-owning surveillance cameras to explore the public value created by sensors, and how they can be governed without centralised control, addressing security and privacy dilemmas.  Civic News City Sheffield: Nurturing deep listening capabilities in Sheffield using the interplay of media and events for deliberation, and creating a new hybrid civic space for ongoing citizen assemblies and collective sensemaking.  Neighbourhood as Commons/ Shared Street Sheffield: Centring neighbourhoods as the foundational unit of change to unlock system-level outcomes (i.e. trust, resilience, well-being, flows of information) and build new capabilities for collective sensemaking and&nbsp;action.  Our ongoing learning circles with diverse experts in citizen science, art and cultural organising, constitutional and contract law, token economics, blockchain and distributed organising and deep dives into our strategic design questions (with deep gratitude to Law and Political Economy Europe, Holochain, da0 civic tech community).

 What are biometrics? 
	
<p>Biometrics are automated methods used to identify an individual or verify/authenticate an individual's identity based on physiological characteristics and behavioral traits. Government and law enforcement agencies often use biometrics to "identify" people (capturing a fingerprint, for example, and comparing it to a database of fingerprints to see if there's a match). Enterprises typically use the "verify/authenticate" type of biometrics, which automates recognition using biological identifiers, such as a facial scan or even one's keystrokes or gait.</p>
	
<p>Some of the most <a href="https://optimalidm.com/resources/blog/types-of-biometrics-sensors">commonly used biometrics</a> include measurable features of:</p>

  Faces 
   Fingerprints 
   Irises 
   Voices 
   Gait 
   Gestures 
   Keystrokes 
   Palm or finger veins 
  How are biometrics used today? 

<p>Some of the practical <a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/market-leadership/publications-media/the-top-9-common-uses-of-biometrics-in-everyday-life/">applications of biometrics</a> in the enterprise and everyday life, include:</p>

  Access to mobile devices

  How do biometrics work? 
<p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-biometrics-how-do-they-work/">Biometrics systems work</a> by comparing data. Systems capture biometric data, convert that data into a digital template, store the template, and analyze the presented biometric — comparing it against the stored template to determine if there is a match.</p>

<p>Because identifiable features, like fingerprint patterns, rarely change, they are ideal for verification purposes. A sensor – such as a fingerprint scanner or camera – can detect and recognize a user's unique characteristics. On some devices, such as an iPhone, the fingerprint is stored on the device itself and is never shared. In other cases, biometrics systems have a database of stored metrics that are used to analyze the recorded metrics against others.</p>
	
 How biometrics applications benefit enterprises 
	
<p>The use of biometrics is clearly revolutionizing the way organizations handle security – and though security is the most common application, there are many others. In the healthcare industry, smart wearable devices use biometrics for health monitoring. Some applications add artificial intelligence (AI) to speed decisioning and detect attempts at unauthorized activities. And others use biometrics to improve operational efficiencies. Here are seven ways biometrics is supporting digital organizations.</p>
	
	 1. Increased accuracy for automated systems 
	
<p>An automated biometric identification system (<a href="https://www.aware.com/automated-biometric-identification-system">ABIS</a>) is a large-scale system that compares recorded biometrics to a massive database of other biometrics. ABIS can be used by enterprises to perform identity checks for new hires or customers, comparing their IDs to those in an existing applicant or criminal database.</p>

<p>In healthcare, providers are starting to use ABIS to identify patients before delivering care to ensure that the right patients are receiving the right treatments. These <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identities</a> can also help reduce identity fraud in any sector. It's harder, for example, to replicate or fake biometrics than it is to steal a password, forge a signature, or use credit card or Social Security numbers. However, generative AI is making it easier to impersonate others, so identity systems that use voice recognition and video will have to evolve to stay ahead of the attackers using AI to create new methods of attack.</p>
	
	 2. Faster and more secure transactions 
	
<p>The use of biometric authentication makes digital transactions more secure by removing the leading cause of breaches: compromised credentials. It also reduces "friction" for legitimate users by eliminating the need to remember a password or enter a code sent to a mobile device. And it reduces the chance that employees and customers will experience security fatigue.</p>

<p>Security fatigue occurs when users become frustrated with repeated, arduous security tasks. It can lead to risky online behavior, such as accepting a push notification to authenticate a login that the user didn't initiate. Attackers are taking advantage of this fatigue by launching <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a> attacks.</p>

<p>To reduce friction, avoid security fatigue, and eliminate the threat of identity-based attacks that rely on the use of stolen credentials (including passwords), organizations are adopting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>. Passwordless authentication offers a variety of ways to verify a user's identity without passwords and include biometric methods, such as facial recognition or a fingerprint scan.</p>
	
	 3. Integration with other technologies 
	
<p>The internet of things (IoT) relates to any internet-connected device that communicates information, often across platforms. Many industries, including manufacturing and healthcare, use IoT devices to share information securely and quickly to employees and customers. In a healthcare setting, this may include a glucose monitor or pacemaker that shares a patient's readings with the patient's doctor. In manufacturing, it may include sensors that relay information from the factory floor to inventory systems or suppliers. All these systems can improve efficiency and information-sharing, but they need to be secure, too, and that's where biometrics comes in.</p>

<p>Biometrics is beginning to integrate into the IoT ecosystem to improve security and the user experience. Not only are biometrics a quicker way to gain access to platforms and apps to receive pertinent information, but they're also a safer way to do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> is crucial to managing authorized access to sensitive information, and biometrics are being used to improve the accuracy of this authorized access. For example, the biometric templates of former business partners could be entered into a list that prevents them from accessing sensitive company information and digital assets after the partnership's dissolution.</p>
	
	 4. Sustained authentication processes 
	
<p>Authentication processes that use biometrics are more sustainable long-term because biometrics is known as an "inherence" factor — in other words, something we are – which rarely changes and is difficult for malicious actors to steal or mimic. Passwords are a knowledge factor – something we know – which means they can be compromised (stolen), shared, intercepted, or cracked, which is getting easier thanks to AI.</p>

<p>Instead of passwords, also known as static shared secrets, organizations are turning to biometrics for verification. It not only streamlines the authentication process but makes it more secure and less subject to compromise for a longer period.</p>
	
	 5. Automated time and attendance tracking 
	
<p>Since organizations are using biometrics to allow access into buildings and digital platforms, they have the ability to automatically track employee and customer attendance. This data can be useful for leadership to analyze the cause of dips in engagement and attendance.</p>

<p>Biometric technology also eliminates the risk of employees logging in on behalf of other employees or sharing passwords. Time tracking is another part of employee behavior that can be prone to user error. To avoid errors in time tracking or time theft, organizations are using biometrics to more accurately manage time logs. This can include camera-based sensors that detect a user, or keystroke recognition software that tells employers how long employees are actually working. This is also easier and less tedious for employees than tracking their time manually.</p>
	
	 6. Streamlined payments and transactions 
	
<p>Payment processing is a crucial function of many digital businesses. Now, all retailers that conduct payment transactions can use biometrics. Shoppers can register for a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/biometric-payment">biometric payment</a> program if they sign up with proper identification and input their biometrics to a secure database provided by the company.</p>

<p>Then, whenever customers want to check out, they can scan their fingerprint instead of reaching for a credit card. This is quicker and safer in many ways, largely because it no longer requires the customer to use a plastic card or account number that someone could potentially steal and use.</p>
	
	 7. Increased employee productivity 
	
<p>The absence of security fatigue can enhance employee productivity. Companies that allow their employees access to resources quickly – without lengthy authentication processes – will likely see a rise in productivity and employee satisfaction. Employees can spend more time on important work tasks and less time remembering complex passwords or submitting help desk tickets when they are locked out of their accounts.</p>

<p>From faster, more secure transactions to automated attendance and time tracking, the growing biometrics market is poised to affect organizations across sectors – and this is only the beginning. Biometrics will continue to advance, streamlining and securing the digital identity experience for employees, partners, and customers – whether they're patients, constituents, students, members, or others. Stay abreast of current technological advancements – the right solutions will propel your organization onward and upward; it's up to you to find and implement them.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The global digital ecosystem finds itself facing a new breed of cyber threat actors: loosely organized groups with a penchant for extortion, chaos, and the desire to gain notoriety. The US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) recently released a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">comprehensive report</a> detailing a series of cyberattacks carried out by a threat group known as Lapsus$. These attacks, which hit a zenith in 2022, targeted a range of high-profile companies and government agencies. They offer a textbook, real-world scenario highlighting systemic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our interconnected digital infrastructure. Let’s delve into the key findings of the CSRB report and the implications they hold for organizations and individuals alike.</p>  
 The Lapsus$ Watershed Moment  
<p>Lapsus$ was arguably a watershed moment because the group orchestrated a series of attacks that shook the cybersecurity community. These attacks were remarkable not because of their sophistication, but rather their effectiveness against even the most well-resourced and well-defended entities. The CSRB's investigation revealed that Lapsus$ thrived on exploiting systemic weaknesses in the digital ecosystem, targeting vulnerabilities in downstream vendors, telecommunications providers, and even employees through social engineering tactics.</p> 
 Lessons in Vulnerability  
<p>One of the most alarming findings from the report is the inadequate nature of current multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations. Lapsus$ and similar groups were able to penetrate organizations by exploiting <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">weaknesses in SMS and voice-based MFA methods</a>. The attackers utilized <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/sim-swapping">SIM swapping</a> attacks to intercept one-time passcodes and push notifications sent via SMS, rendering traditional MFA measures ineffective. The CSRB strongly advocates for a transition to more robust and secure <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/how-passwordless-authentication-works">passwordless authentication methods</a>, specifically Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)2-compliant solutions, to mitigate these risks effectively. Robust FIDO2 solutions include synced passkeys for consumers and device-bound passkeys for workforce authentication.</p> 
 Example of a Fraudulent SIM Swap  
<p></p> 
<p>Source: Review of the Attacks Associated With Lapsus$ and Related Threat Groups, Cyber Safety Review Board, July 24, 2023</p> 
 Access Controls &amp; Third Party Connections  
<p>The report underlines the efficacy of initial access brokers (IABs) and information stealing malware, which allow cybercriminals to purchase valid login credentials for targeted organizations through the dark web. Lapsus$ leveraged these underground markets to gain entry not only to organizations themselves but also to their third-party servicers and business process outsourcers (BPOs). This highlights the importance of considering <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-passwordless-mfa-for-the-supply-chain">third-party risks</a> in an organization's risk management program, because attackers often exploit these relationships to infiltrate their ultimate targets.</p> 
 Securing the Future  
<p>The CSRB report serves as a wake up call to organizations to bolster their cybersecurity defenses and prepare for the continued evolution of new and dynamic attacks which target authentication and identity-related attack vectors. Resilience against threat actor groups like Lapsus$ requires a multifaceted approach. This includes identity verification, continuous <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a>, authentication that eliminates passwords and shared secrets, and well-established incident response procedures that can leverage and share insights from the extended security ecosystem.</p> 
 Rounding Out The Response  
<p>The report acknowledges the crucial role of law enforcement in combating cyber threats but underscores chronic underreporting issues that hinder effective cybersecurity efforts. Furthermore, local law enforcement must have the funding, training and escalation procedures in place to investigate and react in a timely and appropriate manner in order to thwart attack attempts and minimize damage when attacks occur.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>The lessons learned from Lapsus$ are invaluable: the need for stronger authentication methods, comprehensive access controls, a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-power-of-risk-based-authentication-with-hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> approach and collaborative efforts involving both the public and private sectors. As we move forward, the report's recommendations should serve as a roadmap to a safer and more resilient digital future.</p> 
<p>The CSRB report on the Lapsus$ cyber threat actor group serves as a timely reminder of the vulnerabilities that persist within our interconnected digital infrastructure. While the attacks were not carried out by nation-state actors, their impact reverberated globally, highlighting the fragility of our cybersecurity defenses and the need for us all to “do better.”&nbsp;</p>

 Release of official counter fraud guidelines signals another step in the right direction toward fraud prevention in the UK. 



 



<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">May’s fraud strategy paper,</a> the UK government has released official counter fraud guidelines to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, which currently amounts to around £3 billion in losses per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Government Counter Fraud Profession – Fraud Prevention Standard for Counter Fraud Professionals’ <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1170631/3270_GCFP_Prevention_Standard_V.5.pdf">paper i</a>s billed as a resource for counter fraud specialists to refresh their knowledge and plug any gaps in their capability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Writing on LinkedIn, Mark Cheeseman, Chief Executive of the Public Sector Fraud Authority said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is the latest milestone in over a year’s work with experts from across sectors and countries to codify the knowledge, skills and experience for fraud prevention professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those who commit fraud are continually evolving and developing their capability to be successful. If we want to have a bigger impact, we need to systematically build our own capability – building from the hard-won experiences of those who have, and are, taking action on fraud.”</p>



 What is in the ‘Government Counter Fraud Profession – Fraud Prevention Standard for Counter Fraud Professionals’ paper? 



<p>The 80-page document features comprehensive information on the Competency Framework (outlining the knowledge, skills and experience required by those undertaking fraud prevention), and guidance for professionals. Whether in the public or private sector, having a counter fraud culture is imperative to protect the business and its customers.</p>



<blockquote><p>The impact of fraud cannot be overstated. Although many may think of the monetary or organizational disruption of fraud, financial crime like money laundering can also lead to or facilitate numerous societal ills, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/">human trafficking or the financing of terrorism</a>. It can also have a significant impact to the victim’s mental health.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 What are the benefits of an anti-fraud strategy? 



<p>The benefits of having fully trained counter fraud professionals in the private and public sector are numerous:</p>



<p>Reassures the public: Having a strategy and adequate tools and controls in place, alongside trained counter fraud professionals reassures the public that the services they use are safe and secure, and that the government or specific company is serious about protecting users.</p>



<p>Protects vulnerable members of the public: As fraud often has a disproportionate effect on the vulnerable (the old, the sick, the poor), it is this section of society that are either most dependent on government services like welfare or would feel the most acute impact from a loss of money. </p>



<p>Improves effectiveness of services: With a well thought out approach to safeguard against fraud, and a rigorous and robust identity verification service, you can ensure your users access the services or payments that only they are entitled to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Optimize operations, increase speed of transactions: Taking a proactive, preventative approach to fraud by implementing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML and KYC measures</a> saves money in the long run. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">Automated identity verification</a> can increase the speed and security of transactions, while creating a safer environment.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a counter fraud professional? 



<p>A <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/730050/Annex_B_-_GCFP_Brochure.pdf">Counter Fraud Professional (CFP) </a>is someone who focuses on fraud prevention, and who will work to implement proactive and preventative controls within their organization. A CFP will need a good working understanding of the different types of fraud, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/document-fraud/">document fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/synthetic-identity-fraud/">synthetic identity fraud</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/embezzlement/">embezzlement</a>, as well as the causes and motivators of fraud. A chief part of the CFP role is also to collaborate with other invested stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the 8 key steps for counter fraud professionals to follow? 



<p>The Competency Framework is comprised of eight key components, featuring the requisite knowledge, skills and experience required for CFPs to comply with. There are three different levels to attain: Trainee (developing introductory knowledge); Foundation (having the knowledge), and Practitioner (demonstrating the knowledge).<br></p>


 
 
 
 1. Counter fraud management: 
 

<p>Display understanding of why fraud is committed and the impact of fraud, alongside the correct reporting procedure.</p>

 
 
 
 2. Legislation: 
 

<p>Demonstrate knowledge of relevant legislation, including data protection.</p>

 
 
 
 3. Risk management: 
 

<p>Proficient in a range of risk management techniques, including determining priorities, using business process mapping and controls to mitigate fraud, and influence policy plans.</p>

 
 
 
 4. Business analysis: 
 

<p>Identify and use data in fraud prevention. For example, using analytical techniques and datasets.</p>

 
 
 
 5. Prevention methodologies: 
 

<p>Utilize a process specifically created to calculate prevented fraud figures, thereby encouraging innovation before controls are implemented.</p>

 
 
 
 6. Stakeholder engagement: 
 

<p>Engage with stakeholders to implement fraud prevention controls and foster collaborative processes and relationships.</p>

 
 
 
 7. Communications and deterrence: 
 

<p>Develop communications plan to convey deterrence messages.</p>

 
 
 
 8. Measurement, evaluation and review: 
 

<p>Conduct ongoing reviews of materials and methods to ensure effectiveness.</p>

 The value of technology and training in fraud prevention. 



<p>“At IDnow, we recognize the necessity of keeping up to date with the latest developments and techniques in fraud. We run regular training sessions and courses for our clients, and are proud to have helped forensic document examiners and fraud experts from police departments around the world, including the Republic of North Macedonia and Abu Dhabi.”</p>



<blockquote><p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology, and regulatory expertise.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Fraudsters have become smart, it’s time to get smarter.&nbsp; 



<p>A successful counter fraud strategy is dependant on close collaboration between industry and government. Alignment between innovation and regulation will ensure a watertight approach to combating fraud, spanning services across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>IDnow’s layered, strategic approach to fraud prevention and KYC combines cutting edge biometrics and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a> with comprehensive document and data checks to arm you with all the tools you need to fight fraud.</p>



<p>We put the power of identity back into the hands of businesses; helping to reduce friction for trusted users, preventing fraud, and detecting high-risk or anomalous behavior.</p>

			 Tokenization Standardization Has Arrived With the ERC3643 Association 
<p>The advent of blockchain technology is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative developments of this century. Its unparalleled ability to transfer infinite value instantaneously across borders has started to redefine our financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>It’s no secret to anyone who’s watched this space that tokenization and blockchain integrations into our financial system is the inevitable future, the question is how and when will this reach critical mass?</p>
<p>At Tokeny we believe that&nbsp;bringing compliance on-chain at the smart contract level will permit mass adoption, because it enables mass tokenization.</p>
<p>We made this possible with the ERC3643 token protocol. This open-source suite of smart contracts enables the issuance, management, and transfer of permissioned tokens. This allows token issuers to&nbsp;tokenize any real world asset or financial product, enforce compliance and control their tokens, on any EVM blockchain, even on public blockchains.</p>
 Open Sourcing the Code to Ensure Access 
<p>Although Tokeny was the architect behind the ERC3643 standard, we understood that retaining the ‘keys’ wouldn’t align with our broader mission of making a&nbsp;universally recognized compliant token standard,&nbsp;so we elected to make it open-source.</p>
<p>From a traditional business perspective, making proprietary solutions open-source might seem counterintuitive. However, our vision transcends short-term gains; the more entities that leverage this standard, the sooner we can revolutionize the industry.</p>
<p>This philosophy echoes one of the more profound business decisions of our time by Elon Musk of Tesla. Musk made Tesla’s EV technology patents open-source, recognizing that his real competition was not other electric vehicle producers but gasoline-powered cars. Tesla’s mission was to accelerate sustainable transport, not merely to outcompete other electric vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tokeny’s true competition isn’t other tokenization platforms; it’s the incumbent legacy systems that govern our financial world today.</p>
 Creating an Industry-wide Association to Accelerate Adoption 
<p>A few weeks ago, we formally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_nVqJRQbXk1O9GThOVD5HvofciVHANTud7uY2SNc6PvtxD8HEY7kxyWLxD7pCpFbU15O0q">launched</a>&nbsp;the ERC3643 association alongside industry leaders and incumbents including the following:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The association is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the blockchain token standard ERC3643 and, more globally, fostering the development of best practices and a comprehensive&nbsp;toolbox for financial institutions interested in tokenizing assets on the&nbsp;blockchain in a compliant manner.</p>
<p>Together with the members, we embark on a journey that holds tremendous potential for transforming the world of finance and revolutionizing the way assets are managed and traded.</p>
<p>By establishing a set of&nbsp;concrete technical, legal and operational guidelines and specifications, we will provide financial institutions with the tools they need to navigate this emerging landscape in a responsible and efficient manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the standardization efforts, our association will serve as a&nbsp;hub of knowledge and expertise, cultivating an environment of continuous learning and development.</p>
<p>The tokenized future is here, and the ERC3643 association is working to make that a reality for all to benefit from.</p>

<p></p><p>In today’s age of social media dominance, our online identities have become integral to both our personal lives and professional endeavors. From connecting with friends and family to building brands and businesses, platforms like Twitter and Instagram have given us the power to create digital personas that resonate with others where your user handle serves as a unique identifier in the digital world. </p><p>However, recent incidents have shed light on a fundamental question: Do we truly own our user handles on these platforms? Events, such as Twitter's rebranding and the subsequent takeover of the @X handle from a longtime user, shed light on the intricate web of ownership, accountability that revolves around these usernames, and how account models across the web work today.</p><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190891082/twitter-x-account-owner-gene-hwang-elon-musk"></a></p> Borrowing vs. Owning<a title="Direct link to Borrowing vs. Owning">​</a> <p>User handles, also known as usernames, are a string of characters that represent your digital presence on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. While users assume that the handles they create are tied to their accounts, the reality is more complex, often dictated by the terms of service set by the platform. These terms outline the rights and limitations users have over their usernames/accounts, establishing a virtual "landlord and tenant" relationship between you and the platform provider. </p><p>This relationship was exemplified when Twitter rebranded as "X," causing collateral damage as the company took repossession of user handles like @X, without notice or monetary compensation. This was echoed in cases like @Music, which was created by a user who curated their digital presence with this handle for more than 16 years. </p><p></p><p>The notice from Twitter to this account holder reads:</p><blockquote><p>The user handle associated with account @Music will be affiliated with X Corp. Accordingly, your user handle will be changed to a new user handle. </p></blockquote><p>While this is certainly alarming, it’s not illegal. Most people don’t read the fine print of the Terms of Service agreements when joining these applications, and therefore don’t realize how much control these centralized organizations have over our data and digital identity.  </p> The Problem &amp; The Solution<a title="Direct link to The Problem &amp; The Solution">​</a> <p>The way the web stands today, each time we engage with online platforms that require accounts, we borrow an identity from them and then proceed to build a reputation and possibly brand associated with this borrowed identity. The recent turmoil experienced by Twitter has thrust the very nature of the web into the spotlight for those who previously might not have contemplated its issues. This is precisely why Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#what-is-it">DIDs</a>) bear immense significance.</p><p>At the core of Web5's paradigm lie DIDs, which serve as identities that users own and control. DIDs provide individuals with distinctive, universally resolvable identifiers that persist through time and consistently remain under their control. Unlike conventional usernames, DIDs can't be confiscated by platforms, thus empowering users to truly possess their digital identities. This transformative shift adds an identity layer to the web eradicating platform-mediated handles.</p><p>Fortunately, Twitter automatically gave the user who created @X a new (albeit way less cool) handle. However, what if the company simply closed that account instead? The user would have  lost not just their username, but potentially their entire digital existence on that platform if their profile had been wiped out.  </p><p>While Twitter's actions towards these users might not have violated any legal boundaries, is this the way we truly want the web to be? Social media has transcended its original purpose of mere social interaction; it now intertwines with our livelihoods. When signing up for a new platform many of us adopt the same usernames. These usernames serve as both personal and professional branding tools, encapsulating not just our individual identities but also the essence of our businesses.</p><p>Web5 will revolutionize identity management by restoring it to us, the users, while allowing applications to focus solely on enhancing our user experience. </p> Twitter Space with Industry Leaders<a title="Direct link to Twitter Space with Industry Leaders">​</a> <p>Industry leaders Angie Jones, Kelsey Hightower, and Daniel Buchner discussed this very topic on a recent Twitter Space. Tune in to hear their thoughts on how Decentralized Identity solves this problem.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, check out our previous update here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-developer-update-33/">  Spruce Developer Update #33  At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts across our libraries.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p>Last month we <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">announced SpruceKit</a>, a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase<br>   SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything) is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in Web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Upgraded documentation: With the release of SpruceKit, our documentation has been updated to include all SpruceKit libraries and can now be found at: <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">https://www.sprucekit.dev/</a>. The previous version of our documentation can be found at: <a href="https://v1.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">https://v1.ssx.id/</a>.  Reworked architecture and released SSX 2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>): This month, we reworked the library architecture of SSX. The previous functions of SSX have been moved into a new module named UserAuthorization that is responsible for end-user signing-related operations. A new storage module was added, which provides functionality to store and retrieve data in Kepler. Check out the <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX v2.x Docs</a>.  Enabled customizability: @spruceid/ssx-react no longer depends on wagmi. Instead, function hooks must be defined and used as arguments to the component.<br> ✓ onChangeAccount is replaced by watchProvider property, allowing for    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more customizability<br> ✓ web3Provider.providerLoaded property was removed<br> ✓ useSSX now returns the ssx instance and the provider<br> ✓ Now watchProvider is the new interface for listening to provider changes.  You must set up this function to be called whenever an interaction with the  user happens. An example of how to do it can be found <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/blob/main/examples/ssx-test-react/src/index.tsx?ref=blog.spruceid.com#L25">here</a>  Credential modules (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/150?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#150</a>): We’ve added Credential Modules, which allow you to fetch credentials issued on <a href="https://issuer.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceKit Credential Issuer</a>. Our Credential Issuer, Quest, can now be used as a faucet for credentials.  Sprouts Example Apps: Last month we released the Sprouts, SpruceKit example apps. These apps recreate popular consumer experiences with decentralized identity baked into the user experience. Check out SpruceKit open-source libraries in action with our three demo apps:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">  Introducing the Sprouts: SpruceKit Example Apps  We’re excited to release three new reference apps, the Sprouts, that demonstrate how you can leverage the SpruceKit open source libraries to introduce decentralized identity in the next app you build.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a> Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  SIWE 2.1.4 released: Includes support to ethers@6 alongside with ethers@5 and raises minimum version to 5.6.8 due to relevant security fix (), and setup for Node 18 and updates CI ()  SIWE-oidc migrated to WalletConnect v2(<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-oidc/pull/68?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-oidc#68)</a>.  Improved examples and documentation for siwe-rs:(<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-rs/pull/53?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-rs#53</a>)   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  Host key derivation from static secret: moves host key management into the OrbitDatabase in kepler-core via the Secrets trait and provides an implementation of the trait based on simple per-orbit derivation from a static secret (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>)  did:key for peer IDs: Currently peers are represented in delegations by URIs of the form peer:&lt;PEER-ID&gt;, which is neither a proper URI or a DID. We have recently added a way to get a did:key DID to identify hosts (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/151?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#151</a>)   DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Fixed key retrieval: We’ve fixed keys retrieval for verifiable credentials HTTP API issuance <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit?ref=blog.spruceid.com#362">(didkit#362)</a>  Major refactor: A major refactor is underway to integrate with TreeLDR and improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized ID specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#508</a>)  Port support for did:web: we’ve added support for did:web with a port in SSI (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi?ref=blog.spruceid.com#519">ssi#519</a>)   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

 What Is Identity Orchestration? 
<p>Identity Orchestration is an <a>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> approach that automates managing and securing digital identities across diverse platforms, primarily multi-cloud environments. It involves coordinating various identity-related tasks such as authentication, authorization, provisioning, de-provisioning, password management, and more across multiple systems and applications.</p>
<p>For instance, when new employees join a company, they often need access to many systems. Manually provisioning access for each system is time-consuming and prone to error. If the employee leaves, de-provisioning access is also essential to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>By automating these processes through identity orchestration, companies can streamline their identity and access management, reduce the risk of security breaches, ensure compliance with regulations, and enhance the user experience by providing seamless access to the required resources.</p>
 Identity Management Problems Solved by Orchestration 
<p>The challenge of <a>identity management</a> across multi-cloud (or simply diverse platforms) is that such diversity introduces a host of problems that aren’t present (or aren’t as present) in centralized identity systems.</p>
<p>Accordingly, identity orchestration addresses several critical problems associated with identity management, including:</p>
 
 Scalability: As organizations grow and add more systems and applications, managing identities can become complex and time-consuming. Identity orchestration automates and streamlines this process, making it easier to scale. 
 Security: Manual management of identities can lead to errors, like forgetting to de-provision a former employee’s access, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. Automated provisioning and de-provisioning help mitigate such risks. 
 Consistency: Ensuring consistent access rights across multiple systems and applications can be challenging. Identity orchestration helps maintain this consistency by centralizing and automating the process. 
 Compliance: Many industries have strict regulations around who can access specific data types. Identity orchestration provides robust auditing capabilities, which can assist in demonstrating compliance with these regulations. 
 User Experience: Users often need to remember multiple credentials for different systems, leading to password fatigue and decreased productivity. With features like single sign-on (SSO), identity orchestration can provide a seamless user experience. 
 Efficiency: Manual identity management tasks can consume significant IT resources. By automating these tasks, identity orchestration can free IT teams to focus on other critical areas. 
 Visibility: With traditional IAM approaches, having a clear overview of who has access to what can be challenging. Identity orchestration platforms usually provide a unified dashboard that gives a comprehensive view of access rights across the organization, aiding in resource optimization and security management. 
 
 How Does Identity Orchestration Work? 
<p>Identity orchestration works through an orchestrating system that coordinates critical tasks related to IAM across various systems and applications. This orchestration is typically accomplished using a dedicated platform.</p>
<p>There are standard technologies and processes of almost any orchestration system. These include:</p>
 
 Integration: First, the identity orchestration platform is integrated with all the systems and applications for which it will manage access. This could be anything from email systems and databases to cloud platforms and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. 
 Policy Setting: Policies are established within the platform to control system access based on user role, behavior, or attributes of the system or authentication session (time, date, location, etc.). 
 Automation: Policies programmed into an orchestration system can be automated quickly, managing the priorities of that system (provisioning, onboarding, security, etc.). This reduces the manual workload for IT teams and decreases the chances of errors or inconsistencies. 
 Authentication and Authorization: As a baseline, an orchestration solution should be able to handle some of the most important functions of an identity management system–specifically, authenticating users, verifying user identities, and controlling access to system resources based on policies. 
 Audit and Compliance: Finally, the platform also keeps detailed logs of all identity and access management activities. This is crucial for audit purposes and to demonstrate compliance with regulations that mandate certain control over systems and data access. 
 
<p>The specifics of how identity orchestration works can vary depending on the specific technologies and solutions used and the unique requirements of the organization implementing it.</p>
 What Should an Organization Look for in an Orchestration Solution? 
<p>When choosing an identity orchestration solution, it’s essential to consider several key features and aspects to ensure it will meet your organization’s needs. Here are some factors to consider:</p>
 
 Integration with Existing Solutions: The solution should integrate seamlessly with your existing systems, applications, and platforms. This includes both on-premises systems and cloud-based applications. 
 Scalability: Your identity management needs will also grow as your organization grows. Choose a solution that can scale to accommodate increasing users and systems. 
 Automation: One of the main benefits of identity orchestration is automating tasks such as provisioning, de-provisioning, and password resets. Ensure the solution offers a high degree of automation to reduce manual efforts. 
 Security: Features like MFA, SSO, and risk-based access controls can help improve security. Look for a system that offers the best security measures for specific, necessary functions like authentication, authorization, or management. 
 Compliance and Auditing: The solution should provide robust auditing capabilities to track and log all identity and access activities. This is crucial for demonstrating compliance with regulations. 
 User Experience: Features like self-service password resets and single sign-on can enhance the user experience, reducing frustration and help-desk calls. 
 Vendor Support: Consider the vendor’s reputation, their track record in providing support, and the availability of resources such as documentation and training. 
 Cost: Finally, consider the cost of the solution, not only in terms of the purchase price or subscription fees but also the costs related to implementation, training, and ongoing maintenance. 
 
 The Fabric of Identity Orchestration 
<p>As identity and authentication technologies evolve, the methods through which providers and other users can orchestrate identity management. Following that, robust infrastructure and security integration into these systems becomes crucial.</p>
<p>Thus, there are a couple of related security and technical systems that touch on identity orchestration–namely, identity fabrics and zero-trust architecture:</p>
 
 Identity Fabrics: This relatively newer concept in IAM represents a holistic approach to identity services across an organization. It’s a design principle that calls for a single, consistent layer of identity services, which can be used by all parts of an organization, regardless of where they are or what underlying technology they use. Identity Orchestration and identity fabrics work together to provide seamless and unified management of identities across an organization. Identity orchestration is the operational aspect, automating and managing identity tasks, while Identity Fabrics provide the architectural framework that allows this orchestration to occur across the entire organization. 
 
 
 Zero-Trust Architecture: This is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access. This can be implemented in part through robust identity verification processes. <a>Zero-trust identity</a> ties into this by adding a layer of security. The automation provided by Identity Orchestration, combined with the architectural structure of identity fabrics, can help implement the zero trust model by ensuring every access request is thoroughly verified, no matter where it comes from or what it’s accessing. This is done by continuously validating the user’s identity and the request context to minimize the risk of a security breach.

<p>When Anonyome Labs’ CTO and co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley spoke to Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">Privacy Files podcast</a> about the hottest topic in privacy right now, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">decentralized identity</a>, he left the audience with 5 aha! moments.</p>



<p>If you haven’t heard, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">decentralized identity</a> is a new fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or border crossing). </p>



<p>Catch up on the decentralized identity story on our <a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">blog</a> and in our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/whitepaper-blog/">whitepapers</a>.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is the most important privacy innovation of the decade and it’s here now—and that was the first aha moment from Dr Ashley:</p>



<p></p>



 Aha 1: DI technology is ready for your business application. 



<p>On the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">podcast</a>, Dr Ashley told co-hosts Rich and Sarah that hundreds of applications of the groundbreaking DI technology are already springing up around the world and across many industries, particularly travel, health, banking, licensing and certification.</p>



<p>“It’s really been the last 12 months where we’ve seen it take off. We’re at the crest of the wave,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>And it’s easy to get started, Dr Ashley said: “DI is quite simple for organizations to set up. Anonyome Labs has verifier and issuer providers, and we can run [applications] in the cloud because we’re a SaaS provider. We also provide a DI Wallet for users.</p>



<p>“Organizations just do a little application work around what [information] to ask the user for, but it’s not a big load for an organization to become an issuer or a verifier. You’ve just got to be able to control the issuer or verifier software. It’s not a big burden for the user either, they just need to get a wallet.”</p>

<p></p>



 Aha 2: Verifiable credentials will drive DI’s applications across the internet. 



<p>DI’s superpower is it allows a user to selectively disclose their personal information to an organization that is requesting proof of their identity.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Rich and Sarah that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a> are making this selective disclosure of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally</a> identifiable information (PII) possible and will make DI ubiquitous across the internet within the next decade. He pointed out the rise of verifiable credentials has led to the widespread need for an <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>, a massive growth area in privacy and identity management.</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">Explore the Identity Wallet SDKs on Sudo Platform</a><br></p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Rich and Sarah a verifiable credential is really a digital copy of a paper or plastic identity document (e.g. license). It can’t be faked because it’s cryptographically protected. The issuer, holder and verifier can confirm who created the verifiable credential, and it can’t be changed. The verifier can also tell whether the verifiable credential has been revoked. The user holds the verifiable credential in their digital identity wallet.</p>



<p>It works like this:</p>







<p></p>



<p>“The verifier, such as a bar, knows it’s real data; the user is confident they’ve only shown the information they’re comfortable or need to show.</p>



<p>“Standards define the wallet and also what the issuer will do and what the verifier will do. The verifier should just be able to connect to the standard tech to accept the digital identity (verifiable credential),” Dr Ashley explained.</p>

 Aha 3: The technology is extremely well designed for security and privacy. 



<p>Dr Ashley, who’s spent 25-plus years in the privacy and security space, says: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view,” Dr Ashley says.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley points out that data brokers won’t want DI to take off and that includes the Googles and Metas of the world, as well as the smaller data brokers: “That industry will push back [because] DI will swing back the privacy pendulum more towards the user,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley also explained on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">Privacy Files podcast</a> that Anonyome Labs, a leader in DI technology, got into the nascent space from the privacy perspective: “DI is about digital identities that the user can manage and control rather than somebody else,” he says.</p>



<p>He said the technology fits perfectly with the work we’ve done for years around <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/how-sudos-are-making-decentralized-identity-usable-for-most-people/">Sudo digital identities</a>, as seen in our exemplar app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">Blockchain</a> is the anchor of trust for decentralized identity, and “DI is the ultimate blockchain technology,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>DI will mean a passwordless future, connecting from a digital wallet to a system to access that system.</p>



<p>“With DI, there’s no one place you can go where all the data is sitting and can be accessed, so there are a lot of security and privacy aspects to the DI approach that you just don’t get with the centralized approach,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>“Centralized databases are the classic honeypot for a hacker. DI makes hacking a much more difficult proposition. DI is much less attractive for hackers and also for data brokers wanting to exploit your data,” Dr Ashley says.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



 Aha 4: DI presents many opportunities for making money. 



<p>Dr Ashley said there are at least three models for monetizing opportunities in DI:</p>



 
 Verifier paying the issuer model (e.g. employment agency pays a university to get proof of a job applicant’s credential.) 



 User paying the issuer model (e.g. The student pays the university to get their credential proving their degree completion.) 



 Verifier paying the user model for access to their data (e.g. a shopping site pays the user for identity verification information such as age verification). 
 



<p>Dr Ashley said projects in DI are about getting better data or getting it in a low-cost way and enterprises could use DI to move trusted data between a network of parties (e.g. banks or farms etc.). “There are a lot of cost savings from this reduced process,” he said.</p>



<p>Read: <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Aha 5: Use cases for DI technology are virtually endless, across all industries. 



<p>Dr Ashley told <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5fd4MZWoLCKolVYpGrJWY4">Rich and Sarah</a> that the number one decentralized identity scenario is travel: “Digital passports, visas, vaccine certificates, all in a wallet as verifiable credentials the traveller can take from country to country. With decentralized identity, you’re now taking trusted information across borders,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>Some other big use cases we’re already seeing for DI, according to Dr Ashley, are digital driver licenses, event ticketing, certifications in the building or farming industry—”anywhere you need verifiable data to pass between one entity to you to another entity.”</p>



<p>“It’s a very good way of getting high integrity data,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>When podcast co-host Rich raised the question of whether DI still gives off some kind of digital exhaust, Dr Ashley agreed, but gave an example to ease concerns.</p>



<p>“Yes, but take the government example. I think the government’s place in this is as an issuer or verifier of a credential. There’s nothing wrong with a DMV issuing you a digital driver license. Government has a place in it but they don’t own the digital identity. The user owns the credential [digital identity]. Government is just a player like everyone else,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Government is just a player like everyone else.”</p>
Dr. Paul Ashley</blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>As for what a digital wallet will look and feel like? “It will be an app just like MySudo is an app,” Dr Ashley said. As such, it’ll be important to backup a digital wallet app, just like any other app.</p>



<p>And what about when decentralized identity technology will be widely available?</p>



<p>“It’s not in the public domain yet, because it’s mainly networks of systems (e.g. travel or farm or health) that are exploring it and implementing it. It hasn’t got general use yet. Groups of organizations are putting systems in place and if you’re part of that, you’ll get a wallet and get underway,” Dr Ashley said. Noting it’s “not too far away” for the public.</p>



<p>“It will take time to roll out but there’s a great lot of opportunity and benefits for users and organizations as well,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley closed out the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5fd4MZWoLCKolVYpGrJWY4">podcast episode</a> by repeating his earlier assertion: “Decentralized identity is a key technology for privacy for the next decade.”</p>

<p>Big Tech has taken control over your data privacy to help them addict you to their apps. But Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai are building the industry’s next best data tooling to solve data privacy problems while keeping your apps epic&nbsp;too.</p><p>The ‘Ocean’ of&nbsp;Data</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> is an ecosystem of open-source tools for data exchange on the blockchain. The protocol enables software applications to consume user data in a secure and privacy-preserving fashion using Web3 technology. Ocean Protocol’s smart contracts include permissioned datatokens and data NFTs that enable IP rights management in data wallets. Ocean Protocol tools are built to extract value from data by improving its algorithmic accessibility &amp; security.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> is the primary use case of Ocean Protocol’s smart contracts. Data and algorithms can be bought and sold on Ocean Market with token-gated accessibility to computation. Ocean Protocol’s data market is becoming an industry best practice architecture for sharing private data securely — MoveID consortium and GAIA-X (where Datarella is also a partner) use Ocean Market code to exchange data! Indeed, spinoffs of the Ocean Market are already being used in the wild (see<a href="https://portal.pontus-x.eu/"> Pontus-X</a> for a GDPR compliant example).</p> That’s So&nbsp;Fetch! <p><a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a> offers powerful open-source software tools that leverage AI and automation algorithms on-chain to carry out complex tasks in the Web3 digital economy. Fetch’s Autonomous Economic Agents (<a href="https://docs.fetch.ai/aea-framework-documentation/">AEAs</a>) and Microagents gather resources and execute smart contracts using their own private keys to transact business logic autonomously. AEAs delegate on-chain tasks and record their completion, providing auditable traces of transaction history. A popular use case of Fetch’s protocol is its <a href="https://botswap.fi/">stop loss agents</a> that allow traders to autonomously provision liquidity on DeFi protocols and avoid manual transactions.</p> Getting Smart Recommendations Without Forking Over Your Data&nbsp;Privacy <p>Nowadays, smart recommendations in software apps are standard practice to improve these applications’ usability and retention. For example, Amazon curates and recommends relevant products to our feeds based on our recent search history. However, to gain such smart recommendations, we sacrifice our data privacy. Such applications leverage data lakes full of our historical user data to provide these smart recommendations. Not only does this strategy compromise individuals’ data privacy, but it increases the security risk for hacking such valuable data aggregated in one place. What if there was an elegant solution to both get excellent smart recommendations in apps and protect user privacy concerns?</p><p>From this idea, the integration of Fetch.ai’s Autonomous Economic Agents with Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data (C2D) workflow was&nbsp;born.</p><p>In this software release, Ocean Protocol smart contracts for Compute-to-Data interface with AEAs to exchange their data on-chain while protecting user data&nbsp;privacy!</p><p>Let’s describe an excellent use case for the Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai integration: In the realm of IoT devices, this tech integration now makes it possible for IoT devices to determine based on their location and other algorithmic conditions when and how to publish their data on-chain for sale. Data consumers on-chain can query and purchase the data that they need from these IoT outputs. Together, this approach provides the basis for autonomous adaptive machine learning without having to scrape data&nbsp;online.</p> Ocean Protocol x Fetch.ai x Datarella <p>TL;DR: By enabling Fetch Agents to post data to Ocean Marketplace Compute-to-Data recommendation engines can be driven without violating privacy.</p><p>Ocean Protocol has joined forces with Fetch.ai and <a href="https://datarella.com/">Datarella</a> over the last few months to build an <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/connection/ocean_protocol/ocean_connection/0.1.5">Ocean Connection Agent</a> to take private data available to itself, store it confidentially, and then spin up a fixed-rate exchange on the Ocean Market or with C2D enabled as shown in the previous figure. You can imagine that in the near future, this might be your current location data or data about your preferences or searches performed locally within an app (the MOBIX app for example). This data never leaves the sovereign control of the user and the user doesn’t have to worry about handling or organizing or authorizing the data because the AEA does that on behalf of the user well, autonomously! The same applies to companies running AEAs on IoT devices too. You might be asking now why this is even beneficial. It’s useful because it solves the problems associated with those vast data lakes that are driving the recommendation engines behind all sorts of “smart” services.</p><p>Protecting User Privacy and Developing Business Intelligence On-Chain</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> offers data and algorithms for sale on-chain, without any centralized control. Ocean’s Compute-to-Data smart contracts enable dApps and AEAs to publish data and algorithms privately while only selling the computational output of these datasets. The computed insights of the data that are sold, rather than the data&nbsp;itself!</p><p>In the primary use case for the Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol integration, smart apps are then able to use this architecture to produce context-aware recommendations, without accessing users’ data directly. This architecture obfuscates user data to only permit the app to see data insights using C2D. Such decentralized tooling enables compliance with strict privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>The world of data-sharing is changing quickly — and we’re setting the industry best standards of keeping your data private from algorithms while still gaining new context-aware smart recommendations to improve in-app user experiences. Coupling the Ocean Market with Fetch.ai AEAs means for the everyday person that it’s increasingly going to be possible that you can have your (data) cake and eat it too. You won’t have to choose between amazing functionality and privacy — you’ll be able to have&nbsp;both.</p> Developer Resources <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch">Dive into the code</a> for Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol on Github — it’s open-source! Similarly, the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">docs</a> for Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai provide valuable explanations on how to use this integration. If you’re already an AEA developer, then check out the package in the<a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/connection/ocean_protocol/ocean_connection/0.1.5"> AEA registry</a>. In the near future, we’re also planning to release the Storj AEA but for now, you can take any S3-compatible storage you choose. Let’s start automating private business intelligence generation!

<p>Just imagine an academic/tech conference…</p><p>Participants dress professionally. Some may wear suits or dress shirts with trousers, while others may opt for blouses with skirts or pants, or that kind of professional attire. There is a sense of importance or urgency regarding the topics being discussed or the work they are involved in. It creates an atmosphere where individuals appear deeply invested in their contributions and the outcomes of the meeting. In some of these meetings, some participants may exhibit an overconfidence and present themselves in a sophisticated manner when they are under the spotlights of the stage, forgetting that the true value of a meeting lies in collaboration, the exchange of ideas, and the pursuit of mutual understanding rather than personal grandeur.</p> DWeb Camp <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> 2023 is not one of these self-styled “important” meetings.</p><p>Imagine a stunning forest characterized by majestic redwood trees towering hundreds of meters in height, with a nearby river beautifully meandering through the landscape. Everywhere is a stage: Under the tree, across the field, alongside the river… There is no feeling of urgency, the titles of the participants are not important, and the joy of missing out is encouraged. This is the spirit of DWeb Camp.</p>DWeb Camp Participants take a moment to discuss quietly. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>.c<p>At DWeb Camp, you observe that the participants are dressed in a casual manner, wearing pajamas, shorts, or any attire of their choice during their talks. Some even have their children with them, clinging to their parents during their presentations. However, amidst this diverse crowd, everyone remains engaged in exploring the frontiers of science, technology, and collective human intelligence, with the shared goal of empowering individuals and communities. It shows you that no matter what clothes you wear, no matter the color of your skin, no matter what your anything else is, you are welcomed.</p><p>The only thing needed is to treat others with kindness and respect, and to have a passion about the decentralized web, even if you have no technical knowledge. DWeb Camp serves as a platform for researchers, developers, activists, and all people who wish to come together and discuss the challenges, concerns, and opportunities related to decentralization, privacy, security, and open protocols on the web. There is a true sense of community and it encourages the exchange of perspectives among participants from diverse backgrounds.</p> My Perspective on Holochain <p>I was amazed by Holochain from the very first day I encountered it in the spring of 2018. This feeling grew stronger over time, and at times, I wondered if my enthusiasm for Holochain might be an exaggeration due to my deep involvement. As a non-technical person, I was concerned that I might have missed something important about it. That is why I wanted to see how others, especially technical experts and policy makers, perceived Holochain when they were learning about its “whys, hows, and whats” at the camp.</p><p>It proved to be a bit challenging for them to grasp Holochain because it has a completely different paradigm compared to blockchain. While blockchain is data-centric, Holochain is agent-centric. This means that the users, which include ourselves and our devices, play a central role in a Holochain network. This perspective shift is difficult because it requires adapting to a more distributed and truly peer-to-peer way of managing data and interactions between autonomous agents. Additionally, understanding other aspects of Holo and Holochain such as the mechanism behind HoloFuel, a mutual-credit system backed by hosting power which is a significantly different approach from fiat or Ethereum for example, added another layer of complexity. However, as they started to understand it, I clearly observed the excitement in their eyes.</p><p>They became excited because they could envision how this tool/framework enables us to address and solve problems effectively. Therefore, this excitement among technical persons and policy makers was not merely a result of theoretical fascination, but rather a recognition of the practical possibilities and potential solutions that Holochain brings to the table. It sparked a genuine excitement about the transformative impact it could have on our digital sphere and the abilities it offers to individuals and communities in shaping their own destinies.</p>Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun, and other DWeb participants in a pre-camp warm up exercise. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>. One Last Thing About Holochain... <p>I closely observed the Holochain team members and the Holochain community during the camp. The most notable aspect that stood out to me was their genuine lack of greed. Despite creating or being involved in an exceptional and potentially disruptive technology framework, the team members and the community exhibited true modesty. This humility was not artificial or some sort of facade; it is an inherent part of their nature, and it likely contributed to their ability to develop Holochain. Inspired by nature, they clearly combine their intelligence with the virtue of humility. They are not driven by a desire to save the world; instead, they passionately work towards building a meaningful tool that can assist people in their daily lives. And quite possibly, their dedicated efforts will ultimately lead to world-changing improvements.</p><p>Allow me to conclude with a profound quote from Arthur Brock that encapsulates the essence of Holochain concisely:</p><p>“Holochain is not built to attack national currencies, blockchain currencies, or surveillance corporations. Instead, we are simply focused on building viable, functional alternatives.”</p>DWeb Camp participants roast marshmallows over the nightly fire.

Bazıları takım elbise veya pantolon-gömlek giyerken, diğerleri şık birer bluze ek olarak etek-pantolon veya benzerî profesyonel kıyafetleri tercih eder. Tartışılan konulara veya dâhil oldukları faaliyetlere ilişkin yüksek bir önem ve aciliyet duygusu hissedilir. Bu durum, bireylerin kendi katkılarına ve toplantıdan elde edecekleri şeylere derinden yatırım yapmış oldukları bir atmosfer oluşturur. Bu toplantıların bazılarında, bazı katılımcılar aşırı özgüven sergiler ve bu kişiler sahnede spot ışıkları altındayken kendilerini sofistike bir şekilde sunar. Bir toplantının gerçek değerinin kişinin kendisini öne çıkarmaya çalışmasından ziyade işbirliği yapmakta, fikir alışverişinde bulunmakta ve karşılıklı ortak anlayışa ulaşma çabasında yattığını unutabilirler.</p> DWeb Kampı <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Kamp</a>ı 2023 (Decentralized Web Camp / Merkeziyetsiz İnternet Kampı) kerameti kendinden menkul bir şekilde "mühimlik" iddiasında olan o tür toplantılardan biri değil.</p><p>Yüzlerce metre yüksekliğinde görkemli sekoya ağaçlarıyla kaplı, etkileyici bir orman hayal edin; hemen yakınındaki nehir, manzara boyunca usul usul kıvrılıyor. Her yer, katılımcılar için birer sahne hüviyetinde: Ağaçların altı, çim alan, nehrin kenarı... Aciliyet hissi yok, katılımcıların unvanları önemli değil ve bir şeyleri kaçırabilmenin keyfini yaşamak teşvik ediliyor. DWeb Kampı'nın ruhu işte tam da bu.</p>DWeb Kampı katılımcıları sakince görüş alışverişinde bulunmak için kendilerine zaman ayırıyor. Fotoğraf, <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=27165&amp;Akey=9A789DKQ&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>'nın izniyle.<p>DWeb Kampı'nda katılımcıların yaptıkları konuşmalarda bile pijama ve şort gibi rahat kıyafetler giyebildiklerini, istedikleri herhangi bir kıyafeti seçebildiklerini gözlemliyorsunuz. Hatta bazılarının çocukları da yanlarında, sunumları sırasında sahneye gidip ebeveynlerine sarılıyorlar. Ancak, bu çeşitli kalabalığın arasında her bir fert, bireyleri ve toplulukları güçlendirmeye yönelik ortak bir hedef doğrultusunda bilimin, teknolojinin ve kolektif insan zekâsının sınırlarını keşfetmekle meşgul. Hangi kıyafeti giyerseniz giyin, teninizin rengi ne olursa olsun, başka herhangi bir özelliğiniz ne olursa olsun, hoş karşılanıyorsunuz.</p><p>Gerekli olan tek şey, başkalarına nezaketli ve saygılı davranmak ve teknik/yazılım bilginiz olmasa bile merkeziyetsiz web’e yönelik bir tutkuya sahip olmak. DWeb Kampı, bilimsel araştırmacılar, yazılım geliştiriciler, aktivistler için ve hatta bir araya gelerek merkeziyetsizleşme, gizlilik, güvenlik ve web üzerindeki açık protokollerle ilgili zorlukları, endişeleri ve fırsatları tartışmak isteyen herkes için bir platform görevi görüyor. Gerçek bir topluluk duygusu var ve çok çeşitli alanlardan bilgi birikimine sahip katılımcılar arasında bakış açılarının değiş tokuşu teşvik ediliyor.</p> Holochain Hakkındaki Kişisel Bakış Açım <p>Holochain ile 2018 baharında karşılaştığım ilk günden itibaren ona hayran kaldım. Bu his zamanla daha da güçlendi ve zaman zaman, Holochain'e duyduğum coşkunun derin ilgimden kaynaklanan bir abartı olup olmadığını hep merak ettim. Teknik/Yazılım bilgisi olmayan biri olarak, bu konuda önemli bir ayrıntıyı gözden kaçırmış olabileceğimden endişe ettim. Bu nedenle kampta Holochain'in "nedenlerini, nasıllarını ve ne olduğunu" öğrenirken başkalarının, özellikle de teknik uzmanların ve politika yapıcıların Holochain'i nasıl algıladıklarını görmek istedim.</p><p>Holochain'i kavramak onlar için biraz zor oldu çünkü Holochain blokzinciri teknolojisine kıyasla tamamen farklı bir paradigmaya sahip. Blokzinciri veri merkezliyken, Holochain katılımcı (agent) merkezlidir. Bu, bir Holochain ağında bizlerden ve bizim cihazlarımızdan oluşan kullanıcıların merkezî bir rol oynadığı anlamına gelir. Veri merkezli bakış açısından bu bakış açısına geçmek zordur çünkü kendi iradeleriyle hareket eden katılımcılar arasındaki veri ve etkileşimleri yönetmenin daha dağıtık ve gerçek anlamda eşler arasında (P2P) işleyen bir yöntemine uyum sağlamayı gerektirir. Ayrıca, Holo ve Holochain'in, örneğin fiat paralardan ve Ethereum'dan önemli ölçüde farklı bir yaklaşıma sahip olması, barındırma gücüyle desteklenen bir karşılıklı kredi (mutual-credit) sistemi olan HoloFuel'in arkasındaki mekanizma gibi diğer yönlerini anlamak, başka bir karmaşıklık katmanı ekler.

Dolayısıyla, teknik/yazılım arka planı olan kişilerdeki ve politika yapıcı insanlardaki bu heyecan sadece teorik bir hayranlığın sonucu değildi, daha ziyade Holochain'in bize sunduğu pratik fayda ihtimallerinin ve potansiyel çözümlerin farkına varmalarından kaynaklanıyordu. Holochain’in dijital hayatımızda yaratabileceği dönüştürücü etki ve kendi kaderlerini şekillendirmede bireylere ve topluluklara sunduğu imkânlar konusunda hakikî bir heyecan oluşmuştu.</p>Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun ve diğer DWeb katılımcıları kamp öncesi ısınma egzersizinde.

Holochain Hakkında Son Bir Şey Daha... <p>Kamp sırasında Holochain ekip üyelerini ve Holochain topluluğunu yakından gözlemledim. Gözüme çarpan en önemli husus, açgözlülükten gerçek anlamda yoksun olmalarıydı. Olağanüstü ve potansiyel olarak yıkıcı bir teknolojiyi oluşturmalarına ya da bu teknolojinin oluşmasına katkıda bulunmalarına rağmen, ekip üyeleri ve topluluk gerçek bir alçakgönüllülük sergiledi. Bu alçakgönüllülük yapay değildi ve bir sahtelik içermiyordu; kendi doğalarının olağan bir parçasıydı ve muhtemelen Holochain'i geliştirmelerinde de büyük katkısı vardı. Doğadan aldıkları ilham doğrultusunda, zekâlarını alçakgönüllülük erdemiyle harmanlamış görünüyorlardı. Gördüğüm kadarıyla, dünyayı kurtarma arzusuyla hareket etmiyorlar; bunun yerine, insanlara günlük yaşamlarında yardımcı olabilecek anlamlı bir araç oluşturmak için tutkuyla çalışıyorlar. Ve büyük olasılıkla, bu özverili çabaları nihayetinde dünyayı değiştirecek gelişmelere yol açacak.</p><p>Arthur Brock'un, Holochain'in ruhunu kısaca anlatan özlü bir ifadesiyle yazıyı bitirmeme izin verin:</p><p>"Holochain ne ulusal para birimlerine, ne blokzinciri para birimlerine ne de bizleri gözetleyip duran büyük şirketlere saldırmak için inşa edildi.

<p>When it comes to digital transformation initiatives, cloud computing is frequently a key part of the conversation. The cloud is meant to be cost-effective, flexible, and scalable – a way to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and address a long list of use cases. And yet, technology professionals will be quick to caution that cloud services are not a panacea for every business challenge, and cloud transformation may look very different across different types of companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, while some industries embraced cloud migration early on, financial institutions have always moved at their own pace. The financial services sector has some of the most complex legacy application ecosystems and must comply with strict regulations, which has resulted in hesitance when it comes to embracing public cloud. On-premise systems were the norm, and initial exploration of the cloud was largely limited to private cloud deployments as financial institutions took a more conservative approach. However, the promise of offering better services with less effort has driven banks, credit unions, and other financial organizations to explore other types of cloud environments. In recent years, financial organizations have been investing much more in hybrid deployment models and public cloud, with 90% using at least two cloud deployment types and 88% using more than one public cloud. 64% of enterprises that have adopted public or internal private cloud even consider public cloud as their primary cloud platform.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, the cloud has become integral to the way modern financial institutions do business. However, the cloud journey still presents financial institutions with unique challenges around security and privacy which must be addressed. Finding the right cloud deployment model is critical to long-term business success – and identity tools can help financial institutions get the most out of their cloud investments.</p>

<p>Organizations globally face unprecedented challenges in safeguarding their sensitive data, critical assets, and reputation from cyber threats. Legacy authentication methods are not sufficient to thwart sophisticated attacks and evolving risks. This is where adaptive authentication, also referred to as risk-based authentication, shines; offering businesses a proactive and dynamic approach to security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Benefits of Risk-Based, Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Why is <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> an essential strategy that businesses should adopt as part of a comprehensive security strategy?</p> 
 Adaptive Protection  
<p>“Snapshot” authentication methods, which authenticate at a single point in time, fail to address the dynamic threat landscape. Risk-based authentication utilizes advanced risk analytics and real-time threat intelligence to dynamically adjust security measures based on contextual information and user behavior. This adaptability provides a crucial layer of protection against ever-changing threats.</p> 
 Frictionless User Experience That Is Also Secure  
<p>Customer satisfaction (CSAT) is a critical aspect of any business. Legacy authentication methods often create friction that impacts user satisfaction. Risk-based authentication solves this by tailoring the level of authentication based on individual risk profiles. This personalized approach strikes a balance between security and convenience, fostering a positive user experience while ensuring strong protection against threats.</p> 
 Stop Fraud and Unauthorized Access  
<p>Legacy authentication cannot detect suspicious logins, thereby leaving organizations vulnerable to fraud. Risk-based authentication addresses this challenge by analyzing various risk signals, such as geolocation, device information, and user behavior, to identify anomalies and potential threats. By continuously monitoring these risk factors, RBA can detect and mitigate identity based fraud in real-time.</p> 
 Aligning With Regulatory Requirements  
<p>Compliance regulations and <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-mitre-attack-framework">security frameworks</a> mandate businesses to implement robust security measures to safeguard customer information and sensitive data. Risk-based authentication supports these efforts by providing a dynamic and adaptive security framework. By continuously assessing risk and responding to threats in real-time, businesses can proactively meet <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/intro-to-psd2-sca-requirements">regulatory requirements</a> with confidence.</p> 
 Enter HYPR Adapt: Your Key to Proactive Security

 A rapidly changing digital landscape 



<p>While speed and convenience are crucial in today’s financial innovations, they have to be paired with security. As financial apps and services become more digital, so do the fraudsters who are hard at work trying to pose as legitimate consumers. The spike in identity fraud has become an expensive problem, costing consumers, merchants and financial institutions billions of dollars. In 2021, nearly 42 million Americans fell victim to identity fraud. In that one year, fraudsters made off with some <a href="https://javelinstrategy.com/2022-Identity-fraud-scams-report">$52 billion</a> through identity scams. &nbsp;</p>







<p>As the exponential growth of digital banking and services has moved more transactions online, fraudsters’ methods have evolved to take advantage. A recent report published by Aite Novarica, Key Trends Driving Fraud Transformation in 2021 and Beyond, showed that 64% of financial institutions were experiencing higher rates of account takeover (ATO) fraud since the onset of the COVID pandemic. According to a 2021 survey of 110 fraud and loss prevention decision makers at fintech firms, 46% of fintechs report that ATO is their most prevalent problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud risk can increase when consumers are opening accounts and documenting identities digitally. According to research from <a href="https://aite-novarica.com/report/application-fraud-how-do-you-solve-problem-identity">Aite-Novarica</a>, almost a quarter of checking account applications filed online in the first three quarters of 2022 were fraudulent, as were nearly one in five online credit card applications. &nbsp;</p>



 Open banking and identity networks work in unison to cut down on fraud&nbsp; 



<p>In response, financial service innovators are loading up on new tools capable of spotting and preventing fraud in real time, like the integration of identity and open banking solutions. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Mastercard Open Banking</a> allows consumers to safely share their financial data to verify account ownership and facilitate transactions, and now we have integrated open banking with our identity network to make sure participants in transactions are who they say they are. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Mastercard can deliver instant identity verification, spotting compromised identities that manual verification may miss. Mastercard’s Identity and Open Banking networks deliver deep insights into the customer’s identity by analyzing relationships between and among the individual pieces of account owner data. For instance, identity network analysis keeps track of how often a name is linked to a phone number or email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking also helps providers create low-friction customer experiences. The technology enables them to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Reduce manual paperwork&nbsp; 



 Shorten turnaround times 



 Grant instant access to new accounts 
 



 Innovations to secure the future of financial services&nbsp; 



<p>For all the promise that the emerging world of consumer-permissioned data holds, none of it will work without trust. Consumers must know that their money and data are safe. Consumers, banks and fintechs must trust that the system is secure and reliable enough to warrant continued investment and innovation. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/secure-account-opening/">Open Banking for Account Opening</a> provides a solution from Mastercard to specifically create and protect the ecosystem and minimize identity fraud. By doing so, we’re setting the trusted foundation needed to help our partners create financial services that deliver speed, convenience and security for today’s digital commerce.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m delighted to announce the general availability of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/protected-actions-overview">Conditional Access for Protected Actions</a>! This powerful feature empowers organizations to safeguard critical administrative operations with Conditional Access policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protected actions refer to high-stakes operations that carry significant risk, such as altering conditional access policies, adding credentials to an application, or changing federation trust settings. These actions, if executed by a malicious actor, can severely compromise your organization's security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've asked Swetha Rai, a Senior Product Manager on the Identity team, to tell you more. Let us know what you think!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitika Gupta&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group Product Manager, Identity Security</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Swetha, and I’m a product manager on the Identity team focused on Conditional Access (CA). Today, I’m excited to share more about the Conditional Access for protected actions feature that is now generally available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Conditional Access for protected actions, organizations can now add an extra layer of protection to these sensitive operations by defining granular policies that specify the conditions under which users can perform protected actions. For example, organizations can require administrators to complete phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), use a compliant device, or be in a trusted location before modifying a conditional access policy. This way, even if an attacker gains access to an admin account, they won't be able to perform high-risk actions without meeting the additional security criteria. Here are some examples of policies for protected actions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 ​Admins require a privileged access workstation and a FIDO2 key to delete Conditional Access policies. 
 Admins need phishing-resistant MFA to define or modify custom rules that define network locations.<br> 
 
<p>Figure 1 Protected Actions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re continuing to add support for more protected actions based on customer feedback. Today, you can protect the following areas:\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Conditional Access policy management 
 Custom rules that define network locations 
 Protected action management&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protected Actions on the roadmap:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Entra Connect management 
 Cross-tenant access settings management 
 Credential and permission management on app and service principal registrations&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to explore this powerful feature and let us know what you think! &nbsp;</p>

These nodes can store and edit files offline and in geographically diverse locations, and each node accessing the file has a copy. When it's time to bring the changes together and synchronize the file copies, there needs to be a mechanism in place that handles this efficiently and accurately. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are an excellent solution. </p> Understanding CRDTs  <p>CRDTs were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a> by Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marc Shapiro. The authors define a CRDT as an abstract data type that can modify any replica without coordinating with another replica. When two replicas have received the same set of updates, they reach the same state deterministically by adopting mathematically sound rules to guarantee state convergence. </p><p>There are two types of CRDTs: operation-based and state-based. Operation-based CRDTs, or commutative replicated data types (CmRDTs), change state by transmitting only the update operation. State-based CRDTs, or convergent replicated data types (CvRDTs), send their full local state to the other replicas, and a function merges the state. Operation-based CRDTs are not necessarily idempotent, but state-based CRDTs are.</p><p>CRDTs ensure eventual consistency without centralized coordination by linking back to previous versions of the file. As state changes occur, more branches are created and merged in the data structure. </p><p>But what if two valid writes on the same item must be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? This depends on how each application developer chooses to handle merges. Some may employ LWW (Last Writer Wins) and use timestamps to determine which user was the last to submit changes and use that user's edits. Others may use a vector clock to look at causal relationships between the edits and algorithmically choose the accepted edit.</p> Real-World Applications  <p>There are many exciting use cases for CRDTs. Collaborative text editing and collaborative design tools use CRDTs to handle merge conflicts and work offline without tieing themselves to the server-client model, which can increase latency and costs. Fission built <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">Webnative File System</a> (WNFS) as a local-first file system for decentralized apps and uses CRDTs to enable <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-wnfs/">concurrent writes</a> with version control.</p><p>Another example is distributed databases. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB">RhizomeDB</a> is a local-first edge database for querying decentralized data, and it uses CRDTs as its framework. The CRDTs can make the database idempotent, depending on what the user needs to do. For example, if a user updates their address, the system will register that change. If an admin also attempts to update the user's address, no change will occur, and a duplicate entry won't be created. However, if the user wants to submit a form or ticket, ideally, a new one will be created each time because it may be for different reasons. CRDTs enable both options without a central server.</p> Benefits and Limitations  <p>There are several advantages of CRDTs over traditional synchronization methods. As we've already touched on, CRDTs don't require centralized control and can work offline and asynchronously. This helps improve scalability.</p><p>CRDTs are designed to be fault-tolerant. They can continue to function correctly even when nodes are temporarily disconnected from each other, and they can automatically converge to a consistent state once the network is restored.</p><p>CRDTs also provide eventual consistency, ensuring that all replicas will eventually converge to the same state. This allows for flexibility and responsiveness while maintaining data integrity.</p><p>But it's important to note that CRDTs can also have some limitations. CRDTs may require additional metadata or information to track the causality of updates and resolve conflicts. This can lead to increased storage overhead compared to traditional synchronization methods, especially for large datasets. </p><p>There is also a steeper learning curve for developers using more traditional synchronization methods. That, combined with the expectation of implementing strong encryption, can be a big project to undertake.</p> <p>CRDTs are a game-changer for distributed systems and local-first applications and databases. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about CRDTs, we encourage you to check out the following papers:</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a></p><p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/bft-crdt-papoc22.pdf">Making CRDTs Byzantine Fault Tolerant</a></p><p><a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p856-power.pdf">Keep Calm and CRDT On</a></p><p></p>

<p>e-government (e-gov) solutions are at the forefront of digital transformation, revolutionizing the way governments interact with their citizens. Why do governments need e-gov service delivery solutions, and how do credential issuance and verification systems enhance e-government effectiveness?</p>
<p>Why governments need e-gov service delivery solutions</p>
<p>Governments strive to provide citizens with convenient and accessible services, but not all citizens have equal access, particularly those residing in remote areas or facing socioeconomic challenges. e-gov service delivery solutions bridge this gap, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of location or circumstances, can access government services digitally and/or physically.</p>
<p>How you enable citizens to access government services securely and seamlessly, whether they’re crossing borders, applying for benefits, renewing their driver’s license, or paying taxes, impacts their engagement and trust in government. These solutions enable governments to provide real-time updates and share information, while maintaining the integrity of citizen data and protecting privacy.</p>
<p>A citizen-centric approach focuses on enhancing the overall user experience to boost citizen satisfaction, promoting transparency, and strengthening public trust.</p>
<p>Moving to e-government solutions presents specific challenges: How can you verify citizen identity in a digital interaction? How can governments ensure that the right citizens are getting the right services, and prevent fraud? Governments need to ensure they can issue digital and physical credentials, positively verify identities online and in a service center, and authenticate citizen access to services. Credential issuance, credential verification, digital signing, and identity management systems accelerate the potential of eGov service delivery solutions.</p>
<p>How credential issuance and verification help governments achieve their e-gov goals</p>
<p>Credential issuance and verification systems serve as accelerators in maximizing the potential of e-gov solutions. These systems enable governments to issue and verify digital credentials, such as identification documents, licenses, permits, and certifications by eliminating the need for manual verification each step of the way. This expedites service delivery, reduces the administrative burden, and safeguards against fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>These systems also facilitate interoperability and portability of credentials across sectors and jurisdictions. Governments can collaborate with educational institutions, private sector entities, and other government agencies to establish a trusted network for exchanging and verifying credentials. This interoperability enables smooth processes such as licensing, educational certifications, immigration, and cross-border services.</p>
<p>Governments need to provide citizens with convenient and accessible services. E-government solutions enable citizens to submit applications, make payments, and track progress from anywhere at any time. This citizen-centric approach enhances the overall user experience and boosts citizen satisfaction with government services.</p>
<p>Best-in-class e-government solution services should encompass:</p>
 
<p>a. CITIZEN ENROLLMENT AND ONBOARDING</p>
<p>Improve government-to-citizen (G2C) interactions with easy-to-adopt, convenient, and secure digital channels including a web portal and mobile app. Provide strong, vetted identity and document verification.</p>
<p>b. CITIZEN CREDENTIAL ISSUANCE</p>
<p>Issue standard-compliant citizen identities with support for multiple form factors – digital and physical. Realize one unified organizational workflow, one citizen record, and one citizen journey.</p>
<p>c. E-GOV SERVICE DELIVERY</p>
<p>Deliver a secure seamless omnichannel citizen experience. Collect digital signatures from anyone, anywhere and expedite certification processes while increasing overall productivity. Maintain service delivery integrity and mitigate fraud risk with knowledge, possession, and/or biometric factors.</p>
 
<p>Entrust’s new survey <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/infographics/secure-citizen-interactions-infographic.pdf">infographic</a> reveals citizens are demanding more digital G2C interactions. E-government secures citizen identities, expedites verification processes, and fosters trust and security. Governments embracing e-gov service delivery solutions along with robust credential issuance and verification systems will revolutionize G2C interactions, making them more efficient, inclusive, and responsive to citizen needs.</p>

Chakravorti lays out three possible reasons: 1) Data is intangible, and because we're not physically handing it over, it doesn't feel as meaningful to us 2) Users have little leverage to negotiate more data agency because they feel trapped in many services 3) Managing one's own data is complex.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-companies-make-it-so-hard-for-users-to-control-their-data">Why It’s So Hard for Users to Control Their Data</a> 2020-01-30 Bhaskar Chakravorti HBR <blockquote><p>What we’re missing is a system that defines and grants users “digital agency” – the ability to own the rights to their personal data, manage access to this data and, potentially, be compensated fairly for such access. This would make data similar to other forms of personal property: a home, a bank account or even a mobile phone number.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/decentralized-identity-for-ai-personalities/">Decentralized Identity for AI Personalities: Redefining Autonomous Agents</a> 2023-07-29 CryptoPoliton <p>AI meets SSI???

				  Logging into a computer with a password has been around almost as long as there have been computers, which means bad actors have had lots of time to figure out ways around them. It’s time for something new.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Passwords are one of the biggest headaches for IT teams: employees often forget them, even if remembered, they have to be changed frequently, and if they are faked or stolen, entire systems can be compromised. The password is prey to one of the weakest points in any security posture, which is human error.</p>
<p><a href="https://us.norton.com">Norton,</a> a popular security provider, recently released <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/privacy/password-statistics">139 password statistics for 2023</a> and, if you have time, I recommend reading that article. Here are just a few that got our team’s attention:</p>
<p>6 in 10 individuals in the U.S. report that their organization changes its password security practices <a href="https://www.yubico.com/resource/2020-state-of-password-and-authentication-security-behaviors-report/">after experiencing a cyberattack.</a> (It’s already too late…)</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://lp-cdn.lastpass.com/lporcamedia/document-library/lastpass/pdf/en/LastPass-Enterprise-The-Password-Expose-Ebook-v2.pdf">three-fourths of employees</a> report regular usage problems related to passwords. (Not a great use of time for the employees or IT team…)</p>
<p>On average, a 250-person company has nearly <a href="https://lp-cdn.lastpass.com/lporcamedia/document-library/lastpass/pdf/en/LastPass-Enterprise-The-Password-Expose-Ebook-v2.pdf">48,000 passwords</a> in use within the organization. (What are the odds that those are all unique?)</p>
<p>We’ve known for years that passwords are insecure, which is why there has been a surge in additional security layers such as two-factor authentication and password managers. But these extra systems lead to more hoops to jump through for employees and employers alike and aren’t even secure themselves — with hackers finding <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-are-finding-ways-around-multi-factor-authentication-heres-what-to-watch-for/">new ways to dodge around multifactor authentication,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/15/norton-lifelock-password-manager-data/">Norton,</a> <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/">LastPass,</a> and <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/passwordstate-warns-of-ongoing-phishing.html">Password State</a> all confirming breaches within the last two years.</p>
<p>The issue is that we are working from the same base technology. Think of your organization as a ship. Every new security threat is a new hole in your hull, and you’ve been patching these holes constantly as they come up. The holes you know about cost you money and cause headaches, but the ones you don’t know about could sink you. At what point is it time for a new hull?</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials offer a completely new option to keep your organization safe and make your IT team’s lives easier. A verifiable credential uses cryptography to prove its source and digital signatures to prove it hasn’t been tampered with. In short, if you issue your employees verifiable credentials as proof of their employment, they can log into your systems without having to use passwords (See our <a href="https://indicio.tech/white-papers/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">“Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity”</a> for an in-depth introduction to how the technology works).</p>
<p>Other benefits include simplifying enrollment in external payments and benefits providers and easily being able to issue and revoke credentials: No more having to track down everything an employee had access to and changing passwords or manually removing access when they leave.</p>
<p>Implementing open-source verifiable credential technology into your existing IAM systems is relatively easy to do with pre-built solutions such as <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-works/">Proven Works</a> offering a fast way to get started. These systems do not require ripping and replacing existing infrastructure investments, and can help you orchestrate access to your entire suite of SaaS applications.</p>
<p>To see first hand what verifiable credentials could look like at your organization we recommend this short demonstration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-BzikdwNSI">Proven Works,</a> or you can ask any specific questions you may have to our team <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here.</a></p>

<p>We are excited to announce the winners of the first-ever invite-only data challenge hosted by Ocean Protocol! We received great feedback when tasked our data science community with the original <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/awarding-winners-of-the-ocean-token-sentiment-analysis-challenge-4011c9354335">sentiment analysis</a> of the OCEAN token challenge, and now are able to share results from the second leg of this frontier.</p><p>To extend the initial excitement, we invited the top 6 submissions to return for an invite-only data challenge to delve deeper into the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. This blog will detail findings from the 6-person, invite-only data challenge.</p><p>The goals of this challenge were to dive into data to understand the correlation and causation of the price movement of a particular token based on social media sentiment, engagement, and investor behavior.</p><p>The winners are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>First Place — Mohammad Jamal&nbsp;($2500)</p>  Mohammed pulled statistics from major social media platforms and ran them through correlation calculations and tables to find the best-performing posts, profiles, and users that contribute to media engagement regarding the protocol. One suggestion that stood out through Mohammed’s report was stated that in order to achieve a minimum 10 percent impact on the OCEAN price through social media content, creators should focus on generating content that attracts a larger number of comments.  For the transaction side, Mohammed took 100,000 transactions from 25,000 different token holders and conducted analysis on transaction times, volume, unique wallets, and relation to the length of the given trend at that moment (bearish or bullish). By this, Mohammed was able to conclude there is a lag in the market reaction to users' sentiments and proceeded to build a machine-learning model that reflected the outcomes of each of the mentioned parameters.  <p>Second Place — Matin Nahvi&nbsp;($1500)</p>  Matin broke down public data from Twitter, Github, On chain activity, and Medium blog posts to gather data to be used for this second part analysis. Their data was neatly bundled into daily aggregates, then compared against the daily OCEAN token price shifts. Their choice of navigation tool was The Bayesian Rule List — a model with rule-based predictions for a clear understanding of our path. Matin split the journey, dedicating the initial 80% to training (2019–12–30 to 2022–03–28) and the final 20% to evaluation (2022–03–30 to 2022–10–21).  Matin found more power leveraging Google Trends results to find a correlation between the OCEAN token price and Google trends. This was something that hadn’t been considered in the specifics of this challenge, that we found to be very valuable.  <p>Third Place — Luca Ordronneau ($1000)</p>  Luca took a fundamental approach to sourcing the data by breaking it down into key factors: volume, sentiment, and user influence. The machine learning model made in Luca’s report took these key factors and features into account and ran them through a <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/tabular-learning-gradient-boosting-vs-deep-learning-critical-review-4871c99ee9a2">Tabular Gradient Boosting Model</a> (XGBoost). This deployed hyperparameters tuning and cross-validation to ensure an effective and generalizable model. Through data regression, analysis, and machine learning execution, Luca was able to formulate an Impact Sentiment Score, touching on recommendations for investment behavior, market trend forecasting, risk evaluation, and strategic planning.  <p>We were very pleased to see how invitees identified relevant factors, sourced the appropriate data, conducted a thorough analysis, and presented their findings in a comprehensive report. Their exceptional skills and expertise were tested and compensated for in this exclusive data challenge.</p> Using Data for&nbsp;Insights <p>In this competition, the task was to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. By exploring additional factors and leveraging machine learning techniques, uncovered valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>A tool to quantify and predict volatility in capital markets based on social media sentiment is a long-term outcome of this initiative. Starting with the OCEAN token, for example, this forefront of sentiment analysis is set to move to a broader spectrum of crypto assets, tokens, and commodities.</p><p>Both live and expired Ocean Data Challenges can be found here: <a href="https://desights.ai/o/0x8264CE39F7532871868053198fCDC2E2C81d074a">https://desights.ai/o/0x8264CE39F7532871868053198fCDC2E2C81d074a</a></p> What was the&nbsp;task? <p>Participants invited to the second leg of the OCEAN token sentiment challenge competed for a $5000 prize pool, and were tasked with the following:</p>  Identifying three key factors that could potentially influence the price of the OCEAN token, considering social media engagement.  Provide a detailed description of the data sources you would consider for each identified factor. Be specific about the datasets, APIs, or platforms you would utilize to obtain the necessary data for your analysis.  Design a methodology to measure and analyze the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. Explain how you would collect and preprocess data to conduct sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter or any other relevant social media platform.  In addition to social media sentiment, outline their approach for exploring the impact of the external factors you identified in question 1. Describe necessary data transformations, calculations, or statistical techniques you would employ to analyze the relationships between these factors and the OCEAN token&nbsp;price.  Develop a machine learning model that can provide insights into the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN&nbsp;token.  Describe the ML model you chose and explain why it suited this task. Outline the steps involved in training, evaluating, and interpreting the model’s predictions. Include details such as the choice of algorithms, feature engineering techniques, model training methodology, and any considerations for handling potential challenges, such as data imbalance or overfitting. Explain how the ML model contributed to your analysis and supported your findings in the&nbsp;report.  <p>This was the first token sentiment analysis and invitation-only challenge hosted by Ocean Protocol. Future data-driven social media data challenges can be expected for other prominent Crypto and DeFi Protocols.</p><p>Do you think your project could benefit from social media sentiment analysis?

			 Post Webinar Summary 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Introduction:</p><p>A webinar hosted by Coinfirm provided valuable insights into the European regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. The panelists focused on the Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA), the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These regulations aim to bring transparency and accountability to the crypto market while protecting investors and personal data. In this article, we will provide a summary of the key points discussed in the webinar and shed light on how these regulations will impact the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>MICA – Protecting Investors and Ensuring Trustworthiness:</p><p>The webinar began by discussing the scope of the MICA regulation, which primarily aims to protect crypto asset investors and ensure the trustworthiness of the crypto assets market framework. MICA lays down specific rules for offers, persons seeking admissions to trading, as well as issuers of crypto assets. These rules apply to both natural and legal persons, including certain undertakings providing crypto asset services. However, fully decentralized services and certain exemptions are considered out of scope for MICA.</p><p>Key Provisions of MICA:</p><p>To achieve its goals, MICA requires issuers of reference tokens to have a registered office in the Union. It also mandates the creation and publication of white papers by issuers, containing mandatory disclosures about the issuer project details, rights, obligations, and underlying technology. Additionally, marketing communications related to these assets should align with the information provided in the white paper to ensure fairness and clarity.</p><p>TFR – Enhancing Transparency and Combating Money Laundering:</p><p>The panelists also delved into the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), which aims to prevent money laundering in the crypto industry. The TFR extends obligations to virtual asset service providers, requiring them to provide information on the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers to facilitate traceability and comply with anti-money laundering measures. This regulation aligns with global recommendations and enhances transparency in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>GDPR – Safeguarding Personal Data:</p><p>Another significant aspect discussed in the webinar was the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR aims to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data. It covers the processing of personal data by data controllers and processors within the EU, as well as the processing of such data of EU residents by controllers and processors outside the EU. The GDPR sets out rules and obligations for organizations handling personal data to ensure lawful and responsible processing.</p><p>Interconnectivity of MICA, TFR, and GDPR:</p><p>It was highlighted by panelists that MICA and TFR are interconnected and rely on each other to address various issues within the crypto industry. The TFR aligns the European Union with global recommendations and imposes clear obligations on European crypto asset service providers, which will come into effect from January 2025. On the other hand, GDPR complements the regulations by safeguarding personal data and ensuring compliance with data protection standards.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The webinar provided valuable insights into the upcoming regulations in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically MICA, TFR, and GDPR. These regulations are aimed at bringing transparency, trustworthiness, and investor protection to the crypto market while also safeguarding personal data. Understanding and adhering to these regulations will be crucial for individuals and companies operating within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>What a huge topic. The Digital Universe. Is this more than the Metaverse or less? Anyway: We live in the Digital Age. The vast majority of organizations rely on digital services to run at least parts of their business. Every one of us is consuming such digital services. They are ubiquitous. But this bigger ecosystem of connected digital services, of consumers and customers and citizens, of businesses and governments, of business partners and suppliers, of devices and things is at risk. It is under attack, continuously. The golden rule is: Once you are connected, you are under attack.</p>
 No silver bullet for security 
<p>There is no silver bullet, no single solution for securing that complex environment. But there are two good starting points, to my opinion:</p>
 
 Everyone and every organization must care for the security within their realm 
 Zero Trust (and yes, I know, it isn’t the most popular buzzword anymore, but that does not mean it is the wrong approach – in contrary) must be applied: Don’t trust, always verify 
 
<p>Some of the core components of modern security for the Digital Universe, beyond standard cybersecurity, standard IAM (Identity and Access Management) and Zero Trust, include security for Web3 and the Metaverse, Decentralized Identity, Software Supply Chain Security and Secure Development Lifecycles, but also CIAM (Consumer IAM) and IoT (Internet of Things) Security.</p>
 Security for Web3 and the Metaverse(s) – and the role of Decentralized Identity 
<p>We may discuss whether there already are metaverse(s) out there. Web3 is closer, for sure, despite being a somewhat undefined mix of different mostly decentralized technologies. The answer on how security for that brave new world will look like would by far exceed the scope of a single blog post.</p>
<p>But let me mention two important points. One is that there won’t be a single security solution for these environments. Tackling security for Web3 and the metaverses best starts with deconstructing them into the various components such as distributed ledgers or smart contracts and then addressing security per component. Recombining this and implementing policies and other common elements consistently will help us in achieving our goal. The most important of the common elements is Decentralized Identity, which is relevant to every component of metaverses and the Web3. Decentralized Identity thus is essential for securing the digital universe.</p>
 Secure Software and Secure Supply Chains 
<p>Software Security and Secure Software Supply Chains are also essential for the digital universe to work well. With close collaboration, this also impacts Supply Chain Security for partners, suppliers etc. accessing and interoperating with other organizations’ IT. Secure Development Lifecycles (SDL) are a must, where every part of the lifecycle is well-protected. SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials), which are increasingly requested, are mandatory. There is no doubt that we must get much better here, with digital services relying on secure software, but also with the risk of malicious code spreading way faster in a hyperconnected world. Beyond software security, B2B Identity Management is of utmost importance, to understand and being able to manage access of externals.</p>
 The “C” users: Customers, Consumers, Citizens 
<p>At the end, digital services are for customers, consumers, and citizens. Decentralized Identity will play an important role for their access and interaction in the near future. CIAM is equally relevant to connect traditional means of access of these “C” users as well as Decentralized Identity to the backend systems, marketing automation services, and other solutions in the organizations.</p>
 Putting it all together 
<p>Securing the digital universe requires so many different activities. Do you need a blueprint for that? Even while it surely would be fun creating such a blueprint, it appears to be too complex. It requires focus areas, some of these but not all listed above. It requires a common understanding of essential concepts, such as the role of Decentralized Identity and of Zero Trust. It must be based on a good understanding of risks, but also the impact of failure in a hyperconnected world: If security fails in one area, this can impact many other areas. Again, Zero Trust (which also implies layered security) as a foundational principle helps here.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The digital universe as well as individual digital businesses will suffer or even fail when we fail in security.</p>
<p>The importance of securing the digital universe will take center stage at the upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference happening in Frankfurt this November 14-16. Attending this conference will provide valuable insights on how to effectively address this expansive subject and gain a better understanding of the steps involved in securing the digital universe.</p>

Yet, how much do we know about this process? Join us as we don the detective’s hat and dive headfirst into the intriguing maze of digital document verification, revealing its fascinating journey from humble collection to the grand reveal of authenticity.<br>
Key Takeaways</p>
 
 The effectiveness of document verification lies in its comprehensive, multi-step process. Advanced tools like BlockID play a crucial role in this process, enabling speed and accuracy. Embrace these technologies to enhance your document verification efforts and foster digital trust. 
 Document verification isn’t just for identity confirmation; it’s an essential tool for enhancing security, ensuring compliance, and optimizing operations across all business sectors. Recognize its broader potential as a shield against various types of fraud. 
 The implementation of document verification processes brings along privacy considerations. Safeguard your operations by prioritizing data security, adhering to data protection regulations, and maintaining transparency. This balance is vital in the digital age, where trust is paramount. 
 
 Document Verification: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding the Process 
<p>In many different businesses, reliable information is crucial, and document verification is required to accomplish this. The methods involved, the many contexts in which it is employed, and how new technology impacts its effectiveness are all covered in this guide.</p>
 
What is Document Verification? 
<p>A comprehensive verification procedure must ensure that papers and official documents are true and correct. This entails verifying the date of birth document’s current validity, cross-referencing it with reliable databases or reference materials, and closely inspecting it for any indications of tampering or changes.<br>
For organizations to safeguard their interests and adhere to legal and regulatory requirements, it is a critical barrier against fraudulent operations.<br>
Document verification is becoming even more crucial due to the development of digital interfaces, which have replaced conventional face-to-face encounters. It becomes a linchpin for establishing trust, ensuring that the person or entity on the other side of the screen is genuinely who they claim to be.</p>
 
The Evolution of Document Verification Technology 
<p>From manual checks to sophisticated AI algorithms, the evolution of document verification technology has been nothing short of revolutionary. In the early days, document verification was a labor-intensive task that required expert knowledge and an eagle eye.<br>
Technological advancement has led to the development of tools like OCR and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID</a>, which expedite the process and improve accuracy. Understanding the technical journey of document verification can help us appreciate the complexity and effectiveness of contemporary solutions.</p>
 
The Intricacies of Online Document Verification 
<p>Online document verification is a multi-step journey, not just a one-off process. Each step of address and document verification works together, has significance, and contributes to creating a robust, efficient, and effective system for validating documents.</p>
 
Document Collection: Initiating the Verification Journey 
<p>The online document verification process starts with document collection. This first stage of vendor verification involves obtaining the document to be validated by the user. Users can upload the necessary scanned or photographed documents through a secure and incorporated online document verification portal.<br>
Quality is paramount here; clear, legible copies ensure the accurate extraction of information in the next stage. This digitalization speeds up the verification process and provides added convenience for users, who can upload and verify documents online anytime.</p>
 
Data Extraction: Leveraging Technology for Intelligent Information Retrieval 
<p>After securely uploading many official documents, advanced algorithms and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools like BlockID, come into play in user verification. These intelligent systems scan the document, pulling out crucial information for verification.<br>
This data extraction process represents a significant technological advancement. It automates a task that would be labor-intensive and prone to human error, ensuring both speed and accuracy. The data extracted at this stage forms the basis for subsequent validation, underscoring the critical nature of this step in machine learning.</p>
 
Document Validation: Ensuring Authenticity 
<p>The retrieved data undergo a stringent validation process upon successfully extracting forged documents. It is checked against predefined standards or databases to establish the document’s authenticity. This step is crucial in detecting and preventing fraudulent attempts, ensuring the paper hasn’t been falsified or tampered with. The validation process is a cornerstone for document verification and a strong deterrent against document types of fraud.</p>
 Manual Verification: The Human Element in Verification 
<p>Even with all the technological advances, there are still situations when human verification of documents is necessary. While robots can handle vast amounts of data quickly and reliably, human input is still required for certain activities due to their complexity and subtlety.<br>
Experts physically handle and examine documents as part of the manual verification process. A person’s experience, judgment, and intuition are crucial in this time-consuming procedure. Automated systems may miss inconsistencies, anomalies, and even minor symptoms of forgery but not by trained humans.<br>
A human reviewer, for instance, may recognize a fresh forging approach that hasn’t been experienced before. Still, an AI-based system is quite adept at spotting fraud tendencies based on historical data. By ‘training’ the system with this new information, it will be able to identify future efforts like this. Document verification systems may benefit greatly from the synergy of human intuition and machine efficiency, as shown here.<br>
Manual verification is also necessary when dealing with complicated circumstances or confusing situations. Decisions in such instances sometimes need the insight of a human reviewer. In cases when the automatic system suspects fraud but can’t explain why, a human reviewer may step in to do more investigation.</p>
 
The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Document Verification 
<p>The methods for validating and authenticating documents have significantly changed due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Data extraction may now be automated thanks to AI algorithms that can “read” and “understand” the content of documents. This improves productivity and drastically lessens the possibility of human mistakes.</p>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is an AI subfield that has advanced this concept. ML algorithms ‘learn’ from the data they analyze instead of following a set of predefined rules. These algorithms learn over time what characteristics distinguish a genuine document from a fake one. Therefore, the verification system improves in precision and trustworthiness with each new document processed.</p>
<p>The use of this cutting-edge technology in the fight against fraud is extensive. The large amounts of historical data used by AI and ML algorithms make it possible for them to spot anomalies and patterns of fraud in traditional forging techniques. More remarkably, they can foresee new fraud attempts, giving businesses a head start in protecting themselves.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning have applications beyond fraud detection, enhancing operational efficiency and risk management. They can see trends and patterns that humans may overlook, which is a huge help for making decisions and formulating strategies. Staying ahead of more sophisticated fraud efforts will depend on your organization’s capacity to adapt to the changing digital context.</p>
 
Methods of Identity Verification 
<p>There are many ways to verify user identity and documents, each with strengths, limitations, and best-use scenarios.<br>
For instance, physical security feature check methods are excellent at verifying passports or ID cards, with features like holograms, watermarks, and machine-readable zones (MRZ). However, they may not be as effective with documents that do not have these features.<br>
Biometric verification, which analyzes facial features in photos attached to documents or biometric data, offers an added layer of security. It is more difficult to falsify and can be used for additional checks such as liveness detection. But this method can be challenged by poor image quality or changes in the individual’s appearance.<br>
Lastly, cross-referencing data against secure databases is excellent for many documents and doesn’t rely on physical features. But the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the comprehensiveness and reliability of the databases used.<br>
Therefore, the choice of methods largely depends on the specific requirements and the risk level of the customer identity verification process. However, combined, these techniques provide a comprehensive and robust verification process, significantly reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>
 
Significance of Document Verification By Sector 
<p>Document verification is crucial across various sectors like financial services, healthcare, education, and government; document verification acts as a vital shield against a spectrum of fraud.</p>
 
 The Finance Sector: In banking, the need for document verification becomes obvious during activities like onboarding new clients or granting loans. Missteps can result in fraudulent documents, hefty financial losses, and severe regulatory penalties. 
 Healthcare and Education Sectors: Similar importance resonates within healthcare and education, where authenticating the validity of medical records or academic qualifications is vital. Errors in this validation process can create far-reaching repercussions for service providers and beneficiaries. 
 Implications for Businesses: From a business viewpoint, inadequate online document verification exposes an organization to fraud risks. The implications stretch beyond financial losses, threatening an organization’s hard-earned reputation. Incidents of fraud that could have been evaded with rigorous online document verification work can rapidly tarnish this reputation. 
 Impact on Individuals: The stakes for individuals are high as well. Serious identity fraud and theft pose a looming threat. Inaccurate identity documents and verification can result in personal financial upheaval, legal complications, and reputational damage for innocent individuals. 
 Legal and Regulatory Necessity: It’s crucial to remember that document verification isn’t merely beneficial; it’s a legal and regulatory obligation. Organizations are bound to meet these standards to avoid penalties and contribute to broader efforts tackling financial crime, corruption, and even terrorism.

 Adoption of digital credentials 



<p>Over 2000 organizations that use #MARK Studio to issue and manage digital credentials started their journey because of the value propositions such as automation of credentialing workflows, better data management, ease of operations, marketing and branding capabilities and social sharing. And while each of these organizations started with a certificate as a digital credential, the variety of use cases for digital credentials across industries and critical sectors have contributed to the rapid adoption of robust credentialing programs.<br></p>



 #MARK Studio for credentialing 



<p>Today, #MARK Studio is the chosen credentialing platform for corporate training organizations, professional bodies and associations, professional certification agencies, higher education institutes, skilling and professional development organizations and learning experience platforms. The organizations use available templates to design and build their credentials and manage them through the entire lifecycle of issuance and management.</p>



 Features and Capabilities 



<p>A verifiable credential on #MARK Studio is a secure, portable and tamper-resistant digital representation of an accomplishment in real life. The credentials are anchored on the CORD blockchain. These credentials can represent participation in a workshop, the completion of a course, the successful completion of a lesson plan or even attendance at an event. Templates like certificates, badges, event pass and skilling credentials allow issuing organisations to look at the journey with a learner from the perspective of recognizing and rewarding the participation. This is a game-changing difference from the current models of credentialing and digital credentialing platforms such as #MARK Studio. By reducing the friction, labour and expense required to recognize an achievement, #MARK Studio opens up new avenues by which the lifelong learning and skill development paths can be documented using verifiable credentials.<br></p>



 Professional Development Use Case for Credentials 



<p>Consider an organization chartered to create skilling and professional development pathways for professionals such as educators. During a calendar year, these pathways will include creating learning modules, workshops, project assignments, in-person and offline training sessions, mentoring opportunities and more. Each activity is designed to build skills and test the application of the knowledge in different situations. As a learner progresses through these activities, there is a need to have a persistent record of acclaim that can be easily shared and verified in real time with a high degree of assurance. And when new acclaim is acquired, those should also be available to provide a comprehensive perspective of the skills and knowledge. Digitally verifiable credentials help meet these requirements through a modular representation of achievements as certificates, badges and micro-credentials. Instant social sharing builds credibility and recognition among peers creating a virtuous feedback cycle that encourages the learner.<br></p>



 Third-party app integration 



<p>#MARK Studio allows easy integration with third-party systems such as learning management systems (LMS) and ERP/CRM systems, allowing organizations to scale out the credentialing processes quickly and efficiently. This design thinking reduces the creation of silos of enrolment and learner data. Instead, it leverages the richly designed APIs to complete the issuance of digitally verifiable credentials at large volumes as required.<br></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Durable digital credentials with verifiable #MARKs empower the holders to discover more opportunities to compose and present their accomplishments. Recently, the concept of a “digital resume” has attracted attention from skilling organizations. The modularity of lifelong credentials on #MARK Studio enables the fluidity in building resumes that align with the specific employment or growth opportunities requirements. This makes the process of engagement with such opportunities easier and less cumbersome.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>



<p>Welcome to the world of verifiable credentials! If you’re new to this fascinating technology, you’re in the right place. In this beginner’s guide, we’ll walk you through the basics of verifiable credentials, their use cases across various industries, and how they can benefit you. Let’s dive in!<br><br></p>



<p>What are Verifiable Credentials?</p>



<p>verifiable credentials are digital documents that are securely anchored on a blockchain network. Blockchain, in simple terms, is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions or information in a tamper-proof way. These certificates are different from traditional paper-based certificates as they offer enhanced security, immutability, and ease of verification.<br><br></p>



<p>Use Cases in Different Industries:</p>



 
 Education Sector: In the education industry, verifiable credentials are revolutionizing credentialing and verification. By issuing records of academic achievements on the blockchain, educational institutions can prevent certificate fraud, reduce administrative costs, and provide students with a portable and tamper-proof record of their accomplishments.<br><br> 



 Human Resources: Companies are adopting verifiable credentials to record the qualifications and experiences of employees. This streamlines the hiring process, minimizes the risk of fake resumes, and ensures that the candidates’ credentials are authentic and up-to-date.<br><br> 



 Supply Chain Management: verifiable credentials are making their mark in supply chain management, where they help track the origin, quality, and authenticity of products. This improves transparency, reduces counterfeiting, and enhances trust between producers and consumers.<br><br> 



 Healthcare Industry: verifiable credentials are being used to secure medical records, licenses, and certifications. Patients have better control over their data, and healthcare providers can access verified and accurate information, leading to improved patient care.<br><br> 
 



<p>How verifiable credentials Work:</p>



<p>To understand how verifiable credentials function, it’s essential to grasp the underlying technology. Blockchain operates on a distributed network of computers (nodes) that work together to validate and record transactions in blocks. Each block contains a unique code (hash) and a reference to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks—hence the name “blockchain.”</p>



<p>When a certificate is issued, its details are encrypted into a transaction and added to the blockchain. Once recorded, the information becomes immutable and cannot be altered without consensus from the network, ensuring the certificate’s authenticity and integrity.<br><br></p>



<p>Benefits of verifiable credentials:</p>



 
 Security: The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it extremely secure. The certificates are resistant to hacking and tampering, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities.<br><br> 



 Transparency: The blockchain is transparent and publicly accessible, allowing anyone to verify the authenticity of a certificate, promoting trust and credibility.<br><br> 



 Cost-Effectiveness: Adopting blockchain technology for certificate issuance and verification eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing administrative costs.<br><br> 



 Accessibility: verifiable credentials can be accessed and shared digitally, making them convenient and easily portable.<br><br> 
 



<p>Verifiable credentials have the potential to transform various industries by providing a secure, transparent, and efficient way to handle credentials and certifications. Whether you’re a student, professional, or business owner, understanding this technology can give you a competitive edge. Embrace the world of verifiable credentials, and you’ll undoubtedly experience the benefits it brings to your field.</p>

  <p>In addition to the rise in remote and telework, people are conducting more of their personal business online — everything from getting the news to seeing the doctor to paying taxes. This move is a part of what's driving organizations in all sectors to engage in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> initiatives.</p>

<p>In the public sector, agencies are using advancements in technology to modernize websites, replace legacy software, and offer new services that are more convenient and streamlined for constituents and employees alike.</p>

<p>Of course, any significant change comes with challenges, but shying away from digital transformation is becoming impossible in an increasingly digital world. Fortunately, with proper organization and the right tools and solutions, modern organizations and public sector employees can adapt to and thrive in an era of change. Here are six new digital concerns public service sectors will have to address to get there.</p>
	
 1. Onboarding challenges 
	
<p>With new technology, agencies can streamline onboarding processes for their employees as well as new constituents signing up for services. While these technologies can accelerate by creating efficiencies and saving money, they do present challenges. The main one is that many people may not be comfortable with "self-service" IT — and others may not want to provide a lot of personal information upfront.</p>

<p>It's important to provide onboarding processes that are easy for IT teams to implement and for people to navigate, and this is where organizations in private industries and public agencies intersect: they all need to deliver experiences that are simple and secure for consumers, without requiring IT teams to custom-build registration and login journeys. View this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/experience-center/customer-onboarding">interactive tour</a> to see a simple onboarding experience, including "progressive profiling," which enables you to get to know your consumers and constituents over time.</p>

 2. Implementing security and compliance measures 
<p>As more and more of our data is stored online, there's been a dramatic increase in attacks designed to steal constituent and employee credentials as a way to infiltrate networks and steal data or hold it for ransom. To remain safe and compliant, public sector organizations must revamp their security measures to deal with digital attacks.</p>

<p>Digital security measures — including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>, firewalls, cloud protections, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">zero trust</a> — have become essential for preventing infiltration by unauthorized and malicious users, including bots, while providing uncomplicated access for legitimate users. This is especially true for government agencies, healthcare providers, financial institutions, and others that deal with very sensitive data.</p>

<p>In addition to using new security measures, companies must be aware of new digital <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/security-compliance">security and compliance</a> regulations meant to protect consumer and employee data.</p>

 3. Employee accessibility concerns 
	
<p>With a nearly endless list of new security updates and digital tools, public sector employers may find it difficult to grant employees access to the tools they need to do their jobs in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>While passwords are the most common method for authenticating users, they are rife with risks. In fact, password- or credential-based attacks have been the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">leading cause of breaches</a>, year after year. The problem is that any time there is a "known" secret, it is at risk of being stolen, guessed, shared, or subject to social engineering attacks like phishing.</p>

<p>Public sector organizations should consider <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> for constituent users and employees alike. Passwordless methods are becoming more readily available to consumers and include the use of passkeys, biometrics (such as fingerprints and facial scans), push authenticator apps, and more. Even where there are legacy applications and infrastructure, such as databases and VPNs that will always require passwords, there are new techniques that allow a passwordless experience, so that passwords are never seen or entered by users. Passwordless authentication provides a streamlined experience for users while delivering vastly superior security.</p>
	
 4. Legacy infrastructure 
	
<p>Many agencies use legacy applications that cannot be moved to the cloud. At the same time, there are plenty of legacy apps that can't support modern security controls. But secure access to these apps, which often drive essential services, is paramount.</p>

<p>Agencies need modern technologies that can support their legacy apps and infrastructure as well as their SaaS apps and cloud-delivered services. Learn about <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid IAM solutions</a> that provide a consistent experience for users, no matter what type of app or infrastructure they're accessing. A hybrid solution also closes the security gaps created by disparate IAM systems that don't share data.</p>

 5. Adapting to changing technology 
	
<p>Technology is constantly changing in ways that are good and bad. New capabilities offer better services and more pleasant and convenient online experiences. But malicious actors are also getting better at exploiting vulnerabilities that can expose data and erode the public's trust. Therefore, agencies must continually upgrade and adapt to new technologies that are inviting to the public — and that block uninvited attacks.</p>

<p>A great tool for organizations connecting with the public is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-ciam">customer identity and access management</a>, or CIAM. With CIAM, organizations can better manage citizen identities while providing enhanced security. Agencies can also use identity governance and threat protection, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, to provide enterprise-grade security and compliance. These tools allow organizations to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">protect digital identities</a> and remain compliant with security and data privacy regulations.</p>
	
 6. Scalability issues 
	
<p>Government institutions may deal with scalability issues as their legacy systems and security controls are unable to match increasing traffic and demands on online services. Upgrading these systems is costly and time-consuming, as upgrades tend to be implemented slowly and judiciously to ensure they meet security requirements.</p>

<p>Scalability is an area that can be addressed by moving certain services to the cloud, which can elastically scale with spikes in traffic and usage. But a cloud migration can create disruption, which is unacceptable for agencies delivering essential citizen services.</p>

<p>A modern IAM platform <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">accelerates cloud migration</a> by enabling you to quickly add IAM experiences and security controls on top of your legacy systems. It co-exists with these existing solutions as you migrate, minimizing disruption, and allowing you to sunset costly and inadequate capabilities.</p>

 Why digital transformation is necessary in the public sector 
	
<p>Digital transformation can streamline the production of new services, decrease wait times, reduce costs, and improve efficiency and accuracy. Although public sector organizations will see immediate benefits from upgraded software and new security systems, the steps they need to take to achieve these benefits may seem daunting — at least initially. Government agencies need to address the pressing issues of onboarding concerns, security issues, employee accessibility problems, and issues with infrastructure to take full advantage of new technology.</p>

<p>Still, legacy systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks, which could disrupt the lives of constituents who must entrust their personal information with their local, state, and national government agencies. As a result, finding a solution to these new digital concerns should be a priority for institutions and organizations within the public sector. With the appropriate tools in hand, organizations will be equipped to overcome challenges that arise on their digital transformation journeys.</p>

 Check out our comprehensive guide to gambling compliance, covering everything from the relevant regulations, cross-border operations, AML compliance, KYC requirements, data protection, responsible advertising, and employee training. 



 



<p>In a bid to reduce the risks associated with gambling activities, each national government and regulatory body establishes rules to govern different aspects of the sector.</p>



<p>Complying with gambling regulation is a never-ending challenge, especially for multi-jurisdictional operators, as they need to keep abreast of developments in the industry, and the launch of new markets and ‘games of chance’.&nbsp;</p>



 What is gambling compliance? 



<p>Gambling compliance refers to the adherence of gambling operators and gambling-related entities to the laws, regulations, and guidelines set forth by relevant authorities and governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It ensures all aspects of gambling activities, such as financial transactions, advertising practices, and player protection measures, conform to the legal requirements of a particular country to promote fair and responsible gambling practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, gambling compliance requires ongoing due diligence, collaboration with regulatory bodies, and investment in resources to navigate the complexities of the regulatory landscape while upholding the highest standards of legality and player protection. Unsurprisingly, gambling compliance has become a significant risk management area and a necessary challenge for the gambling industry to meet.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is gambling compliance important?&nbsp; 



<p>Gambling compliance is important because it enables gambling operators to:&nbsp;</p>



  Maintain legal standing<br>  Protect players and prevent problem gambling<br>  Build a strong reputation, prevent financial and legal risks, and contribute to the responsible growth and integrity of the gambling industry.&nbsp;  



 Gambling regulations and licensing. 



<p>The goal of gambling regulation is simple: to create a <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/playing-by-the-rules-why-regulators-regulate/">sustainable</a> industry. In essence, sustainability is at the heart of gambling regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main goal of regulatory bodies is to ensure all gambling operations are conducted fairly and safely. They should prevent consumers from engaging in fraudulent activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, impede problem gambling, and encourage responsible gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators are required to follow the regulations and rules as laid out by regulatory bodies, such as licensing requirements, age restrictions, and affordability checks. Through such efforts, regulatory bodies maintain integrity in the industry, protecting operators and consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulatory bodies issue (and revoke) licenses to operators that comply (or fail to comply) with the stipulated requirements and rules. Below are some general licensing requirements for gambling operators:&nbsp;</p>



  A copy of the operator’s passport, proof of address, a criminal history check, and a reference from their bank<br>  Ensuring that their software is in line with jurisdiction requirements. Preparing a list including details of software functionality and games, agreements with software developers, and certification of the Random Number Generator (RNG) employed<br>  Determining whether their platform carries the information required by their regulator. Many jurisdictions seek information regarding responsible gambling, terms, and conditions, withdrawal policy, self-exclusion, etc&nbsp;  



<p>Every country has varying rules as far as gambling regulation is concerned. For instance, in regions such as the UK, gambling is heavily regulated by the government and non-governmental organizations, like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">United Kingdom Gambling Commision</a> (UKGC), to ensure safety and fairness.</p>



<p>Gambling regulations are constantly being updated to reflect changes in the industry. For example, in April 2023, after much frustration and numerous delays, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s Gambling Act White Paper&nbsp;</a>was finally released. The white paper, which contains proposed changes to the UK’s Gambling Act 2005, aims to more accurately reflect gambling in the digital age, by addressing issues related to VIP customers, slot limits, financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks), and other facets of the UK’s gambling sector. </p>



<p>Read more about the UKGC’s three-year plan to implement changes to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UK’s gambling regulations</a> here.</p>



<p>Each country has their own approach to gambling compliance. In cases like Canada, even some cities have their own approach. Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">‘How to become compliant in Ontario’s iGaming market.’</a> Meanwhile, in Brazil, regulators are taking gradual steps toward implementing a regulatory regime, making sophisticated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/">KYC checks in South America</a> a necessity moving forward.</p>

 The importance of AML compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>AML compliance is crucial in the iGaming industry as it helps prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and ensures that the industry operates fairly. Adhering to AML regulations, operators can safeguard their reputations and avoid legal consequences. AML compliance for operators also helps maintain a safe environment for players, which is essential for users to build loyalty and trust in the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money laundering is often used to conceal illegally sourced funds. Without proper regulations in place, criminals could take advantage of various loopholes and exploit online gambling platforms for their own benefit. AML compliance helps protect operators from money laundering by ensuring they adhere to all necessary laws, regulations, and policies. Below are some of common stipulations seen across different regions:&nbsp;</p>



  Conduct continual risk assessments and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">customer due diligence measures</a><br>  Train staff and employees on AML regulations and best practices<br>  Carry out regular independent tests to ensure the effectiveness of the operator’s programs<br>  Ensure all the necessary compliance resources are present<br>  Put systems in place to detect unusual activity and track transactions<br>  Implement new technologies for security enhancement, e.g machine learning and artificial intelligence&nbsp;<br>  Keep up to date with the latest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML laws and regulations</a>&nbsp;  



 How KYC requirements ensure gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> procedures are crucial to gambling compliance when acquiring a license as an operator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such requirements usually include verifying a customer’s name, place of residence, and date of birth, generally verified via the submission of an official document (passport or driving license) and proof of address (bank statement or utility bill). Such documents must be authorized during onboarding or before customers can deposit any funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In most jurisdictions, operators must carry out KYC procedures as part of their local AML regulations. The requirements for operators vary depending on the jurisdiction but usually signify the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Authorizing the source of funds<br>  Authorizing customer identities<br>  Understanding customer relationships<br>  Tracking transactions<br>  Developing risk profiles<br>  Identifying and reporting unusual transactions when applicable<br>  Developing solid AML programs  



 Sustainability, player protection, and the vital role of KYC.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">Responsible gambling</a> is crucial to the long-term sustainability of the iGaming industry. Consequently, gambling operators are required to verify the identity and activities of their customers to prevent fraud, problem gambling, underage gambling, and other negative gambling-related consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, procedures like KYC are crucial as far as responsible gambling is concerned, as they protect vulnerable players and minors, as well as the operator, from fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators can also offer customers tools to practice responsible gambling, such as self-exclusion programs.&nbsp;</p>

 How data protection compliance shields player data.&nbsp; 



<p>The iGaming industry handles large quantities of private user data, making it a primary target for identity theft and data breaches. Keeping customer safety and privacy at the forefront, operators are required by regulatory bodies to comply with data protection laws. Compliance regulations ensure that customer privacy requests are entertained by operators, who are also responsible for taking measures to <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/compliance/taking-cover-how-to-handle-bettors-sensitive-data/">safeguard</a> private user data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption, multi-factor authentication, and robust access controls to protect user data and guarantee its integrity is crucial for operators.&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible advertising and gambling compliance. &nbsp; 



<p>According to regulatory bodies such as the UK Gambling Commission, the advertising of gambling products must be <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/advertising-marketing-rules-and-regulations">undertaken</a> responsibly and comply with the relevant advertising codes. The Codes ensure that gambling advertisements do not encourage gambling behavior deemed socially irresponsible that could result in social, financial, or emotional harm. Advertising gambling to minors is also strictly prohibited and has serious repercussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must comply with relevant laws to promote responsible gambling and safeguard vulnerable individuals. Preventing harmful gambling ads, especially to minors and vulnerable individuals, is essential for operators regarding gambling compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 The importance of regular audits in ethical iGaming operations.&nbsp; 



<p>Frequent compliance audits are crucial for operators to run operations within ethical and legal boundaries. Such audits help determine potential risks and prevent violations, meanwhile avoiding legal disputes and maintaining reputation. Prioritizing compliance and conducting regular audits must be a standard procedure for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Independent audits must audit operators’ compliance programs to determine their efficiency and avoid regulatory fines. These help operators and businesses determine their AML failures and deal with them before formal regulatory inspections get underway. This way, operators can avoid high regulatory fines as well as other serious consequences.&nbsp;</p>



 Legal challenges in cross-border online gambling.&nbsp; 



<p>Numerous legal challenges are associated with cross-border online gambling, including issues pertaining to regulation, taxation, and licensing. In many instances, operators are required to obtain licenses from multiple jurisdictions, each with varying regulations and requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different jurisdictions have different taxation laws, making it challenging for operators to comply with all of them. There are also concerns regarding the security of online gambling, most particularly where protecting customer information and fraud are concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Creating a culture of responsible gambling. 



<p>To comply with regulatory requirements and satisfy customers, operators must offer quality customer service and always facilitate a safe environment for customers. In this case, compliance training is crucial as it ensures all employees know how to act when dealing with customers with gambling addiction or other gambling-related issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a strong culture of compliance is crucial for numerous reasons, including avoiding potential regulatory violations, criminal charges, increasing investor/public confidence, and averting the loss of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/do-i-need-an-online-gaming-license/">gambling license</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure legal gambling practices, operators must monitor employee activities and conduct regular audits. Properly introducing compliance policies via employee training and written materials is vital, and enforcement must be fair and consistent to facilitate a culture of compliance and protect against reputational and legal risks.&nbsp;</p>



 The technological revolution in gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>Technology plays a vital role in gambling <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulatory-compliance/">compliance</a>. It has become crucial for operators to implement technological solutions to guarantee compliance with regulations and mitigate fraudulent activities. Such tools include age ID verification and age verification systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The application of artificial intelligence has revolutionized KYC compliance within the gambling industry, ensuring more effective processes. AI-powered verification ensures accurate yet efficient verification, and advanced facial recognition offers reliable ID verification. AI applications not only enhance compliance with KYC regulations but also enhance user experience, operational efficiency, and the overall integrity of the operator and industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gambling industry’s regulatory landscape presents various challenges for operators, such as complying with regulations in different jurisdictions, staying updated with constantly evolving laws, and ensuring customers a safe and fair gambling experience. Operators must address such challenges head-on by staying informed and embracing new technological advancements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasing use of artificial intelligence and data analytics and the growing vitality of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gambling</a> measures are all new trends constantly shaping the future of gambling compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 Betting on gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>Gambling compliance is essential, as it not only ensures the protection of customers, while offering them fair chances of winning, but it also helps maintain the integrity and sustainability of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposals set forth by the newly released UK Gambling White Paper signify that the importance of gambling compliance has only gained more importance, especially concerning new regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we move into the third quarter of 2023, we take a moment to reflect on our efforts in the ongoing mission of digital identity standardization and enhancement.</p><p> The majority of our daily interactions, both physical and digital, depend on the concept of identity, making it a critical area of focus. Yet, the absence of a native identity layer in the structure of the Internet demands careful coordination and collaboration.</p><p>To address this, SpruceID has been actively involved in various working groups of international standards bodies and foundations. We aim to contribute to open-source, interoperable solutions that will foster a user-centric, privacy-oriented internet applicable across diverse sectors. As part of this effort, we've been involved in developing key identity standards like the Verifiable Credentials 2.0 standard, the SD-JWT VC specification, and more.</p><p>The following are some key highlights of our work in the past quarter:</p><p>ISO Working Groups</p>  SpruceID is hosting the first fully remote ISO/IEC 18013:7 <a href="https://spruceid.com/iso-mdl-interop-event?ref=blog.spruceid.com">mDL interoperability test event</a> for online presentment in cooperation with AAMVA, Austroads, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 members. The event is open for registrations until August 7th at 11:59 UTC and will take place over two weeks at the end of August. The results will inform the ISO/IEC 18013-7 specification process.  We contributed to the ISO/IEC TS 23220-3 mdoc issuance specification and demonstrated how OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) can be used to securely issuance mdocs, and helped to shape the OID4VP mdoc profile in ISO/IEC TS 203220-4.  <p>W3C Working Groups</p>  We continued our work in W3C as editors and contributors to the upcoming <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM) 2.0</a> standard. The VCDM 2.0 will supersede VCDM 1.1 and will be accompanied by a series of other specifications, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Data Integrity</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jwt/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>.  We started the horizontal review process of the VCDM 2.0 standard and created the first self-reviews on architecture, security, privacy, accessibility, and internationalization. In this course, we work with the W3C TAG (Technical Architecture Group), PING (Privacy and Security Interest Group), Internationalization Working Group, and Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group.  We continued to be engaged in the RDF-related working groups in W3C. Finally, we helped transition the proposed W3C Verifiable Credentials Confidence Method vocabulary to W3C CCG.  <p>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</p>  We are spearheading the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-terbu-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT VC</a> specification in IETF that describes using Selective Disclosure JWTs (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT</a>) to secure JSON-based Verifiable Credentials here. The High-Assurance Profile in the <a href="https://openid.net/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID Foundation (OIDF)</a> selected this SD-JWT VC as their preferred credential format. It is also under consideration by the eIDAS 2.0 <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a>. The specification will also be presented at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IETF 117</a> before the OAuth2 Working Group.  We are also closely following the development of the SCITT working group in IETF.  <p>OpenID Foundation Working Groups</p>  We continued contributing to the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC)</a> series as editors of the specifications and as contributors. Amongst others, OID4VC includes <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP)</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI)</a>.  We also helped set up a new working group in the OIDF on Digital Credentials Protocols.  <p>OpenWallet Foundation (OWF)</p>  We continued our engagement in several OWF working or interest groups, such as on Architecture, OID4VC, and credential comparisons.  <p>Web3 Standards</p>  We worked with wallet vendors to address their feedback on EIP-4361 so the specification gives better guidance on how domain binding has to be implemented. The updates are already published in the Ethereum EIP repository.  We contributed to the UCAN working group regarding consistency with timestamps, signature types, and header entry restrictions.  We also contributed to the CACAO (CAIP-196) working group regarding consistent timestamp representations and paths to supporting W3C WebAuthn for signature generation and verification.  Finally, we contributed a definition for did:pkh representations to the MultiDID specification in CASA.  <p>Additional Working Groups</p>  Together with other subject matter experts in the World Economic Forum (WEF) identity working group, we published a whitepaper on <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/reimagining-digital-id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Reimaging Digital Identity</a>.  <p>We fundamentally believe this work to champion global standards is core to the success of further adoption of digital identity, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving yet seamless interactions that build digital trust across the web.</p><p>If you're interested in discussing or contributing to any of our work outlined above, please contact our team.</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.<br></p>

<p>It’s a rare thing at a tech conference to hear cheers when someone says the internet is down. But then, <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> is a rare sort of tech conference.</p>Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a><p>To be fair, we knew that our access to the internet was going to get turned off, and we knew it was only for a day. And it was supposed to be a fun experiment, an opportunity to test all the local-friendly technologies that participants had brought with them. But for most people in the world, this is not a game; it’s a hard reality that they face daily. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet?facet=entity&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org#interactive-charts-on-internet">Almost half of us</a> don’t have any access at all, and for many of those of us who do, access to high-speed internet is not easy, cheap, or reliable.</p><p>Some might argue that isn’t such a bad thing. I imagine those cheers came from a bittersweet awareness that the internet’s effect on society hasn’t all been rosy, a sentiment that’s echoed by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90909279/gen-xers-and-older-millennials-really-just-want-to-go-back-in-time-to-before-the-internet-existed?ref=blog.holochain.org">most generation Xers and millennials</a> in the connected world. But I think it’s also true that networked digital information technologies can be a potent force for empowerment and justice. Economic and political powers are already wielding these tools to their advantage, and those whose security is threatened by those same powers can (and sometimes must) use the same tools if they want to survive.</p>Eric Bear describes the success of the Earth Defenders Toolkit in applying technology judiciously to the contexts of indigenous groups. Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a> An urgent call to step up <p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">Last year I learned</a> about the success of <a href="https://digital-democracy.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Digital Democracy</a> and <a href="https://ahau.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Āhau</a>, two groups building tools for indigenous people around the world to map the wealth in their ecosystems and cultures and use the collected data to preserve their sovereignty — even to the point of <a href="https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/community/mapping-waorani-ancestral-lands-in-ecuador/?ref=blog.holochain.org">winning cases in federal courts</a>.</p><p>This year, however, I heard fewer new success stories and more passionate calls for working tools. The message from activists and change-makers was clear and very loud: They need what we’re building, they need it to work, and they need it yesterday. We were confronted with stories from people working to support the <a href="https://rohingyaproject.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">survival of their people</a>, stories from people striving to <a href="https://www.shareable.net/uniting-tech-and-activism-how-dweb-camp-is-elevating-decentralized-technology/?ref=blog.holochain.org">preserve bodily autonomy and gender-affirming care</a>, stories from people trying to keep the lights on when infrastructure failed. The traditional web can’t serve these needs — you can’t deliver a cloud-based solution to people who have no internet, or whose access is policed by oppressive states.</p><p>The call was both encouraging and sobering. It showed that those of us building tools for decentralisation are on the right track, but it also revealed how much work we have ahead of us.</p><p>There’s a gap between creators and practitioners. Many of us are building tools that we hope the world needs. We start out ‘scratching our own itch’, reasoning that if we need something, then others must too. And that’s where our genius comes from; our creativity gives birth to new possibilities. But our technology is still young, and we haven’t had a lot of experience testing it to see if it is, in fact, what the rest of the world needs.</p><p>In many sessions, like a <a href="https://dwebcamp2023.sched.com/event/1NuA9/thinking-differently-how-do-distributed-patterns-affect-the-way-we-do-things?ref=blog.holochain.org">workshop</a> that my colleague Collin and I hosted on questioning and testing our design choices, and a discussion circle hosted by <a href="https://dweblabs.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Labs</a>, we bridged the creator/practitioner divide to face one question together: how do we make our tech solve real problems?</p>A discussion group at DWeb Camp. Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a> Where to go next <p>The main theme I heard was that the specific tools don’t matter. What matters is that they work. The appropriate solution for a given context might be as simple as a web service running on a ten-year-old laptop, or even pen and paper, or it might be complex enough to <a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network?ref=blog.holochain.org">warrant a blockchain</a>.</p><p>In uncovering what this means, I heard a few other themes:</p><p>It’s time for developers and designers to unseat themselves as authorities, presenting themselves instead as servants who <a href="https://letsstudio.substack.com/p/introducing-lets?ref=blog.holochain.org">honour the wisdom and abilities</a> of the people they’re designing for. Users are the best experts on what they need, yet the ‘culture of the expert’ undermines that and leaves them feeling disempowered.</p><p>One-size-fits-all tools are not necessarily going to work, especially if they embed assumptions that come from a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/09/joseph-henrich-explores-weird-societies/?ref=blog.holochain.org">western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratised</a> perspective. The key to transforming our design process is relationship — meeting the real people we intend to serve, not abstract personas, and learning to listen to them. <a href="https://okthanks.com/blog/2020/3/19/orbot-listening-groups?ref=blog.holochain.org">Co-design</a>, especially using an agile approach, is a well-established set of practices for sharing the design process.</p><p>This will result in culturally appropriate software, tailored to the needs of a specific group. But in our effort to make empowering software accessible to more people (that is, making it affordable to create and access these tools), we may also want to create <a href="https://archive.org/details/neighbourhoods-metagov">‘generic tools’ for ‘specific cultures’</a> — tools that, while one-size-fits-all, embed as few assumptions as possible. If we want to do this well, we’ll need to analyze our designs rigorously for cultural blind spots, make our tools as adaptable as possible, and most importantly, partner with real people to test them.</p><p>Solve for needs that are regular rather than rare. Rather than building with an eye toward a once-every-twenty-years type natural disaster, we can focus on creating tools and processes that help address everyday needs. From communication and coordination, to commerce or even play, people have to find a tool useful in their daily lives or they won’t adopt it. By serving everyday needs, we can ensure that these tools are already in use when one of those rare events inevitably comes along.</p><p>Build for surprise and delight. Similarly, if we build something that is all function, but isn't simple, easy, and effective in addressing the issue at hand, then people aren't going to use it. Like much of the open source software space, those of us developing distributed solutions need to get more disciplined about designing for ease of use.</p><p>I think there’s something unique in local-first tech that could actually surpass the user experience of cloud software. It makes apps ‘just work’ in ways that are challenging for the cloud to match — most DWeb stacks already give users offline mode and inbuilt privacy while making automatic scaling easy and low-cost for developers. Our next step is to close gaps that make the experience unfamiliar, complicated, and buggy. Adoption happens when the first experience is rewarding.</p><p>Better solutions are discovered when tool-makers cooperate with each other. We need a humility that’s courageous enough to step back when someone else’s tool is more appropriate for the job — even (or especially) if that tool is not digital. Rather than fix-alls, let’s see our projects (and distributed tech as a whole) as layers in a stack which shifts from use case to use case. By building greater interoperability between our tools, we can occupy ecological niches that are mutually supportive of each other. Protocol-agnostic approaches like those used by <a href="https://ad4m.dev/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ADAM</a> — which allow users to enjoy a unified experience bridging between spaces and tools — can help us leverage the richness of our ecosystem.</p><p>I was encouraged to see creators and practitioners forming coalitions; DWeb Labs was the most prominent of these. It consists of people who have separately been applying DWeb tech to big problems for years, so it’s wonderful to see them combining their experience and demonstrating the mutual respect that allows them to find the best solutions rather than compete for primacy.</p><p>There are new territories to explore. The DWeb community has long been about simply building alternative systems in the shadow of the dominant systems. There’s a subtly anarchic do-it-ourselves streak here; we prefer to “build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete”, in R Buckminster Fuller’s famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13119-you-never-change-things-by-fighting-the-existing-reality-to?ref=blog.holochain.org">words</a>, rather than fighting against big, top-heavy structures.</p><p>This DWeb Camp, I heard more people talking about dancing strategically with those structures. On a mere pragmatic level, governments and large corporations are the world’s biggest buyers of software, and sages like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%22ACoAAAAA7k8BO2ZeCuuDpsn9aSipkOg2uYhPqc0%22&amp;facetNetwork=%22F%22&amp;origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&amp;sid=9-l&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Mei Lin Fung</a> encouraged us to consider how we could impact people’s lives if we got these institutions to adopt our tech.</p><p>There’s also room for us to start influencing public policy, educating lawmakers about the fact that the DWeb is not just a place where nasty characters hang out but can actually empower citizens in ways that align with the values these officials claim to uphold. And when the DWeb community cooperates on this, our unified voice will carry more weight.</p><p>We can never fully anticipate the consequences of our design choices, but we can speculate intelligently about them, uncover our assumptions, identify the gaps in our knowledge, and become curious enough to explore and close those gaps. And as we build up a community of practice with its own ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language?ref=blog.holochain.org">pattern languages</a>’ — libraries of interconnected design solutions that are proven through experience to work (or not work) for given contexts — the unknown will give way to a body of best practices, and our design interventions will become progressively more life-giving and less damaging to the people we serve.</p><p>A number of us are <a href="https://decentpatterns.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">creating</a> pattern languages together for various aspects of DWeb design, ranging from online communities to cryptographic protocols. <a href="https://discord.gg/myTUswWQz?ref=blog.holochain.org">Join us on the DWeb Discord server</a> if that sort of thing gets you excited!</p>Our workshop secretly also focused on how you can't fully anticipate the consequences of our design choices. Celebrating how far we’ve come <p>In enumerating the challenges and opportunities ahead of us, I run the risk of making it sound like the decentralised web hasn’t made any progress. That is, thankfully, not true. As I mentioned before, organisations like Digital Democracy are pioneering the use of peer-to-peer tech in support of marginalised peoples around the world, and technologies like <a href="https://www.braid.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Braid</a>, <a href="https://gun.eco/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GUNdb</a>, <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a>, <a href="https://hypercore-protocol.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hypercore</a>, <a href="https://www.ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, <a href="https://solidproject.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Solid</a>, <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Spritely</a>, and even humble HTTP are quietly being incorporated into tools that people are using in their daily lives.</p><p>When the internet was disconnected on the last full day of DWeb Camp, many of these technologies had moments of brilliance. Here are a few:</p>  <a href="https://webofcommunity.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb of Community</a>, a simple web app made available on the local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network?ref=blog.holochain.org">mesh network</a>, did one thing and did it well: it allowed us to quickly exchange contact information with each other using our smartphones. It demonstrated that sometimes a simple off-the-shelf protocol like HTTP is all that’s needed.  Emergence, a scheduling app built by the Holochain team, was able to onboard a number of participants before the whole valley lost electricity, taking down the camp’s mesh network. You can read about our experiences building, testing, debugging, and deploying this app in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">Eric’s blog post</a>.  Even after the power went out, one team was able to continue using <a href="https://github.com/tschudin/vossbol?ref=blog.holochain.org">vossbol</a>, a voicemail messaging app built with a peer-to-peer protocol that uses smartphones, Bluetooth, LoRa, and a cheap $20 microcontroller as a relay server.  After electricity was restored, people got the chance to play with a few Holochain apps (including <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a>). The camp’s mesh network wasn’t completely restored yet, so we were able to connect computers using someone’s mobile phone as a hotspot simply acting as a router, without connecting to cell service!  One participant was able to prototype and demo a <a href="https://memije.substack.com/p/dweb-camp-2023?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first collaborative playlist app</a> using GUNdb and Braid.  The <a href="https://guardianproject.info/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Guardian Project</a> demoed their <a href="https://likebutter.app/box/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Butterbox</a> device, a hub that deploys a local network and Android app store full of privacy-preserving, local-first apps.  <a href="https://hyperhyper.space/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hyper Hyper Space</a> demoed Hyper, a web-hosted browser for their peer-to-peer asset-sharing network.  <p>The challenges we face are real, but the need is also real, the opportunities are great, and we’re beginning to show the world what’s possible. As we work to improve the user experience, local-first, peer-to-peer, and agent-centric technologies will become better, more attractive solutions than cloud technologies. At that point, developers and their users may not care that they’re using something that’s more resilient, privacy-friendly, capture-resistant, and respectful of their dignity. But if we remain diligent about meeting real needs, everyone will become empowered by default as these tools are adopted.</p>Sometimes the best tools are paper and a pen.

 Is there any wonder why crypto operators are questioning existing onboarding processes, and experimenting with alternative options like iris scans, when governments and global regulatory bodies are still deliberating correct policing procedures? 



 



<p>If there’s one thing that can’t be levelled against the often maligned and misunderstood industry of crypto, is that it’s boring. In fact, despite cryptocurrency being almost 15 years old, many countries are still wrestling with what it actually is, let alone how to properly police it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, while there are certain regions, like the European Union, that are well on their way to enforcing a crypto regulatory framework (via the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulation</a>), others, like the UK, are moving very slowly with their own proposed crypto regime. In fact, it was only recently that the UK government officially rejected a proposal to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-rejects-call-regulate-crypto-gambling-2023-07-20/">regulate crypto assets as a form of gambling</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information on how the UK’s crypto regime may look, check out our ‘Regulations – Explained in 90 seconds’ video, with our Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech, Jason Tucker-Feltham.</p>



 



 

 



 Riding the crypto roller coaster. 



<p>Having seemingly recovered from the multiple downs of 2022, the crypto industry appears once again to be in its ascendancy. This month, it was revealed that the bitcoin price <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/23/the-skys-the-limit-crypto-now-braced-for-a-multi-trillion-wall-street-earthquake-after-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-litecoin-solana-tron-and-polygon-price-boom/">had doubled since the beginning of the year</a>, and the industry shows no signs of slowing, both in terms of size and scope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when is crypto’s rate of growth too fast, and will regulators ever be able to keep pace?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a sector that has never been shy about pushing the boundaries of technology and questioning the limitations of existing systems, it is understandable that crypto players would experiment with new approaches. The problem, however, is that many of these novel approaches are being conducted on unstable, unregulated ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the recent furore surrounding Worldcoin, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spearheaded by OpenAI Chief, Sam Altham, the cryptocurrency and digital ID project verifies users’ identity through a simple retina scan. This, it claims, ensures a fair distribution process, with each individual only able to claim their<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/"> sign-up bonus once</a>, and also helps to detect deep fakes, which are increasingly being used to perpetrate fraudulent activity, and to complete customer onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A valid and admirable intention, but is it ethical?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Worldcoin boasts ambitious goals, including a potential path to AI-funded Universal Basic Income. However, many concerns have been voiced by the crypto community, particularly on Worldcoin’s targeting of individuals from developing nations. This deployment strategy calls into question whether all those who have been subject to iris scanning fully understand the implications of participating. Could the irrevocable capturing of iris data at some point work against early adopters? The ultimate usage of World IDs remains unclear,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and Fintech at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



 In the eye of the verifier.&nbsp; 



<p>Worldcoin has recorded and stored thousands of iris scans so far, which are being used to train its algorithms, but has assured users it will <a href="https://www.context.news/big-tech/what-is-worldcoin-and-what-does-it-mean-for-our-privacy">destroy and hash users’ biometric data after usage,</a> but has not yet announced when that will be or provided a deadline for when they will delete data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not just privacy considerations that are causing concern, however, but where such a bold step may lead to in the future, especially for matters relating to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>, and to cut corners or offer a much less tried and tested approach to identity verification comes at a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">huge risk</a>.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, as with any new and novel approach, fraud experts are quick off the mark in exploiting loopholes. In China, Worldcoin has gone viral, despite local users being unable to legally downland and register for the platform. The reason for the sudden, mass popularity is that users are bypassing these restrictions by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037">buying iris data</a> for as little as $30 from countries, such as Cambodia and Kenya. In fact, the business in biometrics is booming, leading to the Kenyan government recently banning <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/kenya-bans-worldcoin-activities-as-citizens-trade-biometrics-for-tokens">‘Worldcoin activities’</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>The incentive offered by Worldcoin – crypto in exchange for iris scans – is clearly a catalyst for user adoption. When it comes to personal data, however, many think twice before parting ways with it.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and Fintech at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“Crypto rewards are nothing new in an ever-crowded market, and with backing from some of the world’s largest VC firms, the incentive structure has long been planned by Worldcoin to increase the likelihood of its commercial success. However, perhaps what was not initially envisaged was the ease in which World IDs could be exploited by bad actors for financial gain. A black market is emerging in the trade of World IDs and yet a way in which to prevent such trade has yet to emerge,” added Jason.&nbsp;</p>



 More than meets the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Innovation is important, especially in such a forward-looking industry like crypto. Technological innovation can be transformational for businesses and consumers, but it must always be done within the guardrails of a) regulation and b) a safe and secure environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, crypto platforms can be assured their customers are who they say they are. The responsible use of biometrics, when combined with video identification, in addition to collecting official documents forms part of a solid and robust KYC process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automated identity verification, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes. Adhering to KYC and AML requirements should be logical for every crypto platform, wherever they want to operate, especially whilst regulatory frameworks are still being finalized.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>&nbsp;are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">&nbsp;identity verification solutions</a>&nbsp;work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, its online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.&nbsp;</p>

 The notion of identity – and how to balance online anonymity with accountability – has been a conundrum since the internet was invented. Indeed, the concept of digital identity is one that continually evolves alongside various regulatory and technological developments. But what exactly is digital identity? 



<p>Since 2015, France has had an identity federator called FranceConnect, and more than 40 million users have already used it. However, the digital identity offered remains a low-level identity. In 2021, FranceConnect+ was deployed to remedy this problem and offer the possibility of accessing more secure digital identities (substantial and high levels). France is one of the first countries to have introduced substantial-level identity into its national regulations, acting as a forerunner in this area.</p>



 What is digital identity? 



<p><a href="https://www.yris.eu/en/">Digital identity</a> is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-viky-manaila/">digital counterpart</a> to the evidence we can provide in the physical world. As the digital counterpart of the identity document, it can provide the same level of confidence in online and sensitive use cases as an identity document can in physical use cases.</p>



<p>It is therefore a means of proving identity, but not only that. It is also a means of secure authentication, and can be used to prove certain attributes of identity such as age or nationality. <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/particulier">CNIL</a> (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés or French Data Protection Authority) points out how, “identity is more than just civil status”. </p>



<p>Identification and authentication using a digital identity is a three-way game. The user, having created his digital identity with the help of an identity provider, will use it to authenticate himself with a public or private operator, more commonly known as a service provider.</p>



<p>The best-known use case is when entering into a remote relationship. Here, digital identity makes it possible to retrieve reliable identity data, rather than an identity document. It is also a means of accessing the different accounts we use every day. In this way, it makes our everyday lives easier, while improving the level of security of the services we access.</p>



 What are the different levels of digital identity? 



<p>Digital identity has been regulated at European level, enabling it to be transposed into national law. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS</a> regulation sets three levels for digital identity:</p>



  Low level: Most of the time, this is a username and password. However, this identity is subject to various risks, including phishing. Nevertheless, it is still interesting for uses that do not require a very high level of trust (checking the number of points on your driving license, for example);  Substantial level: This is the level of identity most expected for sensitive transactions in the world of payment and finance, but can also be useful for other uses. Substantial level identity is created face-to-face or equivalent, using a piece of identification and involving strong two-factor authentication (2FA). The first factor is the telephone used to prove ownership. The second factor involves proving what you know, such as a personal code determined when the identity was created;  High-level: Although there are still few cases of this being used, most Member States have adopted a high-level identity. Despite the fact that it is created on the same basis as a substantial-level identity, the identity card used must be fitted with a chip, which acts as a cryptographic element at the time of creation. When used, the cryptographic element must be used for verification as a strong authentication vector.  



 



 

 



 



 How does digital identity work in practice? 



<p>Digital identity can be created in one of two ways: face-to-face or face-to-face equivalent, i.e. remotely. In the second case, which represents the majority of use cases, the process only takes a few minutes to complete. To do this, you need to take a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/capture-solutions/">photo of your identity document</a> and a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">video of yourself</a> to determine whether the person creating the account is really the same person as the one on the document submitted. At this stage, a number of automated checks come into play to verify the veracity of the information submitted. Finally, when a substantial or high-level identity is created, a human operator checks these elements.</p>



<p>Once the identity has been created, it can be reused in a matter of seconds on different services using two-factor authentication. For the user, the digital identity eliminates the need to use multiple IDs/passwords, thanks to a single gateway to a wide range of uses. They will also not have to scan or provide their ID every time they enter into a new relationship.</p>



<p>Finally, it gives them greater control over their personal data. The advantage of digital identity is that it provides only the identity data needed for the service, rather than all of it. This represents a step forward in data control. In terms of privacy protection, the <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/france-cnil-publishes-dossier-regarding-use-digital">CNIL recommends</a> “identifying the need for trust in the service and using the lowest level of identification and authentication that meets this need”.</p>



 What are the benefits for service providers? 



<p>Digital identity offers a number of advantages not only for users, but also for service providers. Without competing with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">current identity verification solutions</a>, digital identity logically coexists with existing solutions.</p>



<p>Thanks to digital identity, the level of confidence in authentication procedures is strengthened, particularly for those who do not yet have strong authentication. By eliminating the need for back-office document verification, digital identity reduces costs and eliminates a tedious and time-consuming task. It is also a major commercial advantage, since it reduces friction during the initial contact, thereby improving the conversion rate.</p>



<p>In all areas subject to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Combating the Financing of Terrorism</a> (AML/CFT) regulations, digital identity makes it easier to meet <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> obligations, by correlating numerous identity elements.</p>



<p>Last but not least, digital identity has a direct impact on the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/">fight against fraud</a>. By being verified by identification specialists, the data submitted is more reliable and less likely to have been stolen or falsified. Digital identity thus guarantees the reliability of identity data. In addition, digital identity providers are regularly audited and must comply with strict obligations, ensuring the security of the entire value chain.</p>



 What is the outlook for digital identity? 



<p>Although there are many use cases, digital identity is still in its infancy. It is set to become the standard for authentication and identification in the next few years, and we need to be prepared for this. By offering numerous advantages for both users and service providers, digital identity will revolutionize, simplify and secure our identification habits for the long term.</p>



<p>At European level, the prospects offered by the European Digital Identity Portfolio are also opening up new horizons. In addition to making it easier to identify oneself within services in other countries thanks to the interoperability of identities, it will be able to contain additional attributes, such as driving licenses or diplomas. The arrival of such solutions will have a direct impact on the user experience and on the way we interact with all our day-to-day services.</p>

 We sat down with our Sales Director, Olivier Artus, to discuss the PVID framework, its impact on the financial market, its evolution over time and its implementation at IDnow. 



 What will the PVID certification mean for the financial market in practice? 



<p>The PVID certification offers a clear and precise reference for all remote identity verification players on the French market. It allows financial market players to integrate a certified solution of substantial level into their process, which will make the entry into a relationship consistent with a face-to-face equivalent. This is the first time that the French authorities that regulate the financial services market have proposed a solution, integrating biometrics, that is 100% compliant with the Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), without having to add any additional measures other than ID and biometrics.</p>



 What will the PVID standard add to the remote identity verification process? 



<p>The real difference is the instant compliance of the entry into the relationship. Until now, the use of biometrics in a transaction, although secure, had no substantial value, i.e. was not recognized or certified by an authority. Thanks to PVID, we finally have a solution that offers a face-to-face equivalent, in line with the requirements of the regulators.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">PVID standard</a> makes it possible to offer online access to unbanked populations. Thanks to the certification, it is no longer necessary to add additional measures such as the first payment by bank transfer, for example, which is less inclusive and often a source of failure or even cost. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">use of biometrics</a> is now recognized as a full complementary measure.</p>



<p>The rules imposed by traditional financial institutions for opening an account have made the entry into a relationship a real challenge. If we had had a PVID standard at the time of the health crisis, for example, traditional banks would have been able to do even more business securely and therefore more transactions.</p>



 Will all players in the financial sector be affected by this certification? In particular the crypto players, the fintech world… will everyone be on the same page? 



<p>All players subject to <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/">ACPR</a> and <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/regulation/regulation-homepage">AMF</a> regulations will now be able to include a biometric entry path in their solution: credit institutions, personal and capital insurance, fintech, payment institutions, etc. Some other sectors will not be immediately affected by PVID, such as property and casualty insurance, which does not have a KYC obligation as it is not considered a risk area.</p>



<p>Other sectors of the financial sphere such as issuers of prepaid products and so-called credit FinTechs will obviously be interested in the development of such solutions to enhance trust when entering into a remote relationship.</p>



<p>As far as crypto is concerned, the AMF in France has defined the PSAN status (Service Provider on Digital Assets) in order to better supervise the market players and requires for this the implementation of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">complete KYC path</a>, including identity verification. This is equivalent to the PVID process for banks. More globally and in order to harmonize the European crypto regulatory landscape, it is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets)</a> regulation that will enter soon, still with the objective of protecting investors and preserving financial stability.</p>



<p>The first beneficiaries of the PVID standard will therefore be banks, neo-banks, payment institutions and credit players. What is important to remember is that players who are not directly concerned by PVID will be able to accelerate their insertion into the market and strengthen confidence in the construction of a customer relationship, thanks to this type of standard.</p>



 What will be the benefits of a PVID certification for financial market participants? 



<p>The last two years have seen a significant increase in cases of online identity fraud. In our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">latest Identity Fraud Trend Report</a> we found a 144% increase in the use of fake identity documents between November and December 2021. PVID certification strengthens traditional remote identity verification solutions, and improves the fight against identity theft through the use of biometrics.</p>



<blockquote><p>Beyond the fight against fraud, the challenge of the PVID standard is to fight against financial crime during remote identification, and therefore money laundering. This involves identifying the origin of funds and the destination of funds. The PVID process completes the financial institution’s AML/CFT system.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



 Do you think that the arrival of PVID will increase confidence in the market? 



<p>Of course. The primary objective of PVID is to strengthen the trust between the financial institution and the customer when subscribing to a service or opening an account.</p>



<p>The end customer will go through a process that is based on a public repository published by a recognized government agency, which represents an additional element of trust for him. For its part, the financial institution will rely on an expert company that provides it with a solution certified by the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> to a substantial level with regard to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">European eIDAS regulation</a>, in order to verify the authenticity of the identity of the customers it deals with.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">PVID standard</a> adds control points to identity documents. The dynamic capture of the document allows the detection of security features that cannot be verified in static mode. Then, a manual analysis completes the automated verification of the captures. It is carried out by operators trained in fraud who check, correct and give a final verdict on the user data in less than 5 minutes.</p>



 What, in your opinion, are the challenges to encourage the adoption of this new type of standard? 



<p>The first challenge is the user experience, which must be simple, intuitive, fast and perfectly integrated into our customers’ acquisition flow. The use of a mobile phone in the context of a long-distance relationship can be a barrier for less technophile users. For this reason, we offer an omnichannel pathway (on smartphones, tablets and computers). Our PVID certified pathway offers an intuitive, step-by-step guided experience to simplify the identity verification process for the user, for high conversion rates.</p>



<p>Furthermore, citizens are becoming increasingly vigilant about the handling of their personal data. Here again, our solutions are compliant with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Our solutions and all processed data are securely hosted in Europe and we have our own infrastructure. Thus, we guarantee the complete confidentiality and protection of all shared data and analyses performed.</p>



<p>In addition to the user aspect, we also have a duty to support financial institutions in learning how to use the solutions and optimize their processes.</p>



 In terms of geography, who will be affected by PVID? And in your opinion, will this certification evolve? 



<p>From a technical point of view, the solution will initially apply to the entire French market under the aegis of the ACPR. As France is a recognized financial center, it is likely that the PVID process could also be recognized as compliant in other EU countries in the context of remote entry.</p>



<blockquote><p>It can be assumed that this regulation will continue to exist and that it may evolve from a functional point of view. Optional modules may be added to the solution to suit different countries and local regulators.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



<p>In the context of the emergence of digital identity and identity wallets, our near future will be to rely on a PVID certified solution for the creation of a recognized digital identity of substantial level.</p>



 What is the status of certification at IDnow? 



<p>IDnow has obtained the ANSSI Security Visa for PVID certification of its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-provider-criteria/">identity verification services</a>! Symbolizing the culmination of months of collaboration and involvement by all our teams, this certification demonstrates our determination to offer our customers secure solutions that comply with current French regulations.</p>

<p>At Fission, we believe that people and the communities they belong to deserve more agency over their data. In the Harvard Business Review article, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-companies-make-it-so-hard-for-users-to-control-their-data">Why It's So Hard for Users to Control Their Data</a> by Bhaskar Chakravorti, digital agency is defined as the ability of users to own the rights to their personal data, manage access to this data and potentially be compensated fairly for such access.</p> The Case for User-Owned Data <p>Web 2.0 saw a huge rise in app platforms, and users became used to sharing their personal information to gain access. But as data breaches occurred and tracking became more sophisticated, users started pushing back against data collection and its resulting invasions of privacy. </p><p>Legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> was passed to protect users by spelling out their rights over their data, but this isn't enough. How many users tick the checkbox and authorize data collection and tracking on the websites they visit simply so they can carry on with what they were doing?</p><p>Many users care about data privacy, but their actions don't always match their concerns. Chakravorti lays out three possible reasons: 1) Data is intangible, and because we're not physically handing it over, it doesn't feel as meaningful to us 2) Users have little leverage to negotiate more data agency because they feel trapped in many services 3) Managing one's own data is complex. </p><p>How can we mitigate these roadblocks and empower users to take back control of their data and privacy, but do so in a more intuitive and user-friendly way?</p> Promising Solutions <p>Local-First Apps</p><p>Local first apps adopt principles and practices prioritizing data ownership, privacy, and control. Data is stored locally on users' devices, giving them direct control over their information. Even if data is synchronized across devices or stored in the cloud, local-first apps often use end-to-end encryption to ensure it remains inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. Users can even modify their data when there is no Internet connection! &nbsp;</p><p>The way changes are made in local-first file systems also empowers users. For example, CRDTs handle data synchronization and guarantee eventual consistency while allowing users to collaborate with others and retain control over their data. </p><p>Fission's Webnative File System (<a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>) is a local-first E2EE file system that developers can integrate with their apps to ensure their users are in control while they remain GDPR-compliant. It's a win-win! </p><p>Interoperable Standards</p><p>As mentioned earlier, many users feel trapped on their platforms because there is no easy way to transfer their data from one service to another. There are ways a user can download their data and request its deletion from the server, but porting that data over to another similar service and picking up where they left off has not always been that simple. It wasn't until GDPR mandated the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">right to data portability</a> that big tech companies came together to work on the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Project</a> and make downloaded data standardized. As a result, companies like Apple, Meta, and Google now interoperate with each other. </p><p>Another way of using standardization is to create a protocol. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, has been working on a new web infrastructure called Solid. &nbsp;<a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> lets users store their data securely in "Pods". Pods are decentralized data stores that act as secure personal web servers for data. It is similar to the local-first app approach in that the data remains with the users. Applications that adhere to standard, open, and interoperable data formats and protocols, like Linked Data, can store and access data in Pods with the user's consent using the Solid Protocol.</p><p>Blockchain technologies have also empowered users to store their data with more agency. <a href="https://www.disco.xyz/">Disco.xyz</a> uses a "data backpack" to keep their data portable while transitioning from Web2 to Web3. By combining Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with Verifiable Credentials (VCs), users can cryptographically verify their identities and share their data with their chosen communities or apps.</p><p>Data Trusts and Data Commons</p><p>A data trust looks after the data and data rights of individuals. Trustees act on behalf of the collective good of the group and can decide whether to grant or revoke access to their members' data. And according to the MIT Technology Review article <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017801/data-trust-cybersecurity-big-tech-privacy/">How Data Trusts Protect Privacy</a> by Anouk Ruhaak, "because the data trust would represent a collective, it could negotiate terms and conditions on our behalf. Thus, it could allow us to exercise our rights as producers of data in much the same way trade unions allow workers to exercise their rights as purveyors of labor." </p><p>Furthermore, data trusts are a way to make larger data sets more available for AI training, research, and innovation while keeping users in control. This could even be a mechanism for users to get paid for their data - similar to how people are paid when participating in clinical trials. </p> <p>The growth of user-owned data solutions can lead to several benefits, such as increased transparency, privacy-centric and user-friendly applications, and more healthy competition across platforms. User data is less susceptible to breaches or unauthorized access, and users feel empowered and in control.</p><p>Which of these solutions resonates with you?

<p>If you want a telling glimpse at why Singapore ranks among the world’s leaders in digital identity, look no further than this summer’s British invasion. No, this former colony and small southeast Asian city-state-turned-financial-powerhouse isn’t fending off intruding forces. It’s fighting for Coldplay tickets.</p>
<p>With six sold-out shows and online ticket queues topping more than a million for concerts that won’t be performed until January, Singaporeans are calling for more to be done to limit the number of foreigners buying up or scalping tickets for a can’t-miss concert from the chart-topping English band. Among the suggested remedies from online masses jones-ing to experience “A Sky Full of Stars” or “Viva La Vida” live and in person: Calls to use the nation’s Singpass digital identity app to purchase tickets, thereby reducing or eliminating the number of foreign fans that can attend the concerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singpass/">Singpass</a> (aka Singapore Personal Access) is a digital identity that Singaporean residents use to access government and private sector services online and via mobile app with the same level of trust as a face-to-face transaction. It’s also the centerpiece of Singapore’s National Digital Identity program, part of this island-state’s ambitious Smart Nation initiative to fuel digital economy inclusion and growth. With 97% penetration among this tiny island nation’s roughly 5.6 million citizens, Singpass facilitates more than <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/digital-development/how-singapores-national-digital-identity-and-government-digital-data-sharing">350 million transactions</a> annually.</p>
<p>The program is considered so successful that countries such as <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/japan-south-korea-to-speed-up-talks-over-pending-military-issues">South Korea and Japan</a> seek guidance and collaboration from Singapore in forging citizen identity architectures for verifying, managing, and securing identity. Like programs in Belgium and elsewhere worldwide, digital identity programs are proving vital as the digital world continues to transform every aspect of daily life while fostering a growing number of costly threats.</p>
 Digital Identity: Proof or Consequences 
<p>Identity verification and proofing have long played an essential role in functioning societies, enabling individuals to prove their identity in person to make purchases, manage finances, receive entitlements and services, and more. But verifying identity in digital channels through authentication based on the usernames and passwords that emerged to protect online accounts have been a goldmine for cybercriminals.</p>
<p>The problem: Organized crime syndicates and state-sponsored threat actors continue to find alarmingly effective ways to crack or pilfer users’ login credentials. A never-ending stream of phishing and spyware attacks harvest credentials en masse, leading to corporate data breaches that have made <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/04/buyers-beware-cybercriminals-target-your-online-credentials/">over 24 billion</a> recently-compromised login credentials and personal identity files accessible to cyber-attackers via underworld websites.</p>
<p>Thieves and malign forces leverage automated technologies to exploit these logins in credential-stuffing attacks that can test more than 22 trillion password-and-username combinations in <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/">less than 22 seconds</a>. Once they’ve successfully pirated an account, these cyber-bandits can drain bank funds, steal personal identity information or corporate data to sell online or impersonate account owners to defraud businesses and governments. The price tag: More than <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-to-cost-the-world-8-trillion-annually-in-2023/#:~:text=Our%20report%20provides%20a%20breakdown,%24667%20billion%20a%20Month.">US$8 trillion</a> in global losses expected just this year. That’s more than US$20 billion every single day.</p>
<p>Despite being ahead of the curve, Singapore<a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/"> isn’t completely immune</a> to this scourge. An estimated 47.9 million phishing attacks targeting remote workers struck the country in just the first half of last year. Smishing schemes targeting customers of OCBC Bank resulted in losses of more than US$6.4 million—forcing regulators to ban bank emails and text messages. And this March, news hit that hackers had stolen thousands of logins from major tech and Fortune 500 companies after breaching a data center <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/hackers-compromised-two-large-data-centers-in-asia-and-leaked-major-tech-giants-login-credentials/">in Singapore</a> and another in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It’s no small matter. Fast, seamless transactions are crucial to the digital economy. So is security. And that requires a universally-accepted form of identity that protects privacy and prevents hackers from stealing and exploiting personal information. As Congressional Leaders in the U.S. weigh the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/digital-identity-a-centerpiece-of-the-digital-economy-problems-challenges-and-solutions">Improving Digital Identity Act</a> passed by the House in April, officials here and elsewhere could benefit from studying Singapore’s progress.</p>
 Singapore: A ‘Smart City’ on Digital’s Cutting Edge 
<p>Made up of 63 islands and known for sleek, modern architecture, clean streets, a multicultural vibe, and bustling financial and business sectors, the Republic of Singapore is one of the “Four Asian Tigers.” It has also been dubbed “the smartest city in the world”—and it’s easy to see why. The city-state’s Smart Nation approach includes a National Digital Identity (NDI) initiative that is uniquely focused on nurturing digital innovation, infrastructure, and inclusion to enhance citizens’ lives and address their ever-changing needs.</p>
<p>Singapore does have some built-in advantages in this effort. As ThalesGroup.com reports, the populace is educated and<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide-digital-identity-and-security/iot/magazine/singapore-worlds-smartest-city"> tech-savvy</a>. Data from public transport fare cards and in-vehicle sensors is analyzed to continuously improve transport systems. Contactless payments are widely adopted.</p>
<p>Healthcare is entirely digitized and leverages AI chatbots and IoT sensors to guide residents in healing, recovery, and healthy living. And the Singpass app provides a one-stop platform that simplifies establishing identity, registering a birth, paying taxes, renewing passports, accessing government and private sector services, and more.</p>
<p>While the NDI program was first launched 20 years ago, Singpass was first introduced as a web app in 2018 and as a cryptography-based smartphone app in 2021. Citizens 15 and up can enroll, and only three percent of eligible people have yet to do so.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, citizens can register for Singpass, which allows them to use single sign-on to log into accounts, share information, conduct transactions, and sign documents. Two-factor authentication, such as a fingerprint biometric or pin code on the user’s device, is offered to provide an added layer of security, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem of Trust 
<p>In Singapore and elsewhere, digital identity is generally comprised of validated digital attributes and credentials designed for the digital world that are verified by cross-referenced government-issued physical world credentials. Think birth certificate, driver’s license, passport, etc. In this case, Singpass is underpinned by the country’s national registration identity card (<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/digital-driving-licence-singpass-app-2531601">NRIC</a>).</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of Singapore’s Singpass is convenience. Citizens don’t need to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different services or transactions. And they can easily access digital equivalents of their driver’s license and Identification Card (IC) through a feature called MyInfo.</p>
<p>By leveraging application programming interfaces (APIs), the service enables users to permit banks and financial services firms to retrieve their personal information to simplify and streamline account enrollment processes. This is also one the first public digital infrastructures to facilitate this form of verification, decreasing the time needed to complete an application by 80%. It has also resulted in a 15% higher approval rate due to better data quality and significant reductions in customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>But Singpass isn’t yet invulnerable to all possible threats. Earlier this year, scammers allegedly used fraudulent advertising and social media promotions for services like pet grooming and groceries, and dry cleaning lured victims into downloading mobile malware that was used to make unauthorized purchases. According to news reports, money mules allegedly forked over their <a href="https://www.hackread.com/teen-arrest-android-malware-scheme/">Singpass credentials</a> and other information to receive and transfer funds.</p>
 A Step Toward Decentralized Identities 
<p>Singpass may soon give Singaporeans far more control over how their information is used while making digital identity far easier and safer to apply across all sectors of the economy. According to reports, the Government Technology (GovTech) agency that runs Singpass is working on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#:~:text=Decentralized%20identifiers%20(DIDs)%20are%20a,the%20controller%20of%20the%20DID.">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a>-based digital wallet.</p>
<p>While Singpass already offers a digital identity wallet (DIW) that acts like a “digital twin” of hard-copy identity documents, it operates within a federated ecosystem of centralized servers belonging to large public or private organizations. In federated models like this, data or things like selfies captured for facial recognition-based authentication and stored, even for a short time, can conceivably be hacked and either ransomed or exploited to commit fraud.</p>
<p>DID-based wallets, however, use globally unique identifiers that give users a cryptographically verifiable, decentralized digital identity. This approach sets the stage for a future where authenticating users no longer requires personal data to be stored centrally. Instead, users can control what personal information they share and how it’s used—and for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=663dde5a584a">how long</a>.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>I couldn’t agree more with Singapore’s exploration of DID-based digital wallets. In my view, the success of digital identity is predicated on distributed technologies and the architectural advantages they deliver.</p>
<p>With distributed ledger-driven systems, for instance, someone applying for a loan could choose which personal information to share instead of granting a bank access to data about their entire financial lives. They could also share third-party trust scores that allow them to demonstrate creditworthiness without revealing personal information at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, they would no longer run the risk of having the loan denied due to inaccurate or out-of-date information stored within a federated network. That’s because when users opt to share data, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/04/04/why-zero-trust-is-all-about-identity/?sh=350d5c6e54ee">zero-trust systems</a> can apply risk, quality, or credit scores without contributing private user information or metadata to the process. It’s a perfect match with Singapore’s commitment to digital inclusion.</p>
<p>But fair warning: To be effective, digital identity wallets must also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics</a>-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNyMKKDUvP5kit_UP4XbwzmqYa5SZLqdolxffbwblB9hNwZ2hzC6VihoCYMMQAvD_BwE">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating identity spoofing.</p>
<p>Had their calls for restricting purchases of top concert acts to Singpass users been in place, that’s the kind of protection more than a few Singaporean Coldplay fans might appreciate right about now.</p>

<p>Ask any CIO or CISO today what they are doing to protect their organization from the continuing threat of cyberattacks and you are likely to hear that they are implementing a Zero Trust approach. A recent Gartner study indicated that Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) is the fastest-growing segment in network security, forecasted to grow 31% this year. Adoption of Zero Trust frameworks offers a more comprehensive alternative to security that better aligns with today’s needs. As organizations transition from the traditional virtual private network (VPN) approach and increasingly adopt the Zero Trust models to secure the perimeter-less environment, one area that cannot be overlooked is the security of the virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the perimeter-less remote work environment we live in today, implementing Zero Trust requires an improved governance of identity, where access to resources is not only determined based on factors such as users’ characteristics and assigned roles but also on asset status and environmental conditions like time and geolocation of the connection request. In this blog post, we describe why it is important to ensure that only authenticated users have access to the resources that they have been authorized to control. And let’s not forget that users can be individuals as well as applications, devices, and machines.</p>
<p>Zero Trust and the virtual infrastructure</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a security model designed to prevent unauthorized access to a network’s resources. It operates under the premise that no user, application, device, or machine can be trusted by default, and that every request must be authenticated and authorized before access can be granted. The Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure extends this model, tailoring it specifically to virtualized and multi-cloud environments. The model relies on several key security principles to deliver enhanced security at a time when the traditional perimeter is quickly disappearing and the use of virtualized applications is rapidly growing across multi-cloud deployments. Security principles addressed by the framework include least privilege, micro-segmentation, and continuous monitoring.</p>
<p>The principle of least privilege ensures that users, applications, devices, and machines are only granted the access they need to perform their specific tasks and nothing more. Tasks that users are authorized to perform can have wide-ranging implications on the operation and security of the business. Therefore, best practices should always dictate that a secondary review and approval be required for any sensitive configuration change. As a component of the least privilege principle, associated changes to the public key infrastructure (PKI), including changes to user and machine identity aspects, should always undergo a secondary review and approval process. This helps to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential damage of any accidental or deliberate misconfiguration that may be perpetrated. Micro-segmentation divides the network into smaller, isolated segments to prevent lateral movement by attackers. This means that even if a single segment is compromised, the attacker cannot easily move across the network and access other resources. Continuous monitoring ensures that any suspicious activity is detected and addressed immediately. This involves the use of advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies and potential threats in real-time.</p>
<p>Foundational security mechanisms</p>
<p>In addition to secondary reviews and approvals and the validation of machine identities through a trusted source, an effective Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure also relies on foundational elements, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), encryption, and cryptographic keys and secrets management. MFA protects the organization from unauthorized access and encryption protects sensitive data, ensuring that even if a user’s credentials are ever compromised, the attacker still cannot gain access to sensitive information. Keys and secrets management provides the underpinning footing, ensuring that the keys used to encrypt data and the secrets and other credentials used to access the applications and data are always secured and in compliance with government and industry security regulations.</p>
<p>The way forward</p>
<p>The Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure is a comprehensive security model that protects against modern threats in cloud and virtualized environments. Entrust provides a complete suite of integrated technology solutions as required by the Zero Trust framework. Extending the security of virtual infrastructure in data centers and private clouds, organizations adopting this framework can significantly improve their security posture. This includes helping reduce the likelihood of a data breach, maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their critical assets, and supporting progress in the journey to Zero Trust maturity.

<p>I want to introduce you to a new developer tool called Kangaroo. You can use it to bundle up a hApp into an installable binary, ready for use on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It makes it easy for people to start using a hApp, because the installation experience feels like any other app install rather than having to learn about the Holochain Launcher (which is honestly fairly easy but still a bit of a shift from what people are used to).</p><p>After I introduce Kangaroo, I’ve got some upcoming events to help you in your development journey and some notes on the newest unstable release in the Holochain 0.2.x branch and its supporting tools and libraries. (Yes, you read that correctly — this is an unstable release. There are known issues with performance and possibly DHT resilience, but there have been a lot of bugfixes in that area and we wanted to get those into people’s hands.)</p> Kangaroo: Bundle up your hApp and Holochain together <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kangaroo</a> is a tool that makes it easy for you, dear dev, to make installation easy for the people using your hApp. It scaffolds a project structure that contains just enough Holochain and webview to generate a self-contained binary with your hApp in it. The included GitHub actions will then generate installers for all three major desktop OSes, with code signing on the OSes that need it.</p><p>As mentioned above, this means that the installation experience feels familiar and easy — there’s no need to install ‘some other thing’ (the Launcher) in order to install and start using a hApp. All they have to do is go to your website or GitHub repo, or their OS’ app store if that’s how you choose to distribute your hApp, download the thing, and install it.</p><p>Kangaroo is a bit like Lightningrod Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/electron-holochain-template?ref=blog.holochain.org">electron-holochain-template</a>, but builds your hApp on a fully Rusty stack using a webview container called <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>. That makes binaries smaller, faster, and less resource-consuming than Electron binaries, although you do have to deal with compatibility issues for webview libraries on older OSes. (You can read more about the differences and similarities between Electron and Tauri <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/tauri-electron-comparison-migration-guide/?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.)</p><p>Tauri also supports <a href="https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater/?ref=blog.holochain.org">auto-updating</a>; the compiled binary will automatically check for and download new hApp binaries. Keep note that, if your version bump signals a breaking change per <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SemVer</a> rules (that is, the leftmost non-zero number increases), user data will not be ported to the new version.</p><p>Bundling your hApp with Kangaroo is pretty straightforward:</p>  Install the dev dependencies (Rust and Go).  Clone, snapshot, or fork the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo?ref=blog.holochain.org">repo</a>.  Run <code>npm install</code> in the repo’s working folder.  Add your hApp and its UI to the <code>./pouch</code> folder.  Do a project-wide search/replace to change <code>replace-me</code> to your hApp’s name.  Add an icon.  Add a version number for your hApp.  Build the hApp using <code>npm run tauri build</code>.  <p>After that, you can push the repo to GitHub and configure GitHub actions to build the installers for you.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo/blob/main/README.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">readme for the repo</a> is well-written and friendly, so you should have an easy time getting started. This tool is new, so please try it out and give the developers your feedback!</p> Holochain development environment setup support <p>This upcoming series of calls is an ‘open office hours’ sort of thing where you can come and get guided through the process of setting up all the dev tools you need to create hApps. We do ask that you try the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/?ref=blog.holochain.org">quick start guide</a> first, but if you hit a roadblock, come to one of these calls with your needs, questions, and frustrations to get unstuck!</p><p>The first session is on Thursday, 3rd August at 13:00 UTC. Here’s the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/events/holochain-development-environment-setup-support?ref=blog.holochain.org">event page</a>, which has a registration link. See you there!</p> Developer-focused AMA in August <p>This will be the first in a new quarterly series of Holochain AMAs just for developers. Rather than a livestream, it’ll be an intimate Zoom call where developers and other dev-related folks can ask focused questions about the things that matter to them. (We will publish the recording afterwards though!)</p><p>We’ve had one or two Holo/Holochain AMAs targeted at developers in the past, but this will be a dedicated AMA just for you, with a regular rhythm that you can put on your calendar. This event joins the fabulous community-led Holochain In Action calls in fostering a community you can journey with as you develop your skills (and your applications).</p><p>The first AMA will be on Tuesday, 15th August at 17:00 UTC. Submit your questions <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/developer-AMA-1?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a> and register for the Zoom call <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_TNW-BVjeTnyd_3hvvwDTzw?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.</p><p>Even if you can’t make the call, please register anyway. This will ensure that you will get notified right away when a link to the recording becomes available.</p> Online developer training in October <p>Along with Marcus and Guillem from our education partner Mythosthesia, we’re co-hosting another online hApp developer training course this October. Just like the first one, it’ll be four days of instruction followed by a weekend hackathon. And just like the first one, the curriculum will be fantastic and you and your fellow students will learn a lot together. Read the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-oct-2023/?ref=blog.holochain.org">landing page</a> to learn more and register. Make sure you get your application in by 18th September!</p> Holochain 0.2.1 (unstable): Bug fixes, small improvements, and big changes <p>As mentioned in previous Dev Pulses, we discovered some performance issues and other bugs in Holochain 0.2.0. We <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-5-released/#quick-update-on-holochain-021-progress">promised</a> a quick turnaround to fix these issues, but some of them have been challenging to diagnose.</p><p>We’ve recently released Holochain 0.2.1, which tackles quite a few of these issues. We’re still aware of some outstanding issues, so we’re pronouncing this release unstable. But if you’ve been itching to update your hApp to the 0.2.x series, this release is ready for development with new features and improved performance over the 0.1.x series, but do expect to run into issues. If you need stability, stick with 0.1.5 or wait for a later release in the 0.2.x series. We intend for this release to be API-stable with future 0.2.x releases, but we may need to make unanticipated breaking changes in the service of fixing bugs.</p><p>Here’s a list of changes since 0.1.5, including those that landed in 0.2.0:</p> General   Breaking/new (network protocol): This is one of the two big news items with this release — a new WebRTC-based networking protocol, which lets us rely more on off-the-shelf libraries and tools than our QUIC-based protocol did. It means we can use standard WebRTC <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interactive-connectivity-establishment-ice/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ICE</a> (interactive connectivity establishment) strategies for making peer-to-peer connections over the public internet, and reduces our burden of security compliance due to the fact that WebRTC tools and libs are more mature and better maintained.  New (conductor): The conductor now supports ‘blocking’, in which a peer adds other peers to their block list. Blocking is the foundation of everything we’ll be doing to create the validation-based network immune system in future releases, and can also be used for things that don’t involve validation, such as community moderation or removing an employee from workspaces when they leave the company.  Breaking (conductor config): Networking types <code>proxy</code> and <code>quic</code> have been removed; please transition to <code>webrtc</code> if you have any conductor config files lying around (this is likely if you’ve generated test configs with <code>hc sandbox generate</code>). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2208?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2208</a>)  Breaking (<code>holochain</code> Rust crate): The feature <code>test_utils</code>, which builds Sweettest into the resulting binary, is no longer default. If you’re relying on the <code>holochain</code> crate to use Sweettest, use <code>default-features = false</code> and the feature <code>sweetest</code> (note only one <code>t</code>). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2281?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2281</a>)  New (networking, conductor config): There’s a new network tuning param called <code>gossip_arc_clamping</code> that lets you optionally override automatic arc size tuning to be either full or empty, allowing a node to claim responsibility for all or none of the DHT. This lets resource-constrained nodes (like cell phones) offload their work to willing ‘full nodes’, and is also accompanied by a new ability of standard nodes to tune their DHT coverage to compensate for freeloading (legitimate or otherwise). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2352?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2352</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2380?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2380</a>)  New/experimental: A chain head coordinator feature allows multiple machines to share the same source chain. This will be used mainly for redundancy in the Holo hosting network. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2502?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2502</a>)  Bugfix: A bootstrap server must be reachable when a conductor with installed hApps is launched. This fixes an issue where hApps would get paused if the conductor was launched without access to a bootstrap. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2419?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2419</a>)  Bugfix: Attempts to duplicate a clone cell (that is, a cell with the same DNA and agent hashes as a cell that already exists) now fail. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1997?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1997</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A lockup on certain network layer error types has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2315?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2315</a>, tx5 <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/31?ref=blog.holochain.org">#31</a>)  Bugfix (networking): Mismatched gossip rounds, caused by rounding errors in storage arc boundaries on multi-agent conductors, has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2332</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A bug in which self-authored data couldn’t be retrieved if the author wasn’t also responsible for that region of the DHT has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2425?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2425</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A race condition that caused network instability (temporary blocking of newly joined nodes) has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2534?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2534</a>)  Optimisation: When uninstalling an app, any DNAs that are no longer used by any other app will have their DHT data removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Optimisation: Capability grant verification during a zome function call is faster, which speeds up calls (especially remote calls) considerably. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2097?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2097</a>)   Bundle manifests   Breaking/bugfix (DNA manifest, conductor APIs): <code>name</code> in a DNA definition no longer affects/forks the DNA hash. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2099?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2099</a>)  Breaking (app manifest): <code>version</code> is renamed to <code>installed_hash</code>, and now only accepts a single optional DNA hash value, where previously it could accept a list of values. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2157?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2157</a>)  New (app manifest): A new cell provisioning strategy <code>clone_only</code> has been implemented, designed for situations where a cell shouldn’t be instantiated for a DNA immediately upon app installation. This is useful for when you want to create clones of a DNA but don’t want to have a ‘default’ cell. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2243?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2243</a>)  New (zome manifest): The zome manifest can now take a <code>dylib</code> argument which points to a WebAssembly module compiled specifically to work on iOS. It’s used with artifacts produced by <code>hc dna pack --dylib-ios</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2218?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2218</a>)   HDI and HDK   Breaking/new (HDI/HDK): <code>HoloHash::retype()</code> is removed from the public API, along with <code>From&lt;AnyDhtHash&gt;</code> and <code>From&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> impls. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2191?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2191</a>) Casting can now be done via the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2191?ref=blog.holochain.org">remaining impls</a>, new <code>TryFrom</code> impls, or a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/struct.HoloHash.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#method.into_agent_pub_key"><code>.into_agent_pub_key()</code></a> conversion function (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2283?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2283</a>).  Breaking/new (HDI/HDK): <code>ChainQueryFilter</code> now lets you filter on multiple entry and action types in one query. The query builder API hasn’t changed, but the underlying data structures have, so you’ll still need to recompile your code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2302?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2302</a>)  Breaking (HDI): The `DhtOp``validation rules have been significantly expanded on and changed. While the data structures and API haven’t changed, stricter rules may cause some previously accepted ops to be rejected. Run those automated tests! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2215?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2215</a>)  New (host API): <code>block_agent</code> and <code>unblock_agent</code> have been added to allow for app-level, agent-driven blocking of peers. This means that a hApp can allow an agent to add other peers to their blocklist, rejecting any signals, remote calls, or gossip attempts from them. (Their DHT neighbours may still ask them to validate and store DHT data for the blocked peers though.) This is useful for moderation of things that can’t or shouldn’t be covered by validation, especially of the <a href="https://cblgh.org/articles/trustnet.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">subjective</a> kind. (Note: as far as I can tell, these functions haven’t yet been wired up to the network plumbing, nor do they yet have convenience functions in the HDK. But the functionality that makes it possible is all there.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1828?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1828</a>)  New (HDK): <code>OpType</code> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.3.1/hdi/flat_op/enum.FlatOp.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>FlatOp</code></a>, and <code>Op::to_type()</code> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#method.flattened"><code>Op::flattened()</code></a>. The old names still exist as aliases, though, so this isn’t (yet) a breaking change. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1909</a>)  New (HDK): <code>Path</code> has a <code>String&lt;TryInto&gt;</code> conversion for easy string representation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2544?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2306</a>)  New (HDK): There’s a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/link/fn.count_links.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>count_links</code></a> function that works like <code>get_links</code> but only returns a number. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2430?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2430</a>)  Bugfix (HDI): Fixed a problem with validation of private entry data, where <code>Op::to_type()</code> would fail for <code>StoreEntry</code> ops. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1910?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1910</a>)   Conductor APIs   New (admin API): <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/storage_info/struct.DnaStorageInfo.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>DnaStorageInfo</code></a> gives information about the data that is being stored for a DNA across all apps/cells that use it. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2147?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2147</a>)  New (admin API): <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#variant.DumpNetworkStats"><code>DumpNetworkStats</code></a> is an endpoint that lets you do diagnostics on the conductor. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2182?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2182</a>)  Bugfix (admin API): Supplying a network seed during <code>InstallApp</code> now properly updates the network seed for roles whose provisioning strategy is set to <code>None</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2102?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2102</a>)   <code>hc</code> CLI   There have been a lot of small documentation updates and bugfixes; you should find the dev experience slightly smoother now. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2125?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2125</a>)  Breaking: <code>hc sandbox run</code> now outputs a new string when an app port is successfully provisioned. If you’ve written tools to help you manage conductors via this command and are watching for this string, you may to update your code. See <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2320/files?ref=blog.holochain.org#diff-ededbc680fd88848f49dcf0bc4c373e14c916cfdaac39839d9eee262a46614a8R56-R60">this diff</a> for details.  Bugfix: A comma-separated argument passed to <code>hc sandbox generate --directories</code> is now parsed properly as multiple directories. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2080?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2080</a>)  New: <code>hc dna schema</code>, <code>hc app schema</code>, and <code>hc web-app schema</code> output JSON schemas for integration into your favourite IDE. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2138?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2138</a>)  New: <code>hc sandbox generate</code> has a new <code>in-process-lair</code> option, which comes with an associated changes to make <code>hc sandbox run</code> respect the config and only launch an out-of-process lair instance when required.  New: <code>hc dna pack</code> now takes a <code>--dylib-ios</code> option, which produces iOS-optimised WASM files. This is paired with a new <code>dylib</code> property in the zome manifest. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2218?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2218</a>)  New: The new <code>hc run-local-services</code> command runs a local WebRTC signal server whose URL can be passed to <code>hc sandbox generate network webrtc</code>, as well as a local bootstrap server. These aren’t appropriate for use as production servers; rather, they’re meant to be used during testing. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2265?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2265</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2353?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2353</a>)  <p>For more information, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.2.1/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">read the full changelog</a> for 0.2.1 all the way back to 0.2.0-beta-rc.0.</p> JavaScript client 0.15.0: Holochain 0.2 support <p>If you’re planning to update to the unstable Holochain 0.2.1, you’ll also want to update the JavaScript client in your hApp’s UI to 0.15.0. Here’s a list of changes:</p>  Breaking: The input params for the <code>networkInfo</code> API endpoint have been changed to match changes in the conductor API.  Breaking: The client and websocket classes have been refactored to accept <code>URL</code> objects rather than strings.  Breaking: Error responses from the conductor are thrown as new instances of <code>HolochainError</code>, which extends <code>Error</code>.  New/breaking: The dependency on the encryption package <code>tweetnacl</code> has been replaced with <code>@noble/ed25519</code>, because <code>tweetnacl</code> is getting old — so old that it didn’t support modern ES modules. This may break your build pipeline because your bundler will need to target ES2020 in order to support <code>BigInt</code>. The crypto module is imported conditionally — it’s only needed in Node.js, as browsers use the Web Crypto API instead.  New: When making a <code>WsClient</code> request, the client will try to reconnect automatically if the socket is closed.  New: admin API endpoints for <code>storageInfo</code>, <code>dumpNetworkStats</code>, and <code>updateCoordinators</code>.  Changed: The default timeout for API calls has been bumped from 15 seconds to 60 seconds.  <p>Read <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">all the changelogs</a> from v0.15.0 back to v0.13.0 to see everything that’s changed.</p> Tryorama 0.15.0-rc.1: Holochain 0.2 support <p>And of course, with an update to the JS client, Tryorama needs to change too. It inherits all the changes in the client, along with:</p>  Breaking: A local signal server (provided conveniently by <code>hc run-local-services</code>) is required for Tryorama tests, but optional for tests orchestrated by TryCP.  Breaking: With the update to Holochain 0.2.1, there’s a change in Tryorama that depends on a changed output from <code>hc sandbox run</code> on conductor startup.  Breaking: <code>runScenario</code> re-throws errors that it catches rather than consuming them.  Breaking: App websockets are decoupled from conductors, to better imitate real-life scenarios, in which different agents would not be using the same websocket to connect to their own conductor.  New: <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/main/docs/tryorama.dhtsync.md?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>dhtSync</code></a> is a new utility function that waits until two players’ views of the DHT are identical.  Changed: <code>runScenario</code> catches and outputs errors.  Optimisation (TryCP): App installations for a conductor, and conductor installations for a client, are done in parallel.  <p>Read <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">all the changelogs</a> from v0.15.0-rc.1 back to v0.13.0.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@innocentrip?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Suzuha Kozuki</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/expMk3K5v_c?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Eager to close the loop on corporate assets and improve threat protection, many global enterprises are looking for new ways to approach cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust framework</a>. Originally coined by former Forrester analyst John Kindervag in 2010, this dynamic strategy has the power to harden cyber defenses and take security to the next level.</p>
<p>However, implementing Zero Trust isn’t a walk in the park. In most cases, it’s a multi-year journey that requires company-wide effort to accomplish. Luckily, organizations can assess their progress and take guidance from the Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM).</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the basics of Zero Trust and how the maturity model can help you complete a successful implementation.</p>
 Zero Trust security explained 
<p>Zero Trust is based on the principle of “never trust, always verify.” It encompasses many cybersecurity tactics where access to data, networks, and infrastructure is kept to a minimum, and the legitimacy of that access is continuously authenticated. The combination of these various techniques layered on top of one another is what’s known as a Zero Trust architecture (ZTA).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), a ZTA is an enterprise cybersecurity strategy that applies Zero Trust principles to component relationships, workflow planning, and access control policies. In short, organizations that implement Zero Trust security take a hard stance against implicit trust, assuming that all users, devices, and cloud applications requesting network access may be potential threats.</p>
<p>Like any data security policy, the Zero Trust model aims to protect sensitive data and other corporate assets from unauthorized access and exposure. But, unlike traditional methods, it focuses not only on the network perimeter but on any and all vulnerabilities inside and out. Simply put, Zero Trust security assumes internal traffic isn’t any more trustworthy than traffic coming from outside the network.</p>
<p>This makes all the difference in today’s environment. With users needing to leverage critical work applications from anywhere, at any time, and on any device, organizations must adopt new policies that can flexibly adapt to their changing risk landscape.</p>
 Why is Zero Trust necessary? 
<p>The truth is that cybersecurity has never been more complex. In an era of rapid digital transformation and cloud acceleration, traditional network security tools don’t stand a chance of protecting sensitive data — and certainly not at the success rate expected of today’s organizations. Beholden to both compliance regulations and consumer responsibility, enterprises are under pressure to upgrade their cyber defenses and keep information under lock and key.</p>
 Attacks on the rise 
<p>Here’s the problem: Cyber threats are evolving and becoming more sophisticated over time. Yet, perimeter-based security controls are stuck in the past.</p>
<p>Take malware, for instance. This threat vector saw a rapid resurgence in 2022, climbing to a whopping <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/medialibrary/en/infographic/mid-year-update-2022-sonicwall-cyber-threat-report.pdf">2.8 billion attacks</a> just one year after hitting a seven-year low. However, what’s more frightening is that hackers deployed over 270,000 malware variants, the likes of which security experts had never seen.</p>
<p>Traditional detection-based techniques rely on a combination of technology and human judgment — and with that comes human error. With an infrastructure based on implicit trust, it’s only a matter of time before an attack slips through the cracks and bypasses your cyber defenses.</p>
<p>Even worse, enterprises are dealing with an increasingly high volume and velocity of threat vectors. From ransomware and phishing to DDoS attacks and insider risks, organizations are under fire like never before. In fact, <a href="https://www.keepersecurity.com/ponemon2020.html">68% of businesses</a> around the world have experienced a cyber attack in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that successful attacks can have significant consequences. According to IBM, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">average cost of a data breach</a> is almost $4.5 million per incident. By 2025, global cybercrime will cost companies a combined <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129432/0/en/Cybercrime-To-Cost-The-World-10-5-Trillion-Annually-By-2025.html">$10.5 trillion annually</a> — up from $3 trillion in 2015.</p>
<p>Regardless of size, businesses simply can’t afford the long-tail costs of poor data security. Critical events can impact organizations in many ways, whether it be a prolonged business disruption or a major compliance violation. No matter the type of attack or how it originates, the mess created can take months, if not years, to clean up.</p>
 Digital transformation 
<p>These challenges are compounded by the recent and sudden transition to hybrid, cloud-first work environments.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated cloud transformation. In fact, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">McKinsey research</a> indicates the majority of organizations speeded the adoption of digital and cloud services by an average of seven years. Now, it’s predicted that the total amount of cloud data — which includes public, private, and government clouds — will <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/the-world-will-store-200-zettabytes-of-data-by-2025/">surpass 100 zettabytes</a> by 2025. For context, that’ll be over 50% of the world’s data at that time, up from 25% of what was stored in the cloud in 2015.</p>
<p>This surge is no doubt a response to the increasingly distributed work environment. Currently, <a href="https://owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2022">78% of global employees</a> prefer remote or hybrid to in-office work. So, more likely than not, flexible arrangements are here to stay. Unfortunately, this is putting a tremendous strain on enterprise security teams.</p>
<p>Not only are distributed workforces relying on cloud applications to stay productive, they’re also accessing them — alongside other network resources — on unmanaged devices. That means security teams cannot secure data in use or in movement to and from personal endpoints, creating a glaring hole in their perimeter. Worse yet, because cloud adoption continues to rise, these vulnerabilities are growing at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>Bottom line: With attack surfaces stretched thin, existing cyber defenses are inadequate against a growing swarm of potential risks.</p>
 What is the Zero Trust Maturity Model? 
<p>Developed by the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> is a roadmap for transitioning to a Zero Trust architecture. The model, originally intended for federal agencies, aims to help organizations leverage Zero Trust principles and better protect sensitive assets.</p>
<p>CISA released version 1.0 in September 2021, as directed by President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> on cybersecurity. An updated version, released in April 2023, added a fourth maturity stage alongside additional guidance on Zero Trust implementation.</p>
<p>The model reflects the <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">seven tenets</a> of the Zero Trust framework, as established by the NIST:</p>
 
 All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
<p>Translation: Networks are composed of many devices, applications, and other resources that may have access to enterprise-owned assets. Therefore, they should be treated as potential risks.</p> 
 All communication is secured regardless of network location.
<p>Translation: Location alone doesn’t imply trust. Access shouldn’t be automatically granted based on the device being on enterprise network infrastructure. Regardless of where a request originates, it must meet the same security requirements.</p> 
 Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
<p>Translation: Just because a device is trusted in a previous session doesn’t mean it should be inherently trusted for the next. Each session must be authenticated so that the user’s identity can be continuously validated.</p> 
 Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy.
<p>Translation: Authorization decisions should take external sensors into consideration. This includes a user’s location, device, and real-time application context.</p> 
 The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets.
<p>Translation: No device or asset receives implicit trust. Every request triggers a security posture assessment, and all assets are continuously monitored to ensure they’re updated, safe, and uncompromised.</p> 
 All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
<p>Translation: Trust is granted on an ongoing basis, factoring in a myriad of elements before making an enforcement decision.</p> 
 The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure, and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.
<p>Translation: Collecting analytics and insights on assets can enhance decision-making and avoid risky approvals.</p> 
 
<p>These tenets lay the groundwork for an effective ZTA and are therefore essential to achieving Zero Trust maturity. As we dive into the model in more detail, it’s best to keep these principles in mind.</p>
 The levels of Zero Trust maturity 
<p>CISA created the ZTMM to help agency IT departments strengthen their security postures through a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/the-critical-role-of-clm-for-zero-trust-today-and-pq-tomorrow/">Zero Trust strategy</a>. However, its highly prescriptive nature lends itself to organizations of all varieties, outlining actions that any enterprise can take to better protect sensitive information.</p>
<p>The four levels of Zero Trust maturity include:</p>
 
 Traditional: At the most basic level, organizations have manually configured lifecycles and attribute assignments, static security policies and solutions that only address one pillar at a time, and siloed policy enforcement capabilities. 
 
 
 Initial: Organizations at this stage start to automate configurations, attribute assignments and enforcement decisions. They begin implementing responsive changes to least privilege after provisioning and aggregate more visibility into internal systems. 
 
 
 Advanced: Enterprises use automated controls for lifecycle configurations, attribute assignments, and cross-pillar coordination. They have centralized visibility and identity control. They’re also able to enforce integrated policies across pillars and dynamically make changes to least privilege based on risk and posture assessments. They’re actively building toward enterprise-level awareness. 
 
 
 Optimal: At the most mature level, organizations have fully automated lifecycles and assignments of attributes to assets and resources that self-report with dynamic policies based on automated triggers. 
 
<p>Generally, these maturity stages represent the ideal progression from a traditional security stature to one that features dynamic updates, automated processes, integrated capabilities, and other best practices.</p>
 5 pillars of Zero Trust maturity 
<p>The ZTMM consists of five main pillars, each with its own individual and cross-functional security controls. By addressing these areas, organizations create a comprehensive and adaptive security framework.</p>
 1. Identity 
<p>Perhaps the most important pillar, identity focuses on user access management in a dynamic environment, emphasizing continuous validation and behavioral analysis. Why? Because in a post-perimeter world, people are at the forefront of security.</p>
<p>According to Verizon, <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/">over 80% of breaches due to hacking</a> involve lost or stolen credentials. Zero Trust mitigates this risk by enforcing a policy of least-privilege access. In short, this means users are only allowed to access resources that are essential to their role, thus preventing lateral movement in case of a breach.</p>
 2. Devices 
<p>The ZTMM defines a device as any asset — including hardware, software, firmware, etc. — that connects to a network, including servers, computers, printers, mobile phones, IoT devices, and so on.</p>
<p>Regardless if the device is enterprise-owned or not, Zero Trust advocates for maintaining an inventory of all assets with network access. By enhancing visibility into these devices, organizations can keep tabs on their configurations, associated vulnerabilities, and patch requirements.</p>
 3. Networks 
<p>A network is considered any open communications medium used to transport messages. That includes internal and wireless networks, the Internet as a whole, as well as cellular and application-level channels.</p>
<p>Organizations that have a mature <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">Zero Trust architecture</a> focus less on perimeter-based security and more on managing internal and external traffic flows. This allows them to isolate risks, enforce encryption, and practice “microsegmentation” — the process of breaking the network down into pieces, thereby creating boundaries that keep threats at bay.</p>
 4. Applications and Workloads 
<p>This pillar encompasses all systems, computer programs, and services that execute on-premises, on mobile devices, and in the cloud. This area is of particular importance now that the majority of businesses are adopting cloud services at lightning speeds.</p>
<p>According to the ZTMM, organizations should apply granular access control and threat protection policies capable of mitigating application-specific threats.</p>
 5. Data 
<p>Data at rest, in use, or in motion — it doesn’t matter. Zero Trust principles say that all structured and unstructured files and fragments should be continuously monitored, encrypted, categorized, and labeled regardless of where or how they’re stored.</p>
<p>Specifically, organizations should deploy mechanisms to detect and prevent data exfiltration. The ZTMM also says it’s best to craft and review governance policies to ensure security procedures are enforced across the enterprise.</p>
 Cross-cutting capabilities 
<p>Additionally, CISA’s maturity model also outlines three “cross-cutting capabilities” that organizations are meant to use throughout their Zero Trust journey. They’re intended to support interoperability and cross-functionality, thus weaving together the five pillars.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
 
 Visibility and Analytics: Increases line of sight, informs policy decision-making, and facilitates response activities in case of threat detection 
 Automation and Orchestration: Leverages analytics and other insights to streamline operations and mitigate security risks as they arise 
 Governance: Enables organizations to manage and monitor their regulatory, legal, environmental, federal, and operational requirements 
 
<p>Strengthening these abilities is key to a fast and effective Zero Trust migration. Organizations can conduct a maturity assessment to better understand where they’re currently at in their journey. Once you’ve evaluated and identified your stage, you can implement CISA’s guidance for progressing to the next phase of maturity.</p>
 Identity Access Management: The foundation of Zero Trust 
<p>Mobile and cloud-first transformations have erased the traditional security perimeter. In its place stands a distributed, decentralized, and sprawling environment. With threats looming on the horizon, secure access is a must-have for enterprises of all shapes and sizes — if only it were that easy.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is Zero Trust is a complex, multi-year commitment. The good news? There are ways to simplify the process.</p>
<p>Users are your first line of defense in today’s threat landscape, but they’re also your greatest risk. Protecting identities is key to preventing unauthorized access and exposure — that’s why Identity Access Management (IAM) is a pivotal first step in the right direction.</p>
<p>At Entrust, we designed our comprehensive IAM portfolio to empower organizations as they begin their Zero Trust journey. Our solutions use a variety of technologies to help you protect identities, secure data, and safeguard applications, including:</p>

				  Adopting new technologies can be a daunting task, tying up resources and taking much longer than planned. Better the broken system you know than the new system breaking in ways you never anticipated! Verifiable credential technology was designed to minimize all these adoption problems. How? Read on! 
<p>New to decentralized identity? A good place to start would be the <a href="https://indicio.tech/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide!</a></p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable high value data to be shared seamlessly and verified instantly — without having to check in with the source of the data, or the data itself having to be stored and managed by a third party. New technologies enable you to instantly trust, cryptographically, both the source of the credential, and the authenticity of the data stored inside.</p>
<p>The ability to use this immediately actionable data to create more seamless processes is a powerful value proposition. With verifiable credentials you can create an identity and verification layer that can transform the creaky, fraud and security nightmare that is Web 2.0 — if, and only if, it’s easy to implement, right?</p>
<p>The specter haunting IT is lifting and shifting to new systems. Spiraling costs and receding deadlines make the new, shiny thing a difficult bet. And then there are the risks of sudden obsolescence (the newer, shinier thing) or vendor lock-in to a system that’s suddenly a lot more costly to run and update.</p>
<p>There are a few ways verifiable credential technology enables safer, smarter digital transformation.</p>
<p>1. You don’t need to replace your existing system. Verifiable credentials and decentralized identity can be added as a layer that orchestrates your existing identity and access management systems and cloud services. This means you can slowly transform your systems at a pace that’s comfortable and cost effective.</p>
<p>2. Off-the-shelf ecosystems and solutions are available to create this layer, you can build as much or as little as you want in-house.</p>
<p>3. You can choose open-source solutions. Open source means freedom from vendor lock-in. Not only can you build on a system you fully own in a way that meets your needs, you get to benefit from a community of developers constantly innovating on the codebase.</p>
<p>Start simple and small</p>
<p>At Indicio, we believe in starting small and picking a simple use case. It doesn’t matter whether you are an SME or a global corporation. Learn how the technology works by solving a simple problem and then expand. Often once our customers discover how easy it is to implement and use verifiable credentials, they quickly hit the scale button.</p>
<p>A typical customer journey might look something like this when learning about, experiencing, and then implementing verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>Depending on your technical background, you might want to start with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3LvHy3eIPsnRX3W06q6dpsciH1FoPFxt">demo video</a> or <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/comprehensive-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-workshop/">hands-on workshop,</a> where you get to issue, hold, and verify a credential.</p>
<p>For the next step you can explore the <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-sandbox/">Proven™ Sandbox,</a> where you can develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a constrained version of our complete verifiable data ecosystem solution, Proven — with support from the Indicio team.</p>
<p>Once your happy with the proof of concept you’re ready for the full version of Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven.</a> This pre-built ecosystem provides everything you needed for a complete interoperable solution, and the open-source codebases offer visibility so your developer teams unfamiliar with the code have the shortest possible learning curve while providing you with a solution that you fully own.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is inescapable. There is a lot of money to be made with faster, easier to use products and services. But they can’t be delivered without verifiable data and identity. The key to mastering the next stage of the web is to combine flexible, low-cost, low-risk transformation with a maximal capacity to interact, interoperate, and scale.</p>
<p>Why wait to catch up?</p>

 Purpose of Challenge <p>The objective of this data challenge was to develop machine learning models that accurately assess risk in supply chain transportation vehicles of perishable goods such as livestock and food&nbsp;items.</p><p>It’s summertime and humidity is a problem in most of the western world this summer. This data challenge sought to understand the impact temperature and humidity have on the lifecycle of a given supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Supply chain management has been in flames in recent years. This challenge scratched the surface to learn how machine learning and artificial intelligence streamline and improve efficiency and sustainable practice in the transportation of perishable goods and&nbsp;animals.</p> Winners are as&nbsp;follows: <p>First place: Mohammad Jamali ($2500&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Mohammed took a unique approach to analyze the dataset provided and drew conclusions that were not initially thought of at the origin of this experiment hosted by Ocean Protocol. Mohammad's report included in-depth heat mats that helped us understand the geolocation and internal weather conditions in a new light. This paper sought the best way to find the correlation between the timestamp and temperature to approach the problem as a classification task. This was done by segmenting the timestamp as an example into 24 one-hour intervals or classes and assigning temperature values to these segments. By doing so, it became possible to estimate the likelihood of specific temperature ranges occurring within each time&nbsp;segment.</p><p>Second place: Marco Rodrigues ($1500&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Marco dug deep through the data set to prove how some hours of the day are warmer than others. This makes perfect sense and is verified by sound data regression models. This metric became interesting when comparing external weather temperature to the temperature inside the shipping vehicle temperature used for this data challenge. Marco’s report used sound data polishing tactics, extensive diagrams, and data visualization. He also used the data set to expose natural weather humidity levels in the context of this challenge.</p><p>Third Place: Andrey Bessalov ($1000&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Andrey built cutting-edge clusters by using weather features and concluded the best factors concluding the ideal conditions inside the vehicle. They are medium temperature, medium humidity, low wind, no snow, no rain. Andrey cleaned and visualized the dataset provided in terrific detail. From this report, we can assume the best conditions and humidity levels for shipping perishable goods.</p><p>There were 12 total submissions to this challenge, less than previous challenges which reach between 20–40 submissions. This challenge was a bit more challenging than others with the use of in-vehicle sensor data, IoT data, temperature and humidity metrics. Specs on the challenge itself can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://desights.ai/g/challenge/10">here</a>.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how AI and ML can impact a real-world business case like supply chain management? This challenge was an indicator of that. Or, curious about how the performance of your supply chain is mitigating risk in handling shipping logistics and humidity? Let us know in our community channels, and your protocol may be selected next to run a data challenge on.</p><p>Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to all the participants for their hard work and dedication.

<p>In early July, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/">Storm-0558</a> where a Chinese threat actor used forged authentication tokens to access the information – primarily email accounts – of about 25 organizations. This attack included some significant organizations including the US Department of Commerce and, reportedly, the US Ambassador to China. The attack was particularly concerning because Microsoft revealed that the attacker was forging Azure AD tokens using an acquired Microsoft account signing key. &nbsp; In Microsoft’s words, "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected."</p>  
<p>(CISA has posted guidance for addressing the threat <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-193a">here</a>.&nbsp; Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/19/expanding-cloud-logging-to-give-customers-deeper-security-visibility/">expanded licensing for Purview</a> to include companies that do not have an E5/G5 license.)</p> 
 What This Means for Defenders  
 Wiz stated in their research, “Identity provider’s signing keys are probably the most powerful secrets in the modern world.”&nbsp; As identity experts, we agree.&nbsp; Attacks like this look like entirely legitimate authentication and, without additional monitoring, can pass undetected for significant periods of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
 HYPR Adapt and Updating Monitoring  
<p>On July 26, we announced <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> which helps organizations to maintain real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls.&nbsp; In other words, it’s entirely focused on protecting authentication by detecting anomalous activity and taking action such as requiring re-authentication.</p> 
<p>While Microsoft believes that Storm-0558 has been mitigated, it’s instructive to look at how monitoring could be employed to address scenarios where their MSA or Azure AD signing keys have been compromised.</p>

<p>One of the key observations is that because of Adapt’s ability to deploy Policy as Code, it can be quickly updated with new policies based on recently identified threats known as IOC and IOA.&nbsp; Once the risk has been identified, HYPR Adapt takes targeted action against the identified risk.&nbsp; These patterns can be detected and action taken to revoke access or mitigate the impact of a newly identified identity threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 How it Works  
<p>Below are the implementation steps to prevent identity-based attacks in the event that a Microsoft signing key is compromised.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Configuring HYPR ADAPT to ingest Azure Audit logs requires only a simple webhook client configuration, from there HYPR ADAPT will receive all Audit entries from Azure ( in the case of STORM-0558, this would be the Audit. Exchange logs.)  
  As the logs enter HYPR ADAPT they are transformed into datasets that can be leveraged for policy evaluation. As noted earlier, the flexibility of policy as code allows any of the information in these datasets to be computed and evaluated.&nbsp;  
  The HYPR Adapt policy will evaluate the user’s events by looking for the MailItemsAccessed event from Microsoft and will determine if this is an event that’s potentially generated using a token generated by a compromised MSA key. This is done using a combination of the user’s behavior such as applications, and client ids typically used, the token issuance process, and additional metadata that is evaluated in real-time.&nbsp;  
  If the HYPR Adapt policy determines the token is maliciously generated and utilized, it will terminate that token on Azure AD and the user will be asked to immediately re-authenticate. If the policy is not breached, the user will not be interrupted.&nbsp;  
  
<p></p> 
<p>The HYPR Adapt policy can also be implemented to alert the enterprise SOC or similar to be notified and react to any indicators of compromise. However, we believe that having actionable insights and policies that can be executed in real-time is critical for reacting to threats quickly and decisively with accuracy. This is what HYPR Adapt is enabling our customers to do!&nbsp;</p> 
 Maintaining Vigilance  
<p>Microsoft indicated in early July that Storm 0558 has been fully mitigated.&nbsp; Smart security teams are continuing to look for other examples where compromised tokens are being utilized to create new attack vectors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finding evidence of attack in the rearview mirror is now insufficient.&nbsp; Risk assessment needs to include the ability to automatically take action to defend against identity threats while minimizing the overall impact to the user experience.

<p>I must admit that I enjoy the convenience of e-commerce shopping. Grocery delivery is just incredibly convenient with my busy schedule. I value my time and want to make sure that I’m working smarter, not harder. But I sometimes find that the online payment process can take a while, especially if I do not feel comfortable storing my card details on merchant websites.</p>
<p>Consumer-preferred payment methods for e-commerce transactions are very dynamic and depend on the situation. So, to learn more about cardholder payment preferences, we recently surveyed 1,000 cardholders. We also asked the respondents how they typically complete an e-commerce transaction. We discovered that more than half of respondents (53%) indicated that they opt to either use the stored card on file or use an expedited checkout button for an easier checkout experience.</p>
<p>Providing the highest level of security for e-commerce payments is possible</p>
<p>Even though both methods are equally convenient for the cardholder, banks that provide the ability to use an expedited checkout button are providing an additional layer of security. This is because the payment information can be tokenized, if the card is pushed to the provider from the bank app.</p>
<p>Thanks to tokenization, card numbers are replaced by encrypted tokens, bringing more security to consumers when it comes to using a digital card to pay. The token is linked to a specific use case and device; e.g., the token can only be used on merchant page x and only from device y. Meaning should the data become compromised, it will not be of use for the fraudster. Providing tokenization and token management capabilities can empower the cardholder with more security and self-service options. And security is a major concern for the cardholder, as we have seen in our recent survey.</p>
<p>Banks can combine this with convenience: Expedited checkout buttons allow the consumer to pay faster online. While those options are proposed by the merchants, banks can also offer an option to push provision cards to digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, Click to Pay, Amazon Pay, PayPal, etc. from the banking app. The advantage is that the cardholder does not have to store the card information on file, and it is faster and more secure than typing in the actual PAN/card info on the merchant website.</p>
<p>Contactless payment and accelerated e-commerce checkout experiences will drive the next evolution in consumer payments, and banks will need to jump on the bandwagon if they want to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Entrust offers push provisioning to third-party wallets, and we now also <a href="https://go.entrust.com/click-to-pay-whitepaper-A">offer push provisioning to Click to Pay</a> for seamless and accelerated e-commerce checkout while providing the highest level of security. Click to Pay, and the enrollment from the banking app, gives cardholders the benefit of a seamless e-commerce checkout experience. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWITpLAlmbg">video</a> shows how the enrollment and payment experience works with Click to Pay.</p>
<p>While physical payment cards remain preferred for in-person transactions, Click to Pay will reignite competition in the virtual checkout lane. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/why-banks-should-offer-both-physical-and-digital-card-issuance/">Banks should consider offering a seamless payment portfolio, offering both digital and physical payment options</a>.</p>

 Everything you need to know about PVID. Discover why you need a PVID-certified identity verification provider to unlock the potential of remote identity proofing today. 



 



<p>One in four companies in France are affected by fraud.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">Identity theft</a>, which is often the preferred technique of fraudsters, affects companies disproportionately, with 14% of French companies attacked revealing they suffered <a href="https://www.allianz-trade.fr/actualites/etude-fraude-2021.html">a loss of more than €100,000</a>. In an attempt to protect companies and customers from the threat of online fraud, <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> (National Safety and Security Agency) rolled out a framework in 2021: the (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) Remote Identity Verification Providers (PVID) standard.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr">ACPR</a> (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution) quickly mandated that financial and banking institutions should use this standard.</p>



<p>(We are now PVID-certified! Read more about our PVID-standard identity verification services in our recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">press release.)</a></p>



<p>All service providers that wish to comply with the Financial Markets Code (FMC) in France for remote onboarding are also required to meet the same requirements. So how do you select the right PVID-certified  provider for you?</p>



 What is the PVID standard? 



<p>To reduce identity theft, the PVID standard requires providers to offer a certified service that is equivalent to face-to-face.</p>



<p>The PVID-standard goal was developed to add due diligence measures to the remote identity verification process to ensure financial and banking institutions comply with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5th AML Directive</a>&nbsp;by using robust and effective ANSSI-certified solutions. Key to becoming certified as a PVID-standard provider is being able to offer reliable identity verification that is equivalent to face-to-face experience, or a&nbsp;high level&nbsp;of assurance of identity theft prevention.</p>



 How can you become PVID certified? 



<p>Nowadays, all remote ID verification providers that wish to comply with the FMC’s requirements regarding remote onboarding must be ANSSI certified.</p>



<p>Service providers must prove that their services comply with all&nbsp;technical and organizational requirements&nbsp;as dictated by the March 2021 ANSSI standard.</p>



 What steps are involved in the PVID certification process? 



  The service provider submits its application to ANSSI, which delegates a certification agent to the applicant.<br>  Evaluation tasks are carried out to ensure the remote service is equivalent to the face-to-face experience, and that biometrics, ID document verification, micro payments and other aspects of the technology (including its Qualified Electronic Signature functionality) are safe and secure.<br><br>As part of the certification process, ANSSI collaborates with the Bureau of Document Fraud of the <a href="https://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/Organisation/Direction-Centrale-de-la-Police-Aux-Frontieres">Central Directorate of Border Police</a>, and the Documents Department of the <a href="https://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/pjgn/ircgn/presentation/the-gendarmerie-forensic-institute-model-english-version">Criminal Research Institute of the National Gendarmerie</a>.  



  If the applicant meets the requirements, the ANSSI will issue a certification, and the remote identity verification provider will then be able to meet the banks’ requirements.  



 3 steps to the PVID standard. 



  Video capture of document data and user’s face: Our identity verification services enable the dynamic capture of an ID document and ID holder’s face, which is cross-referenced during analysis.<br>  Automated and manual data verification: Completed in two steps, identity verification is first conducted through automated document analysis (via optical character recognition and deep learning algorithms.) The second step is manual analysis, which is completed by trained fraud operators.<br>  Creation of evidence file and result submission: Containing the identification data as well as submission results, evidence files are kept for the duration required, and available in case of disputes. Results are also submitted to the company and includes the identity of the user, the dynamic captures of the document and ID holder’s face, and, in case of failure, the reason for the analysis failure.  



 What to consider when choosing a PVID provider. 



<p>All <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">PVID certified providers</a> are compliant with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/glossaire/lcb-ft-5-directive/">LCB-FT 5</a> (The French equivalent of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD)</a>. So what should you consider when choosing a provider? What sets apart a good PVID provider from a bad one?</p>



  User experience: Which provider offers the most intuitive experience?<br>  Processing time: Which provider completes the verification process the fastest?<br>  Document processing capability: The ability to process a variety of documents<br>  Geographic coverage: Does the provider have multi-geographical coverage?<br>  Size of product portfolio: What other solutions are offered by the provider?<br>  Offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esign/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> functionality.<br>  Capturing documents in real time, web and mobile SDKs enable the capture process to be integrated through different channels: directly from the service provider’s website, or application, in an email path or via SMS.  



 One identity verification provider for many regulations. 



<p>Ensuring you meet the myriad of different regulatory requirements across regions, countries and jurisdictions can take significant time and effort, and stifle and inhibit growth and innovation. However, not offering a PVID-standard identity verification service could result in substantial fines, penalties, and reputational damage.</p>



<p>At IDnow, we are committed to helping global businesses navigate the complex regulatory landscape in order to drive growth and scale with ease. Adding to our&nbsp;expansive regulatory certification&nbsp;and expertise across Europe, our latest PVID certification for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">IDCheck.io</a> demonstrates once again the integrity, security and strength of our remote identity proofing services – a certified service that you can trust anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p>In an era where digital transformation is rapidly reshaping industries, businesses face mounting challenges in safeguarding their sensitive information and ensuring user authentication is both secure and seamless.Yet they cannot afford to continue treating security as an endlessly growing cost center that takes time and resources from other strategic priorities. Recognizing the strong demand for more robust security solutions that also serve as a revenue accelerator, Forrester, a renowned research firm, conducted a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study of HYPR. The study reveals impressive key findings that underscore the significance and fiscal impact of modern authentication in enhancing business performance and reducing risk.</p> 
<p>Learn More &gt; <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">Get the HYPR TEI Study</a></p> 
 Understanding the Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) Study  
<p>Forrester's TEI methodology is a well-regarded approach to assessing the potential economic impact of implementing specific technologies within an organization. The study analyzed data gathered from five organizations that had already adopted HYPR Authenticate. All data was gathered directly by Forrester, without HYPR involvement, so that participants would answer freely. The research evaluated the financial and operational benefits experienced by these companies, providing valuable insights into the value of passwordless MFA in real-world scenarios.</p> 
<p>Based on these interviews, Forrester constructed a composite company which models the results experienced by the real-life companies. In this case, Forrester modeled HYPR’s results by looking at a 10,000 person company with $5B annual revenue in a highly regulated industry such as banking.</p> 
 Key Findings from the TEI of HYPR Study  
 ROI of 324%  
<p>One of the most remarkable findings from the TEI study was the impressive Return on Investment (ROI) that may be experienced by organizations implementing HYPR's passwordless MFA solution. Forrester reported an ROI of 324%, indicating that the benefits far outweighed the costs associated with adoption and integration. For the composite company, this amounted to a present value (PV) of $8.1 million realized in total benefits over a three-year period.</p> 
 More than $2.7 Million Savings in Business Risk Related to Data Breaches  
<p>Data breaches and cyberattacks pose a significant threat to businesses of all sizes. Forrester's study calculated a savings of more than $2.7 million (PV) in business risk from breaches for the composite company over three years. . By eliminating passwords and adopting stronger authentication methods, organizations using HYPR Authenticate can effectively mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to critical systems and sensitive data.</p> 
 95% Reduction in Help Desk Support Costs Related to Passwords  
<p>Passwords are not only a security risk but also a common source of frustration for users. The study found that with HYPR Authenticate, organizations witnessed a 95% reduction in help desk costs related to passwords, worth more than $2.5 million (PV) in a three-year period to the composite organization. This reduction was attributed to a decline in password-related issues, such as password resets and account lockouts, which traditionally necessitate user support.</p> 
 $2.7 million Savings in End User Productivity  
<p>User experience plays a crucial role in driving business productivity and an inefficient user experience can be an immense drain on capital. The TEI study demonstrated that employees of organizations using HYPR Authenticate have less downtime and spend less time logging in , resulting in more than $2.7 million (PV) in savings over three years for the composite organization. The elimination of passwords simplifies the authentication process, enabling users to access systems and applications seamlessly and with a more streamlined workflow.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Importantly, the research demonstrated that employees using HYPR Authenticate log into their systems 30% faster than employees using traditional authentication methods. This helps to speed user acceptance and adoption of the new solution.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>Forrester's TEI study for HYPR offers valuable insights into the impact of passwordless MFA on businesses. The study's key findings demonstrate and quantify, based on real HYPR customer data, the immense potential of passwordless MFA in enhancing security, improving user productivity, and delivering substantial financial benefits.</p> 
<p>As businesses strive to meet the growing demands of a digitally driven world, adopting innovative solutions like passwordless MFA becomes a strategic imperative. By leveraging HYPR, businesses can create a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment for employees and customers alike, ensuring they are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the digital age.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, we take great measures to secure our physical belongings, such as locking our homes and storing valuables in safes. However, when it comes to our online safety, we often wonder how to protect ourselves effectively. The answer is simple: we need to be proactive in our internet usage. With the internet playing an integral role in our daily lives, it’s crucial to understand the risks it presents, including cyberattacks, identity theft, malware, and phishing scams. In the year 2022, India experienced a staggering 13.91 Lakh cyber security incidents, as revealed by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for Electronics and Information and Technology, during his address to the Parliament on 10th Feb 2023. The accessibility of data in the digital era has made it valuable globally, but it has also exposed us to risks such as data breaches and identity theft. India has experienced significant financial losses, reputation damage, and identity theft due to data breaches. Therefore, safeguarding personal information becomes crucial for our protection.</p><blockquote>So, how can we ensure online safety? One potential solution to reduce or prevent data breaches is self-sovereign identity (SSI). Let’s explore what SSI is and how it can safeguard our digital identities and mitigate data breaches.</blockquote><p>India’s Cybersecurity Landscape: A Wake-Up&nbsp;Call:</p><p>Data breaches and identity theft have been on the rise in India, resulting in substantial financial losses, reputation damage, and identity theft. Based on real-world data gathered from 550 businesses between March 2021 and March 2022, a breach of approximately 29,500 records led to a 25% increase in the average cost of data breaches. Hackers employ various techniques like hacking, phishing, and malware to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. The consequences extend beyond financial losses, tarnishing the reputation of individuals, businesses, and entire&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Numerous high-profile data breaches affecting millions of individuals worldwide highlight the urgency of adopting robust security measures.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A Solution for Data&nbsp;Breaches</p><p>Can SSI protect your data from hackers? Absolutely. <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> is a user-centric, decentralized approach to digital identity. With SSI, individuals have full control over their personal information, deciding what to share, with whom, and how. SSI utilizes blockchain technology, ensuring that all identity-related transactions are securely recorded in an immutable and tamper-evident manner. In other words, individuals no longer need to rely on centralized authorities to authenticate their identity or ownership of personal information. Users possess a portable, privacy-preserving digital identity that can be verified both online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Taking Control: How SSI Can Safeguard Your&nbsp;Data</p><p>How does self-sovereign identity prevent data breaches? Data breaches occur when hackers gain unauthorized access to personal information, including usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data. This stolen data can be used for fraudulent activities, identity theft, or sold on the dark web. SSI provides a highly secure and private identity and data protection solution by eliminating the reliance on centralized identity systems, making it extremely challenging for hackers to breach the system. In an SSI ecosystem, personal data is stored on an individual’s device, such as a smartphone or computer, and shared only with chosen entities. Even if a hacker gains access to a user’s device, they can only access the data explicitly authorized by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials: Building Trust in a Digital&nbsp;World</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials(VCs)</a> play a crucial role in SSI, allowing individuals to authenticate their identity and ownership of personal data without depending on a centralized authority. Each transaction involving personal information is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. The public-private key architecture further enhances data protection, as individuals retain complete control over their information and sharing permissions.</p><p>In conclusion</p><p>In an era defined by digitalization, safeguarding personal information from data breaches has become a paramount concern. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) emerges as a powerful solution that empowers individuals to take control of their data while leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology. By embracing SSI and collaborating with trusted providers like AyanWorks, individuals and organizations can strengthen their digital identities and proactively combat the risks associated with data breaches.</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> is a leading provider of user-centric solutions that enable organizations to maintain control over their digital identities and data.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>With the increase in automation, there are new cybersecurity threats that need to be addressed, and in order to address the new cybersecurity threats, there are a few technological challenges that need to be understood.</p>
<p>The first challenge is the availability and quality of training data that is required for training cybersecurity-related ML models. This data almost always contains massive amounts of sensitive information – intellectual property, PII, or otherwise strictly regulated data – which companies aren’t willing to share with security vendors. Formal verification and testing of machine learning models is a massive challenge of its own. Making sure that an AI-based cybersecurity product does not misbehave under real-world conditions, or indeed under adversarial examples specifically crafted to deceive ML models is something that vendors are still figuring out, and in many cases, this is only possible through a collaboration with customers.</p>
<p>The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, so while in many applications, it’s perfectly fine to train a model once and then use it for years. Cyber threat models must be continuously updated, expanded, and retrained on newly discovered vulnerabilities and attack vectors.</p>
 Recommendations 
<p>While automation is currently in the spotlight, the role of humans cannot be underestimated. In fact, automation was intended to enable humans to focus on priority tasks with reduced effort rather than replacing them. Thus, to secure the autonomous world against cyber threats, organizations and cybersecurity experts must embrace a collaborative working environment between humans and technology. By combining human expertise and automation tools, organizations can create an effective threat intelligence framework to identify, respond and mitigate threats. This can be achieved by real-time monitoring and analysis of user behavior, network traffic, and activity logs. This will allow organizations to identify threats related to data theft and bypass the automation systems using a disguise to infiltrate critical systems in real-time.</p>
<p>One thing which automation currently lacks is contextual understanding. Policies and procedures need to be robust to fill contextual gaps, which will allow the software to not cause disruption in business activities. Human expertise can support in cases of critical decision-making. Finally, cybersecurity professionals should be equipped to tackle ever-evolving cyber threats towards autonomous machines.</p>
 Moving Forward 
<p>The relevance of the autonomous world will continue to increase in the coming years. With more and more organizations from various sectors embracing initiatives such as digital transformation and the power of AI and machine learning, there will be a proportional increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks. By addressing the security challenges and reinforcing the cybersecurity infrastructure, organizations will truly be able to extract the potential of automation.</p>

 The PVID certifications issued by ANSSI for the automated IDCheck.io identity proofing service and the videochat-based VideoIdent mark a new milestone in the identity proofing service provider’s desire to become the leading European player on the digital identity market. 



<p>Munich, August 1, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, has obtained the remote identity verification <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/produits-certifies/prestataires-de-verification-didentite-a-distance-pvid/">certification known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) on the level “substantial” for its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">IDCheck.io Identity Proofing Service</a> and VideoIdent Qualified Electronic Signature. A symbol of the culmination of months of collaboration and involvement of all teams, this certification demonstrates the company’s desire to offer its customers solutions that are safe, compliant, and fully in line with the regulations in France.</p>



<p>PVID – European leadership in digital and financial security</p>



<p>In a society where transactions have become considerably digitized and are now mostly done remotely, the risk of identity theft has increased, particularly in the banking and financial sector. This is why the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information, the ANSSI) established a new framework defining stricter requirements of identity verification providers. The new standard leads the way for select identity providers to effectively fight against fraud – a singular goal across rigorous Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws in France and throughout Europe. PVID raises cybersecurity standards for traditional finance, digital finance, trust services, and beyond.</p>



<p>Introduced in March 2021, PVID certifies providers the ability to offer identity verification as defined by Europe’s Regulation on Electronic Identification and Trust Services, eIDAS Regulation. Where eIDAS establishes European levels of security to meet the equivalence of a face-to-face verification for various use cases, PVID implements these levels of security to enable compliant digital onboarding for banking and other financial services in France. The certification, issued for two years, allows highly regulated banking or FinServ players to access a robust, secure service offering, thus enabling remote identification while reducing the risk of identity fraud.</p>



<p>France is the first country in the European Union to have established an effective policy for remote identity verification, and was followed by the work of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-among-first-etsi-ts-119-461-certification/">European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) on the ETSI TS 119 461 standard</a>, which pursues a similar purpose.</p>



<p>An undeniable competitive advantage in the digital identity proofing market </p>



<p>As only the second private player to obtain the coveted certification, IDnow has a major advantage in the digital identity proofing market. The certified IDCheck.io Identity Proofing Service and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent Qualified Electronic Signature</a> offer customers a trusted onboarding process that meets the security requirements of the ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution) and supports the fight against money laundering and fraud. The solutions allow banks to offer flexible, simple, and fast digital paths to improve conversion rates through 100% remote identification, equivalent to a face-to-face process.</p>



<p>“Obtaining PVID certification is a source of great pride and validation for IDnow and a real recognition of our expertise in the digital identity market in France,” comments Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow. </p>



<p>“As the regulatory landscape aims to extend its reach to additional digital services across Europe, PVID offers national regulators an example of a consistent framework that places privacy and security at its forefront. Beyond France, PVID represents one more step for IDnow in its ambition to offer its customers the most secure solutions certified by reference organizations, such as ANSSI. Standards like PVID or TS 119 461 have the potential to be building blocks for future onboarding regulations across geographies and applications, like digital identity wallets. The experience gained from PVID or our contribution to writing TS 119 461 will prove invaluable, and few companies will be able to advise customers as well as IDnow on navigating in this sphere,” adds Rayissa.</p>

  <p>In this increasingly digital world, identity is the most attacked surface area, and the sophistication and frequency of attacks continue to rise. Manual investigations and responses can’t keep pace. We need to think differently about how we protect identities from compromise and respond rapidly to emerging threats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Protection (recently renamed from Azure AD Identity Protection) helps stop attacks before they happen. ID Protection blocks identity takeovers in real-time and automates attack mitigation by providing advanced machine learning (ML)-based detections, risk-based access policies, and comprehensive risk reports and insights. To protect customers with our latest innovations, we’re excited to announce key enhancements to Microsoft Entra ID Protection: a brand-new dashboard to provide key insights, new detections to block existing attacks, a new mechanism for Microsoft to rapidly protect users from emerging threats, and the integration with Microsoft 365 Defender. Read below to learn more about these exciting new features. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New dashboard&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to present a brand-new dashboard in Entra ID Protection, a central hub designed to help identity admins and IT practitioners better understand their security posture and enable effective protections against identity compromises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Microsoft Entra ID Protection dashboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new dashboard surfaces in-depth insights with compelling visualizations and actionable recommendations. These will help you and your identity teams answer questions like “How well is my organization protected?” “What kinds of attacks are targeting my organization right now?” and “What should I do to address those attacks?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you &nbsp;increase security measures by using <a href="http://risk-based%20conditional%20access%20policies/">risk-based conditional access policies</a> and modern strong authentication policies, the protection of your tenant is gradually strengthened. You’ve asked for better insight into how well you’re protected over time, so we now provide four key metrics with monthly trends to demonstrate the effectiveness of your deployed protections. The number of attacks blocked and users protected metrics can demonstrate the effectiveness of your security measures, and mean time to remediate highlights how quickly your organization is able to respond to and recover from possible compromises. By adopting automated capabilities like risk-based policies and self-service password resets, you can significantly boost your recovery speed, enhancing security and operational efficiency. Finally, high risk users gives insight into how much account compromise risk you are carrying over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key metrics with monthly trends in Microsoft Entra ID Protection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate your risk exposure and where vulnerabilities lie, we’re thrilled to introduce our cool new attack graphic to help you visualize common identity-based attack patterns detected within the past 30 days for your tenant, and - more importantly - how many were successfully blocked, and how many still need to be remediated. These attack patterns are identified based on our advanced ML detections such as leaked credentials, anomalous token, password spray, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To help you take effective action, we’re offering tailored recommendations based on your risk exposure. For example, when we find that at least 20 high risk users in your tenant have gained access using valid accounts, suggesting possible compromises, a recommendation will be surfaced to suggest protecting these users with a user risk policy to bring these users back to a safe state effectively and efficiently. The attack graphic, alongside our recommendations, will equip you with targeted strategies to improve your security posture.&nbsp;</p>

 New advanced detections&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working on Microsoft Entra ID Protection, we always strive to provide our customers with new detections that can help protect their environment from malicious actors and activities. By leveraging the vast database of threat intelligence across Microsoft, we’ve now released two high fidelity detections that, in conjunction with risk-based conditional access policies, provide our customers with an opportunity to disrupt attacks at a very early stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first detection is verified threat actor ID. In the past couple of years, a lot of the major security incidents have been initiated by known nation state actors and cyber-crime groups. By utilizing the research carried out by the various security teams at Microsoft, we’ve created a comprehensive knowledge base of these actors, which we now use to assign <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection">real-time sign-in risk</a> to sign-ins performed by them.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User risk detection details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is attacker in the middle. One of the common scenarios used to gain access and compromise users is to use phishing, usually by way of a fake login experience, to get the user to enter their credentials and then proxy those credentials to a real session in Entra ID. Even if the user is prompted for multifactor authentication (MFA), since they are going through the expected login experience, it’s likely that they will successfully complete the login, thus providing the attacker with a working session and with the credentials to be used in future attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>We use signals provided by Microsoft 365 Defender, together with data from Entra ID, to accurately detect this type of attack and apply risk to both the affected sign-in and the user via the Azure AD threat intelligence detection, allowing customers to revoke the session by requiring a password reset and preventing future use of the credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both detections are now available to all ID Protection customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-time Azure AD threat intelligence&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To protect customers from emerging identity-based attacks, Entra ID Protection now offers real-time Azure AD threat intelligence detections. When new attack patterns are identified, ID Protection can now rapidly issue new, real-time detections in response to these attacks. These detections will utilize Microsoft’s threat intelligence in real-time – meaning ID Protection will detect identified patterns of compromise during sign in, and customers will be able to leverage risk-based conditional access policies to protect their identities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a user sign-in, if the properties of that sign-in match the signatures of a real-time threat intelligence detection, the real-time risk evaluation engine in ID Protection will report the detection, elevating the risk level of the sign-in and the user, and enforce the access control configured in your risk-based conditional access policies to block or challenge the user, protecting your organization from malicious actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers will be able to investigate this detection in the risk detections report in ID Protection. The specific detection rule will be noted in the Additional Info field of the existing Azure AD threat intelligence detection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Generally available: Integration of Entra ID Protection with Microsoft 365 Defender&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're also excited to announce that the integration of Entra ID Protection with Microsoft 365 Defender is now generally available. Entra ID Protection alerts are critical indicators of identity compromises and are generated by advanced detection algorithms. They’re now surfaced in Microsoft 365 Defender and are correlated into incidents along with alerts from the other security domains. Security teams will be able to investigate incidents efficiently and effectively, gaining a comprehensive understanding of end-to-end attacks and facilitating a quicker response to identity compromises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alerts are also available via the Microsoft 365 Defender Incident API, allowing you to track incidents involving Entra ID Protection alerts in Microsoft Sentinel or any other solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Microsoft 365 Defender user page, you can now view a user’s risk score and provide feedback on potentially compromised risky users. When an investigation is concluded, the status of the incident and the alert can be updated and will automatically sync back to Entra ID Protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seamless integration empowers customers to disrupt security attacks early on when identities are at risk of being compromised. Get started today by visiting <a href="https://security.microsoft.com/">security.microsoft.com</a> and reviewing our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk#investigate-risk-with-microsoft-365-defender">documentation</a>. We look forward to your feedback on this integration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These exciting updates are another significant step towards our goal of providing customers with best-in-class identity security, with additional features and enhancements to be added as we continue to improve Microsoft Entra ID Protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the most value out of our product offering, customers are highly encouraged to follow the best practices and recommendations provided in the new dashboard, deploy risk-based conditional access policies, and utilize the new detections for automatic protection and remediation.&nbsp;</p>

 With summer in full swing, we can’t help but think of the endless queues at the various airport checkpoints. Arriving 2 or 3 hours before take-off for flights that are sometimes shorter is a frustrating experience for passengers who are often exhausted or in a hurry. What if there was a way of considerably reducing this wait and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">improving the travel experience</a>? 



 What is biometric verification? 



<p>What if travelers could <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">verify their identity</a> and passport directly from home? Well, it’s possible. Using a smartphone, passengers can capture their identity document (ID card or passport) before they even get to the airport by doing so <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">during the booking process</a>. The passenger is then invited to carry out a biometric capture of their face (also known as an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">identity check by liveness detection</a>). The physical attributes resulting from the biometric capture are then compared with those on the identity document. This method of identification using biometrics is highly effective. Facial recognition or liveness detection have unique characteristics that enable us to ensure that a person is who they claim to be, and therefore that there is no attempt at identity theft.</p>



<p>Once verified, the passenger’s biometric data is stored in the airport’s or airline’s application for a specific period, enabling the traveler to pass through checkpoints without difficulty.</p>



 The advantages of biometric checks at the airport. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/biometrics/">Biometric checks</a> at airports offers a number of advantages that are revolutionizing the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel</a> experience for passengers. Here are some of the main benefits of this innovative technology:</p>



  Reduced waiting times: one of the greatest benefits of biometric control is the significant reduction in queues at the various checkpoints in the airport. Thanks to facial recognition, travelers can quickly pass through security checks and boarding gates without having to constantly present their identity documents, making the check-in and boarding process much smoother.  



  Improved passenger experience: by eliminating the tedious and repetitive steps involved in checking identity, biometric control offers passengers a smoother and more pleasant travel experience. They can concentrate more on their journey, relax and enjoy the services offered at the airport, without stress.  



  Enhanced security: biometric technologies provide a higher level of security than traditional control methods. Biometric characteristics are unique to each individual, reducing the risk of document fraud and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>. Advanced biometric systems enable airport authorities to detect any suspicious activity or potentially dangerous behavior more effectively.  



  Seamless integration: biometric control can be seamlessly integrated into existing airport processes. Passengers can enroll their biometric data just once, enabling automatic recognition during subsequent checks. This integration facilitates collaboration between airlines, security services and airport authorities for a frictionless travel experience.  



  Respect for privacy: biometric identity verification solutions generally adopt strict standards for the protection of personal data (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>). Travelers’ biometric information is securely stored and accessible only to authorized persons, ensuring confidentiality and protection of sensitive data.  



 Biometric checks at airports: which countries are pioneers? 



<p>Due to the rapid development of technology and airport security policies, several countries have already introduced biometric control systems at their airports. Here are a few examples:</p>



  United States: The United States has deployed biometric screening programs at some major airports, such as Orlando International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport, as part of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ‘<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Oct/biometric-exit-process-fact-sheet.pdf">Biometric Exit</a>‘ program.  United Kingdom: Biometric screening is being trialed at a number of UK airports, including London’s Heathrow airport, as part of the Heathrow Biometrics project to facilitate the passenger screening process.  Singapore: Singapore’s Changi airport is known for its early and extensive use of biometrics for immigration and boarding controls, offering a smoother and more efficient travel experience.  United Arab Emirates: Dubai International Airport is one of the first large-scale airports to deploy biometric screening for check-in, security screening and boarding.  Netherlands: Amsterdam-Schiphol airport has also implemented biometric control systems to simplify the travel process.  



<p>Many countries around the world have adopted or are considering adopting biometric screening at airports to improve the passenger experience and enhance airport security. Implementation varies according to the specific policies and regulations of each country and airport, but there is a global drive.</p>



 In France, what are the challenges inherent in introducing biometric checks at airports? 



<p>For several years, Lyon Saint-Exupéry airport has been running a free “Biometric Experience” service for passengers travelling to Portugal, Ajaccio and Bastia. Passengers download the Lyon airport application and select their eligible flight. They then create their biometric profile by capturing their identity document and taking a selfie. The final step is to capture the boarding pass and link it to the biometric profile. This option allows access to a fast lane dedicated to biometric checks, eliminating frustrating delays before departure.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/flight-preparation/facial-recognition">In Paris, other similar systems have been in place since March 2021</a>, notably with the airlines Air Caraïbes and French Bee. Passengers can carry out biometric verification directly at the airport on dedicated kiosks. However, there are a number of obstacles to the smooth running of the project.</p>



<p>Older passports without the NFC chip required for biometric services are excluded from trials on certain routes. In addition, the verification of biometric data carried out at home differs from that carried out at a kiosk at the airport. Although the latter has the advantage of offering the possibility of local assistance in the event of a problem, passengers do not seem to be rushing to use this latest technology, because of its similarity to a traditional check-in kiosk.</p>



<p>However, the results of these remote check-in pilot projects will not hinder their development. As further trials are implemented, the benefits of biometric boarding will become increasingly clear to all parties involved, and at every stage of the passenger journey through an airport.</p>



<p>Staff shortages at check-in counters and baggage depots will be alleviated, and passengers will no longer be forced to queue.</p>



 Biometric control and digital identity: What are the prospects for travelers? 



<p>In the future, frequent travelers will be able to take advantage of a European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) containing all their personal data, including biometric data, which they will be able to use on every flight, eliminating the need to manually enter their personal details every time they fly. This wallet will enable everyone to store and manage their electronic credentials in one place (directly on their smartphone), all securely and transparently.</p>



<p>The use of biometric technology in the aviation sector has considerable potential, and airlines and airports are undoubtedly open to it as they see the results. Commercial aviation, like the mobility and tourism sectors in general, is undoubtedly undergoing a revolution that should not be missed.</p>

<p>As a security professional, you understand protecting your customers and their data is critical. Customers want to trust that as a vendor, you’ve taken the appropriate precautions to ensure a secure digital experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me log in, look at my stuff, and transact, but keep others away from my account, especially those fraudsters. While you’re at it, please make it convenient as well. And then there’s the aspect of storing personal customer data, which is often like gold, oil, or maybe lithium—it's valuable and can make or break a business. It drives an organization’s product development plans and future revenue. If you don’t know your customers, then you’ll likely build a less desirable product. So organizations try to collect as much customer data as possible, but it must be well protected once collected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our digital world, your customers' primary interaction with your brand is through your website or app. With more digital interactions than ever before, you need to make gaining access as secure and seamless as possible, which most often requires a username and password. And don’t forget about registration. If it’s a prospect, you’ll want to make a good first impression. Passwords and lack of real-time threat signals are the #1 security threat to organizations today and are prime targets in cyberattacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/2016/">86% of breaches involve the use of stolen credentials (VZ)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, it's all about keeping your customers' sensitive info safe and sound. We're talking personal details, financial records, and transaction history. By locking down that data, you prevent the bad guys from pulling off identity theft, fraud, and sneaky unauthorized access. The goal is to prevent any data breaches or at least quickly identify any possible security concerns. Otherwise, you’ll incur big costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY">$150 is the average cost per lost or stolen record (IBM)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that's not all. When you go the extra mile to protect consumer data, you're showing them that you're the real deal—a company they can trust. You become their go-to when it comes to privacy and ethical practices. And that trust goes a long way in building customer loyalty and boosting your brand reputation. People want to do business with companies that take their privacy seriously. Essentially, just common courtesy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/dpbs-2019.pdf">97% of companies are realizing benefits such as competitive advantage or investor appeal from their privacy investments (Cisco)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget about the legal side of things. Protecting customer data is not just a good idea–it's the law. You have to stay compliant with data protection regulations, or you could be facing some hefty fines and legal troubles. So, by putting customer data protection at the top of your priority list, you're not just doing the right thing—you're also reducing major risks to your business.&nbsp;</p>
