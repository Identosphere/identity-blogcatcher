<p>Urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has undergone considerable expansion thanks to the digitalization of its services, made more accessible through a simple application. A societal topic thanks to its public service quality, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">urban mobility</a> contributes not only to the inclusiveness of certain populations, but also to the <a href="https://cor.europa.eu/en/engage/studies/Documents/The%20New%20Urban%20Mobility%20Initiative%20Can%20it%20deliver%20inclusive%20local%20mobility%20needs%20and%20European%20decarbonisation%20goals%20at%20the%20same%20time.pdf">reduction of carbon-based transport</a>. Urban mobility plays a key role in our strategy to combat global warming, by encouraging the use of public transport through the connection of different transport offers, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility</a> and car-sharing.</p>



<p>To encourage the use of public transport, various pricing initiatives have been put in place. For example, reduced-price season tickets have been introduced for certain categories of the population, such as students. These age-based fares are offered by many transport networks in Germany as well as in France, such as <a href="https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en">Île de France Mobilités</a> or <a href="https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-france/mainline-cards-and-fares/avantage-card/avantage-jeune/">SNCF</a>, with offers reserved for those under 26 or senior citizens.</p>



<p>While such measures encourage the adoption of these services, they also open the door to fraudulent practices, with harmful consequences. It therefore seems necessary to provide solutions in terms of age verification of users, to guarantee a fair and efficient service and avoid attempts at fraud and identity theft.</p>



 The importance of discounted fares in urban mobility. 



<p>Discounted tickets exist on many types of platforms and services. From telecom operators to streaming or cultural services, there is a plethora of places offering this type of service. In the field of transport, it is a social policy tool, where the existence of specific offers according to age and income categories promotes access to transport for different categories of the population.</p>



<blockquote><p>The introduction of reduced fares for young people is justified by a number of social and equity considerations: young people are often dependent on public transport (lack of driver’s license and/or vehicle).</p>Île de France Mobilités</blockquote>



<p>These special fares are also used by transport companies as a means of building customer loyalty. However, in a tense economic climate, it is sometimes tempting for users who are not entitled to special fares to abuse the loopholes in a subscription system in order to benefit from them. As a result, mobility providers are increasingly detecting fraud in this area. This may involve the use of false identity documents to take advantage of discounts, or the theft of another person’s identity.</p>



<p>The impact of such fraud is twofold: not only does it adversely affect the revenues of transport operators, it also limits the scope of these offers and the fairness between users. However, it is possible to curb this damaging occurence with online identity verification solutions, which are transparent and easy for the user.</p>



 Combating fraud through identity verification. 



<p>Traditionally, age verification on public transport has been carried out by means of identity documents presented when purchasing season tickets. The possibility of subscribing to these services online has made it easier to commit fraud and obtain discounted fares. It is now easy for anyone to forge an identity document, thanks to editing software that has become readily available.</p>



<p>At the same time, anti-fraud and identity verification technologies have also become more sophisticated, providing even more secure and appropriate responses.</p>



<p>For a transport operator, using these solutions means effectively guarding against identity fraud during the subscription process. They also ensure that users benefiting from an offer are indeed who they say they are.</p>



<p>IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is a solution that has been used for many years in banking and financial services, but is now proving its worth in the mobility and transport sector. By verifying a user’s identity document and photo, IDnow ensures that users are thoroughly screened and their age confirmed in just a few steps:</p>



  The user submits an identity document when subscribing to the offer;  A biometric capture (facial recognition or live detection) is then performed to obtain a correlation with the user making the subscription;  The document is then analyzed by our APIs to verify its authenticity, and cross-referenced with the biometric capture for comparison. This ensures that it is the same person;  The account is validated in a matter of seconds, based on the results.  



<p>Transparent to the user, the identity verification solution is easily integrated into a mobile or web application via our SDK.</p>



<p>Using this solution limits the risk of identity theft, as the user cannot use someone else’s document to subscribe to an offer. Any alteration is identified and forces the user to terminate the subscription process.</p>



 Safer access to offers for both operators and users. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">constantly evolving</a> mobility sector has undergone digital transformations that have revolutionized our habits. At the same time, fraudsters have adapted to these new operating modes, impacting the economic efficiency of various players. Age and identity verification provides transport operators with the guarantee that their users have access to the offers they are entitled to. </p>



<p>Identity verification solutions can be seamlessly integrated into the user journey, simplifying the user experience. In addition to contributing to the fight against fraud, identity verification solutions help improve operators’ economic efficiency. As a result, they are able to enhance their transport offering, as well as the quality of their services. In the end, all users benefit from these measures.</p>

 Shifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis <p>It is hard for organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges to determine what strategies may have the greatest impact. This should be easier with more organizations publishing what they learn and AI tools supporting efficient curation of insights. In reality, the vast amount of data generated is met with overwhelm, and impact-focused organizations struggle to determine what data can be meaningfully used to support their strategic ambitions and what is just&nbsp;noise.</p><p>Over the past ten years of working with foundations, government agencies, and private sector organizations, <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital</a> has found that impact evidence synthesis is one of the more powerful tools to support strategic decisions. Evidence synthesis is the process of compiling and analyzing multiple studies to provide comprehensive impact insights on a set of interventions or products.</p><p>In this article, we share our experience of the value that evidence synthesis has catalyzed, the need to improve prevailing impact evidence synthesis norms, and how we have refined our evidence synthesis processes and products to drive impactful decisions.</p> The power of leveraging collective insights <p>Organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges are not doing it alone. Scattered across the internet and within these organizations’ own knowledge management systems, there is an abundance of insights that could be harnessed to explore the pertinent questions of what works, under what conditions, and for whom. Impact evidence synthesis brings these insights together.</p><p>Individual research efforts provide puzzle pieces that evidence synthesis assembles to create the impact picture. It adds immense value&nbsp;by:</p>  Generating a holistic view: Combining varied perspectives provides a comprehensive view of an issue, allowing for inclusive assessments of what works and what is untested.  Optimizing resources: Identifying promising interventions and avoiding duplicating those with limited impact are valuable tactics in light of finite resources.  Enabling adaptive strategies: Creating an information infrastructure supports agile strategic responses to the changing social and economic landscape.  <p>By basing actions and investment decisions on a curated body of evidence, organizations can establish a clear and justified basis while also building an evidence ecosystem and infrastructure that encourages a collective approach to engaging in shared&nbsp;issues.</p> Challenges within the prevailing forms of impact evidence synthesis <p>There are two phases to unlocking the value of evidence synthesis. The first is intentionality on what is included in a given synthesis, and the second is ensuring the outputs are delivered in ways that support access and — fundamentally — the use of evidence. While there are diverse views on these phases, there are dominant practices. These dominant practices serve some sectors well; in others, they present challenges that can limit their value. Two of the main challenges are:</p>  A bias toward experimental methods: In some sectors, an exclusive focus on one methodology can be challenging for numerous reasons, including issues of power, diversity, and representation, and discounting early insights in emerging and rapidly changing sectors — like digital — where experimental evidence may not be available when investment decisions are being&nbsp;made.  Static representation: Evidence synthesis products often exist as static narratives that summarize the state of evidence. The last decade has seen an increase in evidence maps: graphic representations of the landscape of impact evidence plotted against a set of interventions and outcomes. Maps vary but are usually one-off and focus on visualizing the number of studies rather than the insights gained from them. Unless they are accompanied by narrative summaries, evidence maps leave impact insights on the table. Like all knowledge products, content and medium directly affect engagement and use by different audiences.  <p>At Caribou Digital, we have struggled with these prevailing norms and forms, which sparked our work to innovate and improve the practice of evidence synthesis.</p> How we’ve refined our approach to connect insights to decisions <p>Our approach seeks to provide timely insights with rigor, context, and diversity of perspectives. Five elements distinguish our evidence synthesis approach:</p>  Iterative Theory of Change: Designed with thematic experts, the Theory of Change outlines impact pathways for specific issues as the basis of the synthesis.  Diverse and credible impact methodologies: Experimental and theoretical approaches each offer important views on the evidence. We need both and include&nbsp;both.  Impact results: We include a view of the volume of data points that initiated positive, negative, or no impact, not just the number of studies on a given&nbsp;topic.  Design and delivery mechanisms of interventions: Interventions or products (e.g., upskilling, e-commerce platforms) are not homogeneous. They have unique design and delivery features that can and do affect their impact. We include these features in our analysis to really drill down into what&nbsp;works.  Contextual insights: Who is being studied and where influences impact. We extract contextual data, leveraging localized evidence to support targeted interventions that are more likely to&nbsp;succeed.  <p>Including and extracting this level of detail from individual studies supports a rapid and deeper interrogation of the impact data — many of these elements are visualized in our existing evidence maps on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services</a> and <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital and data-first approaches to driving small business&nbsp;growth</a>.</p> Transforming the way users interact with evidence synthesis <p>At Caribou Digital, we are proponents of interactive and ongoing evidence synthesis. Our experience delivering interactive evidence synthesis has revealed a strong demand for customized and detailed insights on demand. This entails extracting and synthesizing impact evidence from the database on specific questions, such as “<a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">What is the impact of market-place platforms on small business growth?</a>” This recurring need has led us to further innovate with evidence outputs to support greater access to insights using generative AI. Below are three ways we share our evidence synthesis outputs:</p>  An interactive impact database holds the raw coded data. Guided by a code book, we can filter, search, and access extracted summary insights and data points from the impact database. This has been a successful format for (manually) mining the database on-demand to craft impact narratives on interventions/products in specific countries on specific segments. All our evidence syntheses have an underlying impact database, resulting in a significant body of evidence on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services,</a> <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital approaches to driving small business growth</a>, digital tools to support women’s economic empowerment, and geospatial data for humanitarian action (forthcoming).  Interactive evidence maps provide a visual overview of the entire impact evidence landscape, plotting interventions to outcomes and the direction of impact. The maps are integral for communicating a snapshot of the impact landscape and quickly discerning where evidence is concentrated. Filter buttons enable users to get more specific on other variables of interest (i.e., methodology, design and delivery mechanisms, country, segment, etc.) Alongside these interactive syntheses, Caribou Digital has crafted dozens of targeted insights for client strategy and the public (e.g., <a href="https://www.financedigitalafrica.org/tag/evidence-gap-map/">DFS</a> and <a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">small business</a>).  <p>3. A chatbot-based conversational interface queries the impact evidence database using natural language queries. This utilizes language-learning models to interpret queries and return synthesized results from the evidence base, with cited references, allowing users to, for example, type a query “Outline e-commerce products that have positively impacted women’s income in India.” This interface opens up new possibilities to engage with impact evidence, particularly when convenience and speed are prioritized and when supporting greater access to insights for those traditionally marginalized from more complex knowledge products.</p> What’s next <p>This is an exciting time to be working in evidence synthesis. With innovative new tools and processes to work with, there are more possibilities than ever to advance the efficiency, accuracy, diversity, and inclusivity of evidence synthesis. In the coming months, we will share more about our iterations with Gen AI and our approaches to deepening inclusivity and equity within the evidence synthesis process and products. We are keen to connect with users and practitioners alike to refine and perfect these approaches.</p><p>Contact <a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">niamh@cariboudigital.net</a> with any feedback or questions about our evidence synthesis approach.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/shifting-through-the-noise-in-the-age-of-information-overload-the-power-of-evidence-synthesis-6157e5bc472a">Shifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Munich-based identity pioneer looks back on ten years of revolutionizing the KYC space and doubles down on reusable identities and trust services 



<p>Munich, June 27, 2024 – IDnow, a leading platform provider for identity verification in Europe, is looking back on ten successful years of revolutionizing the German and European Know-Your-Customer (KYC) market and is now doubling down on reusable identities and trust services. Founded in 2014 by Armin Bauer, Sebastian Bärhold, Felix Haas and Dennis von Ferenczy, the Munich-based company’s flagship product at the time was <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">the revolutionary VideoIdent</a>, which had just been allowed by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>).</p>



 A platform with automated and expert-led solutions that serves all needs 



<p>Since then, a variety of solutions have been added to the portfolio, following market needs and technological trends: the AI-supported, fully automated AutoIdent solution was introduced in 2018, followed by the electronic function of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German ID card (eID)</a> in 2019. Just last year, IDnow introduced ShopIdent, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">onsite solution for identification</a> in German petrol stations and stores. The transaction figures prove the success of these solutions: Over 13.2 million transactions have been processed via IDnow AutoIdent, while the scale-up looks back on another 13 million successfully identified users with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent</a> to date.</p>



<p>In 2019, Andreas Bodczek was appointed as CEO at IDnow: “We have made it our mission over the past five years to actively shape and lead our industry and show our customers why digital identities are essential to their business. In the last decade, we have grown into a platform provider that serves all market needs with the help of the latest technology. We have earned the trust of our customers because we focus on our core business every day without losing sight of the secular trends that are shaping the market.”</p>



 Munich-based scale-up has long been one of the largest European players 



<p>In 2021, increased expansion opportunities led IDnow to acquire the French market leader for identity verification technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German provider identity Trust Management AG, establishing IDnow as one of the largest European players in the identity industry.</p>



<p>In addition to its traditional financial and telecommunications applications, new growth areas for IDnow have opened up in the mobility and travel industry, online dating, gaming, human resources and social media. Although user needs and regulatory requirements differ greatly from traditional industries, the desire for increased trust in digital transactions has grown across territories, regardless of the use case.</p>



 Reusable identities and trust services determine the future 



<p>The digital identity industry is facing a paradigm shift due to regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 at the European level or announced changes to the Videoident regulation in Germany. With its more than 900 trusted customers, the company aims to leverage these relationships and take them to the next level by building up its own trust service and a digital identity pool of several million users in the next few years. In doing so, the scale-up intends to lead the way in the transformation of the digital identity market heralded by eIDAS 2.0: European trust services, reusable identities and a fully integrated, broad product portfolio form the basis of the company’s long-term product strategy.</p>



<p>“Today, we are facing a fundamental transformation of our industry – away from the one-time verification process and towards reusable identities – and we will once again lead this revolution,” Bodczek says. “Since its founding, IDnow, with its broad and continually evolving portfolio, has shown a great deal of foresight, resiliency, and adaptability to market developments. With a team of over 450 highly skilled colleagues across ten offices in Europe, we are already one of the largest players in the identity industry. The experience, expertise, and innovation drive that we have assembled in-house make us extremely optimistic about the next ten years of our company and the industry at large,” he concludes.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that the <a href="https://setup.cloud.microsoft/entra/migrate-ad-fs-to-microsoft-entra-id">migration tool</a> for Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) customers to move their apps to Microsoft Entra ID is now generally available! Customers can begin updating their identity management with more extensive monitoring and security infrastructure by quickly identifying which applications are capable of being migrated and assessing all their AD FS applications for compatibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/introducing-ad-fs-application-migration-your-path-to-simplicity/ba-p/3980232">announced AD FS Application Migration</a> would be moving to public preview, and the response from our partners and customers has been overwhelmingly positive. For some, transitioning to cloud-based security is a daunting task, but the tool has proven to dramatically streamline the process of moving to Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simplified workflow, reduced need for manual intervention, and minimized downtime (for applications and end users) have reduced stress for hassle-free migrations. The tool not only checks the compatibility of your applications with Entra ID, but it can also suggest how to resolve any issues. It then monitors the migration progress and reflects the latest changes in your applications. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJYmEOK6UJo">Watch the demo</a> to see the tool in action.</p>
<p>Moving from AD FS to a more agile and responsive, cloud-native solution helps overcome some of the inherent limitations of the old way of managing identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to more robust security, organizations count greater visibility and control with a centralized, intuitive admin center and reduced server costs as transformative benefits of moving to a modern identity management. Moreover, Entra ID features can help organizations achieve better security and compliance with multifactor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies—both of which provide a critical foundation for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Entra ID features include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless</a> and MFA for better user experience. 
 A rich set of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-integrated-apps">apps, APIs, SDKs, and connectors</a> for customization and extensibility. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-conditional-access">Granular adaptive access controls</a> to define and monitor conditional access. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-user-self-service-portals">Self-service portals</a> that allow employees to securely manage their own identity.

 A Comprehensive Guide &amp;&nbsp;FAQ  Summary <p>The <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/">Artificial Superintelligence Alliance</a> (ASI) token merger, involving <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, will be implemented in a two-phase process starting on July 1, 2024. Phase 1 will see the consolidation of SingularityNET’s AGIX and Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN tokens into Fetch.ai’s FET, before transitioning to the ASI ticker in Phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Table of&nbsp;Contents</p>  <a>Phase I&nbsp;Overview</a>  <a>Phase I&nbsp;Timeline</a>  <a>Phase II&nbsp;Overview</a>  <a>Key Dates and Action&nbsp;Items</a>  <a>Your Token Migration Journey</a>  <a>Frequently Asked Questions</a>   Phase I&nbsp;Overview <p>Phase 1 of the ASI migration will be focused on merging the three tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. Holders on other chains that wish to take part in the token merger during Phase 1 will need to bridge from their respective chains. Users that prefer to wait for the support of other chains such Cardano or Polygon can opt to wait for Phase 2 should they&nbsp;desire.</p>  Rebranding: The project will be rebranded as the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance across major platforms.  Token Merge: AGIX and OCEAN will temporarily merge into FET under the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;banner.  FET Trading: FET markets will remain open under the FET ticker without interruption.   Phase I&nbsp;Timeline   July 1,&nbsp;2024:    Project name and logos&nbsp;updated.  Deposits and withdrawals for AGIX and OCEAN will close in preparation for migration.  FET deposits, withdrawals, and trading will continue as&nbsp;usual.  Migration platform for AGIX and OCEAN to FET opens on the SingularityDAO dApp.  AGIX and OCEAN will begin to be delisted from exchanges.  Spot and perpetual trading will continue under the FET&nbsp;ticker.  <p>*For token holders with funds on centralized exchanges like Binance, no action is required. Your OCEAN and AGIX tokens will automatically convert to FET at the appropriate ratio on July 1st, followed by a smooth transition to ASI in mid-July. Individuals holding their funds in self-custody across the Ethereum mainnet will receive detailed guides and tutorials to facilitate a hassle-free transition.</p> Phase II&nbsp;Overview   Community Onboarding: Phase 2 will focus on community member onboarding, specifically for those who have opted to self-custody their&nbsp;funds.  ASI Deployment: The ASI token will be deployed across&nbsp;chains.  Network Upgrades: Fetch.ai’s network will upgrade to the ASI&nbsp;network.  New Migration Contracts: Introduced for conversion from FET, AGIX, and OCEAN to&nbsp;ASI.  EVM and Bridges: Ethereum Virtual Machine and other bridges will open to facilitate ASI token transfers.  Exchange Migration: Exchanges will begin migrating spot markets from FET to&nbsp;ASI.  If your funds are on centralized exchanges like Binance, no action is required.  <blockquote>Scam Warning: At no point will individuals be required to disclose private information, including seed phrases. Be aware of potential scams during this transition period. Malicious actors may attempt impersonation, spoofing, and social engineering tactics.</blockquote><p>Trust only official sources of information as outlined&nbsp;here:</p>  Official ASI website: <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/">https://www.superintelligence.io/</a>  Official Fetch.ai website: <a href="https://fetch.ai/">https://fetch.ai/</a>  Official Ocean Protocol website: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">https://oceanprotocol.com/</a>  Official SingularityNET website: <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">https://singularitynet.io/</a>   The Dawn of a Unified AI Ecosystem — Phase&nbsp;I <p>The highly anticipated token merger between Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET is on the horizon. This unique and ambitious undertaking aims to create a powerful and unified Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) ecosystem under the new ASI ticker. This unified network aspires to become the leading force in decentralized AI (decentralized Artificial Intelligence).</p> Key Dates and Action&nbsp;Items <p>As a web3 token holder of FET, AGIX, or OCEAN, understanding the key aspects of this token merger is crucial. Here’s a breakdown of important dates and&nbsp;actions:</p><p>July 1,&nbsp;2024:</p>  Migration Opens: Conversion contracts allowing AGIX and OCEAN holders to convert their tokens to FET will be available.  Deposits and Withdrawals: AGIX, and OCEAN deposits and withdrawals will be halted on exchanges in preparation for the migration process.  AGIX and OCEAN: tokens will be delisted from exchanges.  Branding Changes: Project branding will transition to Artificial Superintelligence Alliance across third-party platforms.   Your Token Migration Journey <p>The token merger will impact your existing tokens. Here’s what you need to&nbsp;know:</p><p>*Exchange-Held Tokens: These tokens will be automatically converted to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Conversion Rates</p><p>The conversion rates are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  AGIX tokens will migrate to $FET at a conversion rate of 1 AGIX to 0.433350&nbsp;$ASI.  OCEAN tokens will migrate to $FET at a conversion rate of 1 OCEAN to 0.433226&nbsp;$ASI.  <p>*We have received inquiries from numerous exchanges expressing their support for the upcoming token merger. While we appreciate this overwhelming interest, it’s important to mention that we cannot guarantee participation from absolutely every exchange. Our team is diligently working to facilitate widespread support, prioritizing a seamless transition for all token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Please note there is no immediate urgency to convert your assets during this initial phase. Our current focus lies in the strategic onboarding of supporting platforms, ensuring robust infrastructure is in place before proceeding further.</p> Supported Wallets and Conversion Processes <p>The new ASI token merger will be compatible with all major software wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) and hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) familiar to the respective communities. For manual conversion (on-chain, self-custody):</p><p>During Phase I, the assets will be consolidated across the Ethereum Network with future plans to significantly increase interoperability with other ecosystems such as BNB Chain and Cardano active in Phase&nbsp;2.</p>  Connect your existing wallet to the official conversion portal hosted on the SingularityDAO dApp.  Follow the on-screen instructions to convert your tokens. Example images have been attached to illustrate the process. The first picture depicts the contract approval process. The second picture just below demonstrates the migration confirmation. The final step would be to confirm the transaction through the wallet. Holders working with AGIX, OCEAN or FET for the first time might have to add the token contract to the wallet to ensure balances are properly displayed. A guide on that can be found <a href="https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask/">here</a>. The SingularityDAO conversion portal makes this easy by incorporating an “Add to Wallet’’ feature as part of the migration interface.  <p>Verify the conversion using a block explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>. If you’re holding FET for the first time on a wallet such as <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> you may need to add FET as a custom token to ensure that it’s properly displayed in the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Important Reminders:   The conversion window will remain open for years, so there’s no immediate pressure to&nbsp;convert.  Dedicated conversion smart contracts are the only official tools that community members will need to rely on. Expect standard transaction fees, but no additional conversion charges. At no point during the conversion process will you need to input private information including your seed&nbsp;phrase.  With respect to native FET holders, it’s important to note that staked tokens will be automatically migrated during Phase 2. Staking rewards will continue uninterrupted.  Liquidity providers will need to manually withdraw their funds and re-allocate them to updated pools for optimal efficiency. More details will be provided.   The Migration from FET to ASI and the network upgrade — Phase&nbsp;II <p>The final step of the merger involves the migration from the FET token ticker to ASI. During this step, new migration contracts will become available for any AGIX and OCEAN tokens yet to be migrated to FET. Migration contracts will also be deployed for EVM based FET. FET Mainnet Tokens will be automatically converted to ASI as the Fetch.ai mainnet completes its scheduled upgrade. Below you’ll find the specific migration ratios&nbsp;again.</p>  FET tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 FET to 1&nbsp;$ASI.  AGIX tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 AGIX to 0.433350&nbsp;$ASI.  OCEAN tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 OCEAN to 0.433226&nbsp;$ASI.  <p>A non-trivial component of this token migration is the network upgrade, which involves enhancements to the underlying blockchain infrastructure. This upgrade ensures improved performance, security, and scalability for the ASI network. The network engineers and validators will execute a series of precise steps to carry out this&nbsp;upgrade:</p><p>Code Deployment: Engineers will deploy the new codebase to all nodes in the network, incorporating the latest improvements and security&nbsp;patches.</p><p>Smart Contract Migration: Existing smart contracts will be migrated to the new network with necessary updates to ensure compatibility and functionality.</p><p>Node Synchronization: All network nodes will be synchronized to ensure they operate on the same updated protocol&nbsp;version.</p><p>Testing and Validation: Extensive testing will be conducted on a testnet before deploying changes to the mainnet to identify and resolve any&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Final Rollout: Once all components are thoroughly tested, the final rollout will occur, and the network will officially transition to the upgraded&nbsp;state.</p><p>As part of the process, all trading pairs on exchanges will be updated to reflect the new ASI token, and integrations with popular wallet and block explorer providers will be completed to ensure broad accessibility. Additionally, comprehensive resources will be delivered to all stakeholders, including token holders, to provide support and information throughout the transition.</p><p>During the network upgrade, there may be potential network downtime and temporary disruptions on exchanges as they update their markets. It’s important to note that this upgrade is being executed by experienced professionals who have meticulously planned and tested each aspect to ensure a smooth transition. Rest assured, every component of the network upgrade has undergone rigorous testing to minimize any impact on users and maintain the integrity of the network.

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced decentralized identity (DI) <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">mobile wallet SDK</a> on the market—and the newly released version 2.0 has even more features for customers to apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a market leader in innovative <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity (DI)</a> technology offerings, Anonyome Labs is proud to bring version 2.0 of the Sudo Platform DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK to market. Like its <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">predecessor</a>, this SDK unites industry-standard DI protocols with <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>’s modularity, reliability and security, and then adds new features that give customers more options for applying the technology to their product suite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a> is an application that sits on an ‘edge device’, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">wallet</a> and peer-to-peer services. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Learn more</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article we run through the technical specs of Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0, but here are the 5 ways the version 2.0 mobile wallet SDK is more advanced than its predecessor:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest v2.0 suite of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Hyperledger Aries RFCs</a> for receiving and securely storing credentials and verifiably presenting credentials. Learn about how the banking industry is using <a href="https://anonyome.com/2024/02/revolutionizing-credit-union-kyc-reusable-credentials/">verifiable or reusable credentials</a>, for example.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 still supports <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Hyperledger Anoncreds</a>, and now also supports more credential and presentation formats, particularly <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs)</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adds support for Aries-based chat functionality, so users can exchange end-to-end encrypted chat messages with their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">DIDComm</a> connections.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">DI offerings</a>, such as in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Sudo Platform Cloud Agent Service</a> and the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform Decentralized Identity Relay</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 In future we will add into the SDK support for OpenID4VC and more of the latest Hyperledger Aries RFCs. This will be part of our new roadmap as we move on from the initial roadmap we outlined <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s now go into more detail about these 5 features:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest Aries credential and presentation exchange RFCs&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to expand its support for the Hyperledger Aries RFCs. Having already supported most of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Protocol (AIP)</a> 1.0 suite of protocols, we have progressed to the latest AIP 2.0 suite. To do this, we’ve implemented these new Aries RFCs into our edge agent:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2">Issue Credential Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0453)</a> for negotiating and receiving verifiable credentials from Aries issuers&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2">Present Proof Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0454)</a> for presenting verifiable credentials to Aries verifiers.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This means version 2.0 is significantly better than version 1.0 because it can receive and present credentials in a range of different formats, such as W3C VCs, in addition to Anoncreds. We discuss these new supported formats below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was the case with version 1 of the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK, we implement the core of these Aries RFCs by leveraging and contributing to the open-source Hyperledger project that Anonyome co-maintains: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Aries-VCX</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for W3C credentials and presentations&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Using the latest Aries protocols for credential and presentation exchange, we built support for new credential and presentation formats, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs and VPs</a>. This means our customers can pick and choose from a wider range of ‘DI flavours’ that best suit their business use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">previously analysed Anoncreds and W3C VCs</a>, both of which play a crucial purpose in the DI ecosystem. Some benefits the Edge Agent SDK’s support for W3C VCs offers include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Higher interoperability from standardization and widespread adoption as a result of being formalized by W3C&nbsp; 



 Highly flexible data structure in comparison to Anoncreds, including support for more complex credential structures such as nested attributes and lists, suitable for a broad range of applications&nbsp; 



 More maturity and backing by a global standard, with many implementations and growing adoption.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Where Anoncreds may beat W3C VCs is in its advanced privacy-preserving features. Anoncreds thrives in this area, with support for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">zero knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs) of credential attributes, and partial disclosure of credential attributes (only reveal the attributes that need to be revealed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To retain some of these privacy-preserving use cases in W3C VCs credentials, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK adds support for presenting selectively disclosed credentials using BBS+ cryptography (as defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0646-bbs-credentials">Aries RFC 0646</a>). This means edge agent users can present a proof with a subset of their BBS credential’s attributes without revealing all the other attributes that may contain sensitive data. This is not otherwise possible with other W3C VC types, such as Ed25519-based VCs.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for end-to-end encrypted chatting&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>All Aries protocol messages transmitted between the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK and its peers (issuers, verifiers, etc.) are already end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), but with our added support for Aries “Basic Messages” (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>), our users can now send and receive text chat messages with their DIDComm connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has built a <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity/edge-agent-sdk/messaging">comprehensive API around this feature</a>, with support for message storage and real-time subscriptions. This new suite of APIs allows our customers to build E2EE chat use cases into their applications, whether that is E2EE chat with an issuer or verifier (e.g. a bank or DMV), or with a fellow edge agent (mobile to mobile chat). The Edge Agent SDK supports these use cases.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The SDK exists in Anonyome’s suite of DI offerings&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Anonyome continues to advance its <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/decentralized-iam/">collection of DI offerings</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our edge agent against our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a> offering (in addition to a suite of open-source Aries agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 
 We have a rich roadmap ahead for the SDK&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Maturing into its second stable release, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK has achieved the roadmap tasks that we laid out in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">this article</a>. But given the evolving nature of the DI industry, Anonyome plans to continue adding new features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future for the SDK, we plan to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Implement V2 Aries protocols for connection establishment, particularly DIDExchange (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0023-did-exchange">RFC 0023</a>) and Out-of-Band protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434</a>)&nbsp; 



 Implement parts of the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID4VC</a> DI stack, allowing the Edge Agent SDK to receive and present credentials with a wider audience of standards, particularly the EUDI’s <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md">Architecture and Reference Framework</a>&nbsp; 



 Expand the set of DID methods we support, such as did:cheqd, did:indy, and did:peer, again increasing the level of interoperability with more DI agents.&nbsp;

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio has a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2gFx-msuE">demonstration</a> of how you can use verifiable credentials for reusable KYC, and bank account authentication for passwordless login — and it’s really easy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demonstration is from the perspective of a bank working with a customer to open an account. It starts with collecting the required personal information to open a bank account&nbsp;(aka KYC — know your customer). Assuming this has been assessed by the bank as being accurate, the customer is sent a QR code to establish a secure, direct communications channel for accepting and receiving a KYC credential, which they store in a digital wallet (in this case, Indicio’s Holdr+ wallet).</p>
<p>Because the source of the credential can be cryptographically verified and the KYC information can be shown to have not been altered, the credential can be reused to share this information.</p>
<p>For example, other bank departments or other institutions, such as insurance companies, can use this credential to avoid re-doing the same KYC. Verifying the information is very simple. The customer scans a QR code to present the credential, and the verifying software on the financial institution’s side verifies its source and that it has not been tampered with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The customer can also use the credential for passwordless login to their bank account. Rather than messing with passwords and two-factor authentication, you can simply scan a QR code to present your account credential to the bank, and you will be instantly authenticated and granted access to your account.</p>
<p>This is a game changer for banking and finance. One of the biggest reasons that customers give up is long and frustrating processes, and now, with a simple scan, you can keep your customers happy and coming back for more.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how verifiable credentials can simplify processes for your organization please<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"> contact the Indicio team</a> and our industry veterans will be happy to help.</p>

  <p>Today, we're excited to announce the general availability of user insights in Microsoft Entra External ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User insights, which was launched in public preview in October 2023, is a powerful tool that enables admins and developers to gain deeper insights into their customers’ behavior, preferences, and challenges. It provides key metrics such as monthly active users (MAU), daily active users (DAU), new users added, requests over time, authentications over time, multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage by type, and MFA success versus failure rates. You can also filter and segment the data by time range, operating system, country, and application id. With user insights, you can:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Analyze the trends and patterns of your customers’ application login and registration activity and discover new opportunities for growth and improvement. 
 Optimize user experience and identity management strategies for your customers and make data-driven decisions that align with your business goals and user needs. 
 Build customized dashboards in tools like Power BI using user insights from Microsoft Graph APIs, allowing more flexibility and control of your customer identity data.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access user insights, you need to have a <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID</a> external tenant. Once you have your tenant ready, you can access the dashboards on the <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDUserInsights">Microsoft admin center</a> or access raw data via <a href="https://aka.ms/userInsightsGraphAPIs">Microsoft Graph APIs</a>. The features we’re announcing today provide significant value and are based on direct feedback from our preview customers. Sign up for your free trial <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin/Trialtenantcreation.reactview/isFromDevHub/true">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Export data to Excel for offline analysis 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘export to Microsoft Excel’ feature is a convenient way to access raw data from the dashboards to suit different user preferences and use cases. You will now be able to export data in comma-separated values (CSV) format to facilitate the seamless importation and manipulation of data with Excel, or any other preferred CSV editor. This allows customers to use data offline for their own customized analysis and manipulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Export authentications data to Microsoft Excel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can filter data by language and identity provider to get more insights into the preferences and behavior of your users. For example, you can see which languages are most popular among your users and how they vary across applications and regions. You can also see which identity providers are used the most for authentication and how they may affect the user experience and retention. These filters help you tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Analyze authentications data by identity provider or language customization</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improving user experience and security with MFA failure insights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA failure chart shows the number of sign-in attempts that failed due to MFA issues and why they failed. You can see the breakdown by three categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Bad request: the sign-in request was malformed or invalid. 
 MFA denied: the user entered the wrong verification code or declined the MFA request. 
 MFA incomplete: the user did not complete the MFA request within the time limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This breakdown can help you understand the common causes of MFA failures so you can target your resources and improve the user experience and security of your applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Monthly MFA failures insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identify potential issues with user retention, engagement, and satisfaction 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inactive users are users who have not signed in over a certain period. You can see the number of daily and monthly inactive users in your applications, as well as the trend over time. This metric can help you monitor user engagement and identify areas where you can improve your user experience or offer incentives to re-engage your users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Active, inactive, and new user trends over time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We’ve written a lot about how attackers try to break passwords. The solution to password attacks—still the most common attack vector for compromising identities—is to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa">turn on multifactor authentication (MFA)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as more customers do the right thing with MFA, actors are going beyond password-only attacks. So, we’re going to publish a series of articles on how to defeat more advanced attacks, starting with token theft. In this article, we’ll start with some basics on how tokens work, describe a token theft attack, and then explain what you can do to prevent and mitigate token theft now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tokens 101&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we get too deep into the token theft conversation, let’s quickly review the mechanics of tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A token is an authentication artifact that grants you access to resources. You get a token by signing into an identity provider (IDP), such as Microsoft Entra ID, using a set of credentials. The IDP responds to a successful sign-in by issuing a token that describes who you are and what you have permission to do. When you want to access an application or service (we’ll just say app from here), you get permission to talk to that resource by presenting a token that’s correctly signed by an issuer it trusts. The software on the client device you’re using takes care of all token handling behind the scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Basic token flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first token you get, called a session token, shows that you successfully signed into the IDP, and how you signed in. When you sign into an app, it can exchange that session token for an access token, which gives you access to a specific resource for a certain amount of time without having to reauthenticate. To use an analogy, think of an amusement park. The IDP is the ticket office, which issues a park pass that provides credits for different rides. If you want to go on the roller coaster, you go to the ticket office, show your season park pass, and receive a ticket for that ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as you might be able to buy a day pass, season pass, or lifetime pass to the park, each token has a lifetime, usually between one and 24 hours. And just as a 12-month season pass may get you a one-day pass to a specific ride, session tokens can have different—and usually much longer—lifetimes than access tokens. Moreover, access token lifetimes can differ, so the roller coaster pass may last an hour while the Ferris wheel pass is good for an entire day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditionally, longer lifetimes are more convenient for users and more resilient against potential IDP outages (they save round trips to the IDP and associated latency) but riskier, while shorter lifetimes are safer (the IDP checks the integrity of the request more often). Technologies such as continuous access evaluation provide continuous assessment, so a shorter token lifetime isn’t a benefit when these are in place. When a token expires or continuous access evaluation reports heightened risk, the client goes back to the IDP and requests a refresh. This process is typically invisible to users, but if a risk condition has changed, and your organization policy requires it, then you may have to reauthenticate and get a new token. One last thing to note: while it’s a bummer to lose your roller coaster ticket, it’s really bad to lose your season park pass. An attacker can use your roller coaster ticket to get on a single ride for a short while, but with your season park pass, they can get on any ride for as long as they want. It’s similar with which, if stolen, give an actor a lasting ability to get access tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How token theft works 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attackers steal tokens so they can impersonate you and access your data for as long as that stolen token lives. To do this, they get access to where a token is stored (on the client, in proxy servers, or in some cases in application or network logs) to acquire it and replay it from somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individual ride ticket</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an attacker steals your session token, it’s like picking your pocket after you’ve purchased your all-access season park pass at the fair’s ticket office. Because a token is digital, token theft is like stealing the pass from your pocket, making a photocopy, and then putting the original back in your pocket. The attacker can use their copy of your session token to get unlimited new access tokens to keep stealing your data, just as they can show a copy of a valid park pass to keep getting on rides without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attacker stealing your access token is comparable to someone stealing your ride ticket as you stand in line. They do the same copy-and-replace trick, using their copy of your token to access the resource, just as they could show a copy of a valid ticket to get on an individual ride without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because in both cases the attacker puts the original pass or ticket back in your pocket, you don’t even know an attacker is riding the rides in your name. Your token seems fine, even though an attacker is using an illegitimate copy of it, and it may take a while to determine that anything is amiss—if you ever do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso stores all their documents in a secure cloud storage service and requires all employees to verify their identity using MFA before accessing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, after starting their workday by signing into Contoso's cloud storage service, a user inadvertently installed malware on their device by clicking on a malicious 'phishing' link sent to them via email. The malicious code copied the user's session token and sent it to the attacker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then used the stolen and MFA-validated session token, now copied to their machine, to gain access to Contoso's environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then downloaded as many documents as they could access, including a bunch of confidential reports, and leaked them on the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of malware on the client to acquire the token is one common, easy method for attackers. Other tactics used to steal tokens include:</p>
 
 Copying tokens from the network as they pass through a proxy or router that the attacker controls. 
 Extracting tokens from unsecured server logs of the relying party. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While token theft still constitutes fewer than 5% of all identity compromises, incidents are growing. alone, we detected 147,000 token replay attacks, a 111% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Protecting tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDPs and clients should handle tokens as securely as possible by only transmitting them over encrypted channels and not storing them in the open. But if an attacker infiltrates the device or network channel as in the example above, they can steal tokens and use them until they expire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, a token would only work when used from the device to which it was issued. That is, if replayed from a different device, such as one an attacker controls, they would be rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key part of Microsoft’s protections against token theft is the use of tokens that are cryptographically tied to the device they own. This is often called token binding, but may also be called sender constrained tokens, or token proof of possession. Token protection makes it harder to execute the main types of attacks designed to steal tokens, including network-based attacks and those using malware on the device by restricting use of the stolen token from devices they weren't issued to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra, token protection binds tokens to cryptographic keys specific to the device and ties them to the device registration. Once developers enable their applications to use protected tokens, you can enforce an Entra Conditional Access policy that requires client applications to use protected tokens to access a service. This policy rejects tokens which are not cryptographically tied to the device they were issued to. In the theme park analogy, this is like the ticket office taking your picture and printing it on your ride ticket and requiring ride operators to match the picture to your face before letting you ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a large project, spanning operating system platforms, native and web applications, all our cloud services, and the full range of different tokens in use for each case. It will be released in stages for specific scenarios. The first stage, in public preview now, protects the sign-in session tokens that native applications on Windows devices use when accessing Exchange, SharePoint and Teams services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection policy is available for Windows clients today. We’ll support Azure management scenarios and web applications that access Microsoft 365 resources and extend our cross-platform capabilities to Mac, iOS, Android, and other clients over the next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Practical steps for countering token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection will offer the strongest protection against token theft; however, it will take the industry time to update all applications to use bound tokens. The good news is that Microsoft offers compelling countermeasures against attacks involving token theft that you can use today to reduce their risk and impact. We recommend a systematic defense-in-depth approach:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft. 
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens. 
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line of defense is to reduce the chances of attackers stealing tokens in the first place, and below are some well-established techniques for building it. It’s the equivalent of keeping your ride tickets and park passes safe from pickpockets while you’re in the theme park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require managed and compliant devices. Use device management and define Conditional Access policies to require that users access resources from a compliant device. Compliance policies we recommend to reduce the risk of successful token theft from devices include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 To help prevent accidental infection with token-stealing malware, require users running on Windows to run as standard users rather than with device admin rights and require that all devices run up to date anti-malware and virus tools. 
 Use storage encryption to protect device content, including tokens, in case someone steals the device itself. 
 Enable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection to help protect Entra ID tokens in LSA memory. LSA protection is on by default for new devices and can be enabled for other devices via Intune. 
 Use jailbreak or rooting detection for mobile devices. Jailbroken devices are more likely to expose tokens and cryptographic secrets to potential attacks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn on Credential Guard for your Windows users. If your users are running Windows 10 or later, you can prevent theft of Active Directory credentials by configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/?source=recommendations">Credential Guard</a>, which us&nbsp;&nbsp; es virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate local and cached credentials so that only privileged system software—and not malware—can access them. Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2, Credential Guard is on by default for devices that meet requirements. This also helps protect cloud applications and resources when hybrid-joined devices using Active Directory authentication initiate a session to access cloud applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for enabling credential guard in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/configure?tabs=intune#enable-credential-guard">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While device management and strong credentials certainly reduce the risk of token theft, not everyone has them, and they’re still not completely foolproof. The next layer of defense is to prevent attackers from using stolen tokens for ongoing access by configuring policies to reject them wherever possible, and by detecting attempted use and responding automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require token protection in Conditional Access, and where possible, choose apps and services that use token protection. Microsoft is updating our apps, identity provider, and operating systems to support token protection, so if you’re using our apps and platforms, be sure to use the latest versions. Then configure Conditional Access to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756">require token protection for sign-in sessions</a> so only applications and devices using bound sign in session tokens, which can’t be used if they’ve been stolen and moved to another device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating a Conditional Access policy that requires token binding in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-token-protection#create-a-conditional-access-policy">our documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a risk policy to disrupt token theft in your environment automatically. When a user initiates a session or attempts to access an application, ID Protection will examine user and session risk factors to see if any have changed. Configure Conditional Access policies to protect both medium and high-risk sessions by either challenging users with MFA or by <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/prompt-users-for-reauthentication-on-sensitive-apps-and-high/ba-p/4062703">requiring reauthentication</a>. This will make it difficult or impossible for an attacker to initiate a session using a stolen session token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever available, <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)</a> can automatically invalidate tokens when ID Protection raises the risk for a user or a service principal. This triggers the risk-based Conditional Access policies to mitigate in real-time, requiring re-authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating risk-based Conditional Access policies in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reduce the risk of token reuse by restricting sessions for use within network boundaries. Most attackers use stolen tokens from untrusted IP addresses. You can establish network boundaries with policies that prevent users from accessing your resources if they’re coming from unknown locations or from known bad locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrict networks with Entra Conditional Access:&nbsp;Conditional Access includes controls that will block requests from outside a network compliance boundary that you define. This will prevent an attacker from refreshing a stolen Entra token, restricting its use to the lifetime of the token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for defining a network compliance boundary with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhance network controls with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution</a>: To prevent the attacker from using a token outside of a trusted network at all, Entra Internet Access and Entra Private access use agents installed on endpoints and a compliant network check (enforced in real-time via CAE) to verify whether a user is connecting from a trusted network. Find step-by-step instructions for enabling compliant network check with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAE-capable applications and services such as Teams, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online will continuously enforce the IP-based named location Conditional Access policies and compliant network policies to ensure that tokens can be used only from trusted networks to access services. CAE offers a strict location enforcement mode to maximize protection. Find the step-by-step instructions for enabling this in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revoke tokens using Continuous Access Evaluation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring that the supported services can only be accessed from trusted locations, <a href="http://aka.ms/cae">CAE</a> can revoke tokens when admins (or users themselves) take action in response to detecting an account compromise or token theft. These include disabling accounts, changing passwords, and revoking refresh tokens. Learn more about Continuous Access Evaluation in <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender to monitor for token theft. When a threat actor replays a token, their sign-in event can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection">trigger detections</a>&nbsp;such as ‘anomalous token’ and ‘unfamiliar sign-in properties’ from both Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#premium-detections">Premium detections</a> recognize abnormal characteristics such as an unusual token lifetime, a token played from an unfamiliar location, or token attributes that are unusual or match known attacker patterns. Signals from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) can indicate a possible attempt to access the Primary Refresh Token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for investigating token theft in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/operations/token-theft-playbook#investigations">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull all your data into one Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), such as Microsoft Sentinel, to investigate potential token theft. If you receive an alert for an event that may indicate token theft, you can investigate it in the Microsoft Sentinel portal or in another SIEM. Microsoft Sentinel gives you important details about a specific incident, such as its severity, when it occurred, how many entities were involved, which events triggered it, and whether it reflects any MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics or techniques. You can then view the investigation map to understand the scope and root cause of the potential security threat.</p>

 We sit down with our internal subject matter expert in the telecommunications industry to learn what trends this sector is seeing, predictions on where it is headed as well as advice for the future. 



<p>Telecommunications is becoming an ever-growing market, not only because we live in a connected world but also because the number of devices and network connections just keeps increasing. One recent study predicts that <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/5g-iot-connections-to-surpass-100-mn/">5G IoT (Internet of Things) connections will reach 116 million globally by 2026</a>. This industry is therefore confronted with many challenges as the number of devices and connections continues to rise.</p>



<p>According to an identity verification survey conducted by Regula in 2023, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/telecoms-turn-to-identity-verification-as-fraud-concerns-soar">9 out of 10 organizations in the telecommunications industry consider identity verification (IDV) a crucial tool in combating the increasing threat of identity fraud</a>. Furthermore, in the coming years, <a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/information-technology/images/infographics/2024-cio-agenda/2024-cio-agenda-infographics/2024-cio-agenda-banking-and-investment-infographic">CIOs will increase investments by 83% in Integration Technologies/APIs/API Architecture according to Gartner</a>. But fraud isn’t the only challenge this industry faces. Telecommunications needs to stay up-to-date and meet the demands that modern technology brings to the table, or shall I say device, if it is to have any future. Since smart devices are as common and habitual as brushing one’s teeth, the direction in which this industry is headed is one in which needs to stay ahead of the curve or get left behind in the pile of outdated technology.</p>



<p>We spoke with Duke Golden, Director Sales at IDnow, with his almost 30 years within the industry and past experiences at 1NCE, Huawei and Vodafone to name just a few, to learn what topics in the telecommunications sector are trending, his predictions on where this industry is headed and his advice for telco operators.</p>



 As an industry that is perhaps overlooked due to the fact that it is very much part of our everyday lives and common for the generations that grew up within this technology boom, what major trends would you say the telecommunications industry is therefore seeing? 



<p>Telecommunications in our daily lives is almost invisible these days – but it is truly the foundation for our digital lives. It’s just something that you think should be there. I’ve been in the telecommunications industry for about 25 years now. But you’re right, that comment is very much what you get from a generation that grew up with the Internet. But there is a lot that goes into this. Everything we enjoy today from dating apps to ordering groceries, telecommunications is the driving force behind all of these innovations. Nothing happens without a network connection.</p>



<p>To describe it in a different way, network connectivity has very much become a commodity, especially over the last 10-15 years. Connectivity is like bread, milk, eggs, oil, gas—it’s just something we need for our everyday life. However, the struggle right now within the telecommunications industry, especially with regards to Tier-1 operators, is that they need to find a way to make that connectivity into something like a value add for their customers. It can’t just be about the connectivity. The question now is what do telecommunications operators do with that connectivity? They have a great opportunity to do something really special, being the owner of the network connectivity.</p>



<blockquote><p>So right now we’re at a point where telecommunications providers really need to provide new solutions, incorporating their connectivity to bring additional value add to customers.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>A big part of that value add for customers is the IoT—API driven economies. What they’re doing is basically providing the connectivity and then a platform for API integration for a million different types of services that are intrinsically connected to their connectivity.</p>



<p>But how do you monetize connectivity? You have to create an ecosystem where you can generate revenue based on new ideas using that connectivity. Telecommunications providers still want connectivity to be at the center of their proposition but the really interesting and attractive part for customers is the ability to monetize this in a variety of forms. And this is where the IoT starts to come in.</p>



 Yes, IoT (Internet of Things) seems to be one of those trends on the radar within telecom, why is this the case? 



<p>IoT is evolving to become one of the most disruptive and enabling technologies for end users in recent memory. It’s revolutionizing the way we approach network connectivity and digitalization in our daily lives. In the beginning it was just machine to machine which was basically the first iteration of the IoT.</p>



<p>IoT is basically a blank canvas for an artist to use connectivity to paint a picture which didn’t exist before, and that’s what’s happening with the IoT, especially with telco-driven IoT initiatives. Because it’s not just the telcos who are doing IoT. It is a hugely competitive and largely proprietary space where the only limitation to business cases is the creator’s imagination. This is where only the strongest telcos will prosper. Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has a very strong expert approach to IoT which can accommodate entire ecosystems to create business value for their customers.</p>



<p>Now, the pressure on the telecom world is really to bring the knowledge that they have, not just about networks but about industry verticals themselves, into play to develop something meaningful for individual customers.</p>



 What tools and resources will help these initiatives in the telco sector? 



<p>What we do at IDnow is possibly one of the most important enabling solutions within the IoT potentially. One of my goals is to connect IDnow into this API economy so customers of a telco service have the option to conduct an ID verification process. To date, IoT has been more concerned with locating individual devices. A lot of people think IoT is a device-driven type of world where you don’t need to know the person behind it. But that’s changing, especially with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">AI and deepfakes</a>. You can really manipulate a traditional device-based IoT network in a big way unless you verify who the person is working on the IoT platform. You really need to know who has access and who is accessing the platform. Maybe it doesn’t have to be a deep dive, but the key with IoT is trust.</p>



<blockquote><p>Trust is the number one factor that will either enable a customer to deploy a telco-based IoT solution or will stop it in its tracks.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>If there are doubts about the authenticity of the platform, or the ability for that platform to control unauthorized usage, then a lot of times IoT initiatives never make it off the ground, especially in Germany. It’s all about 1% risk means 100% opposition in many cases. Germany has kind of a very strict sense when it comes to these things like 0 risk is the only acceptable risk.</p>



 Since trust is the number one factor within telco, the term Zero Trust with regards to network connections and security has been used a lot recently. Is this something widespread in the telecommunications industry? 



<p>Zero Trust is widely used. That is a term that you will hear everywhere from network engineers to security operations technicians. Zero trust—trust nothing. The reason that it has become popular is because security has become completely endangered, especially over the last five to 10 years. In the network engineering world, there are different points of ingress into the network. In the past before IoT, before cloud, before all these other innovative ways to connect to the Internet, the Internet protocol basically protected these environments. They were standardized environments where you could only enter them with a specific network protocol and it was much easier to protect them. Zero Trust wasn’t really needed at that point because you knew that if someone broke into the network, it was an inside job.</p>



<p>Now, anyone has the opportunity to interface with any layer of the network from a completely unverified position. So Zero Trust was born, and it became probably the strongest terminology used especially in the telco world. You need to verify every single user to a different degree. For example, if you’re talking about an online dating platform, you don’t need to verify everything about this person’s character. You just need to verify they are over 18. Zero Trust doesn’t mean you have to conduct a complete background check on every single individual person, but you need to know who you’re dealing with.</p>



 With the need to verify a person and bind them to the device they are using, will there be hesitation from users with concerns to data privacy? 



<p>Enterprises want to know more about their customers because the more they know the better they can serve their customers. Nothing is for free. A well-known CEO of a cybersecurity company once told me, if you are getting something for free, then you are the product. Thus, we’re not dealing in a cash-based economy anymore. True value lies in information these days.</p>



<p>And with regards to the telecommunications industry, there is a huge push right now to monetize in different ways the connectivity that they’re already providing to people. With the price of connectivity sinking daily, the push now for telcos is to recover that depreciation in the cost of actual connectivity in extra value-added services like IoT, like cloud services, 5G campus Networks and other digitalization initiatives. And the key to all these other value-added services is to verify who those services are going to, not only for the safety and security aspect, but having the knowledge to serve their customers better. That knowledge for telecommunications providers is essential to designing or altering services to fit specific types of the widest possible scope of business cases.</p>



<p>As with all new initiatives, especially from my experience in Europe, there will be hesitation. But it depends on the country and on the culture. Every society globally is very different when it comes to their aversion to risk. At the end of the day, it’s all about the economy and people’s ability to pay for things, either with money or information.</p>



<p>While there might be kickback in conservative countries like Germany, the vast majority of the world will have no problem with signing up for services and giving them a certain amount of information. But it needs to be tied to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">identity verification solutions</a> because the only way to really increase security in a very complicated online services world is to start with a single point of truth. And the only way to truly verify who a person is, is by verifying their identity. But they can’t only be verified one time. It needs to be an ongoing activity verifying and reverifying, especially with regards to critical infrastructure. And this is where the telecommunications industry and IDV is headed.</p>



 How regulated would you say is the IoT industry? For example, in Germany, there is the Telecommunications Act (TKG) but are there any other regulations? 



<p>With regards to the IoT specifically, IoT is still very much wild, wild West. There is very little regulation.</p>



<p>I think there is a serious risk that the IoT can become too dangerous in some ways if we don’t regulate ourselves using best practice instead of waiting for regulatory agencies to act. The difference between traditional telecommunications networks and IoT networks is that telecom networks are completely standardized internally and with IoT all of these solutions are proprietary. There is no standardization within the IoT industry. So that means our ability to secure the IoT is much less than with standardized industry standards like on the traditional network side which have well thought out, highly developed security protocols built into them.</p>



<p>What better place to secure the IoT than at the point of ingress for all users, both internal and external? That means performing a comprehensive ID verification process for admins and users, depending on what type of IoT platform it is. We just need to change our view on what is an acceptable level of risk.</p>



 With the number of smart devices continuing to increase and experts predicting that by 2030 the world population will be around 8.3 billion and the number of devices will have reached an estimated 43.2 billion, what are the main challenges this industry faces when considering these numbers? 



<p>Traditionally, in the IDV sector it’s been about verifying users before they buy their prepaid mobile or before they activate it and then they’re good to go. </p>



<blockquote><p>Now, verification needs to become an integral part of the entire value chain for technology, not just at the point of purchase, but at the point of usage.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>The ID verification process is something that needs to be always going on in the background. And this is where the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0 regulation</a> would come into play with a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a>. But we’re just not there yet. Regulations will always be behind technology.</p>



<p>At IDnow and as an ID verification solutions provider, it’s our responsibility to fill the gap between regulation and everyday business risks that aren’t being addressed by the regulatory environment. Building this bridge of trust for our customers is our core mission which we take very seriously.</p>

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>As we enter the era of generative AI, the risk of identity theft for both individuals and organizations is escalating. A <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">recent case</a> in Hong Kong highlights this threat, where an office was deceived into transferring $25 million after a video call with a deepfake CFO and colleagues. As advances in AI erode trust, it becomes apparent that a robust digital identity solution for organizations is urgently&nbsp;needed.</p><p>In the past few years, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a> framework has emerged as one of the most promising solutions to this global crisis. The vLEI framework offers one of the most secure and trustworthy digital organization identity management to date and potentially revolutionizes digital business transactions worldwide.</p><p>Despite its potential, vLEI is of course not a silver bullet that will solve all the world's internet problems. The robustness of the vLEI framework may introduce significant friction to business workflows and, as a result, may not be appropriate for some organizational use cases. vLEI is also still in its&nbsp;infancy</p><p>In this article, we propose 4 pragmatic criteria for identifying bad, good, and great use cases for vLEI. These criteria are by no means rigid rules set in stone but serve as a useful mental model for pioneers and early adopters exploring vLEI use&nbsp;cases.</p> The 4&nbsp;Criteria <p>We have identified 4 criteria for good and great vLEI use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Use cases that involve organization-to-organization transactions  Use cases that involve cross-border transactions  Use cases that are highly regulated  Use cases that have open ecosystems  <p>We posit that a viable use case for vLEI should meet at least 3 out of the 4 specified criteria. We argue that any use case that meets only two or fewer criteria is simply not worth pursuing, and pioneers seeking potential applications for vLEI would be better off focusing their efforts elsewhere.</p> 1. Org-to-Org <p>The first criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they involve organization-to-organization (Org-to-Org) transactions. This includes business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G), and government-to-government (G2G) use cases. This is because org-to-org transactions often involve significant monetary value, which far outweighs the initial friction associated with adopting&nbsp;vLEI.</p><p>Customer-to-customer (C2C) use cases such as typical interactions in a social media platform do not work for a trivial reason that vLEI is specifically designed for organizational uses. While business-to-customer (B2C) could be feasible, they generally do not present enough value or urgency for companies to adopt&nbsp;vLEI.</p> 2. Cross-Border <p>Cross-border transactions often face challenges in identifying and verifying clients, suppliers, or partners across different countries, leading to significant perceived risks. The vLEI framework is ideal for addressing these challenges as it is specifically designed for international use. It can potentially streamline the cross-border identification and verification processes, mitigating risks and improving efficiency.</p><p>While vLEI could be viable for domestic use cases, there are often alternative solutions available that may not incentivize businesses to adopt&nbsp;vLEI.</p> 3. Highly Regulated <p>Highly regulated use cases are subject to strict requirements and standards, where non-compliance can result in severe penalties or legal consequences. As a result, these use cases often require extensive due diligence of business partners, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)&nbsp;checks.</p><p>The process of obtaining vLEI for organizations and their representatives involves robust identity verification that is more stringent than those often conducted in the financial sector. As a result, vLEI, which is built on the global LEI system, can help streamline the due diligence process, significantly reducing compliance costs.</p><p>Conversely, industries that are not highly regulated may be reluctant to bear the initial friction of adopting&nbsp;vLEI.</p> 4. Open Ecosystems <p>The final criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they operate within open ecosystems, allowing the addition of organizations whose identities are not known in advance. Onboarding a new organization to the ecosystem often incurs significant cost, time, and effort. vLEI allows these onboarding costs to be offloaded to a third party, specifically a qualified vLEI issuer (QVI), which ensures that the organization and its representatives have undergone strict identity verification.</p><p>Conversely, a closed ecosystem where participants are already known and trusted may not need&nbsp;vLEI.</p> Bad, Good, and Great Use&nbsp;Cases  Great Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Great use cases are those that satisfy all 4 criteria, making them ideal candidates that could benefit from integrating vLEI into their workflows.</p><p>A prime example of a great use case is trade finance. It typically involves organizations (criterion 1) which are often located in different countries (criterion 2). Trade finance is also highly regulated, with financiers subject to AML and CFT requirements (criterion 3). The trade finance ecosystem is open, allowing any company worldwide to initiate trades and apply for, e.g., a letter of credit (criterion 4).</p> Good Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Good use cases are those that satisfy 3 out of the 4 criteria. We consider these use cases worth pursuing.</p><p>An example of a good use case is the financial reporting of banking institutions in Europe to the European <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-discussion-paper-centralisation-eea-banks">Banking Authority (EBA)</a>. This exemplifies a B2G scenario (criterion 1), encompassing banks across multiple European countries (criterion 2) that operate within a highly regulated environment (criterion 3). What makes this use case simply good rather than great in our criteria is that European banks are already known entities within the closed ecosystem supervised by the&nbsp;EBA.</p> Bad Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Bad use cases are those that satisfy two or fewer criteria. While they may be a feasible use case for vLEI, we consider them a low-potential candidate and would rather prioritize focusing our efforts on other use cases. We argue that bad use cases will only become viable once vLEI has achieved widespread adoption. For instance, organizations that already possess vLEI for stronger use cases might contemplate applying it to these bad use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>An example of a use case we consider “bad” for vLEI is an HR platform. Such a platform is used internally between employers and employees (not org-to-org) and is also not highly regulated. Typically, employees and employers have alternative means to verify each other, diminishing the necessity for vLEI in this&nbsp;context.</p> Conclusion <p>While vLEI holds significant potential to transform global business operations, it currently faces a challenge known as the “cold start problem,” where there are not enough holders and use cases to foster exponential growth in the ecosystem. Pioneers and early adopters are encouraged to prioritize exploring high-potential use cases and to avoid investing effort in those that meet only two or fewer criteria.</p><p>Do you agree with our criteria? Are there additional criteria we should consider adding to the list?

 In the age of the Internet of Things, autonomous and connected cars are revolutionizing the way we drive. As these vehicles become increasingly sophisticated, verifying user identity is becoming a crucial issue in ensuring safety and preventing fraud. Let’s explore the challenges and solutions associated with this mobility revolution. 



<p>In the age of the Internet of Things, autonomous and connected cars are revolutionizing the way we drive. As these vehicles become increasingly sophisticated, verifying user identity is becoming a crucial issue in ensuring safety and preventing fraud. Let’s explore the challenges and solutions associated with this mobility revolution.</p>



<p>By 2025, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/braincamps/planet/how-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-of-the-digital-sector/internet-of-things-50-billion-greenhouse-gas-producers/">50 billion objects will be connected worldwide</a>, covering everything from household appliances to urban infrastructure. Among these objects, cars occupy a prominent place, with functionalities multiplying at an impressive rate. According to <a href="https://www.geotab.com/blog/what-is-connected-car/">Geotab</a>, the smart device is what has changed the game the most in recent years. As technology advances, connected vehicles become more sophisticated, offering advanced functionality that goes far beyond simple driving. These advances are not just limited to improving mechanical and safety aspects, but also extend to features that enhance the overall experience for drivers and passengers.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.febiac.be/en/article/connectivity-in-cars-seen-from-all-aspects">Belgian Automobile Federation (FEBIAC)</a> explains: “There are two types of connected cars. The first category has a 4G/5G card that vehicles use to be constantly connected to the Internet, and more specifically to the manufacturer’s online services. The second category connects via your smartphone, whose screen will be replicated on that of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>Connected cars are increasingly integrating smartphones into their ecosystems, thanks in particular to the democratization of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="https://www.android.com/auto/">Android Auto</a>. As Apple points out, it’s now possible to integrate your iPhone with your car’s digital keys, to open and start your vehicle. Users are now able to link their phone to their vehicle, enabling them to benefit from functions such as remote opening and starting, or purchasing options directly from their phone.</p>



<p>However, such functionalities require a high level of user verification. With the <a href="https://www.confused.com/meet-our-experts/content/automotive-hacking-and-connected-cars">risk of hacking on the rise</a>, it is essential to protect against fraud and identity theft by adopting appropriate solutions.</p>



 Connectivity: the new spearhead of the automotive sector. 



<p>Connected cars have opened up a whole new world of opportunities for automakers and end-users alike. Connectivity has made a major contribution to enhancing the driving experience, through the deployment of new functionalities. These include:</p>



  Predictive maintenance, thanks to remote diagnostic modules, or maintenance notifications based on real-time analysis of vehicle data;  Personalized services, such as notification of available parking spaces nearby, or suggestions for restaurants and services based on location;  Entertainment and connectivity, including smartphones accessing streaming services, or compatible applications from stores;  Remote control and command, enabling the vehicle to be locked, unlocked or started remotely, or the vehicle temperature to be preset.  



<p>Some of these advantages require a connection with a smartphone to operate. More and more cars no longer need a key to start, for example. Cards are gradually replacing ignition keys. They can also be dematerialized on a smartphone, for even greater convenience. This is one of the reasons behind the success of car-sharing services such as <a href="https://getaround.com/">Getaround</a> or <a href="https://zity.eco/en/">Zity</a>, which rely on remote unlocking of vehicles, thanks to strong user identification.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/critical-information-systems-and-cybersecurity/news/new-security-methodology-connected-cars">Thales</a> points out, another crucial point in terms of security for connected vehicles lies in web applications. These enable “the exchange of information between the vehicle and/or driver and the manufacturer’s IT system. If the authentication process is not secure enough, an attacker can enter a user’s account and take control of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>For all these reasons, strong identification measures are essential to anticipate these new uses.</p>



 



 

 



 Securing new uses through identification. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">car-sharing</a> is one of the benchmark use cases, there are other situations in which it may be useful to identify the driver of a vehicle. Lending a vehicle to an employee, rental between private individuals or even self-service cars are all examples of uses that justify better identification of the driver.</p>



<p>These new uses require strong authentication of users using their smartphone, as well as identification of the smartphone by the vehicle. This begins as soon as the vehicle is delivered, where an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> check and biometric verification can be carried out, in order to associate a user with his or her account.</p>



<p>When a key is exchanged digitally with another user, it is necessary for the user to prove his or her identity. By going through the same identification and authentication process as the owner, both parties can optimize the security of vehicle access.</p>



<p>It is also possible to request an additional biometric element to reinforce authentication. For example, the use of biometric features such as facial recognition can add an extra layer of security, allowing the user to access their account in complete safety. Many modern smartphones are equipped with biometric sensors that can be used to authenticate the user before allowing them to unlock the vehicle. Even if an ill-intentioned person has the smartphone of the vehicle’s rightful owner, it will not be possible for him or her to gain access, or even worse, to start it.</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re helping to enhance the security of connected vehicles by offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">ID document verification</a> via our APIs, capable of handling over 3,000 ID documents from 195 countries. By leveraging the latest technologies in facial recognition and life detection, we are able to confirm the physical presence of the person during the verification process. By integrating these technologies and strategies, manufacturers and users of connected vehicles can ensure secure identification of users via their smartphones, minimizing the risk of fraud.</p>



 Anticipating future uses. 



<p>As vehicles become increasingly autonomous and integrated into our daily lives, reliable and secure identification systems are essential to protect drivers and their vehicles. Faced with these new uses, we need to think about security and identification, both on the user side and on the component side. Proactive measures will have a positive impact on users’ peace of mind and their confidence in connected cars.</p>

<p>In the first release of 2024 we have updated SSO Swedish BankID adaptor to enable the core Authentication Flow, utalising animated QR codes for all two device authentications. This modern specification helps to limit the potential phishing attacks through the use of continuously changing QR codes.</p>
<p>We have altered our CustomerID application to help reduce the potential of misconfigurations which could result in user invitations being sent repetitively if your PostgreSQL service were misconfigured or became unavailable.</p>
<p>We have also updated Tomcat, Redis, OpenLDAP and PostgreSQL to the latest possible versions for use with Identity Platform. Additionally, as RedHat7/CentOS 7 becomes end of life during 2024, we have updated our support to RedHat9/Rocky9.</p>
<p>For full details over the IDS 2024.1 release, please review the <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> and <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">System Recommendations</a> pages found on our Developer Portal. </p>
 Patch update: 
<p>SSO 9.4.1 – within this patch release we have updated the Mobile PKI (MPKI) service to fulfil current Traficom requirements. Additionally we have updated Tomcat to 9.0.87</p>
<p>CustomerID 6.4.1 – within this patch release we correct a coding error present when using SSO’s TOTP along with CustomerID’s ability to move users between Organisations. Prior to this patch, moving a user would result in errors and impact both LDAP and PostgreSQL databases. If you utalise TOTP and have CustomerID in active use, we encourage you to update to this patch version of CustomerID.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage all our customers to update to the latest available versions of software. For full details over our latest releases, please review the <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> and <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">System Recommendations</a> pages found on our Developer Portal.</p>

  <p>In the past few weeks, we’ve announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra External ID and Microsoft Entra ID multi-tenant collaboration.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One person, one license 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Included in the first announcement of more multi-tenant organization (MTO) features to enhance collaboration between users, we stated that only one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required per employee per multi-tenant organization. Expanding on that, the term “multi-tenant organization” has two descriptions: an organization that owns and operates more than one tenant; and a set of features that enhance the collaboration experience for users between these tenants. However, your organization doesn’t have to deploy those capabilities to take advantage of the one person, one license philosophy. An organization that owns and operates multiple tenants only needs one Entra ID license per employee across those tenants. The same philosophy applies to Entra ID Governance: the organization only needs one license per person to govern the identities of these users across these tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate this scenario, let’s consider an organization called Contoso, which owns ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys. Mallory is hired by Contoso, which uses Lifecycle Workflows in Entra ID Governance to onboard her user account and grant her access to the resources she needs for her job. Her account receives an access package with an entitlement to ZT Tires’ ERP app, and she requests access to Tailspin Toys inventory management app. Because Mallory has an Entra ID Governance license in the Contoso tenant, her identity can be governed in the ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys tenants with no additional governance licenses – one person, one license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Entra ID Governance in Microsoft Entra External ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other announcement covered Entra External ID, Microsoft’s solution to secure customer and business collaborator access to applications. In November, I&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579">blogged</a> about the licensing model to govern the identities of business guests in the B2B scenario for Entra External ID and shared that pricing would be $0.75 per actively governed identity per month. Because metered, usage-based pricing to govern the identities of business guests is a different model than the existing, licensed-based pricing model to govern the identities of employees, I’d like to share more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A business guest identity in Entra External ID will accrue a single $0.75 charge in any month in which that identity is actively governed, no matter how many governance actions are taken on that identity. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Contoso employee named Gerhart collaborates with Pradeep of Woodgrove Bank to produce Contoso’s quarterly financial statements. Contoso has deployed Entra External ID for its business partners such as Woodgrove Bank. In April, Pradeep accesses Contoso’s Microsoft Teams where Gerhart stores his quarterly reporting documents, but his Entra External ID has no identity governance actions taken on them, so it doesn’t accrue any charges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May, Pradeep receives an access package with an entitlement to Contoso’s accounting system, and Gerhart reviews Pradeep’s existing access to Contoso’s inventory management database, as well as to the Teams with the quarterly reporting documents. Because Pradeep’s identity in Entra External ID had identity governance actions taken on it, Contoso will accrue a $0.75 charge. Note that the charge is applied once, even though there were three identity governance actions taken during the month. Once that Entra External ID identity was governed in May, additional identity governance actions do not generate additional charges for that identity in May.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we had the pleasure of attending Identiverse 2024, the premier conference dedicated to identity and security. Now that we’ve had time to reflect, we’re excited to share our key takeaways from the event. Packed with insightful sessions, innovative workshops, and inspiring keynotes, Identiverse 2024 offered a wealth of knowledge and forward-thinking ideas that are shaping the future of digital identity.</p>
 Fundamentals of Passkeys 
<p>One of the standout sessions was on passkeys, which provided a comprehensive overview of FIDO passkeys, their flow, multi-device capabilities, and the evolution of the standard to support new functionalities. The demonstration of transferring 1Password passkeys to Dashlane showcased significant progress in passkey management flexibility. This interoperability is a game-changer, enabling users to move seamlessly between keychains and enhancing their overall experience. Additionally, Air New Zealand’s rapid adoption of passkeys was notable, with 25% of sign-ins using passkeys and a 30% opt-in rate within the first 24 hours. Such success stories underline the potential of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) in real-world applications.</p>
 Innovation Workshop: Overcoming Obstacles to Empower Innovators 
<p>This workshop addressed key challenges and innovative solutions in advancing identity and security. Inspired by a 2015 data breach affecting 21.5 million federal workers’ fingerprint data, the session emphasized the need for technologies that securely handle biometric data while preserving privacy. The concept of open innovation was also explored, particularly in industries with tight IP restrictions like healthcare and defense. Crowdsourcing platforms like InnoCentive were highlighted as tools to drastically reduce innovation time and effectively solve complex problems.</p>
 Opening Keynote: Andre Durand, Ping Identity 
<p>Andre Durand’s keynote was both engaging and thought-provoking, setting the tone for the conference. Durand highlighted the emerging crisis of deepfakes and the critical need for reliable identity verification solutions. He also emphasized the issue of repeatedly proving one’s identity across multiple systems and the necessity to address this fragmentation. The merging of verification and authentication processes was discussed, aligning well with identity-based authentication solutions. Durand stressed that protecting consumer reputation should be a top priority for identity professionals.</p>
 Keynote: Digital Identity at United Airlines 
<p>United Airlines provided insights into their advancements in integrating digital identity into their customer experience. One of the highlights was the Information Security team reporting to the Customer Success team, demonstrating the importance of combining security with a delightful user experience. The transition from security questions to Email &amp; SMS OTP for second-factor authentication was noted as a step forward, though it presents its own set of challenges. United Airlines is leading the way in embedding identity into every customer touchpoint, from personalized in-flight entertainment to recommending nearby flights during delays.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Identiverse 2024 was a resounding success, offering valuable insights and innovative solutions that will undoubtedly shape the future of digital identity. At 1Kosmos, we’re excited to implement these learnings and continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in identity and security.

 Overview <p>This challenge invites data scientists to analyze 40 years of French tax information, utilizing data collected in a project with the <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en">EU Commission’s Science Hub, the Joint Research Centre</a> (JRC). Held in collaboration with the JRC, known for its commitment to providing rigorous, evidence-based scientific and technical support to EU policymakers, this challenge presents a unique opportunity to examine extensive tax data to enhance data-driven decision-making. Participants will explore trends in municipal finances, develop predictive models, uncover correlations between population size and tax revenue, and assess the impact of tax policy changes on municipal revenues, aiming to offer valuable insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.</p> Objectives <p>Participants will conduct an in-depth exploration of the dataset, beginning with ranking municipalities by their tax revenue to identify those with the highest income from direct local taxes. It includes creating graphical representations to illustrate revenue trends in selected towns, enabling the drawing of meaningful conclusions from these visualizations. Additionally, the challenge extends to classifying municipalities based on their growth in tax revenues over various periods, investigating the relationship between population size and tax revenue, and assessing the impact of eliminating the professional tax collected before 2010. This comprehensive approach seeks to provide actionable insights into the fiscal management of French municipalities.</p> Data <p>We have meticulously prepared the dataset for this challenge, ensuring its efficiency for analysis. We aggregated French REI (<a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-national-des-elus/">Répertoire des Élus et des Institutions</a>) data files to create a comprehensive data pipeline. REI, a directory of elected officials and institutions in France, provides detailed information on French municipalities’ financial and administrative aspects. Originally a 3.6GB CSV file, we have transformed this dataset into a 0.6GB <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Parquet</a> file. Parquet’s columnar storage format allows faster data access, reduces file size, and improves query performance, making it particularly suitable for handling complex queries and large datasets. This meticulous preparation instills confidence in the quality of the data and provides participants with a powerful tool for their analysis.</p><p>We highly recommend using <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> to interact with the dataset and facilitate querying. DuckDB is a high-performance, in-memory database engine optimized for SQL querying on local machines. We have set things up for participants to use DuckDB at no cost and with minimal friction. This is not just a tool but an exciting opportunity to learn a new, efficient way of querying data for an ML model. This combination of Parquet and DuckDB ensures that participants can quickly and effectively analyze the data, gaining deeper insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.</p> Mission <p>The mission of the French Fiscal AI Innovation and Prediction Challenge is to leverage data science and machine learning to gain valuable insights into the fiscal dynamics of municipalities in general. This challenge aims to foster data-driven decision-making and enhance the understanding of municipal financial management.</p><p>Participants will engage in various tasks to contribute to evidence-based policymaking by offering actionable insights that can improve fiscal governance and public administration. This collaborative effort underscores the importance of rigorous, data-driven analysis in shaping effective policies. It seeks to empower data scientists to use their skills to make a tangible impact on society, promoting transparency, efficiency, and innovation in public financial management.</p> Rewards <p>We’re dedicated to acknowledging excellence and nurturing talent, so we’ve designed a reward system that celebrates top performers while motivating participants of all skill levels. With a prize pool of $15,000–50% larger than our regular challenges — distributed among the top 10 performers, our structure brings excitement and competitiveness to the 2024 championship. Not only do the top 10 contenders receive cash rewards, but they also accumulate championship points, ensuring an even playing field for both seasoned data scientists and newcomers alike.</p>Prize pool and 2024 Championship points distribution Opportunities <p>By engaging in this challenge, participants will showcase their #AI and #ML skills and play a crucial role in contributing to the broader goal of making European policies grounded in science. This collaborative effort between data enthusiasts and the JRC aims to generate actionable insights that will significantly aid in French municipalities’ effective governance and fiscal management. Your work, therefore, holds immense value and influence in shaping evidence-based policymaking.</p><p>But wait, there’s more! The top 3 performers in each challenge may have the opportunity to collaborate with Ocean on dApps that monetize their algorithms. What sets us apart?

<p>London, June 18, 2024 – Ahead of the busy summer betting period, IDnow, a leading identity verification provider in Europe, has seen a significant spike in the number of gambling customers requesting identity verification.</p>



<p>Between 14 and 16 June, IDnow saw a 750% increase in the number of players being verified with a European gambling operator [1]. The busiest sign-up day was 14 June, the day of the opening match of UEFA EURO 2024, which saw a much higher volume of verification requests than was seen during the 2022 World Cup. </p>



<p>This latest spike coincides with the lead up to the opening game of UEFA EURO 2024 on 14 June. During each country’s first game, IDnow is expecting these figures to stay at a high level. With that, an increased likelihood of bonus abuse, multi-accounting, underage gambling, money laundering and fake documentation.</p>



 Effective, compliant verification processes to onboard vast numbers of players 



<p>“The challenges operators face during major sporting tournaments are not necessarily any different to their regular daily compliance hurdles, but the sheer volume of new players from all around the world, coupled with increased activity is likely to cause issues for unprepared operators,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.<br><br>“EURO 2024 will be a huge opportunity for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling platforms</a>, new and old, so it’s essential they capitalize on the event, while safeguarding their players and their reputation. It’s important they have effective, compliant verification processes in place to onboard vast numbers of players as smoothly and safely as possible. Only when operators are confident they can verify accounts thoroughly, and onboard the right players during such busy period, will they be effective in fighting fraud.”</p>



<p>As global sporting events have such broad appeal, they often attract both casual and regular bettors. Combined with the convenience and accessibility that online platforms now offer, betting during these periods is getting increasingly popular. Indeed, betting during the 2022 World Cup increased by <a href="https://www.openbet.com/news/openbet-processes-more-than-200m-bets-during-the-world-cup">13 percent compared with the 2018 FIFA World Cup</a>.</p>



<p>Worryingly, the surge in gambling activity was seen on both regulated and unregulated sites. For example, in the UK alone, <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">250,000 people visited unregulated, black-market sites during the last World Cup</a> compared with just 80,0000 during the same time frame of the previous year.</p>



<p>Other key security concerns that are exacerbated by major sporting events, such as EURO 2024:</p>



  Increase in site traffic is often used by fraudsters as a smoke screen for nefarious activities. They may conduct identity theft, or attempt account takeovers by launching phishing attacks and cyberattacks on unsuspecting users.  Unsecured public Wi-Fi networks can pose a security risk when players log in to place bets. These networks are susceptible to interception by hackers, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive personal information and potential financial losses for both users and operators.  Rising rates of gambling fraud, with chargeback fraud a particularly common issue. While identity verification solutions can help verify the identity of users and detect fraudulent activity, preventing chargeback fraud requires additional measures, such as transaction monitoring and collaboration with payment processors to identify and block suspicious transactions in real time.  



<p>Although all global gambling platforms are likely to see an uptick in player onboarding, it will likely be European nations that share the same time zone as the tournament that will see the biggest increase in usage.</p>



<p>“Gaming operators in these particular regions must offer secure player onboarding, deposits and withdrawals, and conduct seamless Anti-Money-Laundering and age verification checks to help fight the expected proliferation of fraudulent activity in both the build up to EURO 2024 and throughout the tournament,” concluded Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk. </p>

<p>As enterprises shift from on-premises to cloud systems, hybrid cloud solutions have become essential for optimizing performance, scalability, and user ease. However, risks arise when poorly configured environments connect to the cloud. A compromised Microsoft Active Directory can fully compromise a synchronized Microsoft Entra ID tenant, undermining the integrity and trust of connected services.</p>  
<p>Researchers at Horizon3.ai <a href="https://www.horizon3.ai/attack-research/n0-attack-paths/on-prem-misconfigurations-lead-to-entra-tenant-compromise/">recently published a fascinating analysis</a> on how on-premise misconfigurations in hybrid Microsoft environments can be exploited by attackers using well-documented techniques. In this case, the attack chain can lead to full compromise of the Entra Tenant. In complex enterprise environments, such misconfigurations are all too common. It’s critical for security teams to understand the tactics attackers use and strategies to close these points of vulnerability. Here we take a closer look at the attack chain and offer some additional mitigation strategies.</p> 
 The Attack Chain  
 Using the NodeZero™ tool:

    &nbsp; 
      MITRE ATT&amp;CK Technique(s)   
      Attack Chain Step   
    
    
      1   
     <p>T1557.001</p>  
     <p>NBT-NS traffic from Host 1 is poisoned to relay a netNTLM credential to Host 2 — an SMB server that doesn’t require signing.</p>  
    
    
      2   
     <p>T1003.002, T1078.003</p>  
     <p>Host 2 SAM database dump exposes a local administrator credential that is reused on Host 3 and Host 4.</p>

     <p>HOST3$’s credentials used to perform an NTDS dump on another Domain Controller (DC2), discovering the credential utilized to sign Kerberos tickets for Azure cloud services when Seamless SSO is enabled.</p>

     <p>T1528</p>  
     <p>Entra Connect credential used to log into Entra tenant. Refresh token obtained for easier long-term access.</p>

     <p>T1087</p>  
     <p>Analysis of AzureHound data reveals on-premise user Global Administrator (EntraAdmin) within the Entra Tenant.</p>

     <p>T1098</p>  
     <p>Access granted to the Microsoft Graph cloud service, without being prompted for MFA, with Global Administrator privileges.</p>  
    
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fortunately, this hacking exercise was carried out by white hat pentesters. The researchers at Horizon3.ai noted that, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the company’s environment, it took the NodeZero tool only an hour to compromise the on-premises AD domain, and the associated Entra ID tenant was compromised in less than two hours.</p> 
 Prevention Strategies  
<p>The team at Horizon3.ai included a set of solid initial mitigation recommendations. These include:</p> 
  
  Prevent NTLM Relay: Disabling NBT-NS and enforcing SMB Signing would have prevented the initial access technique used, although other vectors can be used for initial domain access.&nbsp;  
  Use LAPS: Reuse of credentials for Local Administrators enabled key lateral movements that lead to the discovery of Domain Administrator credentials.&nbsp;  
  Treat Entra Connect as a Tier-0 Resource: Install Entra Connect on a non-DC server (with LAPS enabled) and adequately protected with an EDR solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Do not Use On-Premises Accounts for Entra Administrator Roles: Microsoft recommends limiting the number of Entra Administrators and their level of privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Further Critical Recommendations  
<p>In addition to those, we recommend specific strategies to close common security gaps in Microsoft Entra ID environments.</p> 
  
  Use HYPR as a complement to LAPS to ensure administrators access their devices and systems using a phishing-resistant authentication method.  
  Review and revise your PAM (Privileged Access Management) program. The Static Domain Admin password should be rotated after it is used / checked out. You should also reduce the viability of the Domain Admin Credential in Cache.  
  Use secure <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/single-sign-on-sso">passwordless SSO</a> methods such as HYPRspeed that don’t rely on shared secrets and instead leverage public key cryptography.  
  Enforce the use of phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> methods, such as HYPR, for privileged Entra users access.  
  Begin migration to Entra ID from legacy on-prem technology. While not a small project, it will reduce the threat model of older protocols that rely on hash/passwords.

  Name: Libby Brown<br>Team: Product Management<br>Based in: Seattle area   About Libby <p>I’ve been working in technology and product management for longer than I care to admit, the past 6 years of which were in Identity at Microsoft as product manager of the Microsoft Authenticator app, then all of our passwordless credentials for Microsoft Entra (formerly known as Azure Active Directory.) I really enjoyed working at that intersection of building new technologies in the identity and security ecosystems, and driving the adoption of those technologies by creating user experiences that were compelling both on an individual and organizational level.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming to SpruceID was just a “shift left” in my career, moving upstream in the identity lifecycle, moving to concepts that are earlier in their definition and implementation stages, while at a company still in its launch phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>As Product Manager, I see my role as setting the longer-term direction of the products we are building while staying grounded in the day-to-day details of what and how we deliver&nbsp; on customer promises today. I want to define who SpruceID’s customers are, what they need, and how we’ll meet them, then get everyone on board to deliver.&nbsp;</p> What do you find most rewarding about your job?&nbsp; <p>Startup life is amazing! I love the hustle, the energy, the pressure to deliver because everyone on the team has to play their part to make the whole company successful - it’s invigorating!&nbsp;</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Product (and program) managers need to be able to explore and understand a subject's big picture and then dive down to the nitty gritty details to be successful. Problem-solving and collaboration are also key skills—my current mantra is, “Yes, and….” as in, “Let’s say yes to the idea or challenge, and what else do we need to do to make it happen?” It’s in those discussions of how to do something that good ideas rise up, and the consensus is gained; that doesn’t happen if the first response is a No.&nbsp;</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>First, I’m still learning non-Microsoft tools - I doubt I will ever come to love Google Calendar – but after 2 decades of muscle memory, I’m beginning to leave Outlook behind.&nbsp;</p><p>I was reading the AAMVA Implementation Guide yesterday afternoon; digging into the W3C VCDM email digests earlier; and last week was refreshing my knowledge of NIST IAL levels. Learning is just a constant in this space, which is one of the reasons I love working on the bleeding edge of identity and security. If I ever find myself NOT learning, that’s when I know it’d be time to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>I was in Rio de Janeiro for our all-company meeting, my second week on the job. It was definitely one of my best onboarding experiences ever! It was a great way to meet everyone at once and learn folks’ roles and responsibilities. Also, being a part of big, foundational conversations we were having as a team helped me jump right into product management tasks when I returned home.&nbsp;</p> What's the best piece of advice you’ve received since starting your job here? <p>“Meet Everyone.” Each person at SpruceID has unique skill sets, so it’s been great to learn what those are and jointly figure out how to combine those capabilities to deliver great results.&nbsp;</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>I have done my job successfully when:&nbsp;</p>  customers know what SpruceID can deliver through our digital identity capabilities with the Credible platform;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Customers can realize the business value to their organization from digital credentials and&nbsp;  SpruceID has a long and lustrous roadmap to continue delivering features of value to our customers, existing and new.&nbsp;   What is your favorite part about working at SpruceID? <p>I love #startuplife! After a long time working in and around Microsoft, the direct control I have for driving product definition is wonderfully both terrifying and invigorating.&nbsp;</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time? I enjoy spending time with my kids. They’re at a fun age where they still want me to be a part of their activities. </p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?): HAHAHAHAHA—I am not a programmer, though I’ve spent my life around computers and technology. My first language was Basic, written on a Timex Sinclair computer and saved on an audio cassette. I built my first website via Notepad and FTP. I really didn’t advance in computer science much beyond that until I took an Intro to Programming class taught in Java this spring. </p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: A weeping willow - they love being near water and make perfect playgrounds and climbing gyms for children under their long boughs.&nbsp;</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Key Insights: 
 
 Germany’s approach to driving wallet adoption includes an innovation competition (“Funke”) and a consultation process with civil society. 
 Interoperability profiles, such as OpenID4VC and the Dutch Decentralized Identity Interoperability Profile (DDIP), aim to promote adoption and innovation by providing a common subset of technologies and specifications. 
 The role of big tech companies in providing mobile operating systems and browsers is a double-edged sword, enabling better user experiences but also raising concerns about control and data monetization. 
 Governments have a crucial role in setting regulations and fostering an equal playing field for all stakeholders in the digital identity ecosystem. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Governments can promote innovation and adoption by creating testbeds, innovation competitions, and consultation processes. 
 Interoperability profiles, updated in a cadence, can help organizations and vendors align on a common set of specifications and technologies, enabling interoperability. 
 Separating the roles of big tech companies as infrastructure providers (mobile operating systems, browsers) and product providers (wallets) can help address concerns about control and data monetization.

<div class='wrap'>

 We sit down with our Director of Global Regulatory and Government Affairs, Rayissa Armata and our&nbsp;Senior Architect, Sebastian Elfors to discuss collaboration, consortiums and the honor of being invited to join the European Blockchain Sandbox. 



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/consortium-crypto-assets-compliant-eu-regulations/">we revealed</a> that we had joined the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a> consortium, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="http://havn.network/">HAVN Network</a> and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the aim of creating a Web3-ready KYC and identity verification solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This initiative will enable Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets to become compliant with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer in Funds Regulation (TFR)</a>, which is part of the greater EU Anti Money Laundering Package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sounds relatively straight forward, right? Well, yes and no. New regulations mandate all crypto transactions to a) carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver and b) comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. The issue lies with CASPs also being required to comply with new rules regarding GDPR compliance, which stipulate that personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the consortium; each partner bringing its own strengths and areas of expertise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, Rayissa and Sebastian fill us in on how the project has been going since it was announced in February 2024.</p>



 As Web3 is still just an idea for a ‘new internet’, why did we decide to join the consortium to try and solve this ‘theoretical problem?’ Will this project be important for the future of payments, in particular in the crypto space? 



<p>Rayissa: Great question. Yes, there were several reasons why IDnow joined the consortium. For one, it is important to collaborate and to be able to adapt to new environments be it from a regulatory or technological perspective. Although concepts can be developed quickly, building the frameworks and ultimately achieving a usable product or service does not happen in a vacuum.</p>



<p>As you know, Europe established the crypto regulatory framework and licensing regime, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)</a> and the companion rule known as TFR, which applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. Due to be applied by the end of the year, TFR applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. For example, with transactions, TFR requires CASPs to store certain PII so it can be cross matched to verify information on the originator of the transferred funds and the beneficiary of the transfer. The consortium took on the challenge of how this information can be transferred on and off chain. These solutions not only address privacy concerns, KYC and interoperability but will enhance trust in a relatively new technology ecosystem.</p>



<p>Sebastian: One key objective with this project is to design and implement a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/"> KYC solution</a> that can be used when issuing credentials that are stored as SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) on a blockchain. Technically speaking, the consortium is using Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. Having said that, the SBTs must also be compliant with GDPR regulations, so the SBTs contain anonymous identifiers instead of PII  in clear text. If there is a need for an authority to verify the user’s identity, this can be done by requesting the initial KYC user information from walt.id in conjunction with IDnow.</p>



 What has the consortium been working on since February? Do you have any updates? 



<p>Sebastian: The consortium has spent the past four months testing the solution and refining the implementation with scalability for production purposes in mind. Long term archiving and retrieval of identity documents is one such topic. We have also presented and demonstrated the solution to several stakeholders, with very positive feedback.</p>



 
   
     
                     Preparing for the known: Operating in a world of crypto regulation. 
                      Download to discover how crypto exchanges can prepare for the brave new world of crypto regulation.&nbsp;  
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/whitepaper-crypto-regulation-uk/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Now onto the good news. The consortium’s Web3 Identification Solution (which will enable KYC and identity verification in the Web3 environment), has been selected to take part in the European Blockchain Sandbox. What is it and why is it important? 



<p>Rayissa: Let me share a little about the European Blockchain Sandbox initiative since we have already covered a little about the consortium’s aims and activities above. The European Commission provides various opportunities to introduce new solutions that meet European regulatory requirements, such as data sharing in the TFR. This European Blockchain Sandbox initiative is geared so that new use cases that involve DLT can be developed and tested. This Blockchain initiative began in 2023 and will continue until 2026.</p>



<p>Sebastian: We are proud and happy that our consortium has been selected to participate in the Sandbox. This is a way for IDnow to demonstrate blockchain-based solutions to EU legislators, and pinpoint how they can meet the relevant EU regulations for cryptocurrencies. In particular, the IOTA solution is targeted to comply with the upcoming TFR regulation and we are keen on proving how the product can meet those requirements.</p>



 Why is cross-collaboration so important for such a project? 



<p>Rayissa: The European Commission recognizes the need for collaboration and cooperation between public and private sectors. Part of the regulatory framework is to set requirements that address interoperability, innovation, security and user accessibility. Collaboration is key to enabling this set of requirements and we have many legal experts and technology-savvy developers guiding our project to build something new. IDnow has been at the forefront of good management, regulatory compliance and smart growth since we began and collaboration is a big part of our success.</p>



<p>Sebastian: In addition to the cross-collaboration with the EU Commission, we are also very proud of working with the IOTA-founded consortium. All parties contribute with cutting edge technologies: </p>



  IOTA provides the underlying network based on the IOTA Smart Contract Chain<br>  HAVN Network integrates hybrid blockchain technologies<br>  IDnow delivers the ID verification, prior to the tokenization into a SBT<br>  walt.id has developed the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs<br>  Bloom provides the digital wallet for storing and presenting the SBTs  



 How will our existing and future crypto clients, who use our solutions to onboard customers and process transactions, be able to benefit from the research and development that is going into the Web3 Identification Solution? 



<p>Rayissa: From a compliance perspective, CASPs will be able to use this solution to comply with national and European KYC and TFR requirements to share personal data between the originator and beneficiary of a specific transaction. This will enable trust in the crypto ecosystem and beyond in Web3 and use cases. There may not be a regulatory framework with set requirements for Web3 or Web4 applications, but trust brings growth and what a great opportunity for these environments to become more mainstream.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The solution developed by the IOTA solution has the potential to go beyond the realm of cryptocurrency transactions, which is the current scope of the project. The SBTs that are issued could also be used for digital identities in the Web3 metaverse, for example for identifying avatars purchasing NFTs such as digital paintings.</p>



 Will the Web3 Identification Solution be commercially available in the future? If so, which companies and industries will the product appeal to? 



<p>Rayissa: Yes, certainly that is a goal. We are already in discussions with our consortium members and external CASPs and companies specialized in IOT services.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The term Web3 was initially coined in 2014 by the Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood when he created the vision of a “decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain.” So yes, the Web3 Identification Solution can be used by all industries that have a need for digital identification. In addition to authentication for CASPs, totally different verticals such as the gaming industry could benefit from Web3 identification. Only the imagination sets the limits.</p>

 Introduction <p>The GitHub Developer Dynamics Challenge invited data enthusiasts, analysts, and crypto specialists to analyze the relationships between GitHub developer activity and token prices in crypto-AI projects. Participants examined a dataset encompassing repositories, commits, and historical price movements for tokens from Ocean Protocol, Bittensor, Fetch.AI, Numerai, and SingularityNET.</p><p>Participants analyzed correlations between developer engagement and token price fluctuations to determine if developer activity indicates project success. They focused on commit frequency and repository creation metrics, reflecting market dynamics and influencing investor decisions.</p><p>Through data processing, temporal analysis, and advanced statistical methods, participants uncovered patterns that reveal the interplay between development efforts and financial performance. This challenge highlighted participants’ analytical skills and provided insights into how developer activities impact market perceptions and financial metrics within the crypto&nbsp;space.</p> Podium and Top 10 Submissions <p>The top submissions for this challenge were truly impressive. Participants showcased remarkable abilities in utilizing data to explore the relationship between developer activity and token prices. Each participant provided valuable insights through detailed analysis and statistical modeling. Let’s look at the top ten submissions and explore the top three that stood out due to their comprehensive analytics and insightful conclusions.</p>Top 10 submissions for the GitHub Developer Dynamics challenge 1st Place:&nbsp;Anamaria <p>Anamaria’s <a href="https://arweave.net/LOYGCsF3I3R-39MtgXXcPav5yABXADnlClxA4YK8qXU">submission</a> analyzed the correlation between GitHub commits and token price movements using a dataset of over 20,000 commits. She found that a 10% increase in commits leads to an average of 2.5% increase in token price. Her analysis detailed how consistent development activity can positively influence market perceptions and token&nbsp;value.</p><p>Anamaria’s study revealed that the frequency of commits significantly impacts token stability during high volatility periods. She discovered that increased commit activity during these times reduces price swings by 15%. By examining the temporal patterns of commit frequency, Anamaria demonstrated how developer engagement can stabilize the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Her findings indicate a strong relationship between developer activity and market performance, suggesting that active project development can enhance investor confidence. This insight provides valuable information for project managers and investors in the crypto space. Anamaria’s work underscores the importance of continuous and visible development efforts in maintaining and growing token&nbsp;value.</p> 2nd Place:&nbsp;Ahan <p>Ahan’s <a href="https://arweave.net/sxOWXJrRRbaNhXLZAblAMW-YYKGONQDw5uvpx20INCI">submission</a> leveraged a comprehensive dataset to build predictive models analyzing the correlation between developer activity and token price movements. He focused on projects like Ocean Protocol and Fetch.AI, revealing a long-term positive correlation of 0.26 and 0.38 between cumulative commits and token prices. His analysis highlighted that a 25% increase in token prices often coincided with periods of heightened developer activity.</p><p>Ahan’s model achieved an accuracy rate of 87%, showcasing the predictive strength of his approach. He employed advanced statistical techniques to parse the data, identifying key trends and patterns. His work demonstrated that developer activity, measured through metrics like cumulative commits, can be a reliable indicator of token price movements, especially over longer time&nbsp;frames.</p><p>His findings underscore the potential of using developer activity as a predictor of market performance. Ahan’s insights provide valuable guidance for investors and project managers looking to gauge cryptocurrency projects’ health and future potential. By linking development efforts directly to market outcomes, his work offers a practical tool for strategic planning and investment decision-making in&nbsp;crypto.</p> 3rd Place:&nbsp;Malihe <p>Malihe’s <a href="https://arweave.net/ENHnlab52IN8wMkF5ho-3dDj4mK8yO99vhF9icxiyrs">submission</a> focused on the impact of developer engagement on token prices, analyzing a dataset covering multiple crypto projects. She identified that projects with sustained developer activity, such as SingularityNET, showed a long-term correlation of 0.40 between commits and token prices. Her analysis indicated that for every 100 additional commits per month, there was a predicted 3% increase in token&nbsp;price.</p><p>Malihe’s model demonstrated the importance of continuous development efforts in maintaining token value. She highlighted that consistent commitment activity is crucial for signaling project vitality to investors. Her study also emphasized that projects with active development teams tend to perform better in the market, reflecting a direct link between developer efforts and financial success.</p><p>Her findings provide valuable insights for project managers and investors in the crypto space. Malihe’s work suggests monitoring developer activity can offer predictive insights into token performance. By establishing a clear connection between development activity and market outcomes, her analysis supports the strategic importance of fostering active and engaged development communities within crypto projects.</p> Interesting Facts <p>Developer Activity Boosts Token&nbsp;Prices</p><p>Analyzing data showed that a 10% spike in GitHub commits can increase token prices by 2.5% on average. This demonstrates how crucial active development is in boosting market confidence and&nbsp;value.</p><p>Stability Through Active Development</p><p>During periods of high market volatility, frequent commits can reduce price swings by 15%. This finding suggests that active and ongoing development can help stabilize token prices even in turbulent times.</p><p>Engagement Correlates with Price&nbsp;Surges</p><p>Predictive models revealed a long-term positive correlation of 0.26 for Ocean Protocol and 0.38 for Fetch.AI between cumulative commits and token prices. Heightened developer activity often aligns with a notable 25% increase in token prices, showing the market’s positive response to active project engagement.</p><p>High Accuracy in Predicting Market&nbsp;Trends</p><p>The predictive model achieved an impressive 87% accuracy rate, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for forecasting token price movements based on developer activity. This level of accuracy provides valuable insights for investors.</p><p>Consistent Development Yields Long-Term Gains</p><p>Continuous development efforts pay off, as shown by a 3% increase in token prices for every additional 100 commits per month.

  Decentralized identity is gaining traction globally through diverse implementations and aligns with SpruceID's mission to empower users with control over their data.

<p>Decentralized identity is rapidly gaining momentum as an industry concept, with a growing number of live implementations. Its early roots were in pioneering projects like <a href="https://whitepaper.uport.me/uPort_whitepaper_DRAFT20170221.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">uPort</a>, appearances at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IIW</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Microsoft’s subsequent bet</a>, and its emergence as a hot topic at industry conferences like Identiverse and EIC. We see it in practice globally in the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California DMV Wallet</a>, the European Union Digital Identity initiative, and even digital pioneers like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/bhutans-national-digital-id-showcased-as-ssi-model-for-others?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Bhutan</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s easy to get confused because “decentralization” has become a buzzword for many new technologies. While its source of decentralization doesn’t need to come from blockchains or cryptocurrencies, decentralized identity is ultimately aligned with the objective of returning control to end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At SpruceID, we think about decentralized identity as systems built using the <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">issuer-holder-verifier model</a>, which achieves decentralization when open protocols are used such that any party can assume the role(s) of the issuer, holder, or verifier. These roles come with a clean separation of concerns that mitigate undesirable side effects, such as issuer “phone home” during holder usage. These systems can support either functional (“attributes”) or foundational identity. So, it’s decentralized in that we’re not forcing all digital identity-related interactions through one central control point; instead, peer-to-peer interactions are the default.</p><p>Starting with this definition, it’s easier to evaluate technical standards based on their core ability to support these interoperable capabilities, rather than indexing on affiliation with certain brands or use cases. For example, all the digital credential technologies mentioned in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EU ARF</a>, including W3C Verifiable Credentials, SD-JWTs, and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mobile driver’s license (mDL), can fit this definition of supporting decentralized identity depending on the implementation details. These can all also violate the definition depending on implementation details.</p><p>It’s worth noting that identity and credentialing systems are already more decentralized than you might realize. Even in the United States, DMVs do not have a monopoly on all forms of identification: other documents, such as passports or permanent residency cards, are widely accepted. Even utility bills and bank statements often play a role in verifying identity.&nbsp;</p><p>If we start with a decentralized landscape, a decentralized approach to the technology seems to make the most sense. Open digital standards for sharing this already broad plethora of credentials largely amount to bringing existing credentials together under one umbrella and opening the playing field for other issuers, whom verifiers can choose to trust or not, on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Already, verifiable digital credentials issued across state and federal bodies fall under different administrations, many of which don’t see eye-to-eye, even within the same agency. This doesn’t even scratch the surface of the complexities within the private sector—and an open system is the best way to accommodate that complexity.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at SpruceID, we believe the use of decentralized identity, under this definition, furthers our mission to let users control their data across the web (and beyond). We will continue to evaluate technologies and technical standards to ensure alignment with these capabilities and our organization’s values.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about how we are working to build decentralized identity, visit our <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Stablecoins — Inherently, Unfixably, Problematic  …And Why Gold on the Blockchain Makes Them&nbsp;Obsolete <p><a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum’s</a> partnership with <a href="https://sempsajp.com/">Sempsa JP</a>, one of the world’s oldest and most respected producers and distributors of precious metals, is enabling us to <a href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRvwLmRVxl">tokenize gold</a> through our German regulated exchange partner <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/07/23/announcing-swarm-x-mattereum-partnership/">Swarm</a> in quantity, giving investors immutable proof of ownership and provenance so that every token has a traceable, legally enforceable, connection to a specific gold bar in a named vault and warranties relating to its provenance and other qualities, legally valid in 170 countries worldwide. To make it even easier to put gold, or any other high value asset on chain, the Mattereum group, through its German subsidiary Mattereum GmbH has a discount token, <a href="https://mattereum.de/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marsmatr">MATR*</a>, on sale through Swarm. This gives anyone onboarding assets a discount of up to 50% on their onboarding fees, which is significant when you are talking about gold&nbsp;bars.</p><p>With other forms of tokenized gold, the value of the token is backed by gold that remains in the ownership of the token issuer, and you just have to trust that it’s there. With Sempsa gold as an NFT, backed by a Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP), the token buyer indisputably owns the gold to which the token is bound, and their claim to it is enforceable by international law in over<a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english"> 170 jurisdictions</a>. This combines the solidity and value of owning a physical gold bar with the convenience, speed and flexibility of selling NFTs. No more needing to have bars lugged from the seller’s vault to the purchaser’s vault, no more complex paperwork, no more hassle. This is new, this is revolutionary, and it has the potential to kill stablecoins stone&nbsp;dead.</p><blockquote>It has the potential to kill stablecoins stone&nbsp;dead</blockquote><p>How so?</p><p>Stablecoins exist because they claim to offer the convenience of being blockchain tokens, but with the kind of stability that Bitcoin can’t provide, through being pegged to a currency, usually the US dollar, so that the stablecoin always has a set dollar value that doesn’t fluctuate — pegging (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegging_(sexual_practice)">unfortunate term</a> [nsfw!], I know, but given the nature of stablecoins, maybe not inappropriate). As a result, they are meant to act as stable repositories of value against Bitcoin’s wildly fluctuating price. It is not uncommon for speculators who have reaped vast profit from Bitcoin fluctuations to cash out and put the earnings into stablecoin to hold onto the profits instead of trading it in for fiat and putting it in a&nbsp;bank.</p><p>So why is tokenized gold better? Why does it make stablecoins dead men walking? Well, for a start, stablecoins are not stable. We’ve already seen that can happen when stablecoins go wrong and depeg, and it was ugly. When TerraUSD and LUNA did it in 2022, it wiped out billions of dollars in value, and there were <a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/moody_launches_new_digital_asset_monitor_to_track_risk">more than 600 fiat-backed stablecoin depegs </a>in 2023 alone. Not so&nbsp;stable.</p><blockquote>There were <a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/moody_launches_new_digital_asset_monitor_to_track_risk">more than 600 fiat-backed stablecoin depegs </a>in 2023&nbsp;alone</blockquote><p>Tokenized gold done through <a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum</a> so that it legally bonds the token to a named gold bar — one bar, one token — can’t depeg, it creates a StableNFT that is massively more solid than any stablecoins. Faced with this innovation, stablecoins are already dead, they just haven’t realized it&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Let’s dig into that a bit more. So how do you make a stablecoin? Somebody gives you $1 You put the dollar in the bank. They ask for the dollar back, you take the dollar out. Okay, great. That’s fine. How’d you make a living? Well, option one is the bank pays interest, which means it’s lending that money out. And you hoped the bank is stable and doesn’t lend the money to the wrong people. Maybe that’s fine. Maybe it’s not. Option two is to charge transaction fees like Mattereum does on the gold. You give us the gold. We charge a fee. That means that we’re not doing anything stupid with gold. In the meantime, we just hold on to it, we don’t move it, and that costs us some money and we charge that to you. Option three is you give me that dollar and I go and put it into the lowest risk legitimate investment instrument — one of these index funds type things. Now the thing that I told you is worth $1 is correlated to the stock market and if the stock market crashes we’re both toast, but if the stock market booms you get your dollar back and I get to keep all the upside. Then you imagine option three, but with shitcoins, and that’s a stablecoin, and the very, very large providers of stablecoins have problems, because that model is inherently problematic, inherently unfixably problematic; Tether has horrible, horrible lockbox issues. Nobody really knows what’s going on in there. Then USDC had a bunch of money in Silicon Valley Bank. If Silicon Valley Bank had not been bailed out by the US government, they might have had really serious problems — it turns out that they had about<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/13/usdc-stablecoin-regains-dollar-peg-after-silicon-valley-bank-induced-chaos/"> 8% of their reserves</a> in that single financial institution, but no one owning USDC knew that until the bank hit trouble. So stablecoins are highly opaque. They’ve proven that they have interdependence with the global financial system and so are inherently volatile. Plus, there may or may not be issues of mismanagement that can be discovered at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>So, OK, you could say, that’s why we have central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). They are stablecoins, but unlike the privately issued stablecoins I’ve been talking about above, they are issued by a central bank so are no more likely to depeg than the money in your pocket (I am assuming some of you still use actual cash there). Well, yes, but these still have problems that make gold bound stable NFTs a better option. Like the dollar or pound, or whatever currency you choose, any CBDC linked to those is going to suffer the same problems with inflation that steadily erodes their value, at 2–3% inflation a year, which is less than recent rates, it doesn’t take long for a CBDC to have a fraction of the buying power it once did. Not so with gold, gold value, as I said, is steadily going up, and a stable NFT for a gold bar is going to do the same, so it’s still better than a CBDC stablecoin.</p><p>The core problem with privately issued stablecoins is a lack of transparency because you cannot see exactly what your stablecoin is backed by — that is proprietary information to these guys. But this proprietary information is what you would need to have full insight into a stablecoin and be able to do a full analysis and be sure what you were getting for your dollar. It’s not like it’s a small pool of these things — there’s $140 billion in them. What I’m suggesting is that the first criteria that you want for a stable instrument is staggering, bright side of the moon, black and white photography levels of clarity. You want a zero atmosphere full daylight shot of where the underlying asset is. With an on chain gold StableNFT backed by a MAP, that’s what you get. It’s this chunk of solid gold; it’s got this number; it’s in this building here. You own&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>You cannot see exactly what your stablecoin is backed by — that is proprietary information to these&nbsp;guys</blockquote><p>In theory, that could be a dollar in a central reserve bank account instead. You can have an account with the US Federal Reserve Bank — you could just say there’s a million dollars in the Fed and million tokens one to one, here’s your deal. You could have a situation where you have an absolutely transparent portfolio. We can say we own a single thing and it is backed with a BlackRock index fund and for every dollar you give us we buy BlackRock index fund; here’s an audit report that says this is exactly what we own. We own 151,000 shares and our current market value x that is more than your reserve. Have a nice day. You could use gold and then it would be dollar price, gold, you give us $1 — we buy gold, when we can show you that there is enough money in the portfolio. We like the gold option, anything even remotely tied to dollars loses value due to inflation. Gold doesn’t — in 1929, ten gold bars would buy the average house, and today, ten gold bars will still buy you the average&nbsp;house.</p><blockquote>Anything even remotely tied to dollars loses value due to inflation. Gold&nbsp;doesn’t</blockquote><p>There’s no reason that you couldn’t use any single appreciating asset in a very simplistic way. If your asset value goes up, your investment goes up, and if it goes down, so does your investment. What you wouldn’t get with that is any of the fancy schmancy obfuscated hedge fund stuff, where if that asset went down, you are meant to have something else in the portfolio that would go up. Everything balances and you aren’t supposed to lose money, and, hopefully, you gain some. But as soon as we go down that path, we wind up a highly opaque hedge fund that sells portfolios, which are being used to theoretically secure value in an asset that is not supposed to go up and down. So basically, the suggestion here is that you either pick one thing and your stable coin goes up and down to that one thing, or you pick a basket of things and they’re connected by super complicated maths and you have to pray that that thing is stable, and that’s what the grown ups are supposed to do. However, those grown ups are called hedge fund operators. And hedge funds implode all the time. So if you’re going to pick one thing and anchor to that thing, it should either be something like $1 in a Federal Reserve Bank Account, or it could be an index fund object, or it could be something like US Treasury bonds, or it could be a gold brick, but these are the kinds of assets which have extraordinary ease of audit. And then at that point, you either have a token attached to a very large very non-transparent bucket of things or you have a token which is directly attached to a thing which is extremely audited. These are your two&nbsp;choices.</p><p><a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum </a>has made it easy to have a token directly attached to an asset which is extremely audited. The MAP enables a firm legal binding between the asset and the token, so that ownership is solid and provable. The asset we believe is the absolute best to bind to is gold, so that is what we have done, and we are looking to grow the gold ecosystem, we’re building to increase opportunities for token buyers to own something that really is stable and acts as a repository of value. Also, Gold is steadily going up in value, dollars are getting eaten by inflation, even without all the underlying horrors lurking in stablecoins. The whole sector is just awaiting a deeply horrible, value-incinerating implosion, it’s only a matter of time before something blows away the whole house of cards and reveals the ‘stable’ in stablecoin to be wishful thinking. With the alternative that Mattereum’s gold-bound StableNFTs offer, why take that risk? Do you want to hang around and get pegged by your stablecoins?</p><p>Stablecoins are truly dead in the water for those who have eyes to see.

				  Your health data is important. You should be aware of how it is stored, shared, and who has access to it. This information is even more critical for athletes, as their health data is in demand and can cost them opportunities and potentially millions of dollars.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio recently hosted an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQsWQPrf1o">in-depth discussion on athlete health data</a> featuring <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/honor-data-rights-management/">HONOR Data Rights Management</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristyagale/">Kristy Gale</a> that includes a great breakdown and thorough examination of this topic. We highly encourage you to give it a watch or a listen if you have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Problem:</p>
<p>Athletes, particularly student athletes, are the source of a lot of data. Health, biometric, and even tracking data are all collected by teams, medical services, and wearable devices that the athletes use to monitor their workouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this data is gathered, used, and often shared without the athlete’s consent. Recruiters can get their hands on a surprising amount of data that you would think would be private, for example, how many times a player has sprained their ankle or visited the onsite medical team. They do this through legal loopholes or by going directly to the healthcare provider without the athlete’s knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple truth is that gaps in current laws and business practices leave sensitive health data open for third parties to access. While athletes feel the effects the most, everyone should be able to know who can access their data. We need a technical solution that puts control of the data back into the hands of athletes and everyday people.</p>
<p>How Verifiable Credentials can help:</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable credentials</a> are a technology that allows for a packet of information to be created using a decentralized ledger and securely stored on an end user’s mobile device. By storing the information in this way, you can be sure that the data is only shared with whoever the end user chooses, and by creating the package in this decentralized manner, you can be sure that the end user does not have the ability to change the information inside.</p>
<p>When it comes to athlete health data, all of the data they are creating, including statistics, physiological performance, evaluations, biometric data, tracking data, and more, can all be issued to the athlete as a tamper-proof credential. This accomplishes a few things:</p>
<p>1. It removes liability from teams, colleges, medical providers, and anyone who used to store this data.</p>
<p>2. It gives the athlete complete control over the information. It can still be shared with any party that needs to see it, but now they need to ask the data owner, who can choose to share all or just specific parts of the data.</p>
<p>3. All the data is now in one convenient place, no need to track down all the sources of the information when it is requested.</p>
<p>4. The data can be assumed to be as trusted as the source. The user doesn’t need to waste time double checking or verifying with the issuing party because any changes to the data would be visible on the decentralized ledger and “break” the credential.</p>
<p>5. The data can be easily shared with trusted partners, such as an agent for an athlete, who can share it on the athlete’s behalf if necessary.</p>
<p>By providing information in this new, technical way, we give control over their data back to the athletes. Not only do they have legal recourse should they find out their data has been misused, but they can also stop their data from being wrongfully shared at the point of request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find this topic interesting and would like to learn more about how athlete data is currently collected, held, and shared, the recent <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=bqQsWQPrf1o">Indicio Meetup</a> on this subject is a great place to start.</p>

 A Deep Dive to ZKPs and Decentralized Technology with Extrimian 



<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital identity management, privacy and security are paramount. <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/" title="">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> stand out as a revolutionary technology, enabling the verification of claims without revealing underlying data. Extrimian is at the forefront, integrating ZKPs into decentralized digital identity systems to offer unmatched security and privacy.</p>



 Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs 



<p>Zero Knowledge Proofs are a form of cryptographic protocol that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This technology is particularly potent for privacy-preserving digital interactions.</p>



 Key Concepts of ZKP: 



 
 Completeness: If the statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an honest prover. 



 Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability. 



 Zero-knowledge: If the statement is true, no verifier learns anything other than the fact that the statement is true. 
 



 Extrimian’s Application of ZKPs in Digital Identities 



<p>Extrimian harnesses the power of ZKPs to enhance the security and privacy of digital identities. By using ZKPs, Extrimian allows users to authenticate and share their credentials without exposing any sensitive personal information.</p>



 Example of ZKP in Action: 



 <code>const { zkSnark, generateProof, verifyProof } = require('extrimian-zkp-toolkit');

// Setup: A simple example where a user proves they are over 18 without revealing their age.
const { proof, publicSignals } = generateProof({
    age: 21,
    lowerBound: 18
});

// Verification: The verifier checks the proof without ever knowing the user's exact age.
const isValid = verifyDetails({
    proof,
    publicSignals
});

console.log(isValid);  // Output: true</code> 



 



<p>This simple code snippet demonstrates how a user can prove they meet the age requirement without revealing their exact age, using Extrimian’s ZKP toolkit.</p>



 Practical Use Cases of ZKP in Decentralized Digital Identity 



<p>ZKPs empower several practical applications in decentralized identity systems:</p>



 
 Privacy-Enhanced Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves to services without revealing any unnecessary personal information, thus enhancing privacy. 



 Credential Verification: Verify the authenticity of credentials without exposing the underlying data, useful in scenarios like employment verification or accessing restricted services. 



 Fraud Prevention: Secure systems against fraudulent claims and transactions by enabling entities to prove the legitimacy of their actions without revealing sensitive data. 
 



 Extrimian’s Integration and Benefits 



<p>At Extrimian, we integrate ZKPs within our digital identity solutions to provide:</p>



 
 Enhanced Privacy: Users have complete control over their personal information. 



 Increased Trust: Entities can trust the verification process without accessing private data. 



 Scalability: ZKPs allow for complex operations to be conducted without a significant increase in transaction costs or delays.

<p>Last week, SpruceID attended the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) in Berlin, an event that brings together industry leaders, innovators, and experts to discuss and explore the latest advancements in digital identity and cloud security.</p><p>This year, SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang was among the panelists contributing to three in-depth discussions on the evolving landscape of decentralized identity. These panels provided a comprehensive overview of how decentralized identity can help mitigate modern threats and enhance trust in digital ecosystems in today’s world.</p> Panel: Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>One of our most anticipated sessions was the panel "Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity." This session focused on the pressing issues posed by AI technologies and brought together Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and Linda Jeng, founder of Digital Self Labs.</p><p>In this talk, Wayne highlighted the increasing risks of traditional identification methods in the face of sophisticated AI technologies. He pointed out, “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech, you can fool these systems — this is already showing up at the edges. ” He emphasized the rise in phishing attacks utilizing AI-generated voices that can convincingly mimic trusted individuals, making it easier for scammers to deceive victims.</p><p>The panelists discussed how decentralized identity could offer solutions to these emerging challenges. Wayne explained, “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed decentralized identity into comms channels to prove I’m real.” Decentralized identity is not only about identity but also about establishing data governance and creating chains of trust to mitigate risks from synthetic data. This approach empowers individuals with greater control over their data.</p><p>They touched on the promising developments in automated compliance with data regulations and the potential for expanding trust to content authenticity. They emphasized the need for ongoing education and the role of user demand in driving the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. In Linda Jeng’s words, “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end, it comes down to end-user demand for solutions.”</p><p>Read more about the discussions that took place during this panel in the blog post published by the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/building-trust-in-ai-through-decentralized-identity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p> Panel: Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>In the Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A session, Anil John, Technical Director of the DHS S&amp;T Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, introduced the newest cohort members of SVIP, including SpruceID. Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, engaged in a Q&amp;A with digital wallet solution providers and industry experts from other SVIP cohort members, including Hushmesh, Procivis AG, Ubiqu, Netis, and Credence ID. The discussion focused on the practical aspects of integrating digital identity into digital wallets and verifiable credential systems. It covered a range of topics, including the challenges and opportunities in implementing decentralized identity, the role of verifiers in ensuring trust and security, and the potential for digital wallets to enhance user privacy and data control.&nbsp;</p><p>Panelists emphasized the importance of interoperability and user-centered design in developing digital wallet solutions, which are crucial for securely and conveniently managing digital identities and credentials.</p> Panel: Decentralized Identity in Production <p>Our final panel, "Decentralized Identity in Production," explored the practical applications of verifiable credentials and the integration of decentralized identity into production environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne, along with panelists from Condatis, Adobe, Spherity, and Accenture, shared valuable insights and experiences on the business case for decentralized identity, highlighting key success factors and lessons learned from recent projects and discussing how verifiable credentials have been effectively integrated into workforce certifications, supply chain documentation, and educational qualifications, demonstrating enhanced trust achieved through decentralized identity. </p><p>The panelists emphasized key success factors in project learnings, product roadmaps, and the future direction of decentralized identity, and they encouraged attendees to explore practical applications for decentralized identity technologies within their organizations.</p> Continuing the Conversations on Decentralized Identity <p>We're grateful to have been invited to speak on several panels alongside other experts in the field at this year's event. </p><p>SpruceID is excited to be at the forefront of these important discussions and committed to advancing the development and adoption of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to continuing these discussions and working with partners and stakeholders from EIC!</p><p>Check out our website to learn more about how SpruceID uses decentralized identity to build a more secure and trustworthy digital future.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Healthcare organizations face unique challenges, including security concerns, complex regulatory requirements, and the necessity to provide seamless user experiences for consumers, employees, and partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unified Identity and Access Management (IAM) has emerged as a critical solution to these issues. A unified IAM strategy integrates various identity and access management functions, such as identity verification, identity governance and administration (IGA), identity management (IDM), access management (AM), identity orchestration, and fraud and risk solutions into a single platform. As a result, unified IAM streamlines identity processes across multiple healthcare IT systems, applications, and environments. </p>

				  When it comes to phishing, financial institutions and their customers are targeted <a href="https://www.stationx.net/phishing-statistics/">more often than others</a>. Digital credentials solve this problem and provide customers with a better user experience when logging into their bank accounts.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Phishing is where someone pretends to be from an organization you know and requests information from you that allows them to steal your login data. This might be in the form of an email requesting that you reset your password, a text message, or even a phone call.</p>
<p>Phishing is on the rise because it works: <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/the-history-of-phishing/">22% of data breaches</a> can be attributed to phishing.</p>
<p>Phishing in finance</p>
<p>In finance, phishing often involves someone pretending to be a customer trying to retrieve their account details by contacting their bank. Bank call centers receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">thousands of deepfake calls per year</a>, wasting time and resources, and requiring vigilance on the part of the employee to spot the scams and stop the call. As deepfake technology becomes more dynamic this will be much harder for a human to do.</p>
<p>The other common vector for phishing attacks is that of a scammer pretending to be a bank. Financial institutions are the <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/list/4-things-bankers-need-to-know-about-phishing">most impersonated organizations</a> by scammers. These attacks often come via an email, text, or even a call from the bank saying that there is something wrong with the customer’s account and they need to log in immediately. Unfortunately, the link provided by the scammer will steal the personal account information of the customer when they try to use it.</p>
<p>Stop phishing with verifiable credentials and decentralized identity</p>
<p>The reason phishing works is because there is currently not a good way for identifying who people claim to be online. Passwords and logins are prone to being lost, stolen, or copied, and even assuming they are secure, they are only effective in one direction — when the customer is trying to reach out to the bank. If a bank, or someone pretending to be the bank, tries to reach out to the customer, due diligence is required on the customer’s part to make sure the message is authentic.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity solves this problem. A bank can be absolutely certain that an account holder really is an account holder, and an account holder can be absolutely certain that they are interacting with their bank —&nbsp;and this mutually assured authentication is proven instantaneously by cryptography, and occurs before any information is shared.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>A bank customer’s digital wallet software is able to create a secure communications channel directly with their bank. The customer’s wallet creates a decentralized identifier (a DID) and uses this DID to connect to their bank’s DID. DIDs enable public key cryptography.</p>
<p>Each party uses the other party’s cryptographic keys to send encrypted messages to each other. Only the bank can decrypt the message sent by the customer because the customer has encrypted a message with the bank’s key; only the customer can decrypt the bank’s message because the bank has used the customer’s key to encrypt its message.</p>
<p>In reality, this is instantaneous. But it means that when a customer uses a DID to connect to their bank and then presents a verifiable credential for their bank account, the bank knows its their customer. It is more effective than adding multi factor authentication because it doesn’t require customers to jump through hoops, allows both parties to verify who they are interacting with, and even enables <a href="https://indicio.tech/passwordless-login-will-soon-be-the-norm-for-bank-accounts-financial-institutions/">passwordless login</a> by default.</p>
<p>To learn more about how this all works you can <a href="https://youtu.be/DE2gFx-msuE">see demonstrations of the technology in action</a>.</p>

<blockquote>“We appreciate the patience of the community and look forward to a combined $ASI token that is supported by all partners, exchanges and token holders.”</blockquote><p>Zug and Singapore — June 11, 2024 — The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is dedicated to the successful and seamless integration of our anticipated token merger. SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol have today announced a revised date for the ASI token merger, moving from June 13, 2024, to July 15,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>This schedule adjustment is necessary to accommodate the logistical requirements and technical dependencies of exchanges, validators, and broader ecosystem collaborators. The preparation phase for the token merger involves managing complex integrations, careful coordination, and attention to numerous moving parts. These third-party dependencies are critical to the smooth execution of the token merger process and ensuring that all stakeholders’ needs are adequately met is paramount. While this delay is unfortunate, it is a strategic decision to ensure the token merger is carried out with the highest standards of accuracy and efficiency.</p><p>Token Merger Schedule:</p>  Originally, the plan was for FET to be renamed to ASI today, June 11, followed by the token merger on June&nbsp;13.  On July 15th, FET, AGIX and OCEAN will merge into the new ASI&nbsp;token.  <p>Token Merger&nbsp;Steps:</p>  Current Status: The existing FET, AGIX and OCEAN tokens will continue to trade on exchanges independently.  Future Steps: Once third-party integrations are finalized, the ASI token will be launched and FET, AGIX and OCEAN will cease to trade independently and merge to the ASI&nbsp;token.  <p>Support and Guidance:</p>  Support will be provided on the official FET, AGIX and Ocean channels as well as the ASI&nbsp;channel.  Token contracts, migration contracts and all possible audits will be shared this&nbsp;week.  <blockquote>“While the finalization of the ASI token merger is now scheduled for July due to necessary adjustments by our partners, the commitment and vision driving this alliance remain stronger than ever,” said Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai and chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. “This temporary delay does not impact the substantial progress we have made towards creating a decentralized superintelligence network. Our teams are actively working with centralized exchanges to finalize the remaining steps. We appreciate the continued support and patience of our community and stakeholders as we work through these final logistical steps.”</blockquote><blockquote>“While working through the complexities of executing this unprecedented tokenomic merger,” noted Ben Goertzel, founder and CEO of SingularityNET Foundation and CEO of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, “we have at the same time been advancing toward integration of our respective AI and blockchain technologies. The finalization of the 3-way tokenomic merger on July 15 will be a major milestone, and we anticipate a series of progressively more exciting milestones after that as we leverage our $ASI token based network to move toward increasingly capable AI systems and in time actual superintelligence.”</blockquote><blockquote>“We appreciate the patience of the community and look forward to a combined $ASI token that is supported by all partners, exchanges and token holders.” Added Bruce Pon, founder and CEO of Ocean Protocol and board director in the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;Council.</blockquote><p>Token holders are assured that no action is required on their part at this time. The ASI token merger remains firmly on track and no further delays are anticipated.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/artificial-superintelligence-alliance-announces-revised-timeline-for-token-merger-42d8bea9885e">Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Announces Revised Timeline for Token Merger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  This easy-to-understand comparison of single-tenant and multi-tenant cloud SaaS architectures will help you determine which is right for you.

<p>One type of cloud architecture is not necessarily better than another. When deciding between single-tenant vs. multi-tenant architecture, your organization's specific needs should determine the deployment type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To demonstrate how these two architectures work, let’s consider the familiar experience of looking for a place to live. Specifically, let’s pretend you’re trying to decide whether to buy a home or rent a house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you like the layouts of apartment buildings you’ve toured, don’t mind sharing common walls, and think your life would be easier if things like maintenance, pest control, and landscaping were done for you, then having your own dedicated space as a tenant within a multi-tenant complex might be the right choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to customize your space, knock down walls, put in a new kitchen, fill your yard with apple trees, and enjoy the safety, security, and responsibility that come with maintaining and protecting your own domain, then a single-family home, where you’re the dedicated tenant, may be a better choice for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like someone searching for a place to call home, deciding between single-tenant and multi-tenant architecture requires considering what you want to do with the space once you move in. As you’ll learn below, the choice to go either way depends on a variety of factors.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that guidance for SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers planning to migrate their identity management scenarios to Microsoft Entra is now available. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-and-sap-collaborate-to-modernize-identity-for-sap/ba-p/4056600">previous post</a>, we discussed SAP ending maintenance for their identity management solution (SAP IDM) by 2030.&nbsp;We've since begun jointly developing documentation to help customers plan a seamless migration to the recommended alternative—Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;For many customers, it may be possible to get started immediately, leveraging the subscriptions that they already own with Microsoft 365 suites. Microsoft 365 enterprise suite licenses include Entra ID P1 features that will be the focus of this first round of guidance.&nbsp;In this post, we’ll also outline additional benefits of Microsoft Entra ID and list some key partners who can help you get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Continuing collaboration for enterprise security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP have a long history of collaborating to keep our customers’ organizations productive and secure—an effort especially important now as more companies have adopted hybrid work arrangements, making it possible to work from office and from home. For example, last year we announced how Microsoft Sentinel is helping organizations bring&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/revolutionize-your-sap-security-with-microsoft-sentinel-s-soar/ba-p/3823857">SOAR threat monitoring capabilities to their SAP environments</a>. We continue to deepen our relationship, and now we’re extending support for SAP customers’ digital transformation and cloud adoption goals with a seamless and secure identity management solution in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing the first set of&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/MigrateFromSAPIDM">guidance to migrate from SAP IDM to Entra ID</a>. SAP customers who are using SAP IDM for cloud and on-premises applications like SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Identity Services, or Windows Server Active Directory can begin to use Microsoft Entra features such as Conditional Access to enforce Zero Trust access policies, and automatic provisioning that ensures users have the accounts they need for their job role. For SAP IDM customers who want more guidance on advanced IAM integrations, such as with Micosoft Entra ID Governance or external IDs, for example, we’re developing additional in-depth guidance on each of those areas that will be published later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modernizing your security strategy and moving toward a Zero Trust framework is not an overnight process, so we recommend customers start their journey to adopt cloud services and gain productivity and security benefits.&nbsp;Therefore, we’ve included guidance for migration of the most common scenarios, including:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft and SAP will continue to enhance Microsoft Entra ID and deliver deeper integrations with SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance.&nbsp; As new scenarios become available, we’ll provide ongoing updates to this&nbsp;guidance, incorporating customer and partner feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern identity management is a strategic investment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progressive organizations are switching to cloud-based identity solutions. Older systems, designed for on-site environments, fail to satisfy the demands of the modern cloud-first, mobile, decentralized workforce. Additionally, they can be expensive, complicated, and susceptible to security risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that multifactor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on methods&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW166lD?culture=en-us&amp;country=us">can reduce password breaches by 99.9%</a>, but the benefits of a cloud-based solution in Microsoft Entra ID extend beyond just a stronger security posture. Optimized operational efficiency allows identity teams to do more impactful work and an improved user experience makes the entire organization less frustrated. By moving to Microsoft Entra ID, the benefits of your strategic investment continue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for SAP and non-SAP apps and systems—both on-premises and cloud&nbsp; 
 Rich set of APIs, SDKs,&nbsp;and connectors for customization&nbsp; 
 Minimized vendor footprint&nbsp; 
 Reduced costs and complexity&nbsp; 
 Help meeting identity-related requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>Modernizing identity management is key to boosting organizational security and shielding users and assets from the most common security threats. It’s more than just a cybersecurity measure; it also enhances user experience and operational efficiency. Generative AI, Zero Trust security, decentralized identity, and the flexibility to tailor access policies to exactly match your unique needs and demands offer compelling opportunities to better protect&nbsp;your apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Partner network ready to help 
<p>&nbsp;<br>We’ve also been working with a set of key partners to help organizations begin their migrations, including some with long-term experience in Microsoft/SAP environments. </p>

<p>In response to a recent FDS incident, we have deployed a hotfix to our blockchain explorer, Aergo Scan, enhancing its security and transparency. Looking ahead, we are preparing for a comprehensive hard fork scheduled for next month, aimed at introducing broader systemic improvements and new functionalities. This article will outline the recent updates and preview what to expect from the upcoming&nbsp;changes.</p> Updates on Aergo&nbsp;Scan <p>In anticipation of the Aergo V4 hard fork, we have introduced a new feature to Aergo Scan, the Internal Transaction UI (Beta version). This enhancement, inspired by similar features in the Ethereum Explorer, enables users and network participants to track detailed histories related to addresses and transactions effortlessly.</p><p>This is just a glimpse of what the Aergo V4 hard fork will bring, including the full implementation of internal transaction logging to increase transparency across all transactional histories. Additionally, contract sources will be stored and compiled directly on-chain, facilitating easy access and reference.</p> Upcoming Hard Fork to Aergo&nbsp;V4 <p>The Aergo V4 hard fork is focused on several key objectives:</p>  Enhancing Transparency: <br>- We are committed to increasing the Aergo mainnet’s transparency for both developers and users, fostering a more trustful environment.  Adopting a “White-Box” Model: <br>- This new model will enhance the transparency and readability of contracts and transactions, benefiting both current and future applications.<br>- The new data model will prep Aergo for applications on Machine Learning and Small and Large Language Model integration”  <p>The new features for Aergo V4 include the following:</p>  Internal transaction logging:<br>- Provides increased transparency for complex contracts that interact with each other.<br>- Essential for future developments like DAOs and enabling machine learning on the Aergo&nbsp;mainnet.  C<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/149">omposable Transactions</a>:<br>- Explicit atomic transactions without relying on internal transactions<br>- Enhancing transparency and trustless transactions without the need for turing complete contract implementation (“White-box transactions”)  Text-based Contracts:<br>- All Lua contracts on Aergo will be stored as source code (in lieu of bytecode) to make it more human-readable and deterministic<br>- The basis for text-based language model applications as well (same as text-based transactions)  T<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/252">ext-based Transactions (WIP)</a>:<br>- A transaction format that is both human-readable and machine-interpretable, embodying the principles of the <a href="https://webisoft.com/articles/ricardian-contract/">Ricardian Contract</a> <br>- Aims to fully realize Ricardian Contract capabilities<br>- Also serves as a foundation for text-based language model applications<br>- Enables the use of text-based transactions for prompt engineering and data&nbsp;storage  <p>The technical specifications for the new features introduced in the Aergo V4 hard fork are available on <a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/discussions/256">GitHub</a>.

<p>Recent healthcare cyberattacks have highlighted the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in the healthcare industry. In February 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, was hit by a ransomware attack when hackers exploited a server that was missing a fundamental security measure: multi-factor authentication (MFA). The incident not only paralyzed healthcare services but also led to the payment of a $22 million ransom and is expected to cost the company over $1.6 billion in recovery efforts. Moreover, according to Axios, health care providers are losing up to $1 billion a day from cyberattack.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As healthcare providers and payers continue to digitize their operations and patient records, they also continue to be the prime target for cybercriminals. According to the 2023 ForgeRock Breach Report2 of all industries healthcare is the number one targeted industry by cybercriminals. The stakes are high: a breach not only compromises member and patient data but also disrupts essential healthcare services. To mitigate these risks, healthcare organizations must adopt comprehensive security measures, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the organization being paramount.</p>

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.</p>
<p>This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.</p>
<p>Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

  <p>In the next three years, the twenty seven states of the European Union (EU) will have to finalize the implementing acts for the eIDAS2 regulation and issue digital identity wallets to their citizens. Although the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) defined by the EU expert group has clearly identified mandatory standards for several parts of the wallet, such as the credentials formats, or the verification or presentation protocols, it has not mandated standards on how to secure of the wallet credentials, sensitive data and key materials.<br>The ARF has identified use cases requiring a high level of assurance (LoA) in terms of security, such as the provisioning of the Personal Identification Data (PID) or the use of qualified signature, as well as possible means to ensure this high LoA: with secure elements embedded into the mobile device, with external electronic identity documents accessed by communication channels such as Near Field Communication (NFC), or with the use of remote Hardware Security Modules.<br>Today, the vast majority of mobile devices are embedding secure elements and trusted execution environments that already provide certified high level of security for several use cases such as secure connectivity, payment, ticketing, or digital keys. These secure elements are deployed on billions of mobile devices, and are based on recognized standards such GlobalPlatform Secure Element or Trusted Execution Environment specifications.<br>This presentation will give an overview of the different security standards and technologies available in mobile devices, and how they can be applied for securing digital identity wallets. Besides the secure storage and secure execution environment aspects, this presentation will also address secure provisioning of wallet applications, credentials and sensitive data, as well as their security certification. It will bridge the gap between the high level requirements of security and the possible deployment scenarios that will enable digital identity wallet to enjoy the same level of security as existing proven and largely deployed solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/an-overview-of-deployment-solutions-eic24"></a>

  <p>Providing a product or service across markets internationally can come with significant technical and regulatory overhead. The challenge of such overhead might seem to reduce itself in the current market development in Europe with the soon to be standardized eIDAS architecture and unified wallet interaction protocols that seem to streamline identity integration requirements across 27 countries. In practice though, moving beyond the EU context will still require significant adaptation and often parallel implementation of identity standards and protocols, this is true for the Swiss market as much as it is true for the US or even Japanese market. While all these markets move towards the digital identity wallet paradigm as a new identity model, their technical approach differs significantly.</p>
<p>Abstracting this complexity for companies that simply want to provide their product or service across markets is a tough challenge. Solution providers need to consistently monitor changing specifications, requirements, and regulation, while making sure that their own technological platform is ready to support the variety at hand. Many incumbent solutions and platforms do not handle such diversity well since they were developed for a concrete market environment and then updated on a sub optimal path of evolution towards ever more complexity.</p>
<p>As a Swiss provider of digital identity core technologies, Procivis had to naturally tackle the challenge of a future proof technology solution that is capable of handling complexity since day one. Our home market is too small to justify a solution built for only that environment, so we had to get creative and build a product that can naturally handle complexity and interoperability without compromise.</p>
<p>This presentation will tell the story of our journey to rethink product development in times of uncertainty. It will describe how we learned to radically build for adaptability and extensibility. After the initial instinct to resist uncertainty, we learned to embrace it and I will talk about our company's journey to this new state of consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/embracing-diverse-specifications-eic24"></a>

  <p>Digital wallets are applications used to receive, store, and share identity attributes in a standards-based [preferably], secure, privacy enhancing fashion. To prove that the legitimate, natural person is receiving, in possession of, or sharing these identity attributes a means to bind them to the natural person is needed.<br> In 1995, for example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) clearly recognized the desirability of pursuing the use of biometrics in travel documents as the single best way to link the document and its rightful “owner.”<br> In this example the issuing authority binds the identity attributes to the authorized holder by including biometric data in the cryptographically signed logical data structure. When the holder makes an identity claim the relying party (verifier) can determine the authenticity and integrity of the identity attributes and, through biometric recognition, determine if the authorized holder is presenting the information. This works well for the intended use case: in-person identity verification by government authorities for cross border travel.<br> The EU, for another example, specifies three assurance levels for electronic identification (low, superior, and high) which involve different levels of rigor in the identity proofing process and in the binding process itself, from: <br> The binding has been established on the basis of nationally recognised procedures.<br> to<br> The binding has been verified on the basis of a unique identifier representing the legal person used in the national context; and on the basis of information uniquely representing the natural person from an authoritative source.<br> Here the EU defines authoritative source as:<br> any source irrespective of its form that can be relied upon to provide accurate data, information and/or evidence that can be used to prove identity; <br> The goal of digital wallets in general, and the EU digital wallet in particular, is to be able to prove identity claims to a certain level of assurance both in-person (like an ICAO ePassport or ISO 18013-5 mDL) and on-line (like an ISO 18013-7 mDL). <br> <br> This session will discuss how authentication may rely on the digital wallet to bind the holder to identity claims and what the associated challenges as influenced by varying levels of assurance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-wallet-holder-binding-eic24"></a>

  <p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and traditional security paradigms are proving inadequate in the face of modern threats. As organizations strive to embrace Zero Trust principles, the role of Privileged Access Management (PAM) is pivotal. This talk explores the transformative concept of "Micro Authorizations" and its potential to shape the optimal direction for PAM implementations in support of Zero Trust initiatives.</p>
<p>The Authorization Fabric decides whether a specific principal is authorized to perform a precise operation on a particular resource and whether the resource permits this access.</p>
<p>The granularity of this approach is vital in today’s threat landscape, requiring organizations to shift their focus to a comprehensive, system-wide authorization framework. This shift, parallels the principles of microservices but applies them to the realm of access control.</p>
<p>Rather than depending on a single point of control, there is a need for a network proxy that acts as a bridge between trust and authorization.</p>
<p>Join us on a journey towards a future powered by micro authorizations, where precision, adaptability, and contextual awareness define access control. Explore how micro authorizations can address contemporary security challenges and facilitate the adoption of the Zero Trust model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-privileged-access-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>Compared to externalising authentication, externalising authorization has proven elusive. Yet a combination of the rise of advanced threat actors, regulation, compliance and pressures for greater business agility is bringing it back in focus. It is tempting to think of externalising authorization as a technology problem. Technology like policy languages, authorization engines and workflow systems is necessary to enable the externalisation of authorization, but it is not sufficient. Externalising authorization requires three foundational building blocks to be in place, namely value for all stakeholders from engineers to customers, supporting business processes and technology. In this session we explore each of these building blocks should be internalised in terms of mapping value for all stakeholders, the process and culture needed to make authorization policies explicit and finally the need to drive authorization infrastructure, from policy language to enforcement engines, into the compute and network fabric to address greenfield and brownfield deployments in order to remove barriers to externalising authorization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-before-we-externalise-it-eic24"></a>

  <p>In an era marked by the pervasive spread of disinformation and the&nbsp;democratization of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities to&nbsp;create synthetic media, the need for robust defense mechanisms has never been more urgent. The Defending Against Disinformation Common Data Model&nbsp;(DAD-CDM) and the DISARM Framework stand at the forefront of this&nbsp;battle, offering structured approaches to identify, analyze, and&nbsp;counteract disinformation campaigns. The DISARM Framework and DAD-CDM&nbsp;serve as a unified platform for organizations worldwide to exchange&nbsp;critical information, facilitating early detection and rapid response to&nbsp;emerging threats. Leveraging the DISARM Framework, which codifies&nbsp;adversary behaviors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),&nbsp;stakeholders gain insight into manipulative strategies employed in&nbsp;disinformation campaigns, enabling proactive defense measures and&nbsp;enabling a more rapid and comprehensive incident response.<br> <br> In our upcoming presentation, we will explore the intricate&nbsp;intersection of AI, disinformation, and cybersecurity, shedding light on&nbsp;the pivotal role of DAD-CDM and DISARM in safeguarding against evolving threats. Through real-world case studies and practical insights, we&nbsp;explore how these frameworks empower governments, cybersecurity experts,&nbsp;industry, and organizations to mitigate the influence of disinformation&nbsp;and AI-created synthetic media. Join us as we uncover strategies to&nbsp;fortify defenses and foster collaborative efforts in combating&nbsp;misinformation in the digital age.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/combating-misinformation-in-an-ai-enabled-world-eic24"></a>

  <p>The proliferation of micro-services along with the changing threat landscape means it is no longer possible to rely on network segmentation to establish a secure permitter while allowing broad access between services inside the perimeter. As a result, we have to assume that the attackers are inside the perimeter and apply fine grained authorization at the microservice level to ensure least privilege access based on the context of each transaction. This context includes details of the transaction, the user, other services, or workloads in the call chain as well as the trust domains in which the services operate.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are two new complimentary standards being developed in the IETF OAuth working group that provide a standardised mechanism for preserving transaction context. The Transaction Tokens draft provides a mechanism for preserving context for fine grained authorization decisions within a trust domain, while Identity Chaining across Trust Domains provides a mechanism for preserving that context even when crossing trust boundaries. In this session we will provide an overview of these two emerging standards and describe how they are used to enable fine grained authorization in microservices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enabling-fine-grained-authoirization-eic24"></a>

  <p>Stolen secrets and credentials are one of the most common ways for attackers to move laterally and maintain persistence in cloud environments.</p>
<p>Modern cloud deployments employ secrets management systems such as KMS to protect key materials at rest and avoid leaking keys or credentials in source code or other build artifacts. However, secrets are unprotected at runtime, so any vulnerability or compromise of a service could lead to credential theft.</p>
<p>This talk will propose an architecture that, in conjunction with a secret manager, tokenizes secrets and rewrites requests at runtime. Through this approach, application code never directly interacts with key material. Additionally, it enforces stringent access control rules based on Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for accessing secrets, significantly reducing the blast radius in the event of a security breach.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-workload-identities-eic24"></a>

  <p>As part of the revision of the EU common identity framework regulation, also known as eIDAS 2.0, EU Member States will all soon implement a new common structure for electronic credentials based on digital identity wallets. This includes the development of a European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet.</p>
<p>This wallet can be implemented as a web wallet running in a browser. This means a smartphone is not required to use the wallet – making it inclusive and independent of app stores and phone vendors. Instead of using native APIs to protect cryptographic keys, this web wallet can use FIDO security keys to secure the wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO is a natural fit to secure digital wallets as users are becoming more and more familiar with its associated registration and sign in flows now many websites have adopted passkeys as a means to access their services.</p>
<p>In this session, we will discuss how the wallet works, how FIDO is used to protect the wallet, highlight current use cases of how the wallet is being used by EU member states, and how this model can be replicated in other countries around the world.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-digital-identity-wallets-using-fido-security-keys-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the realm of modern authentication, FIDO and passkeys have launched a new paradigm that is both practical and transformative. Passkey providers have seamlessly integrated the capability to synchronize passkeys across various devices, extending their reach even to different device families. Users enjoy default implementations of passkey providers with each new device, empowering relying parties to leverage passkeys across the multitude of devices.<br> In contrast, relying parties cannot assume the universal presence of identity wallet functionality on the typical devices used by their customers.<br> Given the three-year device switch cycle and the concurrent use of multiple devices, cloud storage services have efficiently addressed the migration of standard data between devices. While these services generally have access to data in the clear, they implement safeguards to prevent inadvertent disclosure.<br> Passkey providers not only synchronize passkeys but also implement robust recovery methods, crucial for scenarios involving the loss or theft of all devices. Similarly, identity wallets, tasked with managing verifiable identity attributes and associated secrets, necessitate safeguards akin to those implemented by passkey providers. <br> This webinar explores the similarities and differences between passkey providers and identity wallets, offering valuable insights into what identity wallets can glean from the proven methodologies of passkeys.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/convergence-of-passkeys-and-identity-wallets-eic24"></a>

  <p>For decentralised identity to reach its full potential we need high levels of trust and high levels of inclusion. <br>As a community we have developed some great standards and practices for identity verification, but they mostly rely on having strong documentation issued by a government if you want to gain the higher levels of trust. <br>The reality is not everyone has strong documentation and not everyone has access to digital technology to verify that documentation remotely. For example, in the UK around 11 million people have neither a passport nor a driving licence, the 2 primary documents used for identity verification. In many countries this number is far higher. <br>And, while we drive forward with more and more technological means of proving who we are online, some people will always struggle to use these technologies or simply not be able to. <br>Vouching for someone as part of the identity verification process has been around for a while but is only now crystalising in the minds of identity experts. It is also one of the most decentralised ways of proving who you are. <br>The process of Vouching is intended to increase inclusivity of population scale identity systems by enabling people with insufficient documentation (identity evidence), or those unable to complete a conventional identity registration to gain a digital identity.<br>In this session Adam Cooper seeks to outline the issues we should be addressing and the approaches we can take to create better inclusivity in digital identity ecosystems based on over a decade of working with governments, citizens, and the private sector to deliver better outcomes for all of us.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-is-already-decentralized-eic24"></a>

  <p>eIDAS version 2 has set in motion and energized identity professionals to think about and work on sharing attributes related to identity data. eIDAS version 2 provides a possible framework and set of technologies to do so. However, that framework does not match with a lot of technical and business practices already in use. In Belgium an ecosystem is forming to perform data sharing in a way which is adapted to the needs of the different existing stakeholders: data subjects, sources, attribute attestation service providers, vaults, IdP and relying parties. It reuses a lot of existing initiatives and infrastructure for a low threshold implementation with the high trust level of the existing initiatives. Nevertheless, it allows to implement important features like privacy, selective disclosure, etc.<br> During this presentation, we will see how this alternative ecosystem works, how it ensures trust and ease of use for the different stakeholders (including data subjects) and why it will lead to a low threshold for adoption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-sharing-ecosystem-and-trust-eic24"></a>

  <p>The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), which just had its fourth birthday, has long held the conviction that technical trust alone is insufficient for enabling human trust in digital interactions. Thus, ToIP has been developing a dual stack that pairs technical architecture with governance architecture. <br> <br>To maximize technical interoperability, ToIP believes there must be a minimum viable “trust spanning” protocol that enables ubiquitous secure, private data exchange. Then every digital trust ecosystem can choose which higher-layer “trust task” protocols—such as exchanging digital credentials between digital wallets, or verifying ecosystem participants using trust registries—they need to meet their specific authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy requirements.<br> <br> With regards to the harder problem of human trust, in the real world this is built through relationships, agreements and other intangible elements within a context. By contrast, in the digital world trust has to be engineered. This means each ecosystem needs to be able to define their governance architecture, policies, credentials, and trust lists/registries that can be communicated both within and across ecosystems using interoperable protocols to maximize the potential for cross-ecosystem trust relationships.<br> <br> This interactive panel, moderated by ToIP’s Executive Director, will convene a set of ToIP leaders to explain why they have been investing in this new approach to decentralized digital trust infrastructure, where it fits with eIDAS 2.0, how it builds upon (not replaces) X.509 PKI and OpenID, and what to expect over the coming year.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/emerging-trust-layer-for-the-internet-eic24"></a>

  <p>With cybercrime on the rise, ransomware attacks that target Active Directory (AD), the primary identity store for most businesses worldwide, are as common as having a cup of coffee. Many cyber incidents involve AD in one way or another. Given that an attack on AD, these days, is more of a "when" rather than an "if" scenario, organizations must have a tested AD DR plan and purpose-built solutions for securing AD before a cyberattack and recovering and securing AD after that cyberattack. In addition, if like many organizations today, you have a hybrid identity environment that connects AD with Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD), do you know what needs to happen to reconnect? Recovering as fast as possible is one thing, assessing the security of your AD and mitigating any (critical) risks is another. But what about reconnecting AD back with Entra ID? Knowing which precautionary measures to take to minimize damage (i.e., the impact on user experience and data loss) within Entra ID is of utmost importance!</p>
<p>This presentation discusses the risk to today’s enterprise organizations and explains why prioritizing hybrid identity (Active Directory and Entra ID) security is so important. Examples of various identity threat detection and response (ITDR) tools to evaluate AD security (pre- and post-attack) and discover vulnerabilities that could attract attackers are also discussed.</p>
<p>Attendees will also learn why an AD Recovery Plan is a vital resource for ongoing operational resilience, including the different ways to execute parts of that DR plan and what the impact is of such an execution. Finally, we will discuss what the problem is with reconnecting AD back with Entra ID and what you can do about it to mitigate any impact.</p>
<p>In summary, during this session, attendees will learn the following:</p>
 
 Learn how to evaluate the security of an AD 
 Learn how to prepare for a disaster scenario 
 Learn which backup to choose and why 
 Learn how to remediate risk (due to security) right after recovery 
 Learn how to remediate impact when reconnecting AD with Entra ID&nbsp; 
 
<p>If time allows, the highlights of a real-life AD recovery scenario will be discussed, to put all the pieces together.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ransomware-attack-against-your-ad-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the&nbsp;Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer introduce a critical view of the process of civilization, economy and enlightenment as such, a critical view of the seemingly self-evident notion of pure reason, science, and technology. What Horkheimer and Adorno are trying to capture and reflect is the very process of rationality backlashing into irrationality. The long history of enlightenment is thus the demystification of nature and the development of pure calculative rationality. According to Horkheimer and Adorno, we have tried to free ourselves of the dangers and brute force of nature, but in the process of developing technology and production we have ended up narrowing our rational capacities, dominating ourselves, and tying ourselves to a petrified system now even endangering our own planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We seem to have reached the era of modern technology and exact calculation, but this leaves us with no sense of control or meaningfulness in the face of a global environmental crisis. Humanity's technological orientation to the world makes clear the responsibility of human beings to the well-being of the world. This taking of responsibility will become vital in the future since it has become perfectly clear that the Earth will not be able in the long term to support the exploitative and care-less ways in which ever growing parts of humanity have been inhabiting her since at least the Industrial Revolution. However, the need to ask about modern technology is presumably dying out to the same extent that technology more definitely characterizes and regulates the appearance of the totality of the world and the position of man in it. Thus, it is important to ask: how does modern technology affect our actuality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will explore how technology is not merely a means to an end but also a lens through which we understand ourselves and the world. It will highlight the increasing responsibility that humanity bears for the well-being of the planet, especially in the face of a global environmental crisis. The session will demonstrate how this transformation represents a radical change in our technological relationship with the planet and with ourselves.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/philosophical-perspective-identity-cybersecurity-professionals-eic24"></a>

At the same time, they are required to meet high expectations of customers for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Traditionally, authentication and API authorization functions have been combined into one system architecture, often through a managed service provided by a vendor. However, this restricts how service providers can customize their identity and access management systems to deliver a consistent brand experience.<br>To thrive in the competitive environment, service providers are increasingly opting to build their own authorization servers in-house. They are taking control of their identity and access management systems to deliver a frictionless and differentiated experience.<br>Discover examples of how well-respected brands have built their fully compliant and secure authorization servers by offloading the protocol processing and management, accelerating the growth of their digital services.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/liberate-yourself-from-vendor-limitations-eic24"></a>

  <p>What would happen if standards-based digital credentialing technology becomes widely accessible? Any entity, large or small, can start issuing and verifying within weeks, days or even hours. Then, the initial adoption of digital credentials will mostly be driven by ‘local’ needs. This is inevitable due to the decreasing cost and complexity of technology. However, as more and more begin to issue credentials on their own terms with little to no coordination, even when the technology everyone uses is based on interoperable standards, as long as there is no established human trust, two entities won’t be able to accept each other’s credentials right away. So how to facilitate trust building in this emerging world of digital credentials?<br><br>This session will introduce a new model, Decentralized Federation, which leverages to the best extent possible of existing systems and connects trust registries, and how it is already being implemented to solve today’s trust problems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-federation-new-trust-model-eic24"></a>

Any such system will have to meet an exacting set of requirements - including the ability to support massive scale and protecting of the privacy individuals whilst preventing fraud and money laundering. This talk will explore the potential role of EUDI Wallets in meeting these requirements, consider gaps that exist and explore additional technologies and capabilities that may be needed. To have utility digital wallets will need to support identity, payments and other credentials.

  <p>In the rapidly evolving agricultural sector, the importance of data management and sharing has never been more critical. Traditional methods are no longer sufficient; they create compliance burdens, inefficiencies and face a lack of trust. New Zealand is undertaking a transformative approach with the Digital Farm Wallet pilot, conceived by the Trust Alliance New Zealand (TANZ), a non-profit industry consortium recognising that trusted data sharing is essential for the growth of New Zealand’s primary sector.</p>
<p>The TANZ Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project exemplifies the commitment to empowering stakeholders to share and verify information in a trusted and permissioned manner, fostering trust and transparency throughout the value chain. This initiative aims to offer tangible proof of brand promises, while alleviating farms from the repetitive tasks of data management.</p>
<p>To ensure international market and financial access demand of digital proofs, such as environmental claims are increasing. The Digital Farm Wallet addresses this by facilitating the sharing of key data points like greenhouse gas and Scope 3 emissions, underscoring good management practices. Exploring various applications, this initiative aims to deliver real value for farmers and food processors.</p>
<p>Klaeri Schelhowe was contracted through Scheddebrock Ltd. to act as the Executive Director for TANZ. In this role she established an industry consortium to focus on trusted data sharing within the primary sector. A significant challenge was posed in bringing together the many and varied stakeholders, many of whom competed with each other, to cooperate in the development of a functioning ecosystem. Developing stakeholder understanding and willingness to engage in a co opetition model in order to build critical mass is a more complex and demanding undertaking than the adoption and deployment of the technology itself.</p>

  <p>Choosing the right platform to secure identity access to privileged resources is more challenging. This is partly because of the escalating risk of under protected identities in the cloud and the tendency of bad actors to target those with privileged access. It’s also because the choice of tools has widened. The protection of privileged identities has traditionally fallen to PAM vendors such as CyberArk or BeyondTrust, but in the last few years, the space has widened to include CIEM and ITDR providers who focus on securing identities in the cloud, for development environments and at the edge.</p>
<p>In this session Paul will explain why these newer technologies emerged, why they are important, and the difference between them and traditional PAM. He will share his analysis of how these technologies can be orchestrated to work together and how some are being deployed in a decentralised fashion for specific identity management and protection tasks.</p>
<p>You will learn the fundamental design elements of each of these technologies, how they can protect your identities and which may offer a solution for managing privileged identities in your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-ciem-itdr-difference-eic24"></a>

Did "John Doe" create the purchase requisition, while "J Doe" made the final invoice payment? The problem of finding and matching John Doe versus J.Doe is attempted in an end-to-end procurement process to detect internal fraud, based on data from ERP systems. We present an explainable AI (XAI) approach that attempts to explain to business users how certain features of data affect high-risk indicators in a procurement process. Various state-of-the-art XAI methods and novel contributions are empirically evaluated to provide an explainable AI-driven output that can be trusted by business users for actions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/threat-detection-in-a-mixed-identity-landscape-eic24"></a>

  <p>This is an implementation and enterprise change management story about how we moved Okta from a baseline of traditional MFA gating app/resources access to a far more dynamic &amp; secure app/resource access policy position using ZTA principles, passwordless, &amp; eventually, phishing resistance. It’s about cross-departmental partnership, iterative improvement, and performance benchmarking to deliver a data-driven transformation in our security posture in a short, yet realistic, time frame.</p>
<p>This session will show WHY and HOW we managed both the technical and cultural enterprise changes needed to make this a success, and provide attendees within all industries with ideas and examples they can take back to undertake iterative security improvement in their own organizations.</p>
<p>We will start by introducing Okta on Okta. OoO are the identity practitioners within Okta, and just like other EIC attendees, we have to deliver solutions to business identity challenges. Though we may wear “team colors,” we talk shop with the credibility that comes from having to actually implement, own, and iterate it - without the marketing mission to distract us.</p>
<p>We will highlight the status quo and the drivers for this change. We will then move on to the foundational work needed to overhaul our security signals and access policies based on said signals, including how we kept the enterprise from experiencing change &amp; security fatigue, how passwordless was a QoL feature to start, but evolved as the program did to emphasize phishing resistance as the real value. As the program went on, we began layering security feature after feature at sign-on time, including user behavior analysis, managed and BYOD device profiling and security signals, CrowdStrike signals, and more until organically we got to a place were we authenticate every user, every device, and constantly review and adjust our policies based on new security threats.</p>
<p>We will share the metrics on how we tracked our objectives, including auth metrics we tracked to know we were making an impact. We will share the business value impact as well in terms of UX, security hygiene, and worker hours saved - and emphasize this is how we kept exec attention on this program so it wouldn’t peter out. We will end by highlighting that our phishing-resistant journey is not “complete” until all aspects of the user’s identity lifecycle are secured with PR credentials, including onboarding, desktop sign-on, and credential recovery.</p>
<p>This is an implementation &amp; ent. change management story. It IS set w/in Okta &amp; executed by Okta employees, but this is not about the product- it is about the doers getting this done. This is a universally applicable story on passwordless as the first step toward the real goal of phishing resistance, and the iterative process toward ZTA using diverse identity &amp; security tooling signals.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/passwordless-phishing-resistance-eic24"></a>

  <p>In order for digital identity initiatives to be successful and sustainable, they have to place people and their societal values at the center of their architecture. This means following the principles of human-centered design, inclusion, privacy-by-design, and ethics while building easy-to-use systems that seamlessly enable access to services while combating fraud and theft. But what happens when these principles end up in conflict with each other? How do we, as identity practitioners, navigate the challenge of building for the world that people actually live in, not the one we wished they lived in - and the dilemmas that creates for us? In this talk, the presenter will lay out some of the trends and drivers he is seeing in global projects that surface these quandaries for which no blueprint currently exists. He will also describe some of the design debates that take place as a result between stakeholders, and detail possible approaches to tackle these issues when they inevitably land on your desk.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/human-centered-design-eic24"></a>

  <p>Maurice Ravel's Boléro is one of the world’s most well-known classical pieces, in part due to its simplicity: eighteen minutes of repeated rhythms and melodies make it easy to grasp.<br> <br> But in the midst of that clarity, Boléro holds demanding questions for the listener. Written in the aftermath of the First World War, it sees the dangers of automation and technology—and inquires if humanity can avoid being assimilated into the march of the machine. Ultimately, Boléro asks the hearer two questions: “What is authentic humanity?” and “Can authentic humanity survive the modern world?”<br> <br> These questions still resonate almost one hundred years later. The recent rise of automation in the form of generative AI shows great promise, but also presents similar challenges to 1928. The rush to adopt this new technology is eroding authenticity not just in biometric authentication and identity, but in writing, in art, and in other activities long thought to be the prerogative of humanity. In response, we must reexamine what it means to remain "authentically human" amidst the drumbeat of innovation.<br> <br> Through one person's experience in losing and recovering Boléro, we'll explore the questions that Ravel's masterpiece presents and propose ways in which identity can safeguard authentic humanity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/recovering-bolero-and-the-death-of-authenticity-eic24"></a>

  <p>Identity verification is rapidly evolving, blending both federated systems and decentralized models to cater to diverse needs. However, this integration often presents challenges, including balancing ease of use with stringent security requirements. Many identity solutions provide seamless user experiences but fail to adequately address the complexities of identity security within hybrid environments. This talk will introduce the Hybrid Wallet, a pioneering approach by Digidentity that merges federated identity systems with decentralized technologies. We will explore how this hybrid model not only enhances user control and privacy but also ensures robust security across different digital landscapes.&nbsp;</p>

				  Add additional features to existing credential systems while preserving their original functionality with Indicio Proven.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The emerging age of digital credentials will transform how we interact digitally, prove identity, and share data. The benefits will be reduced fraud and friction, increased data privacy and security, and the ability to create seamless processes based on data that can be instantly verified and acted on.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of credentials for different needs: some offer only basic authorization; others can manage the kind of data sharing and verification that are essential for business. The key is to be able to interoperate between the two, where a credential with limited features can be given a wrapper that preserves its original function while providing the advanced features of other credential types.</p>
<p>Enter Indicio Proven’s newest feature: a credential bridge. It’s a simple way to bridge the gap between limited and more advanced credential features and allow participation in multiple credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>For example, the Microsoft Entra Verified Identity Platform has basic features but is widely available. It only supports one credential type (JSON Web Token VC), and one DID method (DID: web); it doesn’t support OpenID4VCI (essential to interoperate with European Union’s preferred digital identity protocol), has limited digital wallet support (Microsoft Authenticator), limited governance capability, and doesn’t contain the privacy-preserving features of other verifiable credential types.</p>
<p>These features may not matter to some users, but, increasingly, we see enterprise and public sector organizations around the world opting for more expansive features to meet business, customer, and citizen needs. Why shut yourself out of these ecosystems?</p>
<p>Using Indicio Proven as your credential bridge, you don’t have to limit your options because it’s not a case of one or the other. Now, you can wrap an Entra identity in different credential formats, preserve the underlying capacity to verify it as an Entra identity, and take advantage of Indicio’s:</p>
 
 Support for additional DID methods 
 Selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, and predicate proofs to share data in privacy-preserving ways. 
 Support for additional OIDC specs for interoperability with the EU. 
 Support for additional communication protocols such as DIDComm, which opens up the capacity of direct, secure communication between DID holders. 
 Enable use of peer DIDs for subjects, which improves security 
 Convert to additional credential types such AnonCreds, SD-JWT, BBS+, mDoc/mDL. 
 
<p>The point is — don’t get locked into a single path when the technology is advancing rapidly. It is highly unlikely that there will ever be a single credential format or protocol that does everything. So why not be able to use them all?</p>

<p>An explosion in new financial services experiences, powered by fintech apps for consumers and small businesses, has propelled the rise of open banking technology in the U.S. and around the world. Every player in the consumer finance arena must now rethink what is possible when consumers and small businesses have full control of their financial lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) is embracing this moment of innovation with the long-awaited Dodd-Frank Section 1033 open banking rule, which will accelerate the adoption of open banking technologies and protect consumer interests as we move further into the digital future. This proposed rule is set to be finalized in the second half of 2024. With decades of leadership in data responsibility, Mastercard’s principles align with the tenets of CFPB rulemaking and our role is to protect this data.</p>



<p>Mastercard has created this primer to outline the provisions of CFPB Section 1033 and explain how banks, fintechs and other holders of consumer financial data will be affected by the proposed rule. Read on to discover what CFPB rulemaking means for you — and how Mastercard equips customers to thrive in this new landscape.&nbsp;</p>

 What is the CFPB?&nbsp; 



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the United States federal government, established in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis to protect consumers’ interests in financial markets and promote long-term stability in the broader economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, better known as Dodd-Frank, to provide a single point of accountability for protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive financial practices and to taking action against companies that break the law.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What does the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1033 say about consumers’ rights to access financial data?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes consumers’ right to access financial data associated with the financial products and services they use, such as credit cards, deposits and savings accounts.&nbsp; This data includes account details, transactions, balances and more (see “<a>What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?</a>” below), and is subject to rules put forward by the CFPB.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What is the CFPB’s role in Section 1033 rulemaking?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 gives the CFPB authority to issue rules governing personal financial data rights.&nbsp; The CFPB has been working toward implementing this rulemaking since 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some key milestones include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 publishing a set of consumer protection principles (2017)&nbsp; 



 holding a symposium on consumer access to financial records (2020)&nbsp; 



 releasing detailed documentation of rulemaking proposals and alternatives under consideration (2022)&nbsp; 



 convening a Small Business Review Panel and issuing a report of its findings (2023)&nbsp; 
 



<p>In October 2023, the bureau released its proposed rule and opened a period of public comment through December 29, 2023. Since then, the CFPB has been working to finalize the written regulations. Once it takes effect, the proposed rule will serve as implementation of Dodd-Frank Section 1033.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What parties are impacted by the CFPB Section 1033?&nbsp; 



 
 Data providers – financial institutions and&nbsp;some payment facilitators 



 Third-party data recipients – fintechs and financial institutions acting on consumers’ behalf as data recipients and data aggregators acting on their behalf 



 Qualified industry standard-setting bodies – CFPB-recognized issuers of fair, open, and inclusive industry standards<br> 
 



 How does the proposed rulemaking impact personal financial data rights?&nbsp; 



<p>Broadly speaking, the CFPB open banking rule is a framework of regulations and industry standards that provides consumers with ownership and rights to control their financial data; enhanced consumer protections; and consistency in how data can be accessed and used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposal will require financial institutions and some payment facilitators to make financial data available to consumers and authorized third-party data recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed rule also:&nbsp;</p>



 
 outlines obligations and limitations for how companies must collect, use and store consumer data&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 requires banks to share data in a standardized format via safe and secure application programming interfaces (APIs)&nbsp; 



 seeks to empower consumers with their financial data&nbsp; 



 enables better access to financial products&nbsp; 



 and jump-starts competition between banks of all sizes, fintechs and other digital players&nbsp;<br> 
 



 What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?&nbsp; 



 
 Transaction information, including amounts, dates, payees, historical data, and fees.&nbsp; 



 Account balances&nbsp; 



 Account and routing numbers, both tokenized and non-tokenized&nbsp; 



 Terms and conditions, including fee schedules, rates, rewards terms and overdraft coverage&nbsp; 



 Information on upcoming bills, such as minimum payment amounts 



 Basic account verification information, including names, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.&nbsp;<br> 
 



 When does the open banking regulation take effect?&nbsp; 



<p>While the CFPB hasn’t given an exact date, it has indicated that it will finalize the proposed rule toward the end of 2024, with a tiered compliance timeline to follow, which makes it even more important that financial service providers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>



 
 First, the CFPB must finalize the rulemaking.&nbsp;
 
 While the bureau hasn’t given an exact date, CFPB Section 1033 is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2024, most likely in the fall.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Third parties must comply within 60 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 For consumer-authorized third parties, the CFPB proposed rule becomes effective 60 days from the date of the final rulemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 The proposed timeline for complying with the CFPB rule varies based on the size of the financial institution. Banks and other institutions that hold deposits will have between six months and four years to comply, based on their assets. Non-deposit institutions will have six or 12 months, depending on annual revenue. The CFPB has detailed this tiered approach as follows:&nbsp;

 <br>How can Mastercard help?&nbsp; 



<p>At Mastercard, we believe that consumers own their financial data; they should be in control of how and by whom it is used and should benefit from its use. Mastercard’s role is to protect this data and help data providers do the same. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposed rule calls for secure permissioned data-sharing across developer interfaces, or APIs. Navigating this compliance is going to be complex, as financial institutions must decide to build APIs on their legacy infrastructure or outsource, as well as addressing other areas, including but not limited to consent management, info security, and third-party risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Bug bounty programs are sometimes viewed with a negative connotation for a variety of reasons. This post aims to overcome implementation obstacles by debunking those misconceptions, and providing recommendations for organizations as they embark on the bug bounty journey.</p> 
 What Is a Bug Bounty Program?  
<p>First a quick definition. A bug bounty program is a security scheme offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers where individuals are paid to find security vulnerabilities. These programs incentivize independent security researchers and ethical hackers to discover and report potential flaws, making the technology more secure and reducing breach risk. So why don’t more companies have them?&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Objections to Bug Bounty Programs  
<p>I’ve been involved in a few companies where bug bounty programs were generally perceived negatively. Colleagues gave a number of reasons for not implementing a bug bounty program. These included:</p> 
  
  Too expensive  
  Takes several months before seeing results  
  It’s hard to manage and is extremely time-consuming  
  Researchers can be hostile  
  Quality of findings can be inadequate  
  
<p>However, I’ve been fully managing a bug bounty program for more than two years now and I can attest that these concerns are essentially baseless.&nbsp;</p> 
 Financial Concerns  
<p>The financial concern is misplaced since it’s significantly cheaper to find a critical vulnerability by doing a routine penetration test, or through a controlled bug bounty program, than if one of your customers discovers that vulnerability and demands a fix as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The consequences of customers and prospects finding security issues in an application can range from reduced confidence in your product, to actually losing an opportunity because the prospect considers the application insecure. This is far more expensive than the average bug bounty program. Not to mention the financial consequences of an actual security breach caused by a vulnerability.</p> 
 Results Timeline&nbsp;  
<p>Results can be obtained almost instantly. The researchers are usually highly motivated and working across multiple different time zones. Moreover, unlike penetration testing programs, which usually take place at specific points in time, bug bounty researchers test continuously. This allows you to constantly have an up-to-date understanding of your risk.</p> 
 Management and Scope  
<p>Bug bounty partner/platforms aid significantly when it comes to program management.</p> 
<p>Organizations hesitant to implement a bug bounty program can start by setting a private program that provides access to only a limited number of researchers. This gives organizations more control over the program and limits the number of reports they receive. A private program helps address concerns both about an overwhelming influx of reports and the cost of bug bounty rewards.</p> 
<p>Organizations can include production assets in the scope of their programs by disallowing certain types of testing. Common exclusions include denial of service attacks, social engineering, self-inflicting vulnerabilities, etc.</p> 
 Submissions Management  
<p>This is a more extensive topic that we will be covering in a future post, along with guidance on managing inadequate findings and researchers.</p> 
 Suggestions To Get Started  
 Preparing the Test Environment  
<p>For smaller organizations, it is usually easier to run a bug bounty program when the company only has one main core product or a limited number of offers. For larger companies that have hundreds of applications and thousands of endpoints, providing full access for testers can become a challenge.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ideally, a new test environment that researchers can freely use to run all the needed tests will be provided. If this is not possible, most companies already have a testing environment without any real data, which can be used for providing access to researchers.</p> 
 Including Production Assets  
<p>It is recommended to include all production assets in scope for a bug bounty program, otherwise companies will likely miss vulnerabilities that are only applicable to production applications and configurations. This doesn’t necessarily mean encouraging load testing in production, rather, if somebody finds an issue in production, it must be rewarded.</p> 
<p>For example, wouldn't you like to know if a person with limited resources and an open source web scanner were able to bring down an entire production environment? That’s certainly something I’d like to fix if it happened.</p> 
<p>HYPR has made significant performance improvements by analyzing the scan patterns that researchers performed in production assets. Furthermore, even if these assets are not included under the scope, there’s usually nothing stopping actors on the internet from scanning assets that require authentication.</p> 
 Final Recommendations  
  
  Use an existing platform: Implementing a bug bounty program can be challenging and there are many recommended bug bounty platforms that can help your organization get started in no time, and they handle all the communications, accounts, payouts (especially international payments), etc.&nbsp;  
  Start with a private program: A private program will limit the amount of researchers and initial time invested.  
  Implement guardrails: If there are some assets/domains/vulnerabilities that shouldn’t be included, these can be marked as out of scope.  
  Define payouts: Bounties are a great way to motivate researchers to participate in a program. Consider increasing the bounties whenever possible — use other bug bounty participating companies in your space for guidance.  
  Include all assets in scope: Production-like environments can be added instead of production if there are concerns.

<p>Healthcare technology is rapidly evolving and digital healthcare is now the norm. In order to deliver healthcare online, payer and provider organizations need the ability to securely and seamlessly share member and patient data across their various digital healthcare systems. Interoperability and modern identity and access management (IAM) are what make this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s (ONC) 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule was enacted. A significant component of the ONC’s Cures Act is its focus on interoperability. Electronic Medical Record (EMR)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complying with the Cures Act for interoperability requires the use of two standards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>&nbsp;SMART Health IT’s Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies (SMART) standard</p>
 
 <p>HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these two standards are what’s known as SMART on FHIR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ONC’s Rule and SMART on FHIR the stage is set for a more connected, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare system where clinical data can be more readily shared and accessed by healthcare providers, payers, consumers, and app developers alike.​</p>

  <p>"The AI Pivot" session at EIC 2024 offers a deep dive into the transformative journey from traditional product- and vendor-centric (digital) business models to robust, networked and agents based platform ecosystems in the AI-driven digital landscape. This transition marks a critical inflection point, heralding a new era where the confluence of technology, data, privacy and network effects reshapes industry paradigms and redefines the way we interact with the world.</p>
<p>12 years ago, KuppingerCole launched a Research Note decribing "Life Management Platforms" (LMP) as user-centric tools to support every-day tasks such as storage for sensitive documents and information, personal finance, investment and insurance management with high privacy and security standards. LMPs by definition were able to manage permissions and gave users control over their information sharing.</p>
<p>Since then, a number of such platforms were launched by different vendors and organizations covering parts or the whole set of features described in KuppingerCole´s research. Meeco has been and still is one of the first vendors of LMPs with a focus on financial applications.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since release of the KuppingerCole LMP paper: Decentralized Identity, Gen AI, Wallets, GDPR, eIDAS (2)... and more technologies, standards, governance frameworks and legislation came up since then and is about time to rewrite this profound part of research in the area of human-digital interaction.</p>
<p>Today we describe the former LMP concept as multi-agent based life management ecosystems that help us humans in all aspects of our daily life. They store our documents, buy our food online, navigate our vehicle, help us reducing the our CO2 footprint to a minimum, help us to stay healthy and to get wealthy, be productive at work or in school, manage our calendars propose holiday destinations and make appointments. We talk about agents we let do things for us within such Life Management Ecosystems in a privacy-by-design, secure by default, decentralized, vendor agnostic way. Globally.</p>
 A rough description of such an Ecosystem: 
 Decentralized and Self-Sovereign 
<p>Decentralization is a key aspect of these ecosystems, ensuring that no single entity has control over the entire system. This is achieved through the use of multi-agent systems, where multiple autonomous entities (agents) interact with each other to achieve their goals<br>These agents can share resources, including knowledge, information, contracts, trust, benefits, and goals<br>Self-sovereignty is another important aspect, where individuals have control over their own data. This is in line with the privacy-by-design principle, which ensures that privacy considerations and protections are embedded into the design and operation of the system</p>
 Multi-Agent AI and Edge AI 
<p>Multi-agent AI systems are used to simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to recreate and predict complex phenomena<br>These systems are used in many scientific domains including biology, ecology, and social science<br>Edge AI refers to the process of moving AI algorithms from the cloud and implementing them locally on a hardware device. The algorithms are run locally on the hardware device, allowing for real-time processing and decision-making, which is crucial for many applications in a life management ecosystem.</p>
 Wallets 
<p>(Global) Wallets are digital wallets that allow users to store and manage their digital identities, assets, and data. These wallets are designed to be secure and privacy-preserving, aligning with the principles of privacy-by-design and secure by default.</p>
 Privacy-by-Design 
<p>Privacy-by-design is a principle that ensures privacy is seamlessly integrated into products, services, and system designs by default<br>It promotes transparency about data usage, fostering accountability for how user data is collected, processed, and stored<br>This approach aligns with ethical principles by respecting user autonomy and promoting responsible data usage</p>
 Secure by Default 
<p>Secure by default means that products are resilient against prevalent exploitation techniques out of the box without added charge<br>These products protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities without end-users having to take additional steps to secure them<br>Vendor Agnostic<br>Being vendor agnostic means that the ecosystem is designed to work with technologies and applications from any vendor<br>This ensures interoperability, where multiple departments, systems, technologies, and applications work together for the same goal</p>
 eIDAS 2 Compliance 
<p>eIDAS 2 is a set of regulations in the European Union that govern electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. Compliance with eIDAS 2 ensures that the ecosystem adheres to the highest standards of security, privacy, and trust.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a multi-agent based life management ecosystem leverages a combination of advanced technologies and robust governance principles to provide a secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient system that can assist humans in various aspects of their daily life.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-ai-pivot-eic24"></a>

  <p>With the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) the European Union established an European DLT-infrastructure provided by the Member States. This means that the DLT nodes are in the responsibility of the Member States and so ensure a government trust anchor Since EBSI contains own governance and technical specifications together with conformance tests for wallet it provides a comprehensive framework for decentralized digital identities in Europe. EBSI is widely for use cases in education, public sector or traceability and with the eIDAS Bridge already useable within the eIDAS ecosystem.<br> As eIDAS 2.0 is technology neutral it provides the possibility to use the technical advantages of EBSI like distribution, crypto agility or performance (in comparison to existing TrustLists) on EUDI Alle,t QEAA but also trusted issuer registries, existing interoperability on decentralized identities based on established standards like W3CVC Data Model, ETSI ESI (especially reg. digital signatures as thexy are required for QEAA acc. eIDAS 2.0) also in eIDAS 2.0. As eIDAS 2.0 is not built on a green field EBSI also supports wide adoption of EUDI Wallet and related (qualified) trust services, as EBSI is already established infrastructure in Europe <br> With Section 11 the eIDAS 2.0 on the other hand introduce a dedicate qualified trust service for Electronic Ledger. This allows the provision of EBSI by fully liable QTSP under eIDAS 2.0 and allows the broad utilization of DLT for use cases like supply chain &amp; digital product passport (acc. EU Supply Chain Act), Organizational Digital Identity, Social Security, secure Data sharing etc. Within EBSI-VECTOR and EBSI-TRACE4EU more than 80 partners from all member states work on the establishment of a real decentralized and distributed ecosystem using EBSI as common infrastructure in Europe.<br><br> The session focus on the role of EBSI in the eIDAS 2.0 ecosystem so:</p>
 
 Legal Framework for EBSI within eIDAS 2.0 
 Needs on Governance in EBSI for adoption of eIDAS 2.0

  <p>SAML and OpenID started with a simple model of bilateral trust. Relying Parties register with Identity Providers and exchange trust information so that the RP can know that they are talking to Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc. We have also had Smart Cards (PIV/CAC) for authentication based on a certificate signed by someone that chains back to a known trusted root. The smart card approach avoids the RP needing to register but has significant user privacy issues. The research and education communities have long understood the scalability issues with these approaches. This led to the development of SAML2 and SAML metadata being used to represent more complicated trust relationships, where a single RP may allow identities from hundreds of Identity providers without needing to set up bilateral relationships.&nbsp;<br> <br> We are now entering a new world of Identity Wallets that look a lot more like multilateral federations than a simple one-to-one relationship. For these sorts of credentials to be scalable, we need to represent how a RP/Verifier can be part of perhaps hundreds of overlapping trust groupings. While it might be practical in just the EU to issue special TLS certificates to RP so that they can ask for credentials, that quickly breaks down if multiple countries outside the EU decide that is a good model.<br> <br> This presentation will look at proposed trust models and explore how a number of implementations are using OpenID Federation to address these scalability issues.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multilateral-federation-eic24"></a>

  <p>OIX has analysed eight Digital ID trust frameworks: US, Canada, EU, UK, Singapore, Thailand, MOSIP and Bank ID Sweden. The goal was to see if their policies could be expressed in a consistent way to enable interoperability of IDs across these eco-systems. The analysis found they share 75 common policy rule characteristics with 283 possible values. This is the DNA of Digital ID: trust frameworks are the same species but address the policy issues using a varied characteristics to meet local approaches to privacy, risk, security, and identity assurance. Our conclusion is that convergence of frameworks to a common set of policy criteria is unlikely, as they are necessarily different. Therefore, we have created a tool to allow policy criteria to be expressed and exchanged between trust frameworks and other parties.</p>
<p>This session will share:</p>
 
 An overview of our analysis of the eight trust frameworks 
 The contents of the DNA of Digital ID open criteria exchange framework 
 How the policy criteria will be used in a mixture of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ decision 
processes to enable roaming wallets
 How dynamic level of assurance assessments can be made. 
 A demo of a wallet adapting as it roams from framework to framework.

The “traditional way” of dealing with shadow admins is mapping all of them and letting the identity team decide what to do with it. This approach can work only if the number of shadow admins is small, however, our research, that is based on data of more than 50 organizations, reveals that in most of the big organizations there are hundreds of shadow admins and sometimes even more.<br><br>We will present a novel method that not only finds the shadow admins, but also recommends the identity team which permissions should be revoked to mitigate as many shadow admins as possible. For instance, we discovered that in most organizations more than 70% of the shadow admins can be resolved by revoking one single permission. Our method is based on algorithmic tools and AI. We will share the core concepts of it and show a few real-life examples.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-based-approach-shadow-admins-eic24"></a>

Luckily, AWS provides a very detailed and granular model of roles and predefined policies to define who (or which entity) may be granted to access to which object. All done - right? Unfortunately, either through lack of insight to actual role entitlements or by large number of relations, control over the infrastructure is easily lost.

  <p>In today's cybersecurity landscape, organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of implementing robust Privileged Access Management (PAM) programs. This recognition is primarily driven by regulatory requirements and the growing pressure from malicious actors. However, despite the availability of mature baseline capabilities for PAM products in the market, the implementation of privileged access often falls behind leading practices in typical organizations.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will explore the world of PAM design patterns and anti-patterns, with a specific focus on major use cases. We will explore typical patterns such as isolating accounts, systems, credentials, and networks. Additionally, we will discuss the various options available for defining privileged assets and access, as well as the potential for running Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) projects in parallel with PAM.</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect to consider is the concept of tier models and security domains. We will explore the role of different intermediaries, including Jump Hosts, Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs), and Agents, and their varying security properties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will address the often overlooked aspect of managing Secure Shell (SSH) keys within PAM. Lastly, we will touch upon the importance of having robust procedures in place to handle critical situations in emergency mode.</p>
<p>By understanding these PAM design patterns, organizations can assess their current practices and identify areas for improvement. This talk aims to provide valuable insights and practical guidance for organizations seeking to enhance their PAM programs and align with leading industry practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-design-patterns-eic24"></a>

  <p>UN Strategic Development Goal 16.9 is to bring identity to 8 Billion people… what about enabling 8 billion people to have access to Digital Identity? How can we ensure digital identities are interoperable across borders? What do we need the G20 to do to help accelerate the work already underway? <br> <br> This MasterClass is will engage in these questions and more in the context of the Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI Hub) effort “to define what we need to achieve global interoperability for digital identity.” The SIDI Hub builds upon the OECD Recommendations on the Governance of Digital Identity (38 country adherents), and the “Human-Centric Digital Identity” whitepaper (cobranded by 13 non-profits). The first SIDI Summit was held last November, and convened experts from 21 non-profits, 22 countries, and 4 multilateral organizations (OECD, UN, World Bank, EU), to discuss whether to pursue interoperable digital identity, and if so how to achieve it? The findings of the first event were clear… 92% of attendees agreeing to continue the work in 2024, and the group achieved initial consensus on the tactics that can help the global community achieve digital identity interoperability in practice. <br> <br> During the MasterClass, participants will be asked to take part in an interactive survey. This data will be used to inform the SIDI Hub approach in 2024, and the G20 discussions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/prepare-for-g20-eic24"></a>

We provide new financial services to our sellers, such as keeping funds in the users' accounts for reusing them on eBay to purchase items or to buy shipping labels. In order to secure the accounts of our European sellers and to be compliant with the PSD2 regulation, eBay requires sellers in the EU and UK to use two-factor authentication on our marketplace. This talk describes the journey of eBay offering various two-factor authentications to our millions of users. In particular, eBay was among the first large tech companies offering FIDO2 passkey authentication. We also authenticate access to regulated APIs via eIDAS certificates for licensed third-party providers, as well as protect other sensitive APIs via digital signatures over the payload.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ebays-identity-journey-eic24"></a>

  <p>In this session, Sebastian Elfors gives an introduction into what selective disclosure really means for the EUDI Wallet within eIDAS2. He will delve into the topic of what selectively disclosed attributes are, unlinkability between relying parties, range proofs and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) predicates. He will then dissect the legal definitions of “selective disclosure” within the eIDAS2 proposal as well as the technical definitions in the ARF outline. <br> <br> Next, different selective disclosure schemes are analyzed, including atomic (Q)EAAs schemes, multi-message signature schemes, salted attribute hashes and proofs for arithmetic circuits. The session ends with an in-depth analysis of selective disclosure credential formats and solutions and how they may fit with eIDAS2.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eidas-toolbox-eic24"></a>

  <p>Bots are a scourge on customer identity and access management systems before, during and after the login process. How can we use the power of AI to find malicious bots and protect users while minimizing friction? This session presents real-life examples of bot attacks, AI-based bot mitigation techniques, quantifies their efficacy, and explores what's next for AI in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>AI Chatbots can do your homework, but can they safeguard your users while ensuring a seamless user experience? During this session, we share our firsthand experiences in creating AI controls that strike a balance between robust user protection and minimal user friction.</p>
<p>First, you must know your enemy. Our session will provide a comprehensive perspective from the vantage point of a Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) provider: geographical origins of bots, the networks they exploit, their targets (based on factors such as enterprise size and industry), their tactics to achieve their primary objectives, often revolving around financial gains.</p>
<p>With the backdrop of these threat actors' attempts to exploit CIAM systems, we compare three distinct approaches: a no-control baseline, rule-based controls, and AI-based controls.</p>
<p>AI-driven defenses demonstrate significant improvement from the rule-based baseline systems. Furthermore, an unexpected byproduct of a performing adaptive system like this one, is its quantifiable deterrent effect on bots (Like a lock on a bike, bots are deterred to easier targets).</p>
<p>But are AI-based bot mitigation techniques able to maintain a seamless user experience? The diminution of bot traffic has measurable advantages (more precise modeling of ‘normal’ traffic, ability to see higher quality/lower volume attacks), but AI-systems are probabilistic and cannot be perfect. False Positive Rates (How many humans are challenged by the security control) are a concern for many customers. We discuss tools and recommendations for customer-driven adjustment of risk/friction ratio. We wrap up this section with lessons learned from our journey implementing AI technology in protecting users.</p>
<p>We believe that AI controls will continue to improve user security while simultaneously minimizing friction for users. Then, what is the next challenge for AI-systems in CIAM? Our position is that upcoming challenges will demand paying attention to explainability, privacy and compliance. We are at the dawn of legislation on data privacy and ethics of AI systems, and AI-systems will need to be adequately explainable (deep neural networks aren’t, nor are LLMs) to meet compliance standards. Next year’s security systems will have to balance a third weight in the equation: Security vs Friction vs Explainability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/minimizing-friction-with-ai-eic24"></a>

We will examine real-world scenarios where AI's unintended consequences have sparked significant debates on privacy invasion and the amplification of biases, underscoring the urgent need for a paradigm shift in how these technologies are developed, deployed, and governed.</p>
<p>Imagine the near future of online deceit and manipulation, marked by phenomena such as artificial intimacy, challenged cognitive liberty, and advanced data brokerage.</p>
<p>This presentation aims to foster a more informed discourse on AI, advocating for a future where technology aligns with societal values and contributes to the betterment of humanity rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. Join us as we navigate the murky waters of AI's darker side, emphasizing the importance of responsible innovation and the collaborative effort required to steer the digital future towards ethical horizons.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-shadow-ethical-abyss-eic24"></a>

  <p>The next frontier of customer identity lies not in simply knowing who someone is, but in what they are allowed to do. This is more important than ever in the financial services industry, as the proposed Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3) framework creates further opportunities to deliver highly personalised, secure, and scalable data-driven services through Open Banking. At the same time, customers are pushing their providers to give them the tools needed to delegate control of their finances to trusted persons, while doing more to secure their accounts against fraud.<br><br>The good news is that Dynamic Authorisation is purpose-built to address these industry problems. By centralising authorisation decisioning and enforcement, financial service providers can streamline authorisation workflows, ensure consistent and secure data sharing with third-party providers, improve loyalty and reduce fraud – all in one. Policy-based authorisation takes this even further by enabling dynamic rules that adapt to real-time context and risk factors.<br><br>Join authorisation experts Adam Rusbridge and Adam Preis of Ping Identity to learn how Dynamic Authorization can enable:<br><br></p>
 
 Fine-grained control: Define and enforce access controls for payments, transfers, account settings and data requests, minimising security risks and regulatory compliance headaches. 
 Enhanced user experience: Streamline API interactions and reduce friction for TPPs, accelerating Open Banking and Open Finance investments. 
 Data monetisation: Leverage granular control over data access opens doors for innovative data-driven services and revenue streams. 
 Agility and scalability: Respond swiftly to changing market needs and regulatory landscapes with adaptable authorisation policies.

However, it has historically been difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last six years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.<br> <br> There are challenges when trying to achieve high security and interoperability with OAuth 2: There are many potential threats, some not part of the original OAuth threat model. For seamless authorizations, optionality must be minimized in OAuth itself and also in any extensions used.<br> <br> Seven years ago, the IETF OAuth working group began work on the Security Best Current Practice document and more recently on OAuth 2.1. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation has created FAPI1 and FAPI2 security profiles.<br> <br> We will help you understand the focus of each document and when to use which. We show how to achieve on-the-wire interoperability and security using techniques like asymmetric client authentication and sender-constraining via DPoP and MTLS, discussing the benefits and potential disadvantages of each.
