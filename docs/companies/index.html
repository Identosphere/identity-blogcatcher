<p>Der Regierungsrat hat am 25. April 2018 die
Strategie «<a href="https://rr.zh.ch/dam/regierungsrat/rat/pdf/kommissionen/sdi/strategie/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf.spooler.download.1531402793115.pdf/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf">Digitale
Verwaltung</a>» festgesetzt. Sie zeigt auf, wie die Verwaltung die digitale
Entwicklung gestalten und die Chance der Digitalisierung nutzen will. Teil der
Strategie ist ein Impulsprogramm mit Digitalisierungsvorhaben, die vorrangig
und eng koordiniert angegangen werden. Das Impulsprogramm umfasst unter Ziel 1
«Vereinfachung und Ausbau des digitalen Leistungsangebotes» auch das Projekt
«IP1.5: Studie zum Einsatz der Blockchain-Technologie». Procivis&nbsp;wurde
mit der Ausarbeitung dieser Studie betraut. Wir veröffentlichen hier die
Zusammenfassung der Studie.&nbsp;Den Link zur gesamten Studie&nbsp;ist am Ende
des Blogs zu finden</p>



 Zusammenfassung 



<p>Eine Blockchain ist die
Aneinanderreihung von Datensätzen, Blöcke genannt, die durch kryptographische
Verfahren miteinander fest verkettet sind. Die Darstellung von Informationen
als Kette (“Chain“) von Blöcken (“Block“)
ergibt das Kunstwort Blockchain. Die Verkettung der Blöcke mittels Hashes
erlaubt es, die gesamte Vorgeschichte einer Blockchain jeweils in den neuesten
Block zu kondensieren. Damit entsteht ein unverfälschbarer Audit-Trail.</p>



<p>Blockchains können
unterschiedlich konzipiert werden. Erstens wird differenziert bezüglich des
Grads der Zugangsrechte (Unterscheidung nach Lese- und Schreiberechten).
Zweitens wird unterschieden nach Konsensregeln, die festlegen, wer den
nächsten Block berechnen und publizieren darf. Es besteht eine logische
Abhängigkeit zwischen Zugangsrechten und Konsensregeln. Blockchains, die Lese-
und Schreibrechte uneingeschränkt gewähren, wenden normalerweise die
Konsensregel Proof-of-Work an. Bei dieser Konsensregel ist die Rechenleistung
der einzelnen Teilnehmer der entscheidende Faktor. Bekannteste Beispiele dieser
Art von Blockchain sind Bitcoin und Ethereum. Diese Art von Blockchains hat
sich bezüglich der Sicherheit als robust erwiesen; ihr grösster Nachteil ist,
dass der Skalierung – also der Fähigkeit, grosse Mengen von Transaktionen
durchzuführen, Grenzen gesetzt sind. Zudem brauchen sie grosse Mengen Energie.
Am anderen Ende des Blockchain-Spektrums bewegen sich private Blockchains, wo
sowohl Lese- wie auch Schreibrechte auf einen ausgewählten Kreis beschränkt
sind. Hier stellt die Skalierung kein sonderliches Problem dar; auch der
Energieverbrauch ist bei solchen Blockchains vernachlässigbar. Allerdings
bieten solche Blockchains aufgrund der fehlenden Transparenz und
Dezentralisierung nicht die gleichen Vorteile wie öffentliche Blockchains.</p>



<p>Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass
Blockchains dynamischen Charakter haben, also die Entwicklung von einzelnen
Datenpunkten über die Zeit darstellen, ist es möglich, auf der Blockchain
Transaktionen in Abhängigkeit von Bedingungen zu programmieren. Dies geschieht
mittels Smart Contracts. Diese sorgen dafür, dass Transaktionen
ausgeführt werden, sobald eine gewisse Bedingung erfüllt ist. Dies erlaubt es,
auch komplexe Transaktionen weitergehend zu automatisieren.</p>



<p>Die Blockchain-Technologie wurde
ursprünglich entwickelt, um über eine Infrastruktur zu verfügen, die ohne eine
zentrale Autorität auskommt. Deshalb stellt sich die Frage, inwiefern es für
den Staat Sinn macht, diese Technologie einzusetzen, ist er als Inhaber des physischen
Gewaltmonopols doch das Sinnbild einer zentralen Autorität. Im Falle eines idealen
Staates, der effizient und ordnungsgemäss arbeitet, bedeutet die Anwendung
der Blockchain-Technologie eine Verkomplizierung; zentrale Datenbanken genügen.
Ein besonderer Anwendungsbereich bilden demokratische Wahl- und
Abstimmungsverfahren, bei denen Bürgerinnen und Bürger ihr Wahlgeheimnis
gewahrt wissen, gleichzeitig aber auch sicher sein wollen, dass ihr politischer
Wille korrekt ins Ergebnis einfliesst. Auf öffentlichen Blockchains wäre dies
möglich; allerdings zum Preis der Unmöglichkeit der späteren Vernichtung der
Wahlunterlagen.</p>



<p>Staaten weichen vom Ideal ab, indem sie Strukturen und Prozesse aufweisen,
die einen mehr oder weniger effizienten Mitteleinsatz zur Folge haben. Zudem
können sich Amtsträgerinnen und Amtsträger und Staatsangestellte mehr oder
weniger gesetzeskonform verhalten bzw. Fehler machen. Blockchains können die
damit verbundenen Ineffizienzen mildern, indem sie die Grundlage für
Datenkonsistenz bieten. Darauf aufbauend können Prozesse weiter digitalisiert
und automatisiert werden, und (unbeabsichtigtes) menschliches Fehlverhalten
kann besser kontrolliert werden. Blockchains verhindern gesetzeswidriges
Verhalten nicht per se, aber ein jederzeit einsehbarer und unverfälschbarer
Audit-Trail erhöht den Druck, sich korrekt zu verhalten.</p>



<p>Der Nutzen einer
Blockchain-Lösung kann sich nur entfalten, wenn die entsprechenden
Rahmenbedingungen gegeben sind. Jeder Veränderungsprozess setzt politischen
Willen und Führungsverantwortung voraus. Dies ist bei allfälligen
Blockchain-Anwendungen umso mehr der Fall, weil deren Implementation
Konsequenzen haben, die über technische Aspekte weit hinausgehen. Neben
organisatorischen und kulturellen Fragen sind insbesondere auch rechtliche
Fragen zu beachten: Erstens ist jeweils zu prüfen, ob für eine
Blockchain-Anwendung die erforderliche rechtliche Grundlage vorhanden
ist und zweitens, ob diese mit dem Datenschutzrecht in Einklang, und
drittens, ob eine rechtskonforme Archivierung möglich ist. Den
verfassungsmässig garantierten Rechten – Schutz von Personendaten, Recht auf
Korrektur und Löschung, Recht auf Erinnerung (die zueinander in Konkurrenz
stehen können) – ist Rechnung zu tragen.</p>



<p>Im Zuge der allgemeinen
Begeisterung über die Blockchain-Technologie im Allgemeinen und Kryptowährungen
im Speziellen sind weltweit hunderte Konzepte formuliert und Pilotprojekte für Blockchain-Anwendungen
in öffentlichen Verwaltungen durchgeführt worden. Produktive Anwendungen
mit namhaften Transaktionsvolumina sind aber noch keine bekannt. Dieser Befund
trifft auch auf die Schweiz zu: IIm Rahmen dieser Studie konnten acht
Blockchain-Projekte identifiziert werden, in denen kantonale Verwaltungen und
das Fürstentum Liechtenstein in den Bereichen Register, elektronische
Identitäten, E-Voting und Bezahlung von Gebühren erste Erfahrungen gesammelt
haben oder sammeln. Diese Projekte sind abgeschlossen worden, teilweise noch im
Gang oder in Vorbereitung. </p>



<p>Auf der Grundlage von
Prozessbeschreibungen, die im Rahmen des Projekts «Strategie Datenmanagement
und Data-Governance IP3.1» erarbeitet worden sind, wurden im Rahmen der
vorliegenden Studie vier mögliche Anwendungsbeispiele für den Kanton Zürich
entwickelt:</p>



  Registrierung von amtlichen Dokumenten auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Bürgerdossier mit Blockchain-basiertem Logbuch zur Stärkung der Rechtssicherheit  Inventarkontrolle auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Öffentliche Ausschreibungen auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  



<p></p>



<p>Der Reifegrad dieser Beispiele ist unterschiedlich, ebenso wie die Schwierigkeiten bei einer allfälligen Umsetzung. Allen ist jedoch gemeinsam, dass sie sich die unmittelbare und nicht mehr verfälschbare Transparenz von Blockchains zunutze machen. Zentrale Datenbanken sind nicht dafür ausgelegt, einem grossen Kreis in dynamischer Weise Transparenz zu bieten. Eine solche Funktion kann zwar auch in zentralen Architekturen nachgebaut werden, Blockchains lösen das Problem jedoch eleganter. Hinzu kommt, dass dezentrale Architekturen, wie sie Blockchains aufweisen, tendenziell einen Vertrauensvorsprung bieten, der von zentral konzipierten Lösungen nicht eingeholt werden kann.</p>

<p>Forty-two percent of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020/">data and analytics</a>&nbsp;leaders do not assess, measure or monitor their data and analytics governance, according to a recent Gartner survey. Those who said they measured their <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-best-ways-to-organize-your-data-structures/">governance activity</a>&nbsp;mainly focused on achieving compliance-oriented goals.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<blockquote><p>Good data and analytics governance enables faster, smarter decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good data and analytics governance enables faster, smarter decisions. Organizations that want to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-create-a-business-case-for-data-quality-improvement/">improve the quality of their data</a> often begin with data and analytics governance projects.</p>
<p>Companies start data and analytics governance initiatives to drive better information behaviors through their policies. These policies help maximize the investment that organizations have not just in data and analytics, but also content (pictures, voice recordings, emails, etc.) coming from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">AI </a>and IoT, for example. However, governance practices continue to be data-oriented rather than business-oriented.</p>
<p>CDOs and data and analytics leaders must ensure that their governance initiatives have concrete, measurable metrics that link data and analytics assets and initiatives to business and stakeholder value. For example, tie customer contact data quality to the percentage of customer retention in a specific market segment or percentage of revenue achieved via ecosystem partners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data quality is not solely the job of the IT organization</p>
</blockquote>
 Involve the broader organization in data governance 
<p>Data quality is not solely the job of the IT organization. Data governance work must rally stakeholders to the cause, and IT and the business must be clear on the roles they play. The business decides expectations for data quality, but the business also needs to understand that IT does not own data governance and is not responsible for data quality.</p>
<p>The key to resolving this challenge is for data and analytics leaders and CDOs to connect all governance activity specifically and directly with business outcomes and priorities.</p>

  When it comes to identity management many companies depend heavily on Microsoft Active Directory (AD). This high degree of dependency on one service can become a problem when this service faces an outage. Also, respective of the requirements companies have, all services have certain limitations which are sometimes necessary to overcome. Many cyberattacks are perpetrated via staff endpoint devices (computers, smartphones or even printers). This necessitates a fine-mesh risk management approach with a centralized solution, called Identity Fabric at KuppingerCole.

					 <p>“Identifiers” are how you are identified as a unique person and recognized as that same unique person over time. With other people, your primary identifier is your face. With organizations, it might be a student ID, social security number, or driver’s license number. Online, it might be a username, phone number, or email address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using identifiers properly helps to avoid confusing two people with one another. But identifiers can also be harmful—if a hacker gets ahold of your social security number, it could mean trouble!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most identifiers are given to us by centralized registration authorities like governments, telephone companies, and email providers. But that puts an organization in between us and our ability to access basic services, compromising privacy and putting individuals in a position of powerlessness. The answer to this problem is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standard</a> called Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 A new type of identifier 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>DIDs are “a new type of globally unique identifier”¹ that is used in <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). It looks like this:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>You’ll notice it has three parts:<br><br></p>  Scheme: DIDs all start with <code>did:</code> just like how all website addresses start with <code>http://</code> . This is so that computers can tell what they’re looking at.  Method: After DIDs are generated, they have to be stored somewhere. They’re often stored in a blockchain or a digital wallet, but they can be stored anywhere. The method, which is the <code>example:</code> part of the DID in the example above, tells computers where to go to find the DID. For example, issuers of verifiable credentials in the Trinsic platform get a DID that has a <code>did:sov:</code> method, because the DID goes on the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.  Identifier: This is the unique identifier of the DID.  <p>According to the W3C, a DID has the following four characteristics²:<br><br></p>  Decentralized: There should be no central issuing agency. That means you should be able to create your own DIDs independently of anyone else.  Persistent: The identifier should be inherently persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization. This is in contrast to your email, for example; if Gmail shuts down, you’d lose access to your Gmail messages.  Crytopgraphically verifiable: It should be possible to prove control of the identifier cryptographically.  Resolvable: It should be possible to discover metadata about the identifier.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How are DIDs used? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As identifiers in the Trinsic system, DIDs serve two primary functions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Publicly identifying credential issuers  Privately identifying relationships (connections)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Credential issuers need to be publicly identifiable if they want the credentials they issue to be verifiable. We use a blockchain to post the issuers’ DID, which acts as a public key. The issuer signs the credential attributes with the corresponding private key.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each relationship in the Trinsic system is called a connection. When you make a connection, you create a DID just for that relationship and share it with the counterparty. When you want to send messages, you encrypt them so that only the counterparty can decrypt the message using the DID you shared with them. This creates a super secure, peer-to-peer channel to interact. The identifiers for these connections are kept privately in your (and the counterparty’s) wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about DIDs, feel free to <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a> or read the W3C’s DID specification at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/</a>.</p>

<p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1315944646">https://bihu.com/article/1315944646</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 1,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   Last week, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $601 million to $16,556&nbsp;million.  Tether additionally issued 450 million USDT on Tron&nbsp;twice.  On August 29, China Construction Bank briefly opened its digital currency wallet business to the&nbsp;public.  The digital currency wallet of CCB supports features such as digital RMB bank card recharge, transfer, QR code receipt and payment, NFC one-touch payment, and cancellation.  MakerDAO stated that there had been applications from companies in the fields of treasury bonds, real estate, gold and commodity indexes, and supply chain finance to use assets as collateral for&nbsp;DAI.  Aave applied for an Electronic Money Institution license from the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom in 2018, which was approved in July this year. Aave will continue to apply for other licenses.  Tether additionally issued 10 million USDT on EOS on August 29 due to the increased DeFi activity on&nbsp;EOS.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(August 22, 2020 ~ August 28, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market circulation of major stablecoins has increased by $601 million to $16,556&nbsp;million.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, Tether additionally issued 450 million USDT on Tron twice. The circulation of USDC, PAX, TUSD, HUSD, DAI, and GUSD were increased by 86.48 million, 17.97 million, 3.01 million, 1.24 million, 15.06 million, and 1.28 million, and the circulation of BUSD decreased by&nbsp;980,000.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all decreased by&nbsp;10,1991.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of TUSD and DAI increased by 645, and 3,860. The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC and PAX decreased by 88,075, 18,249 and&nbsp;172.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week increased by an average of 4.75% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;3.13%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 6.85% from the previous&nbsp;week.</p> 2. The connection between stablecoins and real&nbsp;assets <p>On August 29, China Construction Bank briefly opened its digital currency wallet business to the public. Through the ‘digital currency’ feature in the China Construction Bank App, you can use the digital RMB, which is China’s CBDC. The wallet of CCB supports features such as digital RMB bank card recharge, transfer, QR code receipt and payment, NFC one-touch payment, and cancellation. Since CBDC is equivalent to legal currency and cannot be rejected, and Alipay and WeChat may also access digital RMB in the future. CBDC is also a kind of stablecoin. It is foreseeable that CBDC will be used by many people as a supplementary payment method. In this report, we will introduce the connection between stablecoins and real&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Since this year, MakerDAO has added USDC, WBTC, etc. as collateral. Last week MakerDAO stated that in the next 1–3 years, the focus of Maker will be on introducing physical assets as collateral for DAI. There have been applications from companies in the fields of treasury bonds, real estate, gold and commodity indexes, and supply chain finance to use assets as collateral for DAI. Companies and assets being applied for&nbsp;include:</p>  Real estate mortgage company New Silver implements asset tokenization using Centrifuge protocol (NS-DROP).  The trust company Paxos issued the ERC20 gold token PAX GOLD on Ethereum&nbsp;(PAXG).  Arca issued digital securities on Ethereum in the form of ARCoin (corresponding to 1-year, 2–10 year, and 10-year US government bonds).  Supply chain finance company Harbor uses the Centrifuge protocol to initiate asset tokenization (HTC-DROP).  WiV Technology launched Tokenized Wine Commodity Index Fund on Ethereum&nbsp;(WiV).  <p>The above is only being applied for as part of the collateral for DAI. Without the introduction of real assets, now DAI has 443 million in circulation, and the market capitalization of MKR has reached $676&nbsp;million.</p><p>Aave is a decentralized lending protocol, managed by AaveDAO. As early as 2018, Aave applied for an Electronic Money Institution license from the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom, and it was finally approved recently. This allows Aave to get the same as Coinbase and Revolut in Europe, which can issue electronic currency substitutes and provide payment services. Aave users can buy stablecoins and other assets in the Aave ecosystem through legal currency. Stani Kulechov, the founder of Aave, stated that Aave entities will continue to apply for other licenses to facilitate new users to join the Aave ecosystem.</p><p>Telos is a smart contract platform running on EOSIO, supporting the creation of decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous organizations. At the end of August, Telos announced a partnership with Katalyo to tokenize $35 million worth of Croatian real estate. Katalyo will issue two tokens for each real estate. One token represents the ownership of the real estate, and the other is a stablecoin anchored in legal currency generated by rental&nbsp;income.</p><p>As a global payment company, VISA is committed to providing the greatest value to individuals, businesses, and economies. Digital currency provides an opportunity for VISA to continue to expand its service range. Nowadays, the digital currency (stablecoin) backed by legal currency combines the stability of digital currency with currencies such as the U.S. dollar to become a promising new payment method. The concept of stablecoins has gradually attracted attention outside the financial technology field, including financial institutions and central banks. Consumers and businesses are also using digital currencies, leading to rapid growth in the circulation of digital currencies. VISA cooperates with the regulated and approved digital currency platforms Coinbase and Fold, etc., to provide services to the blockchain for the existing 61 million merchants. More than 25 digital currency wallets have been connected to VISA, which provides users with an easy way to use VISA debit or prepaid cards to spend from their digital currency balances wherever VISA is accepted. VISA has been committed to cooperating with global policymakers and organizations to help everyone better understand digital currencies.</p><p>According to the twitter tweeted by Sygnum on August 27, Galaxus, the largest online retailer in Switzerland, started using Sygnum Bank’s stablecoin Digital Swiss Franc (DCHF) to complete e-commerce payments. DCHF was launched in March 2020 and is anchored to the Swiss franc. Sygnum claims to be the first licensed bank in Switzerland to issue stablecoins. The bank holds a digital asset banking license from the Swiss&nbsp;FINMA.</p><p>The use of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market is a trend. Not only companies in the blockchain industry are actively attracting external capital to join, but also traditional financial institutions. It is foreseeable that stablecoins will enter our daily lives in the&nbsp;future.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>Earlier this year, ForgeRock published our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2020-consumer-identity-breach-report">2020 Consumer Identity Breach Report</a> detailing insights and data on breaches impacting consumers in 2019 and Q1 2020. As highlighted in the report, healthcare was, once again, the most frequently targeted industry (43% of all breaches), personal identifiable information (PII) accounted for the most sought after data type at 98%, and unauthorized access was by far the most common attack vector, responsible for 40% of breaches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As overburdened healthcare IT professionals work tirelessly to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals are using the global health crisis to take advantage of institutions by exploiting unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This reality means the healthcare industry must protect against two threats at once. Neither is simple. IT professionals need to ask themselves whether they can identify high risk anomalous access. And just as importantly, explore how AI can help by automating access requests, performing certifications, and predicting what access should be provisioned to users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions fall short in their ability to address the healthcare industry’s risk landscape and cannot meet its demanding and ever-changing requirements. Why? Simply put, IGA solutions don’t provide organization-wide visibility or identity context especially as identities continue to increase in multiple applications and locations (on-premise, cloud, etc.). This leaves your risk and security teams struggling to keep up as they manually provision access privileges and rubber stamp access requests and certifications. Additionally, the resulting operational inefficiencies can leave your teams blind as to who has access to what and, more importantly, why they have access in the first place. So, what’s the cure?&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a> is an AI-driven identity analytics solution that can be layered on top of, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/autonomous-identity-maximize-your-identity-investments-ai-driven-identity-analytics">integrated with, your existing IGA solutions</a> to provide real-time and continuous organization-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation. Autonomous Identity analyzes all identity data to give you a deeper understanding into the risk associated with user access across the entire organization. The solution ingests vast amounts of workforce, partner, and consumer (patients/members) identity data from existing identity management and governance solutions, identity stores, and user activity repositories to provide wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access.</p>

<p>For example, one of the largest healthcare retailers in the United States used ForgeRock Autonomous Identity to bring visibility and contextual insight to their employee records, applications, entitlements, and entitlement assignments. The result was 550,000 entitlement assignments identified for AI-driven automation and clean-up; an accomplishment that would have taken a lot of resources and months, if not years, for IT teams to do manually.</p>

<p>As the customer story above exemplifies, Autonomous Identity enables your risk and security teams to accomplish the seemingly impossible — reducing risk, manual processes, and costs with one solution across your disparate identity enterprise.</p>

  <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for digitization in many companies and led to an increase in remote work and adoption of the bring your own device (BYOD) policy. Every device and digital service that employees use is a potential gateway into company networks and thus poses a security risk. The risks are magnified even more when privileged accounts enter the equation because they enable access to critical data. Given the immediacy and speed with which companies had to shift from office to remote work, security concerns were often neglected leading to an increase in successful cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Facing this situation of increased risks and attack vectors, companies need to have foolproof security in place to keep their data safe and secure. IT teams should start with the very basics such as giving the company staff cybersecurity awareness trainings and monitoring remote access. While it has become a well-known fact that Privileged Access Management (PAM)&nbsp; is an integral part of cybersecurity in modern companies, Secure Compliance Management (SCM) and&nbsp;User Behaviour Analytics (UBA) perhaps have not been given proper attention in the security world yet.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/remote_workforce_security"></a>

<p>As organizations have accelerated their investments in digital initiatives, business and app teams have embraced the DevOps model, a process that speeds up software delivery. DevOps enables businesses to be agile enough to quickly adapt or be the first to market, which can have a tremendous impact on the bottom line.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for identity to join the DevOps party. For far too long, identity initiatives have been stretched to their limits while struggling to keep pace with application growth. DevOps is starting to gain traction in the identity space—and for good reason, since identity is a key part of application onboarding. Without collaboration between identity teams and DevOps teams, many of the intended benefits of DevOps can quickly unravel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is DevOps? 
<p>The DevOps methodology for software development breaks down traditional silos by eliminating manual tasks and replacing them with automation via code so that releases and updates can be pushed out faster and more frequently. At its core, DevOps improves the efficiencies between app development and IT operations or infrastructure teams. Previously, developers would make manual requests to identity teams or IT ops and lose valuable time. In DevOps, the identity teams enable the software to be consumable via APIs or infrastructure-as-code, the preferred methods for developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the DevOps model has specific tools for implementation. The most common include Docker, which enables software in images or “containers,” and Kubernetes, the orchestration engine that manages containers. These tools allow developers to easily spin up infrastructure and perform updates with minimal interruption.</p>

   Back in the days of DOS, software developers couldn’t count much on fancy tools. There were no graphical interfaces, and everything was purely text-based.

  <p>Back in the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a>, software developers couldn’t count much on fancy tools. There were no graphical interfaces, and everything was purely text-based. I remember using <a href="http://www.briefeditor.com/index.htm">brief</a> as an editor for my C source files (C++ didn’t exist yet), and compiling the code from the command line with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_C">Aztec C</a> compiler. The most advanced concept of a non-trivial software project was based on <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile">makefiles</a>. The idea of grabbing a mouse and moving it around the desk to operate a computer would have been hilarious (or disgusting maybe!). No clicks or taps, only keystrokes - and a lot of them.</p>

<p>With the appearance of the graphical OSs, and point-and-click devices, we grew bored of hitting keys; it annoys us when there is no reason to click or tap, and we are forced to go back to the keyboard. The annoyance escalates sometimes to anger if there is not a shortcut or a copy-and-paste solution and we have to write down the full command, character-by-character!</p>

<p>While graphical interfaces are very convenient and user-friendly, they are not ideal with repetitive sequences of operations. Modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> aims to make faster infrastructure configuration and application deployment. The availability of a tooling system that allows scripting these operations on automated and streamlined workflows is paramount to achieve better performances.</p>

 Command-Line? Discover Why 

<p>With .NET Core and Azure Microsoft aiming to gain a bigger share in the software development industry, non-Windows operating system’s ban policy adopted in the past by the Redmond giant gave way to a new era where different mainstream operating systems and devices (like Linux, macOS, iOS and Android) are embraced as allied, instead of fought against as competitors in the software business.</p>

<p>In addition to the graphical-first approach that characterized .NET Framework, .NET Core and Azure offer complete command-line-oriented tooling, including a built-in Linux integration (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL</a>, Windows Subsystem for Linux).</p>

<p>In this tutorial I am going to demonstrate how you can create and deploy to the Cloud an application including Okta Security services using the .NET Core and the Azure command-line interface tools, respectively known as dotnet and az.</p>

 Requirements 

<p>The resources used for this post are:</p>

 
   A computer with a .NET Core compatible Operating System (I used Windows 10) 
   A modern internet browser (I used Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) 
   An <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure account</a> (Free Tier is ok) 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Development account</a> 
   Your favorite text editor (I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">ASP.NET Core SDK</a> (I am using version 3.1.401) 
   The Azure Command Line Interface (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">Azure CLI</a>) tool 
 

 Prep an ASP.NET Core Application for the Azure CLI 

<p>In this paragraph you will create a new ASP.NET Core application using dotnet and add the Okta security layer with a text editor.</p>

<p>Create a basic ASP.NET Core MVC application, using the dotnet CLI and the mvc template and Check that it works as expected.</p>

   <code>dotnet new mvc -n okta-cli-app
</code>   

<p>Then run the application.</p>

   <code>dotnet run
</code>   

<p>The output should look like the following:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The application is now served at the two addresses indicated in the log messages; open your browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:5000</code>. You should get the following page:</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the browser has been redirected to the URL <code>https://localhost:5001</code>. This is because the standard template includes by default a redirection to to the secure protocol (<code>app.UseHttpsRedirection()</code> is called by <code>Configure()</code> in <code>Startup.cs</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are now ready to add the authentication and authorization features: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>, of course! Stop the running app by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal.</p>

<p>To make the necessary code changes, a simple text editor would be enough. In this case, I am using Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p>Add the <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package to the project.</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>This modifies the project file okta-cli-app.cspro, adding an entry for the dependency.</p>

   <code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Okta.AspNetCore" Version="3.3.0" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code>   

<p>Modify <code>Startup.cs</code> as follows</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace okta_cli_app
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
            {
                options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            })
           .AddCookie()
           .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
           {
                // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
                OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:OktaDomain"),
               ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
               ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
               Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
           });

            services.AddControllersWithViews();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                app.UseHsts();
            }
            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now the application is fully equipped with the Okta middleware to manage Authentication and Authorization. However, there isn’t any part of the application using it, yet.</p>

<p>Whenever you put an Authorize attribute declaration on a Controller or Action, The ASP.NET Core runtime verifies that a user is logged in and has been granted the necessary authority. If not, you are redirected to the Okta login page.</p>

<p>In this case, we are going to implement an explicit Sign In/Sign Out feature, with two links in the top bar of the front-end User Interface.</p>

<p>Add <code>AccountControllers.cs</code> to the project, under the Controllers folder.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace okta_cli_app.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult SignIn()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult SignOut()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
                new[]
                {
                     OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                     CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                },
                new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>As you can see, the new controller provides the two actions, one for Signing In and one for Signing Out.</p>

<p>Finally, add two links to the top bar of the UI, with the following razor code in <code>_Layout.cshtml</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse"&gt;
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="nav-link" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut" method="post"&gt;
                    &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark" id="logout-button"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn" id="login-button"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    }
    &lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;  
</code>   

 Set Up Your Okta Application for Azure 

<p>The application is now ready to provide its services, enriched with a state-of-the-art security framework, in conjunction with a first-class Cloud-based authentication/authorization provider as Okta. You have probably realized that something is missing: I have done nothing (yet) to inform the provider that my brand new application, okta-cli-app, is going to ask it to manage authentication and authorization matters on its behalf.
To fix this I need to set up a proper configuration in Okta and bind my ASP.NET Core project to it.</p>

<p>If you haven’t yet got an Okta developer account, please <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">sign up</a> and grab one, it’s quick and free. You will need one to perform the next step.</p>

<p>Login to your Okta developer account and create a new application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is how it looks after I have filled all the necessary fields:</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the TCP port 5001 must be the same used by the application. You can see it in the messages displayed in the terminal when you start the application with <code>dotnet run</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the bottom of the page, you see two fields containing cryptic strings, named Client ID and Client secret.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A third fundamental value you need to complete the configuration process is the Okta domain URL, which has been created for you when you signed up for your new account. You can find it on the top-right of the dashboard page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Insert these three values in the appsettings.json file in the ASP.NET Core project:</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "https://dev-509249.okta.com",
    "ClientId": "0oaq5vf8fzPfAljzy4x6",
    "ClientSecret": "HoGyxgDTrMfNqDp4RO234CEQxDAwuXnZm2FycON-"
  }  
}

</code>   

<p>Go back to the terminal and start it again.</p>

   <code>dotnet run
</code>   

<p>Point your browser to <code>http://localhost:5000</code> once again and you should see the same page as before but with a Sign In link on the left of the top bar.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can now click on Sign In and get redirected to the Okta login page. Once logged in, you’ll see the top bar changing.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though this post is about using the command line tooling rather than the IDE’s plugins or the portal user experience, I haven’t done so when creating the Okta application. It’s worth mentioning here that Okta services are offered through the portal, a Web API interface and an SDK (Okta.Sdk) - but the new <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a> tool has just been released! This allows DevOps engineers to fully automate the Okta account and application setting management and integrate Okta configurations in the CI/CD pipelines.</p>
</blockquote>

 The Azure CLI Cloud Deployment Process 

<p>Microsoft Azure allows us to setup and configure everything right from the Azure Portal. While this is very convenient while learning, it’s not ideal when the same sequences of operations need to be repeated. Modern DevOps aim to make faster infrastructure configuration and application deployment. The availability of a tooling system that allows you to script these operations on automated and streamlined workflows is necessary in order to achieve better performance. I am now going to demonstrate how you can deploy the application we just created to Azure, using the Azure Command Line Interface (Azure CLI, a.k.a az).</p>

   <code>az login
</code>   

<p>This command opens a browser page where you are requested to login to your Microsoft account. This means, of course, that to proceed with the following steps you need to have an Azure account and a valid (even free-tier) subscription.
Once logged in (you only need to do this once), you can begin creating resources.</p>

<p>Create a Resource Group:</p>

   <code>az group create -n okta-cli-rg
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Create an Application Service Plan:</p>

   <code>az appservice plan create -n okta-cli-plan --resource-group okta-cli-rg --sku FREE
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Create the Application Service Instance:</p>

   <code>az webapp create -g okta-cli-rg -p okta-cli-plan -n okta-cli-app
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Your application is now deployed to the Cloud and available to the world at the address <code>https://okta-cli-app.azurewebsites.net/</code>. But before trying it, don’t forget that you need to align the URLs in your Okta application to the new address. You do that simply replacing the Okta application page, the old <code>http://localhost:5000</code> with the new  <code>https://okta-cli-app.azurewebsites.net/</code> in all the fields that contain it (should be three).</p>

<p>You can now open the browser and surf to <code>https://okta-cli-app.azurewebsites.net/</code>. Or, if you prefer, automate this step as well with another console command.</p>

   <code>az webapp browse -n okta-cli-app
</code>   

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>

 Recap 

<p>In this article, I explored the basics of two command-line interface utilities (ASP.NET Core CLI and Azure CLI) and showed how to use them to create, build and deploy to the Cloud a web application, without using an IDE or a web portal.</p>

<p>What you learned:</p>

 
   Create an ASP.NET Core web application with dotnet new 
   Add Okta ASP.NET Core package to the application with dotnet add 
   Implement a basic Sign In/Sign Out workflow using Okta 
   Build and run the application with dotnet run 
   Login the local Azure CLI to your Azure account with az login 
   Create an Azure resource group with az group create 
   Create an Azure application service plan with az appservice plan create 
   Create an Azure application service instance with az webapp create 
   Launch the browser and point it to an Azure application using az webapp browse

 The GiD Report #125 — Everyone v. Apple, Discord’s Groups&nbsp;vision <p>Happy Monday everyone,</p><p>If you haven’t had a chance to check it out ye, check out our first employee profile interview featuring Erik! This was a fun&nbsp;one:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team — Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>  <p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Quick updates on the war against Apple’s App&nbsp;Store  Facebook’s multi-pronged fight with&nbsp;Apple  Discord’s long term vision (it sounds a little like&nbsp;Groups)  The shifting challenges of platform moderation  Symbolic: ExxonMobile booted from&nbsp;Dow  Stuff happens   1. We’ve been covering the battle between Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games and Apple’s App Store so a couple of quick updates for&nbsp;you. <p>First, the initial judge ruling, via The Information:</p><blockquote>A federal judge denied a request by Epic Games for a temporary restraining order that would have forced Apple to allow Fortnite, a popular Epic videogame, back into the App Store. But that same judge granted another request by Epic to stop Apple from kicking it out of a developer program.</blockquote><p>….</p><blockquote>In a court filing, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Epic had not shown that it was at risk of irreparable harm from Apple, which removed Fortnite from the App Store last week after Epic began violating its policies. Epic modified Fortnite to bypass an Apple payment mechanism, which in turn enabled Epic to avoid paying Apple the standard 30% commission it collects on in-app transactions.</blockquote>Photo: Mike Deerkoski<blockquote>But the judge ruled that Epic was more persuasive about the harm that could have resulted from another matter — a threat by Apple to deny Epic access to developer tools for its iOS and Mac operating systems. Epic depends on those tools for the development of Unreal Engine, an Epic product used by many outside companies to build&nbsp;games.</blockquote><blockquote>The judge said that Apple had “chosen to act severely” and that denying Epic access to the developer could have hurt games made by independent companies. The judge ordered Epic to file a motion for a longer-term injunction by Sept. 4 and a hearing it on the matter is scheduled for Sept.&nbsp;28.</blockquote><p>Apple has also made peace with Wordpress creator Automattic:</p><blockquote>Apple says it has come to an agreement with Automattic, which operates the WordPress content management system application, after Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg announced on Friday that Apple had blocked updates for the iOS version of WordPress until he agreed to add in-app purchases.</blockquote><p>The first couple of skirmishes but the war is far from&nbsp;over.</p><p>In any case, Ben Thompson thinks <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Apple’s App Store policy is bad for innovation, bad for customers, and ultimately bad for&nbsp;Apple</a>.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/from-kingmaker-to-autocrat-how-game-makers-went-to-war-with-apple">From Kingmaker to ‘Autocrat’: How Game Makers Went to War With&nbsp;Apple</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402547/fortnite-epic-games-apple-ios-macos-two-different-games">Fortnite is splitting into two different games because of Epic and Apple’s&nbsp;fight</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-makers-apple-fight-leaves-some-developers-wary-11598274027?mod=djem10point">‘Fortnite’ Maker’s Apple Fight Leaves Some Developers Wary</a>  Ben Thompson — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Rethinking the App&nbsp;Store</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3htFFcoo6Lc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Linus weighs in on Apple vs Epic&nbsp;Games</a>   2. In part because Facebook has joined the chat. That’s because Apple’s policies are a threat to Mark Zuckerberg’s long term vision of making Facebook more of a super app in the vein of&nbsp;WeChat. <p>He made that pretty clear in a company wide town hall last week, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">reported by Buzzfeed</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a swing at Apple on Thursday, calling the iPhone maker’s app store monopolistic and harmful to customers during a companywide meeting.</blockquote><blockquote>“[Apple has] this unique stranglehold as a gatekeeper on what gets on phones,” Zuckerberg said to more than 50,000 employees via webcast. He added that the Cupertino, California–based company’s app store “blocks innovation, blocks competition” and “allows Apple to charge monopoly&nbsp;rents.”</blockquote><p>Mark has a point and it’s one reason why China has superapps while the rest of us don’t. Apple has set it up so that the iOS itself is the superapp — further entrenched by its deep integration of features such as payments and now identity.</p><p>It’s not Facebook’s only tiff w/Apple,&nbsp;BTW:</p><blockquote>A new fight between Facebook and Apple over the mechanics of ad tech is surfacing an industry divide over user privacy and spotlighting longstanding dilemmas about the tracking and use of personal information online, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Privacy advocates have been sounding alarms for years about tech firms’ expansive, sometimes inescapable data harvesting without making much headway in the U.S. But the game could change if major industry players start taking opposite&nbsp;sides.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook warned advertisers Wednesday that a coming change to Apple’s iOS could devastate revenue for ads that sends users straight to the App Store to install an app — an approach that’s used widely by developers including mobile game&nbsp;makers.</blockquote><p>Like I said, a lot is at stake and both sides are in it for the long&nbsp;haul.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/f20e9b">Briefing: Facebook Says Apple Changes Could Kill Part of its Ads&nbsp;Business</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-warns-advertisers-on-apple-privacy-changes-5018b903-c2af-43cb-afef-4f53ce7b0f2a.html">Facebook warns advertisers on Apple privacy&nbsp;changes</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">Mark Zuckerberg Said Apple Has A “Stranglehold” On Your&nbsp;iPhone</a>  <p>3. Because the battle between Facebook and Apple is just starting to heat&nbsp;up.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-00909c64-4f0d-4233-bb83-e8a4f90ef61a.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook and Apple are fighting an increasingly high stakes battle over user privacy and access to the iOS App Store, deepening a rift between two of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley, Axios’ Scott Rosenberg and I&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: By trading accusations, Facebook and Apple could just be handing more ammo to critics and regulators — but at the same time, conflict between these giants could be read as a sign of competitive life and a rebuttal to antitrust charges.</blockquote><p>A sign of the&nbsp;times:</p><blockquote>Our thought bubble: Historically, the big tech companies have maintained power by dominating a key market while competing with one another at the edges. The Apple-Facebook fight shows that they’re now willing to take swings at each other’s core businesses.</blockquote> 3. The thing is, Apple’s approach also bucks the macro trend. More apps want to do&nbsp;more. <p>Consider Discord, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d2587314-f65c-4cf0-b20f-50ab02564d47.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Discord began in 2015 as a way for gamers to talk to one another before, during, and after play. Now, the chat company is pursuing a far broader vision: to be the Slack for your non-work&nbsp;life.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: In the age of COVID-19, more than ever before, people need the online equivalent of social spaces like bars, restaurants and&nbsp;stages.</blockquote><blockquote>How it&nbsp;works:</blockquote>  Discord allows people to create their own online community space, to set and enforce rules and decide whether to remain invite-only or open it to the&nbsp;public.  Users can share messages in various channels, chat privately and have group discussions. More recently, the company has added group video&nbsp;chat.  Discord calls each community’s space a “server,” but it’s not a server in the sense of a separate computer controlled by the user. Users can run servers without needing system-administrator knowhow.  This arrangement has pros and cons. It means Discord controls the data and is responsible for complying with law enforcement. But it also means the service can enforce its own code of conduct, handling trust, safety and security.  <p>One way to think about it: all of these various products are really just various combinations of a few core building blocks: identity, messaging, and payments (and groups!).</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/line-launches-digital-asset-wallet-and-blockchain-development-platform">LINE Launches Digital Asset Wallet and Blockchain Development Platform — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-confirms-acquisition-of-vr-startup-spaces-87449f9f-d2b3-4294-a33c-c7377ba90b48.html">Apple confirms acquisition of VR startup&nbsp;Spaces</a>   4. The thing about bringing people together on a platform (through identity, messaging, and payments) is that humans have a tendency to do really amazing things but also some really nasty things. And one of the big takeaways from this latest tech cycle is how we optimize the former and mitigate the&nbsp;latter. <p>A recent battleground has been Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits platform liability from user behavior.</p><p>But the days of that laissez-faire approach could be coming to the&nbsp;end.</p><p>AT&amp;T is firing the latest salvo in that movement:</p><blockquote>AT&amp;T will tell the Federal Communications Commission that the agency should craft rules to shrink tech’s longstanding legal shield, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: AT&amp;T is a telecom giant and, since buying Time Warner, a major force in media and entertainment — both industries that have butted heads with Silicon Valley. The company is now launching this fresh attack as tech is under attack in Washington.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: On Monday, AT&amp;T is previewing comments it will make to the FCC Wednesday on reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from liability over content their users&nbsp;post.</blockquote><blockquote>The company will ask the FCC to modify Section 230 so that tech platforms don’t get such broad immunity.</blockquote><blockquote>It will also argue that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google should be forced to be more transparent about the decisions they “make on a daily basis,” like how they rank search results and feature news&nbsp;stories.</blockquote><p>Plus <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-825d6da0-1bc2-406c-ba1b-3e246574c5f2.html">the latest from&nbsp;FB</a>:</p><blockquote>After initially taking no action on militia pages organizing an armed counter-protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Facebook said Wednesday that the pages violate a just-enacted policy that imposes stricter limits on QAnon, militia and other extremist groups.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook’s handling of the issue raises fresh questions about its ability and willingness to enforce policies in time to prevent violence rather than after the&nbsp;fact.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/thailand-protests-social-media">How the Battle for Thailand Is Being Fought on Twitter — CoinDesk</a>  Youtube on platform moderation — <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/responsible-policy-enforcement-during-covid-19">Responsible policy enforcement during&nbsp;Covid-19</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/f">/f</a> — <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/post-no-evil">Post No Evil | Radiolab | WNYC&nbsp;Studios</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/greg</a>— <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-sellers-use-new-tactic-to-deal-on-facebook-marketplace-11598270872">WSJ News Exclusive | Gun Sellers Use New Tactic to Deal on Facebook Marketplace</a>   5.

  The evolution of cybersecurity protection demands a more nuanced response to providing access to a company’s sensitive resources. Policy-based access control (PBAC) combines identity attributes and context variables to enable sophisticated granting of access to corporate systems and protected resources based on centrally managed policies that ensure consistent access control decisions across the enterprise. Advancement in both business requirements and technology (such as growing use of micro-services), require a better way to control access. In a way that is consistent across all silos, dynamic enough to react to change in risk, and provides better control for the application business owners.

					 <p>When the outbreak of COVID-19 started, Michael Corning, the Cryptocosm Architect at <a href="https://www.secours.io/">Secours.io</a>, wanted to build a self-sovereign identity (SSI) based app that would help reopen his local economy in Sisters, Oregon without reopening the pandemic. As we all know, how easy it is to adopt a new technology or software plays a key role in its ultimate success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first version of his app proved to be too complicated and idealistic for businesses and organizations to adopt. He quickly reevaluated his strategy and built a more simplified app, called Safe in Sisters, which was built with adoption in mind. The Q&amp;A below is our interview with him to learn more about the changes he made to create an SSI-based app that was “adoptable”.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is the Safe in Sisters project? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic hit the state of Oregon and we shuttered shops and public places, here in my little piece of heaven—the city of Sisters—I went to some of my friends at <a href="https://edcoinfo.com/covid-19-central-oregon-business-resources/">Economic Development for Central Oregon</a> and told them how I wanted to reopen the Sisters economy without reopening the pandemic. They both loved the idea. Two of my physicians heard me explain how I was planning to accomplish this mission (I wanted to know how medical providers would react). One doctor was enthusiastic, and the other had an arguable HIPAA-allergic reaction. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Armed with this mix of reactions, I set out to build a set of tools that would provide users with local contact tracing, a COVID symptoms scoring sheet (based on data published by Oregon Health Authority), and verifiable presentations. The verifiable presentations would do something as simple as check a zip code (Sisters had zero COVID cases at the time, but counties nearby glowed purple with the afflicted) or as complicated as checking for a positive COVID test result and two subsequent negative results within a two-week window.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Early on, I realized that writing the code was the easy part. Socializing the protocol and getting people to understand, value, and use the technology would be the hard part.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out, I was correct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Working with my <a href="https://enduringnet.org/">Enduring Net</a> COVID comrades across the pond, we took the prototypes to a large care center in Manchester, England. We showed them all the fancy stuff, and their first response was, “We have six entrances to our facility and handle over 600 people per day. We can’t spend time exchanging QR codes with visitors.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I learned two valuable lessons (actually, I knew the lessons but had never seen their consequences in action quite so starkly): &nbsp;<br><br></p>  My passion for complex solutions usually does not meet with equal user enthusiasm. &nbsp;<br><br>  The second lesson was best taught by Professor Edwin Jaynes in his Probability Theory: The Language of Science. He notes, “The simplest solutions aren’t best because they’re simple. They’re best because simple solutions are more likely to succeed.”&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, I set aside the techno bling, and I started over. I was bound and determined to provide the world with a solution simple enough to succeed. &nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What makes this project unique from some of the other SSI &amp; verifiable credentials projects that are designed to combat the threat of COVID-19?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The first difference is that we focus on local ground conditions. &nbsp;People in Sisters don’t care about COVID prevalence in Manchester. They care about the prevalence at the Sisters High School or the Five Pine Lodge. They don’t care about the prevalence at Heathland Care Center in Manchester, but they care about The Lodge in Sisters care center across the street from the Fika Coffeehouse. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A second difference follows from the first: Local contact tracing is just the first line of defense.&nbsp;If a COVID carrier gets into a room and exposes other healthy people, at least those now at risk know about their invisible condition in time to do something to stop further spread.&nbsp;Once a room has carried a carrier, the room needs to bring out the big guns. The room and its visitors need other tools to access the risk of exposure. This is where symptom tracking and verifiable credentials come into play. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third difference is that we focus on measuring risk. &nbsp;This may turn out to be the most important difference. We understand that a measurement is a set of observations that reduce uncertainty. We don’t guarantee safety; we don’t reduce risk by 100%. But we do use all available data as a set of observations that reduce the uncertainty that plagues us about the virus. Our tools provide users with consistent metrics they can use to make informed decisions about who is safe enough to interact with. No more controversy. No more excuses. No more virus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our job as technologists is not to show how cool our technology is. It’s to save lives. It’s to stop the virus in its tracks. My job is to make Sisters the COVID Hotel California—the virus can check-in, but it will never check-out.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Why have you focused on a local contact tracing solution? What is the difference between contact tracing and local contact tracing?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>All politics are local. All battles with the virus are local. Most of those affected by the virus are local. Local contact tracing is far simpler and more reliable than conventional contact tracing. We can control the virus in our town without help from the government or from Apple and Google. We don’t need GPS. We don’t need Bluetooth. But we do need common sense, privacy, and secure messaging.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since local contact tracing is local and not centralized at scale, and since the code and infrastructure is neither complex nor expensive, we expect rapid replication across the planet, not of the virus, but of the tools to kill it.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Can you go into detail of how the Safe in Sisters app works? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Since local contact tracing is a free service, I moved development to my nonprofit counterpart of Secours.io, <a href="http://soteria.id/">the Soteria Institute</a>. The <a href="https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/">Soteria Local Contact Tracing</a> tool is a Progressive Web App (built with VueJS on the front end and socket.io on the backend). Once you’re on <a href="https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/">https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/</a>, you can add the app to your phone’s home screen and it looks and acts like a native mobile app. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The app has two views: Room and Visitor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People responsible for a public space manage a Room. Visitors choose that room and check-in when they enter and check-out when they leave. Rooms and Visitors store each of these decisions (to enter a Room or to be allowed to enter a Room) in local storage (IndexedDB) on their phone. Visitors send check-in socket messages to the server, and the server forwards those messages to the Room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a person sends a COVID exposure alert to all the Rooms stored on their phone, the Rooms can pick up the message from the server, list all the Visitors who occupied the room at the same time in the past two weeks, and can send alerts to the server that forwards them on to each of the other Visitors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the simplest scenario, Rooms don’t have to do anything (the alert protocol can be fully automated), and all a Visitor has to do is click a button on the app to log Rooms and another button if they go into quarantine. No QR codes. No room staff overhead. No cost of service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If that’s still too complicated for people, I’m going into another line of work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Below is a short demo video that shows how the process works:&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How has this project evolved since you first started? What are the obstacles you have run into?   		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To summarize the evolution of my work:&nbsp;<br><br></p>  The Secours app started as a full-blown application based on Trinsic.&nbsp;  I separated out the simplest capabilities of that original design to focus on local contact tracing using Aries messaging.&nbsp;  I stopped using Aries messaging and refactored LCT with Socket.io (this is the base Service Level Agreement, SLA-0), and I assigned that development to Soteria.&nbsp;  I refactored the Trinsic capabilities into two additional Secours SLAs:  SLA-1 adds personal credentialing and additional risk management tools.  SLA-2 adds COVID test credentials and rich Verifiable Presentations.&nbsp;    I plan to augment Socket.io with more powerful assets like Redis, so I can develop artificial intelligence asserts that will transform my Soteria/Secours-based digital twins into intelligent and helpful digital partners.&nbsp;   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How has Trinsic helped you along in the process?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic was mission-critical for three reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, making something simple that’s complicated is difficult. Trinsic has met that challenge. Back in the Spring, I was able to get up and running in a few minutes. Trinsic assets are generally well-documented now, and development tools are even simpler than a few months ago. This meant I was able to build my verifiable credential exchange&nbsp;(VCX) prototype in record time. And while I was disappointed that the world wasn’t quite ready for all these new capabilities, it was a forcing function that changed my marketing strategy from push (see how cool this tech is, don’t you want some?) to pull (see how easy it is to do&nbsp;something you couldn’t do before?).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And because I built so much in so little time, I was able to set these powerful Trinsic solutions aside and spent one more month getting a simple and stable web socket messaging platform ready for our fist offering: local contact tracing. Having all the rest of the heavy iron waiting in the back room means I can respond immediately to early adopters who quickly needed more power than messaging provides. At each stage of the VCX adoption process, we stay as simple as possible and no simpler. We give our users all the power they need now and no more (until they need it).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, local contact tracing goes global only if thousands of people like me can get their hands on technology that is simple and easy to implement and extend. Trinsic was built on the lowest barrier to entry. All our Trinsic API code is in a public GitHub repo, and we will provide later local contact tracing adopters with training material that will ensure many other communities around the world can stay safe from the virus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I realized something else during this early development phase: As cool as connectionless credentials are, they are not the most important part of the Trinsic platform. Credentials keep your data safe. Verifiable presentations make your data valuable. Trinsic’s implementation of verification policies took all the mystery out of this critical step in VCX; so, again, our users can tell us what they need for verification, and we can respond on the spot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next time you ask me this question, I may have a third&nbsp;reason to love Trinsic: I suspect verification policies will enable me to implement decentralized semantics with relative ease.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What stage of development are you in? How big do you see your solution getting, and how do you see it scaling?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>I am nearly ready to take the tool back to the UK and see if it is simple enough to be effective. If the app passes acceptance testing, I will recommend a British colleague to fork the GitHub repos (<a href="https://github.com/mcorning/prototyping.git">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mcorning/socket.io.server.git">server</a>), setup the necessary server assets (static Web App, Ubuntu VM), and take it from there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, I will make it available to my friends and family here in Sisters. And if that works, I will recruit others in Oregon to replicate our success in Sisters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once my users build muscle memory on Service Level 0, I will continue field testing at SLA-1 and SLA-2. Someday, soon—I hope—I will have the resources to focus on SLA-3: a personal artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If I do my job and our local approach scales effortlessly, then I expect there will be 7 million localities each serving 1,000 users.&nbsp;</p>

					 <p>To my fellow Sisters residents: For our strategy to work, people must care about each other just enough to push two buttons on their phone, maybe three. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a few people in other cities and towns: You can do your part, too. Replicate Safe in Sisters where you live and work. Stop the virus in its tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Together, we can relegate COVID-19 to a display at the Natural History Museum.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And stay safe out there…&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(end of interview)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We, at Trinsic, are currently offering our platform free-of-charge to those working on SSI projects related to COVID-19.

<p>Munich / Leipzig – September 1st, 2020, IDnow, a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions and Wirecard Communication Services GmbH announce the signing of an agreement for the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services by IDnow. IDnow will retain the Leipzig location preserving the majority of the 150 employees.</p>
<p>With Wirecard Communication Services, IDnow will focus on providing identity services and continue to build additional capacity for the strong growth of IDnow identification processes. In light of organic growth in digital services as well as the added needs related to restrictons imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, IDnow is experiencing a sharp increase in demand for its digital verification procedures. The acquisition is intended to enhance the service quality of IDnow products and thus further increase the responsiveness for customers and cut waiting times.</p>
<p>Wirecard Communication Services GmbH was established on April 29, 2003, and is part of the Wirecard Group. In a structured investor process, Wirecard Communication Services GmbH was offered for sale by way of an asset deal. IDnow and Wirecard Communication Services have already been working together successfully for more than five years.</p>
<p>At a staff meeting on Monday afternoon, the insolvency administrator, attorney Dr. Nils Freudenberg from Tiefenbacher Insolvency Administration, announced the takeover to the staff of Wirecard Communications Services. The first step will be to provide the employees with appropriate qualifications and to adapt the technical infrastructure. Following this realignment, the Leipzig location will be expanded in a targeted way and integrated into the IDnow processes in order to enable even faster implementation of projects as well as further technical development of the Ident services.</p>
<p>“With the integration of Wirecard Communication Services into the IDnow Group, we are seizing the opportunity to further improve our range and service quality for our customers. We have worked in close collaboration with this division of the company for several years and greatly appreciate the qualifications and experience of its employees. We are on a strong growth path and will maintain and further develop the Leipzig location,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have found in IDnow a buyer who appreciates and knows our company and has such a friendly culture. Personally, I am very pleased to stay on board and work in the team at IDnow,” says Amra Blume, Managing Director Wirecard Communications Services.</p>

Disclosure is a security conference that’s shaping up to have a super amazing schedule! The speaker lineup is fantastic—with talks ranging from cyber warfare to disinformation to social engineering (and much more!).</p>

<p>My talk is called “How to Think About OAuth Security”. I’ll be focusing on what makes OAuth secure and some holes in implementations that have previously left some gaps for attackers. Here’s a taste of the kinds of things I’ll be talking about tomorrow!</p>

 Revealing mobile app API keys 

<p>It’s a well-understood part of modern app development that trying to hide API keys in an app is a futile effort. But just a few years ago, Twitter made headlines when their mobile app’s API keys were leaked! We’ll talk about what happened and how OAuth evolved to address the need for mobile apps to securely log users in.</p>

 Stop relying on passwords 

<p>There are much better solutions than passwords on the modern internet. How has OAuth been adapting to the changes? Spoiler alert: OAuth never encouraged apps to handle passwords in the first place, so we’ll take a look at how OAuth is changing to address this.</p>

 What’s coming in OAuth 2.1? 

<p>You may have heard some rumblings about <a href="https://oauth.net/2.1/">OAuth 2.1</a>, an update to the spec that I and a few others are currently working on at the OAuth Working Group in the IETF. We’ll look at the significant changes coming in that version, highlight what isn’t changing, and talk about why now is a good time to publish an update to the spec!</p>

<p>Hope to see you there! It’s not too late to <a href="https://www.disclosureconference.com/register/">register</a>! I’ll be answering Q&amp;A, and I’m always happy to chat about OAuth security on Twitter, you can find me at <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a>.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>Even before COVID-19 entered our lexicon, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">privileged access management (PAM)</a> was widely recognized as a foundational <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/cyber-security">cybersecurity technology</a>. In recent years, almost every cyberattack has involved compromised or misused privileges/privileged credentials. Most malware needs privileges to execute and install payload. Once a threat actor has infiltrated an IT network, privileges are typically needed to access resources or compromise additional identities. With privileged credentials and access obtained, a threat actor or piece of malware essentially becomes a malicious “insider”. Outside of PAM, there are few defenses against a rogue insider.</p>
<p>In 2020, the largescale shift to working from home (WFH) imposed by the coronavirus has increased the urgency for maturation of PAM security capabilities. The subsequent increase in BYOD and shadow IT, compound by significantly more reliance on insecure WiFi networks and remote access pathways, has exacerbated many of the thorniest privileged access challenges. It’s also a proven recipe for breaches.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this blog, I will cover the 10 phases, or use cases, of PAM that comprise a complete, holistic privileged access management program. At BeyondTrust, we refer to this as the <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions/universal-privilege-management">Universal Privilege Management model</a>. This approach entails securing every privileged user (human or machine), session, and asset across your IT environment—leaving no privilege undiscovered, unmanaged, or unaudited. The 10 phases can be implemented via the three solutions that comprise a complete PAM platform—privileged password management, endpoint privilege management, and secure remote access.</p>
<p>While organizations most frequently begin with <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/privileged-password-management">securing privileged credentials</a> (privileged password management), you can start anywhere, so long as your PAM platform is flexible. With each PAM layer implemented, your organization eliminates and mitigates additional <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/new-privileged-attack-vectors-book-q-a-with-author-morey-haber">privileged attack vectors</a>, while realizing new security and operational synergies.</p>
 1. Secure &amp; Audit Privileged Account Credentials 
<p>Gaining control and accountability over privileged accounts—both human and machine—is often the first step organizations take on their PAM journey. <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/password-management">Privileged password management solutions</a> can automate the discovery, onboarding, management, and monitoring of the ever-expanding types of human and machine privileged accounts/credential types (privileged user passwords, application passwords, DevOps secrets, SSH keys, certificates, etc.), and bring those accounts/credentials under management within a centralized password safe. This is an important step for preventing or mitigating password re-use attacks and other backdoors (orphaned accounts, etc.) into the IT environment.</p>
 2. Enforce Least Privilege on Desktops (Windows and MacOS) 
<p><a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-least-privilege">Enforcing least privilege</a> on desktop devices is one of the most powerful ways to reduce <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">endpoint security risk</a> across the enterprise. <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/privilege-management/active-directory-bridge">Endpoint privilege management solutions</a> can remove local administrative rights and default every user as a standard user. Rather than being enabled, persistent, and always-on, the privileges are only elevated on an as-needed basis and only for the targeted application or process. Limiting both the amount and duration of access condenses both the attack surface and threat window for malicious applications and activity that can abuse privileges.</p>
 3. Apply Least Privilege Across Your Server Environment (Windows, Unix, Linux) 
<p>IT admins often require elevated rights to perform their jobs. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, high levels of privilege can be abused to inflict considerable damage to an IT environment and exfiltrate data. While sudo can help organizations “get by” in simple environments, it’s not an enterprise-class tool. Sudo suffers from significant security and administration drawbacks. Enterprise-class PAM solutions can enable organizations to efficiently and effectively delegate server privileges without disclosing the passwords for root, local, Active Directory domain, or bridged administrative accounts. Least-privileged, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/just-in-time-privileged-access-management-jit-pam-the-missing-piece-to-achieving-true-least-privilege-maximum-risk-reduction">just-in-time access</a> should always be enforced, and every privileged session should be closely audited and monitored.</p>
 4. Implement Application Reputation 
<p>PAM solutions should be able to enforce a number of application reputation strategies as part of endpoint privilege management. Some of these include:</p>
 
 Application control capabilities, including allow listing,&nbsp; block listing, and reputation-based listing to restrict applications to only those approved to execute, with the correct privileges, within the appropriate context 
 Applying real-time risk intelligence to inform privilege delegation and elevation decisions 
 Command filtering (on Unix and Linux systems) and PowerShell script management (on Windows systems) 
 <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/how-trusted-application-protection-builds-on-application-control-endpoint-privilege-management">Trusted application protection</a> to add context to the IT process tree to prevent fileless attacks and attacks leveraging trusted applications to perform malicious activities 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Control Remote Access 
<p>Rarely does a cyber attacker operate directly on a resource (such as a stolen laptop). Most attacks start externally via a remote access connection. Typically, these threats initially compromise a remote vendor or employee, then piggyback into an organization’s network. VPNs and other widely used remote access tools lack connection isolation, granular privilege and access controls, and application-based audit capabilities. With the recent, largescale shift to remote work, tools like VPNs and RDP are being stretched way beyond their legitimate use cases, contributing to a surge in targeted attacks and breaches. PAM platforms with <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions#secure-remote-access">privileged remote access capabilities</a> can enforce least-privilege access and session auditing for remote access sessions—for both vendors and employees better than traditional VPN solutions alone.</p>
 6. Extend PAM Best Practices to Network Devices and IoT/IIoT 
<p>Some non-traditional endpoints and edge devices, like IoT, have minimal computing power, which means they may not be candidates for traditional <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">endpoint security tools</a>, like AV. Additionally, IoT and network devices may have embedded or easy-to-guess credentials, among other design flaws. That’s why it’s critical to extend credential management, least privilege, and other PAM controls to these devices and keep them properly segmented across your environment.</p>
 7. Extend PAM Best Practices to the Cloud and Virtualized Environments 
<p>In addition to suffering from many of the same privileged access weaknesses as on-premise environments, the cloud presents unique use cases, such as hypervisors, cloud management consoles, and APIs. In the cloud, ephemeral privileged accounts and credentials are rapidly instantiated and disposed of when new cloud and virtual instances are spun up and, just as easily, spun down. When managing any privileged account, discovery is the critical first step to gaining control over these assets and the many planes of privileges across cloud environments. Once cloud and virtualized instances and their assets are found, they must be managed to limit exposure, and all session access should be monitored and audited. Simply put, PAM has a substantive role to play when it comes to both <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/cloud-security-best-practices">cloud security</a> and <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/api-security-privileged-access-management">API security</a>, regardless of the access and implementation of privileged accounts.</p>
 8. Extend PAM to DevOps and DevSecOps 
<p>DevOps seems to magnify many of the worst PAM challenges due to the heavy emphasis on automation and speed. Common DevOps risks include:</p>
 
 Insecure code and <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/hardcoded-and-embedded-credentials-are-an-it-security-hazard-heres-what-you-need-to-know">hardcoded passwords</a> 
 Scripts or vulnerabilities in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools, that could deploy malware or sabotage code 
 Over-provisioning of privileges 
 Sharing of <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/secrets-management">DevOps secrets</a> 
 
<p>While DevOps presents some special use cases, PAM’s role in <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/devops-security-best-practices">DevOps security</a> is comparable to any other environment—managing privileged accounts/credentials (including for CI/for CI/CD tools, service accounts, etc.), enforcing least privilege, etc. It also essential that the PAM solution does not disrupt or delay workflows, but rather enables peak DevOps agility. Securing the accounts, keys, and certificates required for automation is a fundamental part of extending PAM into your development and automation practices.</p>
 9. Integrate PAM and Identity Access Management 
<p><a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-identity-and-access-management-and-why-is-it-a-vital-it-security-layer">Identity and access management (IAM) solutions</a> help IT teams answer, “Who has access to what?” PAM solutions answer the questions of “Is that access appropriate?” and “Is that access being used appropriately?” Complete visibility and accountability over identities requires bi-directional integration of privilege management and IAM solutions. Some PAM solutions also include <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/privilege-management/active-directory-bridge">AD Bridging capabilities</a>, which help further centralize identity management and authentication by providing single sign on across Windows, Unix, Linux, and macOS environments using the same account for simplified access, monitoring, and reporting.</p>
 10. Integrate PAM with Other IT Tools 
<p>PAM + IAM integration is imperative, but your privileged access security workflows and data should also integrate with the rest of your IT and security ecosystem. Gaps in this ecosystem translate into security vulnerabilities and lost productivity. The better your PAM platform integrates (such as with SIEM, ITSM, etc.), the more effective your ability to orchestrate pinpoint responses to problems—or opportunities.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, any security technology that solves a problem, but that does not integrate into the rest of your ecosystem, is a point solution with a finite lifespan. It could be argued that siloed solutions are also a waste of money and resources. Therefore, make sure your PAM investment works with, and integrates with, your overall IT and security ecosystem to best serve your environment.</p>

<p>Last month<a href="https://authenteq.com/short-sweet-and-fully-automated-july-product-update/"> </a>at Authenteq: besides striving to be trustworthy and secure we also strive to be fully automated. As automation is the key to the success last month our product updated focused on automated flagging – since last month instead of your compliance team having to flag suspicious users, our technology does that for you. What is more, you can take a glimpse at the verification data with our dashboard quick-view and not waste your precious time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This month our product update is one of the biggest product releases we ever had! Here’s what’s new:</p>



 Let your customers pick up where they left 



<p>At Authenteq we know that the conversion rate is the key metric that you use to calculate your business success and that even small friction can have a high impact on your user satisfaction. To make sure that your customers are always pleased with the onboarding process we’ve added a feature that allows your customer to exit the flow at any point or move the app to the background and not cancel the onboarding flow. This will allow your users to pick up where they left the flow and will provide for a truly frictionless mobile onboarding experience.</p>



 Enhanced security – always&nbsp; 



<p>Our customer dashboard has never been as secure. Now you can facilitate data collection in three different ways and never have to touch the images of the identification documents again. Here are the ways you can facilitate the data collection: mobile SDK, mobile end-point, or a webhook. Read more about it on our API documentation. <br><br>What is more, our team added a small but no less important <a href="https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) for additional security to the customer dashboard. You can enable it by going to the settings section of your company dashboard. Interesting in learning more about how to protect your data and increase your business security?&nbsp; Check out <a href="https://authenteq.com/anti-spoofing-tips-and-tools-to-keep-you-and-your-company-safe-and-secure/">our latest blog</a> on anti-spoofing where we share useful tips.</p>



 Features that will help you onboard customers with international documents 



<p>As part of our continued efforts to provide document support worldwide, we’ve introduced some API changes that will benefit your user onboarding process. We know that personal identification document formats differ across the globe, for example, those with the US or Australian drivers licenses or passports that are being issued by certain Asian countries might have difficulty with verifying their identity.</p>



<p>The main issue was that these documents do not distinguish between the surname and given names field. In order to solve this issue, Authenteq will now pass you the entire field as SurnameandGivenNames. By introducing this change we empower you to cater to a truly secure, frictionless experience to your users.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Want to unleash the power of frictionless verification. Fetch your API keys by starting a <a href="https://customer-dashboard.app.authenteq.com/registration/">30-day-trial</a> with us, or <a href="https://cal.services/multi/Authenteq-Demo/-1jva2cQw">have a chat</a> with one of our identity verification and KYC experts. </p>

  <p>Developers have cool ideas for pet projects all the time. I often have quite a clear picture of what I want to build and am ready to spend next weekend making the Next Big Thing. The weekend comes finally, and instead of building it, I find myself doing the same repetitive things - deployment, user sign in, registration, deployment, etc.
Starting a new project with user registration and a login form is fun! - said no one, ever.</p>

<p>The first hundred user sign-up forms I made were fun, kind of. As I move forward, I see more and more boilerplate, mostly copypasta between projects with some minor tweaks.</p>

<p>Luckily, we are living in the era of PaaS, IaaS, and open source. Most of the typical components are already built for us, and we simply need to connect them in order to focus on unique features and delivery for the end-user.</p>

<p>While there are many options available to bootstrap a new project, sometimes it can be challenging to mix and match the right components.</p>

 Build a Secure Spring Boot Application 

<p>In this tutorial, you’re going to build a single page (no JavaScript, I promise!), secure web application, and deploy it in Heroku’s cloud. It could be a good foundation for the next project or just something on the side.  Most importantly, it doesn’t cost a penny.</p>

<p>Your website will invite a user to log in and then will present them with some meaningful information, for example, give The Answer.</p>

<p>Tools you’ll be using:</p>

 
   Spring Boot - agile and time-tested all-in-one suite for the web and REST API development framework with countless integrations and much more. 
   Spring Security - swiss knife for the various security setups which provides great flexibility and control all over the application. You’ll be using its OAuth 2.0 module. 
   Kotlin - fastest-growing statically typed language which is gaining adoption in different applications. 
   kotlinx.html - an HTML-like DSL (domain-specific language) helping developers to build type-safe applications. 
   Okta - easy to use authentication and authorization service provider, you’ll offload user management to this service 
   Heroku - PaaS provider making deployment process as smooth as possible. 
 

<p>Since you won’t handle authentication and won’t store any personal data, that significantly helps to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other government regulations, as  Okta already takes care of that.</p>

<p>Spring Boot has first-class support for Kotlin, easing out potential challenges in some corner cases. Okta provides a very handy autoconfiguration <code>okta-spring-boot-starter</code>, similar to <code>spring-boot-starter-web</code> which automagically sets up most of the components for you. With Heroku, you’ll be able to deploy the whole application with a simple <code>git push</code>.</p>

 Scaffold a New Spring Boot Project 

<p>You can create a project skeleton with a standard directory layout and basic dependencies configured. However, configuring Spring manually can be convoluted, and leave you with cryptic errors just because a dependency was or wasn’t included. Fortunately, <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a> can help with that. It’s a neat online tool giving you an option to set up all dependencies of the project  automatically. I prepared a <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&amp;language=kotlin&amp;platformVersion=2.3.3.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.springboot&amp;artifactId=demo&amp;name=demo&amp;description=Heroku%2C%20Spring%20Boot%20and%20Okta%20demo&amp;packageName=com.okta.springboot.demo&amp;dependencies=web,okta">magic link</a> which preselects project’s components.</p>

<p>Should you prefer to select the dependencies yourself, choose options as displayed in the screenshot below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Spring Initializr website will generate a zip archive that you’ll need to download, decompress, and import in your favorite IDE.</p>

 Touch up Gradle Dependencies 

<p>Although most of the required dependencies are there, you’ll need to add the <code>kotlinx.html</code> library and the <code>jcenter</code> repository to <code>build.gradle.kts</code>.
Also, please temporarily exclude the Okta Spring Boot starter to see the application working:</p>

   <code>...
 
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // add this repository for kotlinx.html library
    jcenter()
}
 
dependencies {
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    implementation("com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin")
    //  temporarily exclude the Okta Spring Boot starter
    //  implementation("com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:1.4.0")
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect")
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8")
    // add kotlin html dsl
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-html-jvm:0.7.1-1.4.0-rc")
 
    testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test") {
        exclude(group = "org.junit.vintage", module = "junit-vintage-engine")
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Re-import your Gradle configuration and run the project from your IDE, or from the command line using <code>./gradlew bootRun</code>.</p>

<p>The application should start successfully, but a 404 page will be returned when accessing <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. This is expected behaviour if you didn’t define a handler for the root endpoint.</p>

 Prepare a Git Repository for Heroku 

<p>To enable Heroku deployments you need to create a new Git repository and commit your application skeleton generated by Spring Initializr. Open you favorite terminal, navigate to your project’s folder, then run the following commands:</p>

   <code>git init &amp;&amp; git checkout -b main
git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -a -m "Initial commit"
</code>   

<p>These commands will initialise a new Git repository with a default <code>main</code> branch and create the first commit.</p>

 Say Hello World with Spring Boot and Kotlin 

<p>One of the best things about the controlled magic of Spring Boot is that it makes complex things plain, and helps to write very concise and easy to read code, especially when teamed up with Kotlin.</p>

<p>Create a <code>HelloController.kt</code> class that returns “Hello, World”.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.springboot.demo
 
import org.springframework.http.MediaType
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController
 
@RestController
class HelloController {
 
    @GetMapping("/", produces = [MediaType.TEXT_HTML_VALUE])
    fun theAnswer(): String = "&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;"
}
</code>   

<p>A lot of things are happening under the hood. This controller has a <code>@RestController</code> annotation because instead of returning a name of view, you want to return a response body. In this example, it will be rendered as an HTML string.</p>

<p>Using <code>@GetMapping</code> annotation you declare a GET endpoint bound to <code>/</code>, and indicate that return mime type is <code>text/html</code>. Finally, the HTML string <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;</code> is returned.</p>

<p>Re-start the application and open your browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You should see “Hello, World”.</p>

<p></p>

 Use Kotlin’s Statically-typed HTML Builder 

<p>Kotlin provides great syntactic sugar for creating statically-typed <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>s. HTML builder is one of the many practical applications and is implemented as <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html">kotlinx.html</a> library. It allows you to create web pages with plain Kotlin code which resembles HTML.</p>

<p>Your web application contains only one page. The corresponding HTML-generating render function <code>indexPage()</code> has all the HTML boilerplate including basic HTML document layout, Bootstrap CSS inclusion, and styles. The <code>indexPage()</code> function produces a horizontally and vertically centered ‘hero’ block with content.</p>

<p>Start building your HTML page by adding the following code in a new  <code>views.kt</code> file alongside the controller you just added:</p>

   <code>import kotlinx.html.*
import kotlinx.html.stream.createHTML
 
fun indexPage() = createHTML().html {
    head {
        link("https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.1/css/bootstrap.min.css", rel = "stylesheet")
    }
    body("h-100") {
        div("container lead text-center") {
            div("h-100 align-items-center") {
                style = "display: grid"
                div("jumbotron jumbotron-fluid") {
                    // meaningful content goes here
                    guestView()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 
private fun FlowContent.guestView() {
    h1 { +"Hello, Guest" }
}
</code>   

<p>The function producing meaningful content is <code>FlowContent.guestView()</code>. Note that it is an extension function because HTML DSL components are available only within <code>FlowContent</code> objects. You can read more about <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html">creating a DSL in Kotlin</a>.</p>

<p>Update your controller’s<code>theAnswer()</code> method to call <code>indexPage()</code>:</p>

   <code>import indexPage
...
 
@RestController
class HelloController {
   
    @GetMapping("/", produces = [MediaType.TEXT_HTML_VALUE])
    fun theAnswer(): String = indexPage() // call your render function
}
</code>   

<p>After you restart your app and refresh your browser, you should see the output from your template:</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy Spring Boot to Heroku 

<p>I know that feeling, you can’t wait to put ‘The Thing’ out there on the Internet and share it with your friends. It’s a good time to start deploying as you’ve built a welcoming page.</p>

<p>Please ensure that you have <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Heroku CLI installed</a>.</p>

<p>Log in to Heroku. You can skip this step if it was done previously:</p>

   <code>heroku login
</code>   

<p>Then, create a new app with <code>heroku apps:create</code>:</p>

   <code>heroku apps:create
</code>   

<p>You should see output like the following:</p>

   <code>Creating ⬢ okta-springboot-heroku-demo... done
https://okta-springboot-heroku-demo.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/okta-springboot-heroku-demo.git
</code>   

<p>You’ll find Heroku automatically configures a <code>remote</code> origin called <code>heroku</code>. Running a <code>git push</code> will trigger the build and deploy process automatically. It’s as simple as that!</p>

<p>At the moment, the default JVM Heroku uses is 1.8. You’ll need to create a <code>system.properties</code> file in your application root to provide the desired version:</p>

   <code>java.runtime.version=11
</code>   

<p>Then commit your changes:</p>

   <code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "Added system.properties with target jvm version"
</code>   

<p>Then, deploy to Heroku:</p>

   <code>git push --set-upstream heroku main
</code>   

<p>Heroku will build from source once your code is pushed.</p>

</code>   

<p>Once your application is deployed, it can be easily accessed by running <code>heroku open</code>. This command opens a new web browser window and navigates to its URL.</p>

<p>Every time you want to deploy your web application, simply push your source code by running <code>git push heroku main</code>.</p>

 Protect Your Spring Boot Application 

<p>Many services have a “user’s area” - part of the website or content visible only to the members. In this application, the content of the index page depends on the user login state. Logged in users can see The Answer while guests are invited to sign in. This user registration and login bit might sound trivial but in fact, it causes a number of very serious questions not easy to find answers:</p>

 
   Where do I store user’s personal data such as name, email, etc.? Is it another table, another database, another type of database, or as a microservice? 
   Do I encrypt data, if so what algorithm should I use? Where do I keep encryption keys? Ask yourself if you understand cryptography enough to make the right decision. 
   How do I hash passwords? Do I need <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/03/what-are-salted-passwords-and-password-hashing/">salt and pepper</a> to cook it right? 
   What if I want to add more authentication providers, for instance, social networks? Shall I spend time writing those abstractions I might never use? 
   How would I design access management and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens/revokeatrt/">access token revocation</a>? Does it sound like a very generic thing which must have been implemented by somebody? 
   Do I have a good understanding of how to keep user’s PII (Personal Identifiable Information) in compliance with GDPR/CCPA/DPA/other regulations? 
 

<p>Those are just a few questions off the top of my head. I’m certain you’ve got a cool bar story about authentication to tell.</p>

<p>It’s easy to build authentication and authorisation but it’s hard to do it right.</p>

<p>You’ll be using Okta, a software-as-service identity access provider which has excellent integration with Spring Boot and Heroku. Combining Okta with Spring Security makes the sign-in/sign up process as easy as it could be. Yes, you’ll have a user sign up right out of the box. (See bonus section).</p>

 Enable the Okta Spring Boot Starter 

<p>Update your <code>build.gradle.kts</code> to include <code>okta-spring-boot-starter</code> artifact and don’t forget to re-import the Gradle model in your IDE.</p>

   <code>dependencies {
    ...
    implementation("com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:1.4.0")
    ...
}
</code>   

 Add the Okta Add-on to Your Heroku Application 

<p>Okta provides an official <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/okta">Okta Heroku Add-on</a> which expedites the development process. You’ll create an Okta account linked to your Heroku app, and automatically configure Okta right from the command line.</p>

<p>Run <code>heroku addons:create okta</code> to begin. You should see output like the following:</p>

   <code>➜ heroku addons:create okta
Creating Okta on ⬢ okta-springboot-heroku-demo... free
Provisioning Okta Org
okta-opaque-28728 is being created in the background. The app will restart when complete...
Use heroku addons:info okta-opaque-28728 to check creation progress.
Use heroku addons:docs okta to view documentation.
</code>   

<p>This add-on creates a user and configured Okta application for you. The configuration settings will be specified for your service via environment variables. You can lookup these settings with <code>heroku config</code>.</p>

<p>This command will return all the environment variables for your app on Heroku.</p>

   <code>=== okta-springboot-heroku-demo Config Vars
OKTA_ADMIN_EMAIL:              dcc8cf18-198b-4395-81b7-f96a6adc9463@heroku.okta.com
OKTA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:           A$8278eb57-6af7-4ef4-2713-b0d6ba3ff36d
OKTA_CLIENT_ORGURL:            https://dev-995757.okta.com

OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_WEB:     0aap529m06mVIIidR4x6
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_WEB: &lt;okta oauth2 client secret&gt;
OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER:            https://dev-995757.okta.com/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>If you see an empty output you need to wait a minute or two while the setup process is completed.</p>

<p>Note that <code>OKTA_ADMIN_EMAIL</code> and <code>OKTA_ADMIN_PASSWORD</code> are actual credentials you can use to log in to your application.</p>

 Provide Environment Variables for Okta Spring Boot 

<p>For OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication and OAuth 2.0 authorization,  only three variables are important to you: <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER</code>, <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_WEB</code>, and <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_WEB</code>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to update <code>application.properties</code> file to provide them for Okta’s Spring Boot starter:</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
okta.oauth2.clientId=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_WEB}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_WEB}
</code>   

<p>Although the idea of hardcoding secrets into the properties file might look very tempting, especially for a pet project, you should never do that! It’s good hygiene practice to <a>never store secrets in your source control</a>.</p>

 Configure IntelliJ IDEA to Run Your Spring Boot App 

<p>You probably want to play with the application locally as well, but at the moment it expects environment variables to be set. IntelliJ IDEA allows providing a custom configuration.</p>

<p>In Run Actions(Ctrl-Shift-A) dialogue search for Edit Configurations or use your mouse to edit the current run configuration in dropdown.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Provide the <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER</code>, <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_WEB</code>, <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_WEB</code> keys and values from the <code>heroku config</code> output:</p>

<p></p>

 Configure Spring Security 

<p>One last step to make the application secure is to configure Spring Security. Create a <code>WebSecurityConfig</code> class in the same package as your other classes and fill it with the code below.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.springboot.demo
 
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
 
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
class WebSecurityConfig : WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter() {
    override fun configure(http: HttpSecurity): Unit = with(http) {
        authorizeRequests().run {
            antMatchers("/").permitAll()
            anyRequest().authenticated()
        }
        oauth2Login().run {
            defaultSuccessUrl("/")
        }
        logout().run {
            logoutSuccessUrl("/")
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This configuration allows anyone to access <code>/</code> but always authenticates each request; allowing logged in users and guests to access the same URL. In the event of successful login or logout, users will be redirected to the index page <code>/</code>.</p>

 Redirect Users to the Okta Login Page 

<p>Spring Security automatically registers an endpoint for Okta at <code>/oauth2/authorization/okta</code>. This allows you to redirect the user to the right location to start the OIDC authentication process.</p>

<p>To enable login flow for the user add a link to your <code>guestView()</code> in <code>views.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>private fun FlowContent.guestView() {
    h1 { +"Hello, Guest" }
    a(href = "/oauth2/authorization/okta") {
        +"Login to get The Answer"
    }
}
</code>   

 Handle an Authenticated User 

<p>Upon successful login, you can extract information provided by the authentication service. Spring Boot can inject it straight in to your controller’s handler:</p>

   <code>import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser
...
 
@RestController
class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/", produces = [MediaType.TEXT_HTML_VALUE])
    fun theAnswer(@AuthenticationPrincipal user: OidcUser?): String = indexPage(user)
}
</code>   

<p><a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/oauth2/core/oidc/user/OidcUser.html"><code>OidcUser</code></a> contains a variety of fields you might find useful, among them are: name, email, claims, etc.</p>

<p>When <code>OidcUser?</code> is null user is not authorized, it effectively makes them a guest.</p>

<p>Update the <code>indexPage()</code> method in <code>views.kt</code> to match the code below. Now when a user is logged in, they’ll see a warm welcome message:</p>

   <code>import kotlinx.html.*
import kotlinx.html.stream.createHTML
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser

<p>Run your application via IntelliJ and you should be able to complete the sign-in process:</p>

<p></p>

 (Bonus) Enable Self-Registration 

<p>Okta can also take care of the registration process, which can be easily enabled in the settings. Head on over to your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/">Heroku dashboard</a> and choose your project. Find the Installed add-ons section and click on okta to open your Okta dashboard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to Users &gt; Registration and click Enable Registration. A registration configuration form allows some level of flexibility. For example, you can require new users to provide their first and last name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After you save the configuration, open a new incognito browser window and try to log in. This time, the Okta login form will have a link for user registration:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can push all your changes to Heroku after committing them.</p>

   <code>git add .
git commit -m "Add Okta for Auth"
git push heroku main
</code>   

 Learn More about Spring Boot and Heroku 

<p>In this tutorial, you learnt how to quickly bootstrap secured web applications for your ‘pet project’ ideas using Spring Boot with Spring Security, Kotlin, and Okta. You deployed a web application to the Heroku cloud using Heroku CLI and Git command-line tools. It’s always a good idea to use existing frameworks and tools instead of focusing on repetitive tasks such as deployment, authentication, and authorization.</p>

<p>The source code for this tutorial and the examples in it are available on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-heroku-example">oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-heroku-example repository</a>.</p>

The integration of Plaid’s API will allow us to provide detailed transaction history and data to ONTO users, who will have the opportunity to gain a complete understanding of their financial picture. This marks another important step in fulfilling our commitment of allowing consumers to take back control of their data. We look forward to what this integration will bring to the Ontology community, as we continue to enrich our ecosystem and service-offering.”</p><p>Over 80% of the world’s largest fintechs are powered by Plaid, including Acorns, Betterment, Coinbase, and Venmo.

 Taming the Beast — Refactoring to Empower&nbsp;Teams <p>One day I stumbled onto a ticket from the website team that was open for several days. The ticket was for a simple change, to enable file compression.</p><p>The comments went back and forth. First we would try something, then we would ask someone else to test. Then they would come back and say it didn’t work. This repeated 3 or 4 times until everyone gave&nbsp;up.</p><p>I was confused, the request seemed easy to do. I decided to investigate, and that’s when I found The&nbsp;Beast.</p> Unraveling The&nbsp;Beast <p>To understand The Beast, you need to understand what would happen at the time when you opened onfido.com on your&nbsp;phone.</p><p>A request would first go to Kubernetes, then an nginx server, then a Cloudfront distribution, and finally to an S3&nbsp;bucket!</p>Here was the&nbsp;beast<p>Each step on this chain had a different owner, was in a different project, and had a different release process. Each team had to verify that changes to the website didn’t break their main service. It took time to make&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Not only that, it was also slow. US users had to wait twice as long as European users to see the&nbsp;page.</p> How did it get to&nbsp;this <p>To understand how we got to this beast, we need to go back to when it was just a tiny&nbsp;puppy.</p><p>Many years ago, the website was done in Rails, and its code was part of our platform. And all of this was behind an Nginx instance.</p>Life was simple for the young&nbsp;puppy<p>The developers managed the website, the Rails app handled routing, the Nginx proxy handled requests and caching, and the user saw a&nbsp;website.</p><p>Eventually one Rails app became many Rails apps. Nginx started serving the static assets from a folder. The puppy’s fur grew and nobody was there to trim&nbsp;it.</p><p>A couple more years and the website became separate, so the marketing team could own it. But because all the paths were intrinsically linked, it continued to be served by&nbsp;Nginx.</p><p>A bit more time and Kubernetes was added to the mix, and all of this was moved inside&nbsp;it.</p><p>The puppy’s fur grew and grew, and nobody gave it a trim. The puppy grew to become The&nbsp;Beast.</p> Taming The&nbsp;Beast <p>So how do you go towards taming The&nbsp;Beast?</p><p>We had to understand how that devilish Nginx configuration came to be. We had to understand what we had to keep, what we could rearrange and what we could throw away. We wanted to understand what the user workflows were.</p><p>So we talked with teams to see what they knew about this beast and evaluated the access logs for the website. With that precious information in mind, we were able to propose a new architecture that removed the website out of the way of other&nbsp;teams.</p><p>In this new architecture, we start with a Cloudfront distribution, this distribution has one single goal, to see what goes towards the website and what goes towards Kubernetes.</p>Proposed taming of The&nbsp;Beast<p>With this new architecture designed and the approval of all the teams, we prepared our new test environment. We made it match the behaviour of the real website as much as possible.</p><p>With a few days of trials, we got confidence that we could proceed. We did a dark launch of production only in our office network. Teams did their final end-to-end tests. Minor hiccups were fixed and we got ready for the big&nbsp;switch.</p> Launch Day <p>It was early morning, the release scheduled to happen in just a few hours. There was some tension. This could have a large impact, both on our image as well as for our&nbsp;clients.</p><p>All internal stakeholders were gathered, rollout procedures were ready and rollback procedures were prepared in case of a disaster. Eyes all on the various graphs and monitors. The pull request had one single change, onfido.com stopped pointing to the Load Balancer and would instead point to CloudFront.</p><p>The commit was merged, the CI ran and the changes were&nbsp;applied.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>No alarms were sounded. All services were normal. The website looked exactly the same. Nobody had noticed the&nbsp;change.</p><p>Exactly as intended.</p> Results <p>So, visually it looked the same. What&nbsp;changed?</p><p>First, we finally could fix that ticket from the start. And not having to go all the way to Europe on every request made the average page loads in the United States go from 5.59 seconds to 2.01&nbsp;seconds.</p>Page load times from the weeks before and after the switch, even depending on the internet connection of the person the load times fell by over a second worldwide<p>But even if all of these metrics continued the same, the changes would have been worth it. They enabled our website team to act independently.</p><p>With the smaller and self-contained code base, the team was able to own it. They went from opening tickets to change something to opening pull requests themselves. The devops team has less load and the website team can change things fearlessly.</p> Key Takeaways <p>When faced with a large scary beast, the first instinct is to run! But that beast will not go away! It will terrify everyone who passes by and any change will take an eternity to&nbsp;do.</p><p>The proper action is to be fearless and tame the beast! When it is no more than a harmless puppy, teams will be more confident to make changes and will act&nbsp;quicker.</p><p>It’s a win-win for everyone, and all it needs is that initial push for&nbsp;change!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/taming-the-beast-refactoring-to-empower-teams-8957a7df969b">Taming The Beast — Refactoring to empower teams</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>On September 2, 2020, Okta will host <a href="https://www.disclosureconference.com/">Disclosure</a>, our public security conference. There will be two tracks: one that is focused on general computer and network security and one that is aimed at developers who are interested in security as it relates to programming. The conference is virtual and runs from 9 am to 6 pm PT.</p>

<p>There are a couple of talks I am super-stoked to see and I wanted to take a quick minute to explain why.</p>

 Strategic Cyber Warfare: In Great Power Competition, Cybercraft &gt; Kinetic War 

<p>While the opening keynote is not specifically directed at developers, it is certainly timely. I’m very interested in how this works. How do we defend against cyber attacks? What exactly is happening in a “cyber-warfare” attack? We keep hearing about foreign governments or groups hacking our elections, our emails, our democracy. I’m just interested to see what that might actually mean from a strategic perspective.</p>

 How Ops Work Made Me Better at AppSec 

<p>I’ve been working with Docker and DevOps for a while now, but I’ve only scratched the surface on what AppSec means for DevOps. I’ve always relied on my AppSec friends and coworkers to help me understand the security ramifications of anything I do in DevOps. I’m interested to see how those two functions work together and how I might improve my security awareness when it comes to ops-based work.</p>

 How to Think About OAuth Security 

<p>This will be a stellar talk no matter what. Aaron Parecki is part of the OAuth working group and is extremely knowledgable when it comes to OAuth and OpenID Connect. Even though I live in that world every day, I always learn something new when listening to Aaron talk about OAuth. I look forward to hearing about the newest best practices when it comes to OAuth 2.0 and I am confident  Aaron will deliver!</p>

 Blasting Browser Security with Extensions 

<p>Another engaging speaker and a super interesting topic. Micah is a smart and mischievous developer with a passion for “tinkering”. He will be talking about how to write, debug, and package a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. He will be covering not just the “how-to”, but what things to look out for and how some extensions might have a little more power than they should really have. Sure to be an enlightening and entertaining talk!</p>

 Introduction to Public Key Cryptography 

<p>While I work in the security space, I’m not super familiar with a lot of the inner workings of cryptography and encryption. So I’ll be interested to get a good introduction to public-key cryptography. Hopefully, it will get me started down the road of taking a deeper dive into the world of cryptography, and help me understand what public-key cryptography actually is and does, practically.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://www.disclosureconference.com/#agenda">agenda</a> and comment below on the talks you’re excited to see at this year’s Disclosure Conference!

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications.

To reduce the risk of privileged accounts being hijacked or fraudulently used, and to uphold stringent regulatory compliance within an organization, a strong PAM solution is essential.</p>

 Crypto Stablecoin Report 15: The market capitalization of stablecoins increased to $15.961 billion, On-chain usage of stablecoins <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1229222499">https://bihu.com/article/1229222499</a></p><p>Original publish time: August 25,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   Last week, the market capitalization of major stablecoins increased by $759 million to $15.961&nbsp;billion.  Tether migrated 1 billion USDT from Tron to Ethereum and additionally issued 120 million USDT on Ethereum, and additionally issued 400 million USDT on Tron&nbsp;twice.  On the evening of August 23, the gas fee cost in USDT transfer within 24 hours accounted for 10.73% of the gas fee on Ethereum.  The deposits in Curve include 333 million USDC, 307 million USDT, 236 million TUSD, 70.7 million DAI, 23.39 million sUSD, 290,000 BUSD, and 220,000 PAX(Including cToken and&nbsp;yToken).  The loan balance of DAI in Compound is 217 million, accounting for 49.2% of the DAI&nbsp;supply.  USDT has a higher volume/liquidity in&nbsp;Uniswap.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(August 15, 2020 ~ August 21, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market circulation of major stablecoins has increased by $759 million to $15.961&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, Tether migrated 1 billion USDT from Tron to Ethereum and additionally issued 120 million USDT on Ethereum and additionally issued 400 million USDT on Tron twice. The circulation of USDC, PAX, BUSD, TUSD, DAI, and GUSD were increased by 134 million, 2.59 million, 4.34 million, 79.99 million, 19.87 million, and 140,000, and the circulation of HUSD decreased by 1.28&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased and increased by 90,&nbsp;657.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, TUSD, and DAI increased by 90,845, 504, and 1,695. The number of holding addresses of USDC and PAX decreased by 2,375 and&nbsp;12.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week increased by an average of 1.64% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins decreased by an average of&nbsp;4.15%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Due to the large amount of transfers on the blockchain caused by the USDT migration, the daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week increased by an average of 19.67% from the previous&nbsp;week.</p> 2. On-chain usage of stablecoins <p>Stablecoins have become a very important infrastructure, especially for public blockchains that are ready to develop DeFi, almost essential. The more complete ecological public blockchains Ethereum, EOS, TRON, not only have introduced USDT issued by Tether but also have their on-chain collateralized stablecoins DAI, EOSDT, USDJ. For Ethereum, stablecoins are an important asset, providing a foundation for the ecology on Ethereum. But at the same time, stablecoins also bring some bad effects, such as on-chain congestion and skyrocketing fees. In this report, we will introduce you to the on-chain usage of stablecoins on Ethereum.</p><p>To maintain the security of the network and allow miners to package transactions, each transaction on Ethereum needs to pay a certain gas fee, and the gas fee can most intuitively reflect the use of each contract on the blockchain. According to Etherscan data on August 23, Uniswap V2: Router2, which uses the most Gas fee, is routing on Uniswap. The Transaction Account ‘0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d’ that we often see on Uniswap corresponds to the contract. In Uniswap, any two ERC20 tokens can be exchanged, which is the credit of the routing. There are still many transactions that do not require routing because of direct exchange, so it can be confirmed that Uniswap is a Dapp that costs more gas fees on Ethereum.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://ethereoscan.io/">ethereoscan.io</a></p><p>The second-largest cost of the gas fee is USDT. In the past 24 hours, the gas fee cost accounted for 10.73% of the Ethereum, with a total cost of 780.69ETH, totaling $305,800. Among the top 50 fees, there are USDC and DAI, which account for 0.47% and 0.22% of the gas fee on Ethereum. Only the transfer of USDT, USDC, and DAI accounted for 11.42% of the gas fee on Ethereum.</p><p>Some contracts are highly related to stablecoins that also cost a lot of gas fees, such as <a href="http://curve.fi/">Curve.fi</a>: y Deposit, Maker: Proxy Registry. Uniswap, 1inch, Balancer, and other decentralized trading platforms will also use more stablecoins. It can be predicted that transactions related to stablecoins cost a relatively high proportion of gas fees on Ethereum.</p><p>The total lock-up volume is an important indicator when measuring the scale of DeFi projects. A large part of the lock-up volume in Aave, Curve, and Compound comes from stablecoins.</p><p>Aave is an open-source decentralized lending protocol. Although many kinds of assets can be deposited and withdrawn in Aave, the main deposit /lending of users is still stablecoin. Currently, deposits in Aave include 267 million USDT, 250 million USDC, 240 million TUSD, and 39.53 million DAI. There are more deposits in USDT, USDC, and TUSD, but DAI is more capital efficient. USDT, USDC, and TUSD have more deposits, but the capital utilization rate of DAI is&nbsp;higher.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://apps.aave.com/">apps.aave.com</a></p><p>Curve is a protocol based on automatic market makers and specifically designed for stablecoin and stablecoin swap. Curve also integrates the cToken of Compound and yToken of yearn. Compound and yearn depositors can not only get the loan interest in their respective platforms but also earn transaction fees in Curve. As of August 23, a total of 1.139 billion dollars of assets have been deposited in Curve including 333 million USDC, 307 million USDT, 236 million TUSD, 70.7 million DAI, 23.39 million sUSD, 290,000 BUSD, and 220,000 PAX. Also, there are 70.19 million renBTC and 68.98 million&nbsp;WBTC.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://curve.fi/">curve.fi</a></p><p>As of August 24, the total deposits in Compound were $1.746 billion, which is still the DeFi project with the most deposits. Deposits in Compound include $1.024 billion DAI, $201 million USDC, and $25.55 million USDT. The concept of collateral factor is introduced in Compound. The collateral factor is the ratio of assets that can be borrowed against deposits, and the collateral factor of USDT is 0. Since Compound does not fully support USDT, USDT deposits are less. The application of DAI in Compound is better. The loan balance of DAI in Compound is 217 million, accounting for 49.2% of the DAI&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Source: compound.finance</p><p>Among the top 6 tokens with the best liquidity in Uniswap, USDC, USDT, DAI, and sUSD are all relatively common stablecoins. Among them, USDC has the best liquidity, but USDT has a higher volume/liquidity in Uniswap, and it is easier to get higher transaction fees for depositing USDT. For example, in the exchange pairs with ETH, the liquidity of USDC-ETH, USDT-ETH, and DAI-ETH are $22.36 million, $16.01 million, and $13.12 million. However, due to the higher volume of transactions of USDT-ETH, their fees in the past 24 hours were $27,850, $38,648, and&nbsp;$25,227.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://uniswap.info/">uniswap.info</a></p> 3. Questions of&nbsp;Readers <p>1. Why is USDT not included in the cryptocurrency whitelist announced by&nbsp;NYDFS?</p><p>Answer: USDT, USDC, and DAI are not on the list of cryptocurrency whitelists announced by NYDFS, but PAX, BUSD, and GUSD are on the list. I think this is because of compliance issues. GUSD and PAX passed the approval of NYDFS in the first batch, and it is not surprising that they can pass the whitelist of NYDFS this time. BUSD is a stablecoin launched by Binance and Paxos, and it has also been approved by&nbsp;NYDFS.</p><p>USDC was developed by Centre Consortium, a company jointly invested and operated by Coinbase and Circle. It complies with the supervision of the ‘MTM’ and can be used as a currency transfer agency in the United States, but it has not obtained a clear regulatory license from&nbsp;NYDFS.</p><p>Although USDT is large in scale, it has the worst compliance and does not even issue monthly audit reports like other stablecoins. Last year, the New York Department of Justice also accused Bitfinex of illegally embezzling $850 million in Tether to make up for losses. Therefore, USDT is the most difficult to comply with the commonly used off-chain collateralized stablecoins.<br>On the other hand, DAI is entirely dependent on on-chain collateral generation without the participation of centralized institutions and has the characteristics of anti-censorship, and there is uncertainty for supervision.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>Cloud computing has proven battle-ready. During COVID-19, cloud demonstrated it can support unplanned and unexpected needs. Organizations may no longer question its utility, but security remains a commonly cited reason for avoiding it.</p>
<p>In reality, the public cloud can be made <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-the-cloud-secure/">secure enough for most uses</a>.</p>
<p>“Even for the most reluctant organizations, there are now techniques such as confidential computing that can address lingering concerns,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/55700/Steve-Riley">Steve Riley</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “You can stop worrying about whether you can trust your cloud provider.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Confidential computing — one of 33 technologies on the Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security, 2020 — is a security mechanism that protects code and data from the host system. By making critical information invisible to third parties, including the host, it potentially removes the remaining barrier to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-trends-impacting-cloud-adoption-in-2020/">cloud adoption</a> for highly regulated businesses in the financial services, insurance and healthcare sectors.</p>
<p>For example, a retailer and a bank could cross-check customer transaction data for potential fraud without giving the other party access to the original data.</p>
<p>While confidential computing is highly useful in theory, it isn’t plug-and-play. Gartner anticipates a five- to 10-year wait before it is in regular use.</p>
<p>Here are three technologies from the Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security, 2020, to action right now.</p>
<p><a title="Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security 2020" href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz02MDdjNzE1MmUyYmQxMWVhOWEzNzBlYjlhMmRjN2JjMw=="></a></p>
 Secure access service edge&nbsp; 
<p>Secure access service edge (SASE), pronounced “sassy,”&nbsp; supports secure branch office and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">remote worker access</a>. SASE’s cloud-delivered set of services, including <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-9-security-and-risk-trends-for-2020/">zero trust network access</a> and software-defined WAN, is driving rapid adoption.</p>
<p>Gartner predicts that by 2024, at least 40% of enterprises will have explicit strategies to adopt SASE, up from less than 1% at the end of 2018.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watch out for slideware, especially from incumbent vendors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>COVID-19 has highlighted the need for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/stress-test-your-business-continuity-management/">business continuity plans</a> that include flexible, anywhere, anytime, secure remote access at scale, even from untrusted devices. SASE enables security teams to deliver secure networking and security services in a consistent way, to support digital business transformation and workforce mobility.</p>
<p>SASE is in the early stages of market development but is being actively marketed by the vendor community, with more than a dozen SASE announcements over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>User advice: “Watch out for slideware, especially from incumbent vendors that are ill-prepared for cloud-based delivery as a service model,” says Riley. “This is a case in which software architecture and implementation matters. True SASE services are cloud-native.”</p>

 Cloud security posture management&nbsp; 
<p>It is becoming increasingly complex and time-consuming to answer the critical question “are my public cloud applications and services configured securely?” Even simple misconfiguration issues represent significant risk, as evidenced by several public data disclosures last year.</p>
<p>For enterprises that have a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-organizations-choose-a-multicloud-strategy/">multicloud strategy</a>, cloud security posture management (CSPM) assures business and security leaders that their services are implemented in a secure and compliant way across multiple cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers.</p>
<p>User advice: “First, investigate your cloud provider’s own risk posture assessment capabilities to see if they will satisfy the requirement, even if they fall short of commercial offerings,” Riley says. “Also check if any products you already have include CSPM capabilities.”</p>
 Cloud access security brokers&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Unlike traditional security products, cloud access security brokers (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/cloud-access-security-brokers-casbs">CASBs</a>) are designed to protect data that’s stored in someone else’s systems. They enable organizations to achieve consistent security policies and governance across many cloud services and demonstrate that cloud use is well-governed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend seeking one-year contract terms over lengthier ones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pace of Gartner client inquiry indicates that CASBs are a popular choice for cloud-using organizations. Although <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-06-17-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-security-and-risk-managem">Gartner’s latest spending forecast</a> shows slowing growth for all security markets, CASBs’ expected growth remains higher than any other information security market at 33% in 2020. This high-benefit technology has entered the mainstream and the number of vendors has stabilized.</p>
<p>User advice: “Differentiation among vendors is becoming difficult, and several have branched beyond SaaS governance and protection to include other features such as CSPM and user and entity behavior analysis (UEBA). Given continued feature expansion and relative ease of switching, we recommend seeking one-year contract terms over lengthier ones,” says Riley.</p>

Erik Westra, Technical Architect<p>We have a fun one for you—the inaugural interview of our new Meet the Team series of employee profiles.</p><p>Meet the Team is an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>As a remote company with employees around the world—from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand—it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little better (especially with current travel restrictions).</p><p>Today, we’re introducing Erik Westra, technical architect at GlobaliD, head of GlobaliD Labs, and avid&nbsp;cyclist.</p><p>Not only is Erik working on a ton of super cool projects here at GlobaliD, he also has a unique perspective given his decades-long relationship with our co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd, which, as you’d expect, involves plenty of crazy adventures.</p><p>During our chat, Erik covered a range of&nbsp;topics:</p>  How GlobaliD Labs came to&nbsp;be  Some of the cool projects Labs is working on right&nbsp;now  How Erik met Greg back in the ’80s (spoiler alert: payments data, an insane bike ride, and hypothermia)  Their first company together (which went public on the NASDAQ and had over 6000 employees)  How a young Jack Dorsey hacked into their&nbsp;systems  The time Erik saved both their lives (and the essence of their relationship)  Standing up for their values and being sued for $13&nbsp;trillion  Coming full circle and the birth of GlobaliD (and&nbsp;Groups!)   1. Who are you and what do you do at GlobaliD? <p>My name’s Erik! I’m head of GlobaliD Labs, which is responsible for the experimental aspects of what we’re trying to build. My job involves designing systems, writing proof of concepts, and managing the Labs team. We’re always trying to push the envelope.</p><p>GlobaliD Labs exists because the current way we build our system has to be relatively structured to ensure quality code and security — everything needs to work and run smoothly. Like other startups, we employ agile frameworks for development, but we need to balance that with long term planning.</p><p>That has huge benefits for the quality of our core product, but sometimes this structured approach can crowd out more experimental ideas.</p><p>I like to call myself the unofficial champion of GlobaliD Groups. It’s a feature that’s been central to our long term vision from day one, but for one reason or another, we weren’t able to get it into a production environment. Something else always required higher priority when it came to the core business.</p><blockquote>“I like to call myself the unofficial champion of GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups.”</blockquote><p>Even though Groups had a long term upside for us — especially when it came to our vision and our mission — we never had time to develop&nbsp;it.</p><p>That’s when we decided to spin it off and create GlobaliD Labs, which helps bring balance between our short term development needs with our long term aspirations. Now, we have a separate team dedicated to Groups that’s also exploring other cool&nbsp;ideas.</p> 2. What kind of cool&nbsp;ideas? <p>We believe that Groups should be able to issue credentials to people. You might get a license to ride a particular mountain bike trail — one of Greg’s favorite things, being a mountain biker. You might get a ticket to a Zoom concert. Or you might get a credential for receiving a&nbsp;vaccine.</p><p>It’s an open platform so people can come up with their own ideas on how to use it. You could even set up a group and run your business through it — connecting directly with employees and customers, matching up seekers and providers of goods and services, managing bookings, sending and receiving payments, and of course marketing and promotions — all done through the GlobaliD platform.</p><blockquote>“It’s an open platform so people can come up with their own ideas on how to use it. You could even set up a group and run your business through it — all done through the GlobaliD platform.”</blockquote><p>Another project we’ve been investing time into is email — what I call the email anonymizer, an idea I find quite&nbsp;cool.</p><p>One of the problems today is that whenever you sign up for anything online, you need to provide your email. Do this enough times and your inbox is now full of spam. You’ve essentially lost control of your email address. With the email anonymizer, you can set up a one-time address. That way, you never reveal your private email. You stay in control of your&nbsp;email.</p><p>Let’s say you want to sign up for Amazon and they ask for your email. Now, you can create an anonymous address just for Amazon. If you choose to receive those messages, emails sent by Amazon will go to your private address. If you decide that you don’t want to deal with Amazon anymore, you can simply disable the address. Privacy is a fundamental tenet of our company, and this is another way of keeping your identity&nbsp;private.</p><p>It’s little things like this that I find quite cool. If both sides are using the anonymizer, you can actually have both parties communicate back and forth without either party knowing the other’s real&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s just one of the things we’re working on right now. At Labs, we go in a lot of odd directions; there’s a lot of exploration. For every idea that does work out, there will be plenty that fall flat. Maybe they don’t work technically or there’s no business need for it. We’ll learn from those lessons. We’re the mad scientists at GlobaliD.</p><blockquote>“At Labs, we go in a lot of odd directions; there’s a lot of exploration. For every idea that does work out, there will be plenty that fall flat.

How did you end up in this&nbsp;role? <p>I met Greg [GlobaliD co-founder and CEO] around 1980 when I was still a young man — a very, very long time ago. I was studying computer science and psychology at university in New Zealand. I was really into human-computer interaction.</p><p>Greg came to New Zealand to restructure the banking industry. I was taking a part-time course in the evenings at the polytechnic at the time and word came around that people were looking for students to help with data analysis as a part-time job. I put my hand&nbsp;up.</p><p>It was a company called Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton — where Greg was working at the time. They were management consultants working with Data Bank of New Zealand, a centralized check processing company, to help make their operations more efficient. My job was to analyze data using Excel macros, and the results would be displayed in various charts. Excel charts didn’t look professional enough for the presentations they wanted, so we had to draw them by hand in&nbsp;MacDraw.</p><p>One day, I was at my desk, busily drawing one of these charts when Greg walks by and notices my bike pump sticking out of my&nbsp;bag.</p><p>“Oh, you ride a bike?” he asked. It was more of a statement, really. “We’ll go for a ride this weekend. I’ll pick you&nbsp;up.”</p><p>“Okay, cool!”</p><p>Or so I thought. I figured it would probably be a three or four hour ride. After all, all we had were our road bikes — real, old-school technology. No&nbsp;problem.</p><p>But then Greg got this idea. “Oh, look. There’s this route — it goes over this hill and goes all the way out to the coast. This looks pretty cool. We’ll go that&nbsp;way.”</p><p>And so off we&nbsp;go.</p><p>That hill ended up being a rather large mountain — mostly rock with severe slopes. You can imagine us going up and down, up and down on these narrow-tired road bikes with our big clunky shoes with cleats on the bottom. I suffered something like six flats going over that mountain&nbsp;range.</p><p>Oh yeah, it was mid&nbsp;winter.</p><p>By the time we got to the other side of the coastline, it was dusk, and we still had another 70 kilometers to ride back to the car — the only silver lining being that it was on the road&nbsp;again.</p><p>But it was dark, and I was getting really cold. At one point, I became hypothermic and I had to lie in a ditch by the side of the road while Greg rode back himself to get the&nbsp;car.</p><p>In all, it was a 13-hour bike ride. It was absolutely insane.</p><p>That’s how we met each other for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>We’ve been doing crazy things together ever&nbsp;since.</p><blockquote>“At one point, I became hypothermic and I had to lie in a ditch by the side of the road while Greg rode back himself to get the car.

On the beginning of a lifelong partnership <p>Around 1986, Greg called me. “Hey, can you come meet me? I want you to see something.”</p><p>I met him at this really old, dingy building in downtown Wellington, New Zealand. People are running in and out with their bicycles. What are these guys doing, I’m wondering to&nbsp;myself.</p><p>Apparently, it was an urgent messenger delivery company. The guys running around with bikes were delivering parcels.</p><p>“Come look at this,” Greg said. We went up the stairs. “Open this door — that’s where we’re going. But be careful. If the wind blows, we’re in real trouble.”</p><p>We sneak in and shut the door behind us. On two wooden supports is this door covered with hundreds of bits of&nbsp;paper.</p><p>That’s how they kept track of all the&nbsp;parcels.</p><p>Their service could guarantee delivery within 15 minutes from the time of your call — super efficient. For a while, we just stood there and watched it&nbsp;work.</p><p>Then Greg looked over at me. “Can you build a computer program that does&nbsp;that?”</p><p>That was our first business together. It took us about eight years to build it. But it was very successful. Eventually, it made it to the U.S., and we actually wound up being listed on the NASDAQ. We had about 6,000 employees at one stage. The company was called DMS corporation — Dispatch Management Services.</p><blockquote>“That was our first business together.

It was our first try at building something together and it succeeded.</p> 5. On Jack Dorsey hacking into their&nbsp;system <p>We ultimately left DMS and explored various other ventures together. I want to tell you about one because it’s kind of interesting.</p><p>We were building a system for last-mile ecommerce delivery. You could order online, and someone would pick it up from the depot and bring it to you within an hour. We needed an admin interface that had to be access-controlled. “Let’s do something quick! Just hardwire it into the code,” Greg said — which was typical for him at the time. Everything was about speed and minimum viable products. So that’s what we&nbsp;did.</p><p>Of course, someone broke in and sent Greg a message: “Your security&nbsp;sucks.”</p><p>That someone was Jack&nbsp;Dorsey.</p><blockquote>“Of course, someone broke [into our system] and sent Greg a message: ‘Your security sucks.’ That someone was Jack&nbsp;Dorsey.”</blockquote><p>Greg decided to hire him and we worked together for a while before he went off and founded&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>It was my fault that Jack broke in. In my defense, it’s what Greg told me to do. We’ve taken our security a bit more seriously since then&nbsp;:)</p> 6. I certainly hope so! What’s it like working with&nbsp;Greg? <p>That’s been the essence of our relationship.</p><p>Greg lived in New Zealand for about six years — if I remember correctly.</p><p>“We should go for a hike in the mountains,” he said one&nbsp;day.</p><p>So off we&nbsp;went.</p><p>Along the way, we reached the Broken Axe Pinnacles. The name speaks for itself — it’s pretty insane, this narrow little ledge with maybe a thousand-foot drop on either side plus strong winds. We were creeping along this sliver of a ledge when suddenly it started sloping downhill, steeper and&nbsp;steeper.</p><p>“Come on, we gotta get down there!” Greg&nbsp;said.</p><p>“Hang on a minute, Greg. Let’s just wait and&nbsp;check.”</p><p>We stopped for a moment to check the compass and the map. Sure enough, that path dropped off into a cliff. Had we kept going, we wouldn’t have been able to get back up. We could have died up&nbsp;there.</p><blockquote>“We stopped for a moment to check the compass and the map. Sure enough, that path dropped off into a cliff. Had we kept going, we wouldn’t have been able to get back up. We could have died up&nbsp;there.”</blockquote><p>That’s one way to view our working relationship — we’ve been working as a team for many years. There’s always a lot of back and forth. Greg would come up with all these mad ideas, and I’d figure out how to make them&nbsp;work.</p><p>It’s been like that ever since we&nbsp;met.</p> 7. Public information should be&nbsp;free <p>We’ve had a number of crazy adventures together. Another one of the companies we worked on, 3Taps, was sued by Craigslist for the nice sum of $13 trillion — an insane, arbitrary number.</p><p>[3Taps was an exchange company dedicated to keeping public facts publicly accessible — which included Craigslist listings.]</p><p>Greg was steadfast — he believed that public information should be free. If the information is freely available, it should be available to everybody. You can’t make it available to some people and not to&nbsp;others.</p><blockquote>“Greg was steadfast — he believed that public information should be free. If the information is freely available, it should be available to everybody. You can’t make it available to some people and not to&nbsp;others.”</blockquote><p>[Greg was an executive producer of and contributor to the Aaron Schwartz documentary — <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/">The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron&nbsp;Swartz</a>.]</p><p>He fought the case, which went on for several years. It got pretty ugly and I wondered if we’d lose everything. Eventually, they reached a settlement, which Greg saw as a victory. He agreed to pay out $1 million — except to the charity of his choice, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>After that saga, we were in a little bit of a&nbsp;lull.</p><p>Then out of the blue, Greg invited me to join him in Ljubljana, Slovenia. You can guess where this is&nbsp;going.</p> 8. “The early days of GlobaliD” <p>This was the early days of GlobaliD — the company had only been up and running for a couple of&nbsp;months.</p><p>We were there for two weeks, discussing the possibilities of a self-sovereign identity platform complemented with messaging and a&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>We came up with this notion of Groups. Having your digital identity is great. Here’s my phone, my wallet — my identity. I’m an individual. I can do what I need to do. But it’s when you have collections of people working together — there’s an emergent quality that’s greater than the sum of our&nbsp;parts.</p><blockquote>“We came up with this notion of Groups.

It’s this notion that you can do a lot more with people together than with people individually.</p><p>I wrote a bunch of white papers outlining how Groups should work, but it took another three years to get the foundation in place. This is where GlobaliD Labs came&nbsp;in.</p><p>I’m going to paraphrase Greg here, but once you put together the three different pieces, identity, messaging, and money — and now with Groups — magic&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Most people in our company are relatively young. Greg and I — we’re not spring chickens anymore. We’ve worked on a number of projects over the years. With GlobaliD, we just thought, “Let’s do this.” It’s our last big chance to do something amazing.</p><p>This isn’t a job. This is a mission. We are absolutely one thousand percent dedicated to making this&nbsp;succeed.</p><p>You might also&nbsp;like:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-groups-multi-person-chat-and-vouches-6f391ce3ea50">GlobaliD App — Introducing Groups, Vouches, and multi-person chat</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-messaging-is-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default-9c5d5e7d199d">GlobaliD messaging is end-to-end encrypted by&nbsp;default</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-the-wallet-87870843dc1b">GlobaliD App — Introducing the&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-sepa-and-crypto-transfers-to-your-wallet-6147deb5f6cd">GlobaliD App: Introducing SEPA and crypto transfers to your&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <p>Join a growing trusted community and experience how digital identity works for&nbsp;you.</p><a href="http://link.global.id/invite"></a> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team—Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD Labs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>If you have been developing React applications, then you probably know that there are two ways of creating React components. You can create a component class that extends from <code>React.Component</code>. You then have to implement specific methods such as <code>render()</code> that renders the component. The alternative is to create a functional component. This type of component is simply a JavaScript function that returns a rendered element.</p>

<p>Functional components are much shorter, they contain less boilerplate code, and everything is contained in one function. Until recently, there was another big difference between class components and functional components. Functional components could not contain any state. These stateless components are lightweight, and they encourage separating the presentation from the application logic.</p>

<p>Then React introduced Hooks. Hooks allow you to obtain data and a callback function that can modify the data. This allows you to add state to functional components, making them much more powerful. In this way, you can create complete stateful React components using the terse functional style.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to create a simple React application using Hooks to add state to a functional component. The application is a simple search form for books by their title and uses the Open Library API to obtain real book data.</p>

 Creating a React Application with Hooks 

<p>In the following, I will assume that you have some knowledge of JavaScript and that you have Node installed on your system. You do not need any experience with React, and I will be explaining all the major concepts. A typical Node installation comes together with two command-line tools, <code>npm</code> and <code>npx</code>.</p>

<p><code>npm</code> is used for installing packages into a project, and <code>npx</code> is used to run Node commands from the command line. The beauty of <code>npx</code> is that the commands don’t necessarily need to be installed on your system. <code>npx</code> will first look in your current project folder to see if a command is installed there. When it can’t find it on your computer, it will look in the <a href="https://npmjs.com">npmjs.com</a> repository, load the latest version of the command script and run it, without installing it locally. This feature can be used to create a skeleton React application in just a few key presses. Open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app react-books-with-hooks
</code>   

<p>This will create a new folder <code>react-books-with-hooks</code> and initialize it with a basic React application. You can now open up the project in your favorite IDE. Inside the project, you will see a <code>src</code> folder with the main application component, <code>App.js</code>.</p>

<p>When you look inside this file, you can see that it contains a single <code>function App()</code>. This function returns an element, and it uses an extended JavaScript syntax, known as JSX, to define the component. JSX allows you to write HTML-style template syntax straight into your JavaScript file. The React toolchain is set up to convert this mix of JavaScript and HTML into pure JavaScript that renders the HTML element.</p>

<p>You can define your own React components simply by writing a function that returns a JSX element. Try it out. Create a new file, <code>src/Search.js</code>, and paste the following code into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

export function Search() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div className="search-input"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Search"/&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;h1 className="h1"&gt;Search Results&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;div className="books"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
          &lt;thead&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
              &lt;th className="title-col"&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th className="author-col"&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th className="year-col"&gt;Pub Year&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;/thead&gt;
          &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>This is all you need to create a component. Of course, it doesn’t yet do anything and only displays an empty table. But you can already use the <code>Search</code> component in the application. Open up <code>src/App.js</code> again and add the following import to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { Search } from './Search';
</code>   

<p>Now remove the import of the <code>logo.svg</code> and then replace the contents of returned value in the <code>App()</code> function with the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;div className="App"&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    Books with Hooks
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;Search/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>You will notice the <code>&lt;Search/&gt;</code> element has been used as if it was an HTML element. The JSX syntax allows you to include components in this way directly in your JavaScript code. You can already test your application by running the following command in your terminal.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>This will compile the application and open your default browser to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You can leave this command running while you’re developing your code, and it will keep on updating the application and reloading the browser page every time you modify and save the code.</p>

<p>So far, the application works, but it doesn’t look nice, and it doesn’t react to any user input.</p>

 Adding State with React Hooks 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to use Hooks to create state and update the search results depending on that state. First, create a function that loads content from the Open Library web service. Open <code>src/Search.js</code> and paste the following code after the import statements.</p>

   <code>const baseUrl = 'http://openlibrary.org';

export function searchBooks(query) {
    const url = new URL(baseUrl + '/search.json');
    url.searchParams.append('title', query);

    return fetch(url).then(response =&gt; response.json());
}
</code>   

<p>This uses the browser’s <code>fetch()</code> API to get data from a server and return a JavaScript <code>Promise</code> that resolves with the server’s response.</p>

<p>Now, inside the <code>Search()</code> function, before the return statement, add the following code.</p>

   <code>const [results, setResults] = React.useState(0);

const handleSearch = (event) =&gt; {
  searchBooks(event.target.value).then(response =&gt; {
    setResults(response.docs);
  });
};

const resultList = (results || []).map((book) =&gt;
  &lt;tr key={book.key}&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;{book.title}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;{book.author_name &amp;&amp; book.author_name.join(', ')}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;{book.first_publish_year}&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
);
</code>   

<p>The first line calls <code>React.useState()</code> to obtain a stateful variable. <code>useState()</code> returns an array with two entries. The first entry is the current value of the state variable. This will be <code>undefined</code> until you update the state. The second entry is a function that you can call to update the state. In the example above, I have called the state variable <code>results</code> and the callback <code>setResults()</code>.</p>

<p>After obtaining the state, the code above defines an event handler. This simply calls the <code>searchBooks()</code> function and, once a response from the server is received, calls the <code>setResults()</code> callback to update the state. You do not have to worry about telling React to re-render the component. When you update the state, React will automatically check which parts of the application have changed and re-render them. Finally, a <code>resultList</code> is created that represents the search results in an array of HTML table rows.</p>

<p>You can now add the <code>handleSearch()</code> event handler to the input element. Modify the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element that is part of the returned JSX code to match the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;input onChange={handleSearch} type="text" placeholder="Search"/&gt;
</code>   

<p>To render the results inside the table, modify the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element to render the <code>resultList</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;tbody&gt;{resultList}&lt;/tbody&gt;
</code>   

<p>In both cases, the curly braces are used to insert the value of variables into the rendered HTML.</p>

 Add Authentication to Your React App 

<p>Real-life web applications require access control. Some parts of the application should be restricted to a limited number of users. Creating your own user management and securing your application is difficult and requires a lot of expertise. Okta allows you to set up authentication with just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>If you haven’t done so already, register for a free account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">developer.okta.com</a>. Select Create Free Account and fill in the forms to complete the registration process. Once you are done and logged in, you will see your Okta Developer Console.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip: You can also create an account using the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a> and <code>okta register</code>. To create an app, run <code>okta apps create</code> and use the settings below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the place where you register your application by selecting Applications &gt; Add Application. On the next screen, choose Single Page App and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the following screen, you can edit the application settings. For React applications running in developer mode, the port number should be 3000. You also need to change the base URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. Finally, set the Login redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code>. Once you have completed the form, you will be given a Client ID. This needs to be pasted into your JavaScript code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To make use of Okta in your React app, open the terminal in your project directory, and install the Okta React SDK with the React router by running the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@3.0.4 react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>In <code>src/App.js</code>, add the imports for these two packages to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Home } from './Home';
</code>   

<p>The router is responsible for looking at the route part of the URL and selecting the right React component to render. To add the router to your application, replace the component returned in the <code>render()</code> function with the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;div className="App"&gt;
  &lt;Router&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Books with Hooks&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;ul className="menu"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;Link to="/"&gt;Home&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;Link to="/search"&gt;Search&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;Security issuer='https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
              clientId='{ClientId}'
              redirectUri={window.location.origin + '/callback'}
              pkce={true}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home}/&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path='/search' exact={true} component={Search}/&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{YourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta developer domain. You can find this on the Okta dashboard tab. <code>{ClientId}</code> is the client ID that you obtained earlier when you registered the application. I have added a reference to a <code>Home</code> component. Implement this by creating a new file <code>src/Home.js</code> and pasting the following code into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export function Home() {
  const { authState, authService } = useOktaAuth();

  const login = () =&gt; { authService.login('/'); }
  const logout = () =&gt; { authService.logout('/'); }

  const userText = authState.isAuthenticated
    ? &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are signed in!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;button onClick={ logout }&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    : &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to sign in to use the application!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;button onClick={ login }&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;;

  return &lt;div className="page-home"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Books with Hooks&lt;/h1&gt;{ userText }&lt;/div&gt;;
}
</code>   

 Add Some Finishing Touches 

<p>You have created a functioning application, but it doesn’t look very nice yet. Of course, styling web applications is done using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). You might have noticed the import of <code>App.css</code> at the top of the <code>App.js</code> file. React configures your application so that CSS files can be directly imported into the component JavaScript files. The styles will then automatically be applied to the component. You can add some styling by opening the <code>src/App.css</code> file and replacing its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>.App header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

ul.menu {
  list-style: none;
}

ul.menu li {
  display: inline;
  padding: 12px;
}

ul.menu a {
  color: #ffffff;
}

.page-home {
  text-align: center;
}

.content {
  text-align: left;
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1232px;
  padding: 16px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

.books table {
  width: 100%;
}

.title-col {
  max-width: 60%;
}

.search-input {
  padding: 4px;
  text-align: center;
}

.search-input input {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 50%;
}
</code>   

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully created a React app that uses Hooks to manage state inside its components. You can run the following command again if it isn’t still running.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>In your browser at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>, you will be redirected to the Okta sign-in page. After successfully entering your credentials, you should see something like the following.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you enter a search term and click enter, the results might take a few seconds to render, so give it a few.</p>

 Learn More About React and Single Page Applications 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a simple React application using functional components. Using the new Hooks in React allows you to add state to functional components. This was previously reserved for React components that were defined using ES6 classes. Extending the capabilities of functional components opens up new possibilities. But it also undermines the strict separation between the purely stateless view and the stateful model of an application.</p>

<p>This is in line with the general philosophy of the React framework. While other frameworks impose strict guidelines and force the developer into a predefined architecture, React attempts to be as least opinionated as possible. It is up to the individual developer to apply the right architecture to a project. React simply empowers the developer with the freedom of choice.</p>

<p>The code for this tutorial is available on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-books-with-hooks-example">@oktadeveloper/okta-react-books-with-hooks-example</a>.</p>

   The Role of Cyber Security &amp; Digital Identity in the Modern Economy&nbsp; 

<p>While the connection between cyber security and Identity and Access Management continues to strengthen across Australia, it has become a keen area of focus for one of the country’s most influential leaders. I recently sat down with Malcolm Turnbull, the 29th Prime Minister of Australia, and ForgeRock Managing Director for Australia &amp; New Zealand, James Ross, to discuss the opportunities and trends that are driving innovation and investment in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Solving complex security challenges 

<p>Speaking to a virtual audience of ForgeRock customers and identity professionals from around the globe, Mr. Turnbull shared his views about the risks associated with handling cyber threats reactively. Globally, organizations are investing billions of dollars to reactively combat threats that can be delivered, in some cases, by a single skilled individual with an internet connection. The threat increases of course, with the investments that can be made by cybercriminals and foreign governments. The impact could lead to widespread disruption to our society.</p>

<p>The rationale behind Mr. Turnbull’s 2016 Australian National Cyber Security Strategy - which established the country’s first formalized approach to cyber security and saw an investment of A$230 Million dollars across 33 initiatives and the establishment of the national Cyber Security Centre - was to recognize the seriousness of cyber threats that was estimated to be costing the Australian economy A$7 Billion per year and offer a strategy to get on the front-foot in combating them. ForgeRock’s approach complements this thinking. So much of our work with customers and partners is to raise awareness that usernames and passwords are not sufficient. By bringing in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">behavior-based authentication</a> and biometrics, organizations can quickly eliminate a major point of exploitation from hackers while simultaneously opening up opportunities for improving the customer and employee experience by providing users with a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless</a> authentication option that is even more secure. Digital identity is now a critical part of overall cyber security planning and execution.</p>

 “Identity is trust and trust is identity" 

<p>People want to feel safe and secure when they engage with brands and services online. They expect their bank, healthcare provider, or favorite online retailer will keep their personal data protected from harm. No wonder then, that the tension that so many organizations are grappling with is how to make consumer experiences easy while putting the right security controls in place to assure people that their data is being well looked after.&nbsp; The ability to login using a single credential and get access to multiple services (through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">single sign-on or SSO</a>) eliminates the burden of remembering multiple user profiles and passwords.</p>

<p>What is clear is that people are happy to hand over sensitive information to trusted brands. In turn, that personal information is used to authenticate individuals and provide access to services. As Mr. Turnbull highlighted, “Identity is trust and trust is identity.” No wonder then that, alongside Australia’s National Cyber Security Strategy, Mr. Turnbull was behind the establishment of the country’s Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), which explored, among other things, identity and access management. Out of the DTA has come Australia’s MyGov and MyHealthRecord systems that make government digital for citizens - both of which are built on the premise that authenticated identity is the cornerstone to streamlined access to services.</p>

 Powering new opportunities 

<p>Of course, organizations that use identity to create secure, streamlined digital experiences will find themselves ahead of competitors. Personalizing services for customers or citizens makes life easier and allows people to self-manage their accounts and services and has a positive impact on an organization’s bottom line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Australia, this opportunity is being driven by ambitious government initiatives. Following the UK’s Open Banking program, Australia launched the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/cdr">Consumer Data Right (CDR)</a> regulation, which will enable consumers to more easily transfer their personal information to competing companies. Aside from empowering people to own and use their personal data to comparison shop, the CDR will also enable vendors and third parties to securely access the personal information stored by banks, powering further innovation and customisation of services. Identity management solutions are a critical component in the success of the legislated CDR roll out.</p>

<p>The role of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a> is being further thrust into the spotlight by the COVID-19 lockdown, which has sparked widespread upticks in demand for digital access. In Australia, national retailer Woolworths reported a 320 percent increase in app use, while ANZ Bank saw a five-fold increase in the use of its digital channels and these are just a&nbsp; couple of relevant examples.</p>

<p>As Mr. Turnbull observed, digital is becoming the battleground for brands and organizations and for the public sector to provide better secured customer experience to its citizens and as he stressed during our discussion, “If we crack the digital identity nut, a lot of the issues we are facing will be mitigated.”</p>

<p>You can watch the replay of our virtual fireside chat with Mr. Turnbull <a href="https://go.forgerock.com/Malcolm-Turnbull-Fireside-Chat_On-Demand.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 The GiD Report#124 — Fortnite’s philosophical crusade for a more open, interoperable future <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-123-balkanization-and-what-that-means-for-the-future-of-the-internet-4fb493177e38">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Epic and all the other huge companies fighting Apple (now a $2 trillion&nbsp;company)  This isn’t Epic’s first rodeo — like the time they took on Valve (and everyone won — including Valve)  Epic’s founder Tim Sweeney has been criticizing tech monopolies for years. Why he believes the future will be less centralized/closed and more distributed/open/interoperable.  Tim Sweeney’s also a fan of blockchain.  Greg on Occulus: “The Oculus move (under the direction of Facebook) towards a single, unified, and somewhat portable identity, bespeaks the future to&nbsp;come.”  This week on TikTok/WeChat (spoiler: this is what Facebook has been lobbying&nbsp;for)  A new era of the Federal&nbsp;Reserve  Race for central bank digital currencies heats&nbsp;up  Stuff happens   1. What’s really remarkable about the moment we’re in is just how suddenly the tides can shift — economically, culturally, and technologically. It speaks to where we are in the cycle. I’m, of course, talking about Apple, and what began as a trickle, the backlash against the App Store now feels like a&nbsp;tsunami. <p>Axios:</p><blockquote>A steady drip of criticism over Apple’s App Store policies has become a torrent, as even other tech giants feel emboldened to pile on — but Apple’s path to satisfying its critics is uncertain.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Apple’s policies aren’t that different from those governing other digital marketplaces, but its size and inflexibility could fuel regulatory action from antitrust authorities in the U.S. and&nbsp;beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: The criticisms of the App Store are many and varied, but most revolve around the 30% cut that Apple takes on sales of apps and other digital goods, with very limited workarounds.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: Microsoft Sunday became the latest company to take aim at Apple, warning in a court filing that a move to restrict Epic Games’ access to developer tools could impact lots of games from other developers that rely on Epic’s Unreal game&nbsp;engine.</blockquote><p>Hey, a new email app from the creators of Basecamp, should get some credit for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch">sparking the latest wave of&nbsp;protest</a>.</p><p>The thing is, we’ve seen that story before — some small fry developer complaining about big ‘ol Apple and their tyrannical policies. But Apple always seemed untouchable. They would ignore the criticism and continue on their merry way, never conceding any&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Moreover, Apple had some fair arguments in their defense. After all, in building the App Store from scratch, Apple created a new paradigm, unleashing immense value to the ecosystem. It made sense that Apple took a cut — they deserved credit for their work. It also made sense that they’d moderate the App Store — in itself a way to create more value in a safe, curated environment.</p><p>And as it created value for the ecosystem, it also created tremendous value for Apple, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-markets-50f38776-84cb-42f5-bcf9-9bffaa476b2c.html">which just hit a market cap of $2 trillion</a>:</p><p>Apple made Wall Street history when its 2020 stock surge pushed its market value over $2 trillion, a first for a U.S. company, Bloomberg reports.</p><p>“While it took Apple 38 years to reach its first $1 trillion in value, the next trillion only took two&nbsp;years.”</p><p>Apple shares have more than doubled since&nbsp;March.</p><p>Crazy stat: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, account for 23% of the S&amp;P 500’s entire&nbsp;value.</p><p>Saudi Aramco in December became the world’s first company worth $2 trillion, but now trails Apple at $1.8 trillion.</p><p>As Apple has grown, so has the App Store and the nature of our relationship with our apps. Apps do a lot more now. Our expectations for what we want them to do has also grown. You could argue that Apple’s model for how it manages and charges for the App Store hasn’t evolved with the&nbsp;times.</p><p>Instead, most of their decisions seem to leverage their position, expanding power over the ecosystem across more touchpoints, demanding control of essential features and services such as identity and payments.</p><p>So it was only a matter of time before companies got tired of paying these exorbitant companies to the most valuable company on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Because small fries, these are&nbsp;not:</p><blockquote>Epic itself, locked in a battle over the 30% commission, which wants a court to restore Fortnite to the App Store and stop Apple from cutting off its developer access. (Apple defended itself Friday, likening Epic to a shoplifter and insisting Epic’s issues were a crisis of its own&nbsp;making.)</blockquote><blockquote>Automattic, blocked from updating its WordPress app for not letting users buy&nbsp;.com domains through Apple’s in-app purchase system, despite not letting users buy such domains directly in the WordPress app at all. (Apple clarified its position and apologized for any confusion over the weekend.)</blockquote><blockquote>Plus, a group of news publishers asking for better App Store terms; Facebook, which suggests Apple’s terms will hurt small businesses; and Airbnb, which reportedly talked with House antitrust enforcers after Apple asked for a commission on Airbnb’s recently launched online experiences.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Spotify, for instance, says Apple gives itself a competitive edge by keeping all Apple Music subscription revenue while eating into that generated by other streaming services. EU antitrust regulators are now probing the App Store, in part due to Spotify’s complaints.</blockquote><blockquote>Match Group says Apple puts paid services at a disadvantage against ad-funded rivals that don’t have to give Apple a cut of their&nbsp;revenue.</blockquote><p>For what it’s worth, here’s Apple’s take on the situation, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">via Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>During the Congressional hearings over the market power of large technology firms, Apple CEO Tim Cook insisted that Apple had little market power over mobile apps, because developers and consumers could always switch over to different types of phones or platforms on which to create software. Epic’s attempt to restructure terms with Apple is a great test case for Cook’s argument. One would expect, based on Cook’s views, that developers of popular apps have leverage against Apple, if Apple had little market power over app stores. Certainly, Epic’s Fortnite is popular, a massive multi-billion dollar game, as close to a must-have app as possible.</blockquote><p>The problem, of course, is that I don’t want to give up my iPhone, and Apple knows this. Moreover, Google’s Play Store has more or less copied Apple’s model regarding commission and payment&nbsp;options.</p><p>So it’s a sticky situation for developers and users alike. They don’t really have much in the way of options. (Epic has a parallel suit with&nbsp;Google):</p><blockquote>Yes, but: Apple’s rules are slightly stricter, but not all that different from those on other digital marketplaces, including those run by Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</blockquote><p>The primary difference between iOS and Android, however, is that Epic is still able to provide their app directly to its users, bypassing the Play&nbsp;Store.</p><p>Still, this will likely be one for the regulators:</p><blockquote>The bottom line: Expect these arguments to come from more companies in more settings, with courts and regulators likely having to decide if there’s an antitrust problem at&nbsp;play.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21258214.130991/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9lZjU1OWI3ZTEyMjhiNjViNzM0YTRmNWFiNzg3NzU5ZT91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2FtJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcBe05717eb">Apple reaches $2 trillion market value as tech fortunes&nbsp;soar</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-china-loopholes-are-starting-to-close">Apple’s China Loopholes Are Starting to&nbsp;Close</a>  <a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/z8sG5UERte1Rmyb1myHo1w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhH5XqP0TgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wOC8xOS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2JpZy10ZWNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRvbWluYXRpb24uaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD00JmVtYz1lZGl0X2RrXzIwMjAwODE5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTIxNDEwJm5sPWRlYWxib29rJnJlZ2lfaWQ9NjI5NjUzNTUmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0zNjUwMSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9NzZlMDdlNjBiNDkyZTNjOTY4MGUwYzM1OTcwZGM5ZWZXA255dEIKABzqED1f10sDB1ISYWxlY3hsaXVAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA">Big Tech’s Domination of Business Reaches New&nbsp;Heights</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-political-censorship-poll-6bd4fbaf-43a9-49ac-8e20-48b07f5af38c.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Most Americans think social media platforms censor political viewpoints</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">@FortniteGame</a> 2. We can’t talk about the App Store controversy without talking about Epic Games, which is a super cool story in and of itself. First off, it’s not their first rodeo. They also took on Valve, which owns the Steam gaming platform. <p>For those who aren’t familiar with the gaming space, Steam is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-games-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html">essentially the Apple App Store of&nbsp;games</a>:</p><blockquote>Countless challengers had tried and failed to overcome Valve’s primacy. Many carved niches for themselves, like GOG with DRM-free and classic games. But for the biggest PC releases? Why buy elsewhere if you already owned a few dozen (or few hundred) games through Steam? You wouldn’t.</blockquote><p>Did Epic care? Not much so. They went after Valve with the same kind of swagger that they’re swinging around to take on&nbsp;Apple.</p><p>One interesting takeaway — without getting too much into the landscape of gaming — is that many believed that this was actually beneficial to Steam over the last two years. Funny how healthy competition works,&nbsp;huh?</p><blockquote>A year ago, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3326060/epic-games-store-steam-rival-valve.html">I wrote these words</a>: “Epic Games is creating a Steam rival and Valve should be scared.” And for good reason: The Epic Games Store debuted December 6, 2018 and upended the PC gaming market. Valve, once unassailable, suddenly seemed very vulnerable. Flush with Fortnite money, Epic provided the first real competition to Steam since its inception 15 years prior. What company wouldn’t&nbsp;worry?</blockquote><blockquote>If I could amend that headline now though, I’d instead write “Epic Games is creating a Steam rival and Valve should be grateful.”</blockquote><p>We can talk about the results a little bit, though — and you’ll soon see why. Here’s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>I suspect that a legal approach was not what Epic wanted to do. Epic has experience using the marketplace to address monopoly power; a few years ago, Epic took on Valve, which owned a monopoly game store, Steam, by launching its rival Epic Games Store. And Epic has used Fortnite’s draw to force interoperability among PC, Mac, Xbox One, PS4 and mobile platforms.</blockquote><p>It’s easy to get why this would be huge for users (gamers). Why was it great for Valve? Well, it forced them to up their game — literally. No longer able to rely on their platform dominance, they decided to improve their actual products. And they did exactly that. Steam, despite aggressive competition from Epic, is now better than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Talk about a win-win-win situation. Goliath won, but so did David. And then users reaped the benefits.</p><p>But Epic’s battle with Apple will be fundamentally different in nature simply because of Apple’s complete dominance in their arena. It’s why Epic has taken the legal route — a strategy Greg has discussed and taken&nbsp;himself:</p><blockquote>But because Apple’s monopoly power over the iPhone is so total, Epic chose to use the legal and political system to make an aggressive set of claims that, if accepted by a judge, would essentially destroy Apple’s control over the app ecosystem on the&nbsp;iPhone.</blockquote><p>And according to Matt, Epic has a strong case (as well as a legendary attack&nbsp;dog):</p><blockquote>These claims include the argument that Apple has tied its payments system to its app store, which is a fairly strong legal argument that judges have often (though not always) upheld. It also included an argument that the app store is what is called an ‘essential facility,’ and that Apple as a monopolist in control of such a facility has to share it with competitors or customers on reasonable terms. Judges have generally not upheld this kind of claim. So Epic is not only trying to take its dispute with Apple to the courts, it is also seeking to overturn court precedent, and encourage Congress to write statute overturning judge-made law.</blockquote><blockquote>As its head lawyer, Epic hired antitrust royalty, Christine Varney, who served as the Assistant Antitrust Attorney General under Obama, and before that worked for Netscape during the Microsoft battle in the 1990s. The suit draws heavily from the House Antitrust Subcommittee investigation and hearing, with multiple footnotes citing information unearthed by investigators, as well as a quote from Rep. Hank&nbsp;Johnson.</blockquote><p>Let’s be clear, Epic is certainly on the attack. And as Matt notes, these are indeed peculiar&nbsp;times:</p><blockquote>Typically large businesses reserve their political capital to limit government enforcers or regulators, but something strange started happening a few years ago, and it’s continuing today with this suit. Businesses began battling each other, and some started asking for an expansion of public power to structure markets. This suit is the latest on that score, the escalation of an ideological civil war within the business world, an attempt to undo deep changes in our society implemented forty years&nbsp;ago.</blockquote><p>Hard to take your eyes off this one. Grab some&nbsp;popcorn.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">Epic Games Kicks Off the Civil War in American&nbsp;Business</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/epic-games-seeks-to-form-coalition-of-apple-critics">Epic Games Seeks to Form Coalition of Apple&nbsp;Critics</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-creator-says-apple-threatening-to-restrict-access-to-software-tools-11597697909">‘Fortnite’ Creator Says Apple Is Threatening to Curb Access to Software&nbsp;Tools</a>   3. We also can’t talk about Epic without talking about its founder, Tim Sweeney. Because for Tim, this isn’t simply a battle for money — although it clearly is. But Tim is waging a philosophical crusade in order to create a digital world that’s less closed and centralized and more distributed and open and interoperable. (Sound familiar?) <p>Here are some highlights from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/30/game-boss-interview-epics-tim-sweeney-on-blockchain-digital-humans-and-fortnite/">a fantastic VentureBeat interview</a>:</p><blockquote>We talked about his vision for the Metaverse, the virtual world envisioned by Neal Stephenson in his 1997 novel Snow Crash. Sweeney thinks it’s possible to build such a world and the digital economy that goes with it, but he believes it shouldn’t be owned by a single company. He has been outspoken about ensuring openness in gaming in the past couple of&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p>For one, he’s an outspoken critic of tech monopolists (which incidentally, came after a deep chat about blockchain and&nbsp;crypto):</p><blockquote>GamesBeat: It’s a tool to pull power away from centralized authority, which is something you’ve worried about. Platform owners have proprietary technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Sweeney: And they use it to exert arbitrary control. They tilt the market in their favor. They censor people whose political views they disagree with. It’s a big and growing problem, the amount of power possessed by Google and Facebook. President Eisenhower said it about the military-industrial complex. They pose a grave threat to our democracy.</blockquote><p>He talks about games and virtual worlds like we talk about GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: There’s real value in that. If you look at why people are paid to do things, it’s because they’re creating a good or delivering a service that’s valuable to somebody. There’s just as much potential for that in these virtual environments as there is in the real world. If, by playing a game or doing something in a virtual world, you’re making someone else’s life better, then you can be paid for&nbsp;that.</blockquote><blockquote>We need to start rethinking the way we structure these large-scale game economies, especially as they get bigger and more complex. They should not simply be a means for the developer to suck money out of the users. It should be a bi-directional thing where users participate. Some pay, some sell, some buy, and there’s a real&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>If you look at what Valve has done with CS: GO and other games, they have a vibrant economy. Lots of people earn a living in those games. When you buy something, you’re not just buying it from Valve. You’re often buying it on an open marketplace from some other seller. It’s a very complex economy. There’s a lot of potential in that. We need to move toward a model like that in order to scale up to something like the metaverse. As long as it’s just the machination of a single company, there’s not going to be this bidirectional exchange of value. We need to keep that circulating.</blockquote><p>He believes we’re on the cusp of a new chapter for our digital world — one that’s less centralized closed and increasingly distributed and&nbsp;open:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: It’s really popular. That’s not even a closed economy. You’re not actually getting any incremental value for these tips. Imagine if you actually got additional benefits for doing that — recognition or power or something like that. I think that could go much further than it’s gone&nbsp;before.</blockquote><blockquote>These technology revolutions come in waves. The social network could have developed 10 years earlier than it did. You just needed a generation of people that were okay with putting all their personal information into these services. The limiting factor wasn’t technology. It was social expectations.</blockquote><blockquote>Now we’re approaching 10 years of the blockchain. As these technologies become more widely accepted, we’ll see a whole new generation of distributed systems, which really changes the game — away from closed to open. Instead of building a business that extracts money from a service, you build an economy in which everybody can be rewarded for participating in many different ways.</blockquote><p>Tim’s been talking about this stuff for years. He’s been in the industries for decades — started programming BASIC on an IBM PC at the age of&nbsp;11.</p><p>What’s super cool, though, is that he’s putting his money where his mouth is. He’s on the frontlines, battling for a digital world that he truly believes&nbsp;in.</p> 4. BONUS: What Tim Sweeney thinks about blockchain stuff. <p>Let’s just say, he’s a&nbsp;fan:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: There are some incredibly powerful ideas there. I feel like they’ve only begun to be developed. There’s Bitcoin, but the more interesting one is Ethereum, which runs general programs in the blockchain. Instead of mining coins by verifying transactions, miners are running programs specified in the blockchain and computing the results of those. They can be anything from programs to effect a single transaction, exchanging money for a good, or they can be entire distributed autonomous organizations that execute governance rules designed by shareholders and can be extended over time by majority vote. You can implement these arbitrarily complex&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>You come to the realization that the blockchain is really a general mechanism for running programs, storing data, and verifiably carrying out transactions. It’s a superset of everything that exists in computing. We’ll eventually come to look at it as a computer that’s distributed and runs a billion times faster than the computer we have on our desktops, because it’s the combination of everyone’s computer.</blockquote><p>5. Digital worlds, digital identities. Facebook is merging Oculus identity with Facebook’s.</p><p><a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>The Oculus move (under the direction of Facebook) towards a single, unified, and somewhat portable identity, bespeaks the future to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">A Single Way to Log Into Oculus and Unlock Social&nbsp;Features</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21372322/instagram-qr-code-launch-global-nametag">Instagram launches QR codes globally, letting people open a profile from any camera&nbsp;app</a>   6. Some quickies on TikTok and WeChat: Mark Zuckerberg lobbied hard for TikTok ban, and Trump is privately telling businesses they can still use&nbsp;WeChat. <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-stoked-washingtons-fears-about-tiktok-11598223133">WSJ on&nbsp;Mark</a>:</p><blockquote>When Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app&nbsp;TikTok.</blockquote><blockquote>Tucked into the speech was a line pointing to Facebook’s rising rival: Mr. Zuckerberg told Georgetown students that TikTok doesn’t share Facebook’s commitment to freedom of expression, and represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy.</blockquote><blockquote>That was a message Mr. Zuckerberg hammered behind the scenes in meetings with officials and lawmakers during the October trip and a separate visit to Washington weeks earlier, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>In a private dinner at the White House in late October, Mr. Zuckerberg made the case to President Trump that the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business, and should be a bigger concern than reining in Facebook, some of the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Zuckerberg discussed TikTok specifically in meetings with several senators, according to people familiar with the meetings. In late October, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) — who met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September — and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence officials demanding an inquiry into TikTok. The government began a national-security review of the company soon after, and by the spring, Mr. Trump began threatening to ban the app entirely. This month he signed an executive order demanding that TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., divest itself of its U.S. operations.</blockquote><blockquote>Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok’s travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese&nbsp;owners.</blockquote><p>A touch of irony here given the influence Facebook had in making TikTok a raving success, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-122-what-will-replace-wechat-and-how-facebook-fueled-tiktoks-rise-ce34d1dc9ef0">as we discussed a couple weeks&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>On the WeChat front, there’s now a lawsuit.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-u-s-wechat-ban-is-unconstitutional-11598059765">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, claims the executive order is unconstitutional. It was filed by U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, a nonprofit organization, as well as other plaintiffs including a small business and several individuals.</blockquote><blockquote>The plaintiffs aren’t connected with the popular app or its Chinese-based parent, Tencent Holdings Ltd., representatives said. They said the user alliance was formed by people who depend on WeChat in their business and personal&nbsp;lives.</blockquote><p>(TikTok is also filing a lawsuit.)</p><p>In classic Trump fashion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-21/trump-administration-signals-u-s-firms-can-use-wechat-in-china">the president is playing both&nbsp;sides</a>:</p><blockquote>The Trump administration is privately seeking to reassure U.S. companies including Apple Inc. that they can still do business with the WeChat messaging app in China, according to several people familiar with the matter, two weeks after President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned service.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent days, senior administration officials have been reaching out to some companies, realizing that the impact of an all-out ban on the popular app, owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., could be devastating for U.S. technology, retail, gaming, telecommunications and other industries, people familiar with the discussions said.</blockquote><p>Just another day, I&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-hate-speech-grilling-by-indian-lawmakers-after-journal-article-11597747734">Facebook Faces Hate-Speech Questioning by Indian Lawmakers After Journal&nbsp;Article</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-ftc-questioned.html">Mark Zuckerberg Questioned Under Oath in F.T.C.

On the other side of the (digital) coin, the race is heating&nbsp;up. <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-markets-be605d90-4ee5-48f3-b2c1-b553938cf5b6.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>China is moving ahead “rapidly” with its version of a central bank-issued digital currency and the Fed looks to be prioritizing development and moving forward with urgency to produce one in the U.S. as&nbsp;well.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Digital currencies would provide a number of new policy tools to help stimulate the economy, including allowing Congress to send money more quickly and efficiently to Americans or facilitating direct transmissions from the Fed to consumers.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Spending patterns by the unemployed and others who received funds through the CARES Act and private company progress on digital currencies “has intensified calls for [central bank digital currencies] CBDCs to maintain the sovereign currency as the anchor of the nation’s payment systems,” Fed governor Lael Brainard said in a speech earlier this month. “Moreover, China has moved ahead rapidly on its version of a&nbsp;CBDC.”</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Watch this space: Separate House and Senate bills have emerged this year proposing the creation of digital currencies.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>The intrigue: A digital currency could also help the Fed implement monetary policy by setting interest rates on consumers’ accounts holding the digital currency — analysts say this also could be a more efficient way for the Fed to institute negative interest rates to boost consumption and inflation.</blockquote><blockquote>Between the lines: China already is far ahead of the U.S. and much of the developed world in mobile payments, and a new digital currency could provide another avenue to challenge the dollar’s supremacy as the world’s funding currency.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>What’s next: The Fed could provide some hints on the next steps in developing a digital currency at its annual Jackson Hole Symposium, which is set to kickoff virtually on Thursday.</blockquote><p>This new “Cold War” with China — whatever you want to call it — may very well have a silver lining. Sure, there’s going to be plenty of disruption — as we’re already seeing with the trade war, Huawei, TikTok,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>But it’s also creating real urgency for companies, central banks, and governments to deliver the goods. There’s nowhere to hide and everyone’s looking over the shoulder. That’s a tense environment, but it also portends potential forward progress.</p><p>Maybe a little competition is exactly what we&nbsp;need.</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a>— <a href="https://twitter.com/MariaShen/status/1296225281779220480">https://twitter.com/MariaShen/status/1296225281779220480</a>:  <blockquote>“China is starting to test the Digital RMB and educate its citizens. 🇨🇳 This video is circulating WeChat: China’s digital currency in action w/ the Agricultural Bank of&nbsp;China”</blockquote>  <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/new-digital-realities/">New Digital Realities; New Oversight Solutions | Shorenstein Center</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/75022/a-global-look-at-central-bank-digital-currencies-full-research-report">A Global Look at Central Bank Digital Currencies | Full Research Report — The&nbsp;Block</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/occ-crypto-custody-years">The OCC’s Crypto Custody Letter Was Years in the Making — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://click.coindesk-email.com/?qs=d3f8726978bee17e2f00966d0f9a14341fd282e061ff86c8b57dc9dc124951eae0cfad40fb83c52ba3b8437e0fbf8a17b33824be5d53427e">Bond trading: technology finally disrupts a $50tn&nbsp;market</a>  <a href="https://click.coindesk-email.com/?qs=d3f8726978bee17ef52a64f38d5782e371461a3a4e3977ea5146dd8ae35aa9f7f1af25c0c8129183c9ad70ab65ff2e9267f02d458697afc3">JPMorgan report reveals ‘dramatic’ Covid shift to electronic bond&nbsp;trading</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/apis-will-decentralize-cbdcs">APIs Will Decentralize CBDCs — CoinDesk</a>   9.

<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>MYKEY released a new Network Fee discount system, upgraded from the original monthly free Ethereum transfers to a new coupon, which is more flexible and personalized than the previous program. You can experience it when upgrading to the latest version 2.8.0. Users with high demand for daily Ethereum transfers must carefully read the detailed&nbsp;rules:</p><p>(The coupon description mainly includes the name of the coupon, the limited period, the scope of application, transaction speed, and the amount of deduction)</p> Adjustment details  Task rewards <p>Ethereum users — 1 $5 Common Coupon per month to replace 1 free slow transfer per month, which can be used to deduct transactions at any&nbsp;speed.</p><p>Beta users — 1 $5 Common Coupon per month to replace 1 free slow transfer per month, which can be used to deduct transactions at any&nbsp;speed.</p><p>Real-name users — 1 $5 Common Coupon per month to replace 1 free slow transfer per month, which can be used to deduct transactions at any&nbsp;speed.</p><p>Users binding BIHU — 1 $5 Common Coupon per month to replace 1 free slow transfer per month, which can be used to deduct transactions at any&nbsp;speed.</p> Participate in the annual financial activity (Annual Financial Activity) <p>Participating users with assets between $10 and $99 — 1 $5 Common Coupon per month to replace 1 free slow transfer per month, which can be used to deduct transactions at any&nbsp;speed.</p><p>Participating users with assets between $100 and $999 — The original 3 slow free transfers per month have been adjusted to include 1 $5 Common Coupon, 1 Investment Coupon (for Compound/AAVE/Hashkey hub/FBG One/Firstpool), and 1 MYKEY Swap Coupon per month that can be used to deduct transactions at any&nbsp;speed.</p><p>Participating users with assets of more than $1,000 — The original 5 slow free transfers per month have been adjusted to include 3 $5 Common Coupon, 1 Investment Coupon (for Compound/AAVE/Hashkey hub/FBG One/Firstpool), and 1 MYKEY Swap Coupon per month that can be used to deduct transactions at any&nbsp;speed.</p> How to view my&nbsp;coupons <p>Open [Me] &gt; [Network Fee Balance] &gt; [Coupons Available] in MYKEY to check all coupons you’ve got including available and invalid&nbsp;coupons.</p> How can I get&nbsp;coupons <p>Open [Home] &gt; [Tasks] and complete relevant tasks to get coupons. You can even receive coupons on the 1st of every month after complete some of the&nbsp;tasks.</p> How to&nbsp;use  Attention <p>1. Different types of coupons can be used in different scenarios. For example, common coupons can be used for all Ethereum transactions (except account management), Investment coupons can be used in the MYKEY wealth management section, and swap coupons can be used in the MYKEY redemption function.</p><p>(Example: If you use a $5 common unlimited speed coupon to complete the transfer, choose the medium speed, the estimated network fee is $6 after the transaction is sent to the chain for confirmation, the actual network fee is $5.98, and then $5 is deducted, You only need to pay the $0.98 network&nbsp;fee.)</p><p>2. Each coupon has its validity&nbsp;period.</p><p>3. The number of original task rewards has been changed from free slow transfers to $5 common unlimited speed coupons, which is automatically distributed at the beginning of each month and expires at the end of the&nbsp;month.</p><p>4. The reward changes corresponding to annual financial management, in which investment coupons and swap coupons are all free coupons. You need to apply manually at the beginning of each month, and it will expire at the end of the&nbsp;month.</p><p>5. Coupons will not be chose by default when sending transactions, and you need to manually choose&nbsp;them.</p> About MYKEY <p>MYKEY (<a href="http://mykey.org/">mykey.org</a>) is a smart wallet implemented on multiple public blockchains.

<p>Those that work in the digital privacy space may feel that they aren’t at risk like other companies or individuals. We here at Authenteq are not those people. We know that protecting one’s privacy online extends far beyond just safeguarding the identity of our customers, we take the security of our own digital identities, and our shared systems, seriously. As the saying goes, sometimes you have to eat your own dog food. So, in the spirit of transparency, we thought we’d share how we handle things here to help anyone that may be looking for ways to better protect themselves.</p>



 The Cost of Spoofs 



<p>No one who uses the internet – and really, is there anyone who doesn’t? – is immune to cyberattacks. A simple check on sites like<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"> Pwned</a>&nbsp;can show you all the compromised sites where your email address has been used. Last year, a hacker gained access to CapitalOne’s system affecting 100 million Americans and 6 million Canadians, costing the company upwards of<a href="https://www.virtualarmour.com/the-capital-one-hack-the-latest-in-a-series-of-high-profile-breaches/"> $100 million</a>. Phishing and spoofing attacks have risen steadily every year and according to Agari’s<a href="https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/2h-2020-trends-report/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=prnewswire&amp;utm_campaign=h2trendsreport"> H2 2020 Email Fraud &amp; Identity Deception Trends Report</a>, 80 percent of FTSE 100 companies are vulnerable to brand impersonation online. TL; DR anti-spoofing efforts should matter to everyone.</p>



 Email and Phone 



<p>Ensuring that you request some pretty basic information may seem obvious, but there are easy steps to implement to protect your employees and customers that can go a long way.</p>



<p>At Authenteq, we’ve changed fields on our website so that only someone with a professional, or corporate, an email address can schedule a demo. That means no Hotmail, no Gmail, no personal emails at all. It’s a good first step in preventing either bad actors from entering your system as a worst-case scenario, but it’s also a way to prevent low quality leads from taking up time from your workforce by flooding support with questions, booking demos of products they don’t intend to purchase or license, and generally wasting time and resources. If an email address does make its way into your system, flag it as spam and block it immediately.<br></p>



 Regular Training&nbsp; 



<p>Keep your staff up to date by offering regular training around anti-spoofing measures. Just like any facet of life, trends come and go, and so it’s important to know the latest. When new scams emerge, ensure that you have measures in place to protect yourselves. Your employees should also be aware of any new scams in case customers get targeted and turn to their sales or account representative looking for guidance or assurance.</p>



<p>COVID, for example, brought a<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2020/08/03/which-covid-scams-are-hot-now/#46c0369e1577"> new wave of scams</a>, particularly around robocalls, as a flood of new financial assistance funds were released. People were stuck at home, either by their own choice or by their government’s insistence, which meant companies or government agencies suddenly reaching out by phone didn’t feel at all out of place.</p>



<p>Furthermore, your employees themselves need to make sure they are verifying their own emails for suspicious emails, know not to share passwords or private information via email, and to always back up their work. All it takes is one employee that opens a phishing email and your entire operation could be compromised. If an employee gets an email from their CEO that seems off, they should know and feel empowered to be able to question it instead of opening it and clicking suspicious links.</p>



 Two-Factor Authentication 



<p>As companies grow, the security measures that worked for a team of say 10 employees will not work for a team of 100. One thing companies often fail to implement is increased security as this growth happens. Having to go back and adjust things retroactively is much harder than putting in what may feel like an overly vigorous system in place before the need is felt. Two-factor authentication on emails, sites where internal documents are kept like Jira or<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa"> GitHub</a>, or even shared social media sites is a great best practice to set up. At Authenteq, we require employees to set up two-factor authentication for our internal emails, and they must reverify their authentication every time a new device is used or if they’re in a new location.</p>



<p>In addition to 2FA, we use<a href="https://1password.com/"> 1Password</a>, a password manager, for our shared accounts. We also have three different VPNs. All employees’ pay slips are encrypted. And for physical onsite security, the<a href="https://nuki.io/en/"> Nuki</a> smart lock and app is the only way to gain access inside the office, and we keep employee records, confidential documents, and any expensive hardware in a safe.</p>



 Planning 



<p>Having a plan in place to respond to any worst-case scenario is a good idea for some and crucial for others. Even if it’s not on your “need to have”, we can’t think of any situation in which this wouldn’t be a “nice to have.” If a hacker breached your internal IT system, consider what that would mean, what and who would be affected and most at risk, and the people on your team who could respond.</p>



 Liveness Checks&nbsp; 



<p>Integrating a fully automated KYC solution into your onboarding process is the ultimate tactic to prevent spoofers from sneaking in. But identity verification tools with an accompanying liveness check leaves almost no room for them.</p>



<p>Liveness checks can also prevent deepfakes from entering your system, the latest in spoofing threats. Using neural network-powered artificial intelligence and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into algorithms to create a “mask”, replacing or manipulating the original faces with lookalike data. Deepfakes do pose a threat to identity theft online, but can also be<a href="https://authenteq.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-deepfakes-the-importance-of-kyc/"> prevented</a> with sophisticated KYC tools and liveness checks.</p>

<p>Ontology Launches New Decentralized Identity For the Automotive Industry</p><p>Ontology is focused on building trust in the automotive industry through the development of a blockchain-based decentralized digital identity solution that allows for driving data to be recorded, stored, and verified in a safe and secure way, offering a range of benefits to drivers and the wider automotive industry.</p><p>How does it work? Meet Daphne, and see how her driving experience is made easier with&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>Ontology Records Daphne’s Driving Data Making Her Driving Experience Better</p><p>Daphne is a florist and vlogger. She begins her day driving to the flower shop, activating ONT ID, Ontology’s mobile digital ID application and decentralized framework that allows users to securely manage their digital identity by storing their data locally on a phone or on trusted cloud storage with a private key that grants access only to the verified user. When Daphne opens her smart lock enabled car, her driving data has been recorded and stored in a safe and secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>Ontology Allows Daphne To Book Concert Tickets Quickly Using Ontology&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>While making her way to the flower shop, Daphne uses her built-in ONTO self-sovereign data wallet, a one-stop mobile application for the management of digital identity, data, and assets, to book concert tickets with her friends. She pays using ONT, Ontology’s utility token. Daphne books the tickets using built-in voice recognition, meaning she can safely use the application while driving. Daphne is then able to send the tickets directly to her friend through the Ontology network, which transfers the cinema ticket in the form of a Ontology Non-Fungible Token&nbsp;(NFT).</p><p>Ontology Allows Daphne To Earn ONT By Renting Her Car To Other Verified Safe&nbsp;Drivers</p><p>Later in the day, Daphne goes online to an Ontology-powered marketplace where she can earn ONT by renting her car to other verified, safe drivers. Daphne is able to easily verify that the driver she rents her car to is a licensed driver with a good driver history according to their ONT Score, Ontology’s decentralized reputation scoring&nbsp;system.</p><p>Following A Minor Car Accident, Daphne Settles Her Insurance Payment Immediately Through An Ontology-powered Insurance Application</p><p>After work, Daphne is back in her car on the way to the cinema, when she gets into a minor road traffic accident. By using an Ontology-powered insurance platform, Daphne can settle her insurance payment immediately. Because the information is recorded on the Ontology blockchain, the process is fully verified, fast, and efficient. Now needing to fix her car, Daphne is able to easily order replacement car parts. Details of Daphne’s car model is recorded in a decentralized way, making the process simple and ensuring Daphne can purchase the right&nbsp;parts.</p><p>Throughout Daphne’s day, Ontology has helped make her driving experience better. By integrating Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, Ontology is bringing much-needed trust to the driving industry, not only for Daphne, but for insurers, car renters, and other drivers,&nbsp;too.</p> Want to find out more about Ontology Automotive Solution? <p>Visit <a href="https://ont.io/automotive">https://ont.io/automotive</a> or get your customized solution by emailing us at <a href="http://business@ont.io">business@ont.io</a>.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/in-the-fast-lane-ontology-accelerates-decentralized-identity-for-the-automotive-industry-2e829ecb7f23">In The Fast Lane: Ontology Accelerates Decentralized Identity for the Automotive Industry</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The symbol for the denarius, the reference coin in the Roman Empire</p>



<p>This is the fourth in the series on the paradigm shift to a digital state, this time focusing on new digital forms of government-issued money.</p>



<p>Technology
is changing the building blocks of government. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">Part 1</a> we
saw that the trend to e-government is leaving no pillar untouched. <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">Part 2</a>
showed how the technology by which people make their political choices is
changing, and <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/30/the-digital-state-part-3/">Part 3</a>
looked at how law-making is being shaped by new digital tools.</p>



<p>The
rush to digital government is now evident everywhere. Recently, for example, we
learnt about the chaos caused in the UK by a government algorithm that decided
which students passed their university entry exams. [1] The point of this negative
example is not to be negative, but merely to show that the state is now
embracing digital tools big time.</p>



<p>And
what can be a bigger than government-issued digital currencies?</p>



<p>E-government
and its money</p>



<p>The
latest technology has always shaped the physical characteristics of money. We
know that there was a time without coins – a pre-metallic monetary period. One
form of money then was cowrie shells, which could not be counterfeited. Its
monetary area encompassed the Indian ocean coastal regions of Africa, Asia and Oceania.
We know that when the shift to metallic money happened, coins started out as little
blobs. As the technology got more sophisticated, the coins became rounder and
flatter, with symbols stamped on them. We know that the metallic composition of
coins was impacted by mining discoveries – also linked to new technology. We
know that Marco Polo was hugely impressed when he discovered that the Chinese were
using a new technology for money: paper. And we know that Australia introduced
the first banknotes made from a rubber-like substance (polymer). So, we know
that the composition of money reflected the technology and resources of the
era.</p>



<p>Should
we now be terribly surprised, therefore, that in our era the state is
experimenting with new technology for the issuance, distribution, safe-keeping
and exchange of money? No. And should we be surprised that the essence of this
new money is something we cannot see or touch: digital stuff? No. And wouldn’t Marco
Polo have been impressed? Yes!</p>



<p>So,
what’s new about CBDCs?</p>



<p>While
computers are not new and electronic payments are not new and central bank
digital book entries are not new, there is something new about central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs). The new feature is that technology is changing how
and where they can be distributed and stored. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A
new digital highway, interspersed with cool digital gadgets, is creating a new
monetary transmission mechanism directly from the central bank to those
devices. The technology is not holding up its introduction, the missing legal
framework is. Where is the law that governs the new digital wallets at the
central bank? Where are the laws that govern the settlement of cross-border
payments linked to these new wallets? </p>



<p>What
we know from history is that where technology leads, society and the law inevitably
follow. The new laws will also follow from the local driving forces. One such
case is currently happening in Switzerland. The country’s stock exchange is
building a trading platform for “digital assets”. The central bank needs to
understand what that might mean for the payments system, counterparty risk and
systemic stability. One potential outcome could be a “digital Swiss franc”, which
would be used to settle payments between wholesale participants on that
platform. Nothing has been decided yet. But if that were decided, it could
happen as early as 2021.</p>



<p>Central
banks all over the world are taking a closer look at what this new digital
infrastructure might mean for their mandates. While the motivations and urgency
differ from country to country, it appears at this point that the introductions
of the first central bank digital currencies will not replace “cash” – they
will merely be an additional pool of digital units for a newly defined purpose,
distributed and stored via a new infrastructure. It also appears clear at this
stage that central banks are not keen on the idea that retail clients should
have digital wallets at the central bank.</p>



<p>Blockchain
agnostic</p>



<p>Central
bank digital currencies do not need blockchain. Recall that bitcoin was born as
the anti-central bank fiat currency. Central banks want control over the amount
of money they issue; they are not going to give up that control to a public
blockchain. Central bank digital money is anti-bitcoin money; it has a central
counterparty: the central bank. Some central banks are indeed experimenting
with blockchain, and it is not inconceivable that some could even issue a
currency on a private or permissioned blockchain, but that means they will
still exercise control.</p>



<p>Concluding
thoughts: What we can learn from the big Ӿ</p>



<p>The
era of central bank digital currencies is dawning just as governments all over
the world have issued war-time levels of debt and central banks have increased
their balance sheets to previously unimaginable sizes. It is not unreasonable
to ask if central bank digital currencies stored on new digital wallets would
not make it easier to push more digital units through the system or even remove
units via new negative interest rates? The answer to both questions is probably
yes.</p>



<p>The
algorithm problem in the UK cited above is also meant to illustrate the point
that e-government also needs a superior governance framework. This is not just
about downloading new software; e-government should also be smart government
that serves the people more efficiently.</p>



<p>Similarly,
the introduction of central bank digital currencies will need a superior
governance framework to prevent bad outcomes. Here we perhaps need to be
reminded about bad monetary outcomes in history. It is difficult to separate
the role of the issuer of money, be it a mint in ancient Greece or a modern
central bank, from the fiscal obligations of its owner, the sovereign.&nbsp; These are two sides of the coin. Several
writers who focused on the finances of the ancient world conclude that the
unsustainable public finances of ancient Greece and Rome were ultimately the
real cause of the collapse of those empires. [2]</p>



<p>In
one of the largest recorded increases in the money supply of the Roman Empire&nbsp;– a tenfold
rise in the circulation of mainly silver coinage between 157BC and 50BC – smart
administration and structural changes initially held back inflation. The measures included more cash reserves held by the
banks and the Roman treasury.
But these supportive factors eventually reversed. The Roman coin
the denarius (which had its own symbol Ӿ), was gradually debased from a practically pure
silver coin to one just washed in silver. Its value plummeted (figure 1). </p>



<p>Figure 1: The price of one pound of gold in denarii,
log scale, 50 BC to 350 AD</p>



Source [3]



<p>The
wealthy were initially able to protect themselves from inflation with a
diversified portfolio that included gold, silver and real estate. But when Rome
eventually fell to the invaders, and the new capital moved to Ravenna, the rich
could not take their land with them. </p>



<p>Rome was not built in a day and its money was not destroyed in a day either. We will need a smart new governance framework for the era of central bank digital currencies. </p>

  <p>When employees were sent home from their offices en masse amid the global onset of COVID-19, many businesses scrambled to adopt technology solutions to enable their teams to work remotely. IT leaders have now realized the urgency to scale up their digital workplace technology stacks to ensure the long-term resiliency of their business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pandemic rapidly elevated many digital workplace technologies from nice-to-have to must-have status</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“According to the Gartner 2020 Digital Workplace Survey, 68% of respondents agreed that more C-level execs have expressed involvement in the digital workplace since COVID-19,” says <a href="http://www.gartner.com/analyst/25743/Matthew-W.-Cain">Matt Cain</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “From meeting solution software, to enterprise chat platforms, to desktop-as-a-service, the pandemic rapidly elevated many digital workplace technologies from nice-to-have to must-have status.”</p>
<p>The need for replacements for in-person activities is leading to heightened interest in the emerging technologies included in the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle">Gartner Hype Cycle for the Digital Workplace, 2020</a>. Here are the top digital workplace trends on the Hype Cycle that CIOs will be paying attention to in the years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz01OTdiM2IwMGRkNmQxMWVhYTZiMTBlMTg5NWRmNWQxMQ=="></a></p>
 Trend 1: The new work nucleus 
<p>The “new work nucleus” refers to a collection of SaaS-based personal productivity, collaboration and communication tools, combined into one cloud office product. It generally includes email, instant messaging, file sharing, conferencing, document management and editing, search and discovery, and collaboration.</p>
<p>The new work nucleus has become a cornerstone of most organizations’ digital workplace infrastructures, particularly in today’s remote work environment. Reliance on cloud office technologies has increased due to a general preference for cloud, as well as the desire to reduce costs, drive simplicity and continuously provide more functionality to employees. Vendors are upgrading cloud services with new mobility, content discovery and artificial intelligence (AI) features.</p>
 Trend 2: Bring your own thing 
<p>Individuals are beginning to use more personal Internet of Things (IoT) devices or wearables at work, in a trend known as bring your own thing (BYOT). BYOT involves a wide range of objects, such as fitness bands, smart lights, air filters, voice assistants, smart earbuds and consumer virtual reality (VR) headsets. In the future it will include highly sophisticated devices such as robots and drones.</p>
<p>“As homes and domestic technology become smarter and consumers acquire more IoT technology, a growing range of personal things will be brought into offices or used to support remote working,” says Cain.</p>

 Trend 3: The distance economy 
<p>In-person events and meetings were once the norm and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-lead-better-remote-meetings/">virtual meetings</a> the exception, but COVID-19 has flipped those scenarios. The pandemic influenced the emergence of the distance economy, or business activities that don’t rely on face-to-face activity. Organizations with operating models that depend on first-party or hosted events have switched quickly to virtual alternatives.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, as internal meetings, client interactions, new hire interviews and a variety of other business activities have gone virtual, the distance economy has given rise to a new generation of meeting solutions that attempt to more closely mimic an in-person meeting.</p>

 Trend 4: Smart workspaces 
<p>A smart workspace leverages the growing digitalization of physical objects to deliver new ways of working and improve workforce efficiency. Examples of smart workspace technologies include IoT, digital signage, integrated workplace management systems, virtual workspaces, motion sensors and facial recognition. Any location where people work can be a smart workspace, such as office buildings, desk spaces, conference rooms and even home spaces.</p>
<p>As employees <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-early-return-to-workplace-lessons-from-asia/">return to work post-COVID-19</a>, organizations will take full advantage of smart workspaces as they revisit design strategies to better understand how people participate in physical spaces or adhere to social distancing. Such insight can create new capabilities related to seating and room allocation, access management and wayfaring.</p>
 Trend 5: Desktop-as-a-service 
<p>Desktop as a service (DaaS) provides users with an on-demand, virtualized desktop experience delivered from a remotely hosted location. It includes provisioning, patching and maintenance of the management plane and resources to host workloads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COVID-19 highlighted the value and business continuity strength of DaaS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations have long been interested in adopting <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/virtual-desktop-infrastructure-vdi">virtual desktop infrastructure</a>, but complexity and capital investment have made implementations difficult. COVID-19 highlighted the value and business continuity strength of DaaS in its ability to rapidly enable remote work where on-premises options have stalled. The pandemic is likely to accelerate adoption of DaaS, and it may even perpetuate as a delivery architecture when employees return to the office.</p>
 Trend 6: Democratized technology services 
<p>Technology services of the future will be assembled and composed by the people that actually use them. A few examples of democratized technology services include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer">Citizen developers</a>, or employees who create new business applications using development tools and runtime environments sanctioned by corporate IT. Citizen developers are empowered by the availability and power of low-code and “no code” development tools. 
 Citizen integrator tools, which enable expert business users with minimal IT skills to handle relatively simple application, data and process integration tasks by themselves through very intuitive, no-code development environments. 
 Citizen data science, an emerging set of capabilities that enable users to extract advanced analytic insights from data without the need for extensive data science expertise.

  <p>In today’s connected world, APIs are becoming an essential part of software and hardware companies. APIs allow companies to expose their services to third-party developers and integrate with other services. As more and more APIs are built and exposed to the internet, it is essential to secure them from unauthorized access. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-3.1">ASP.NET Core 3.1 Web API</a> using GraphQL and secure it with Okta.</p>

<p>ASP.NET Core is an open-source framework for building web apps and web APIs. It is cross-platform, runs on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction">.NET Core</a>, and can be hosted on-premise or cloud-based.</p>

<p>To continue you will need:</p>

 
   A basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core 3.1 SDK</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Benefits of GraphQL 

<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is an open-source technology developed by Facebook that allows API developers to create a type system for the data—allowing clients to write queries against these types—and a server-side runtime for executing these queries. GraphQL allows you to query exactly the fields you need, so you can avoid fetching extra data that you don’t need. It also is strongly typed so it validates all your queries before running them. GraphQL isn’t tied to any specific web framework or database engine and can be used with any technology that supports it.</p>

 Create an ASP.NET Core API with GraphQL 

<p>Let’s build an API for time tracking. Fire up Visual Studio and create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project select ASP.NET Core Web Application, and click Next. Name the app TimeGraphServer and click Create. On the next window, select Empty and click OK.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create the project by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

   <code>dotnet new web
</code>   

 Create Data Model and Set Up Database 

<p>For the demo of this article, I’ll use an in-memory database provider for Entity Framework Core. I’ll install the latest version of <code>Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory</code> NuGet package (3.1.7 as of publish date of this post). You can also install it from NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory --version 3.1.7
</code>   

<p>In the <code>TimeGraphServer</code> project create a folder called <code>Models</code> and add <code>Project.cs</code> and <code>TimeLog.cs</code> classes:</p>

   <code>public class Project
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string CreatedBy { get; set; }
}
</code>   

   <code>public class TimeLog
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public DateTime From { get; set; }
  public DateTime To { get; set; }

  public string User { get; set; }

  public int ProjectId { get; set; }
  public Project Project { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to set up a database context for Entity Framework Core. Create another folder called <code>Database</code> and add <code>TimeGraphContext</code> class:</p>

   <code>public class TimeGraphContext : DbContext
{
  public TimeGraphContext(DbContextOptions&lt;TimeGraphContext&gt; options) : base(options)
  {
  }

  public DbSet&lt;Project&gt; Projects { get; set; }
  public DbSet&lt;TimeLog&gt; TimeLogs { get; set; }
}

</code>   

<p>Now that we have the <code>TimeGraphContext</code>, let’s add it to the available services. Open the <code>Startup.cs</code> file and paste the following in <code>ConfigureServices</code> method:</p>

   <code>services.AddDbContext&lt;TimeGraphContext&gt;(context =&gt;
{
  context.UseInMemoryDatabase("TimeGraphServer");
});
</code>   

<p>You have now configured Entity Framework Core to use an in-memory database called <code>TimeGraphServer</code>. The in-memory database is mainly used for tests, but it will be enough for the purposes of this tutorial.</p>

<p>Now let’s populate the database with some dummy data. In the <code>TimeGraphContext</code> class, override the <code>OnModelCreating</code> method and replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
  modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Project&gt;().HasData(new Project
  {
      CreatedBy = "Giorgi",
      Id = 1,
      Name = "Migrate to TLS 1.2"
  }, new Project
  {
      CreatedBy = "Giorgi",
      Id = 2,
      Name = "Move Blog to Hugo"
  });

  modelBuilder.Entity&lt;TimeLog&gt;().HasData(new TimeLog
  {
      Id = 1,
      From = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 12, 0, 0),
      To = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 14, 0, 0),
      ProjectId = 1,
      User = "Giorgi"
  }, new TimeLog
  {
      Id = 2,
      From = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 16, 0, 0),
      To = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 18, 0, 0),
      ProjectId = 1,
      User = "Giorgi"
  }, new TimeLog
  {
      Id = 3,
      From = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 20, 0, 0),
      To = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 22, 0, 0),
      ProjectId = 2,
      User = "Giorgi"
  });
}
</code>   

<p>To force Entity Framework Core to create the database containing the seed data, add <code>Database.EnsureCreated();</code> to the constructor of the <code>TimeGraphContext</code> class.</p>

<p>Our database set up is now complete so you are now ready to add GraphQL support to the project.</p>

 Configure GraphQL in Your API 

<p>To add GraphQL support I will use the <a href="https://hotchocolate.io/">HotChocolate</a> library. HotChocolate is a set of libraries that provide GraphQL implementation for .NET Core and .NET Classic.</p>

<p>First, install the following packages:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore
dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Playground
</code>   

<p>Next, go to the <code>Startup</code> class and replace the <code>Configure</code> method with this:</p>

   <code>if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
  app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
  app.UsePlayground(new PlaygroundOptions
  {
      QueryPath = "/api",
      Path = "/playground"
  });
}

app.UseGraphQL("/api");
</code>   

<p>This will configure GraphQL server to be available at the <code>/api</code> endpoint and, when running in development mode, we will have a nice simple GraphQL ide available at <code>/playground</code> which we will see in action in a minute.</p>

<p>Next, I will expose our types to GraphQL for querying.</p>

 Add Queries to GraphQL 

<p>For each type that you want to expose through GraphQL, you need to create a corresponding GraphQL type. Add a folder called <code>GraphQL</code> to the project and create <code>GraphQLTypes.cs</code> like this:</p>

   <code>public class ProjectType : ObjectType&lt;Project&gt;
{
}

public class TimeLogType : ObjectType&lt;TimeLog&gt;
{
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add <code>Query.cs</code> and paste the following:</p>

   <code>public class Query
{
  private readonly TimeGraphContext dbContext;

  public Query(TimeGraphContext dbContext)
  {
      this.dbContext = dbContext;
  }

  public IQueryable&lt;Project&gt; Projects =&gt; dbContext.Projects;
  public IQueryable&lt;TimeLog&gt; TimeLogs =&gt; dbContext.TimeLogs;
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Query</code> class is the root type that the GraphQL server will expose—it will allow clients to query <code>Project</code> and <code>TimeLog</code> entities. Go to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method in the <code>Startup</code> class and add the following:</p>

   <code>services.AddGraphQL(provider =&gt; SchemaBuilder.New().AddServices(provider)
    .AddType&lt;ProjectType&gt;()
    .AddType&lt;TimeLogType&gt;()
    .AddQueryType&lt;Query&gt;()
    .Create());
</code>   

<p>This will add the <code>Query</code> type as a root query type and register a GraphQL schema with the dependency injection container.</p>

<p>This completes the definition of our GraphQL queries so let’s run the project now and see what our GraphQL API looks like!</p>

 Execute Queries from GraphQL Playground 

<p>Hit the F5 button and you will see GraphQL playground which looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you click the Schema button at the right of the screen you will see the raw contents of our GraphQL API schema:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Docs button and you will see a human-readable version of the schema:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, paste the following query in the left panel and click the Play button:</p>

   <code>{
  projects{
      id
      createdBy
      name
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Our GraphQL API will execute the query, and you will see the results in the right panel:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, it’s time to secure the API!</p>

 Secure GraphQL API with Okta 

<p>In this tutorial, I will use Okta to easily secure the API, so that I don’t have to roll my own identity provider and deal with all the tricky details. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, as well as all OpenID connect flows out of the box—so it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>To get started, log in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a>—via the URL emailed to you after signing up—to access your org’s portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, create a new application. Click Applications in the top menu and then Add Application. Select Native and click Service.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name (I will use TimeGraphClient), and click Done. On the next screen, you will see <code>Client Id</code> and <code>Client Secret</code> of the application. You will need these to call the API, so take note of them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go back to Visual Studio and add <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> and <code>HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Authorization</code> NuGet packages:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Authorization
</code>   

 Configure Okta middleware 

<p>Go the <code>Startup</code> class and add this using statement:</p>

   <code>using Okta.AspNetCore;
</code>   

<p>Next, add the following code in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method and add your Okta configuration:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
  options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
  options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
  options.DefaultSignInScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddOktaWebApi(new OktaWebApiOptions()
{
  OktaDomain = "https://${yourOktaDomain}"
});
</code>   

<p>Then, in the Configure method, add this line above the <code>UseGraphQL</code> line:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
</code>   

 Add Authorization to HotChocolate 

<p>Now that you have configured authentication for the service, you need to secure the actual GraphQL objects. In this tutorial, I will allow unauthorized users to query <code>Projects</code> but require authentication for <code>TimeLogs.</code></p>

<p>To achieve this override, <code>Configure</code> method in <code>TimeLogType</code> class:</p>

   <code>  protected override void Configure(IObjectTypeDescriptor&lt;TimeLog&gt; descriptor)
  {
      descriptor.Authorize();
  }
</code>   

<p>Finally, go to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method and register authorize directive in the <code>AddGraphQL</code> method:</p>

   <code>services.AddGraphQL(provider =&gt; SchemaBuilder.New().AddServices(provider)
    .AddType&lt;ProjectType&gt;()
    .AddType&lt;TimeLogType&gt;()
    .AddAuthorizeDirectiveType()
    .AddQueryType&lt;Query&gt;()
    .Create());
</code>   

 Test Your Secure GraphQL API 

<p>If you run the project again and execute the same query as above, you will get the same results as the previous time. But, if you run the query for all the <code>TimeLog</code> entries, you will get The current user is not authorized to access this resource error:</p>

   <code>{
  timeLogs{
      id
      from
      to
  }
}
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>To access the protected items, you need to make a call to your authenticator so that you receive a token. In your Okta developer console, go to API and click Authorization Servers. Note the Issuer URI as you will need it to make the request to get a token. Finally, click on the name of the server, click on the Scopes tab, and add a new scope called <code>api_access</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are now ready to request a token from your authorization server. To make the request I will use Postman but you are free to use any other REST client that you prefer. The token endpoint is located at <code>/v1/token</code>, so I will make a request to <code>https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token</code> URL. You will also need to pass the <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code> parameters of your client application. Issue the request and you will get an <code>access_token</code> back from your authorization server:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have <code>access_token</code>, go back to the playground, click on the HTTP HEADERS panel and pass your token in <code>Authorization</code> header like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "Authorization":"Bearer &lt;your token here&gt;"
}
</code>   

<p>Click the Play button and this time you will get the list of <code>TimeLog</code> entries:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you have a secure GraphQL API!</p>

  <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Technologies">Unity Technologies</a>. The engine is able to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.</p>

<p>Identity security is a key concept that is mostly missing in Unity. In fact, most engines today do not provide solutions for securing identity, authenticating users, and authorizing users. The industry has instead traditionally relied on custom-built solutions and/or delegated auth from other products, like game stores. As the industry advances beyond anonymous consumption of video games, into massively interconnected online projects, or professional XR use cases such as ArchViz and simulation, new requirements have appeared for authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>In gaming, use cases tend to depend on the project itself. A single-player game really only needs to focus on protecting its own intellectual property from theft. Using a game store’s authorization—as is common today—is more than enough for this use case. Even the introduction of microtransactions can stay secure with just a store if these transactions are being handled by that store. However, once the project gets to a point where a user’s client needs to authenticate a user and authorize that user to one or multiple servers, the solutions provided by stores fall short. It gets even more complicated when users are actually making purchases or entering personal information into your game client directly. Once the game gets to a more complex level of interconnectivity, and once users are trusting you with private information and financial information, proper identity security is paramount.</p>

<p>With XR use cases, the concept is similar to what is described above for gaming—especially if the project is a VR game—however professional XR projects open up a whole new area of interest. Professional projects such as ArchViz, or simulations done for security or scientific application, need to protect the intellectual property within the project itself, and the user identity, just like games. However, more is potentially needed to handle authorization to specific aspects of the project results, as well as professional requirements to integrate or federate with other technologies used by these professionals.</p>

<p>The level of effort to build identity security from scratch is massive. Just to build a secure store for identity, authentication with basic username/password, authorization via OAuth, and basic security policy, it takes a large team months. When you account for keeping the tech up to date with new standards, compliance with standards such as PCI, compliance with GDPR, complex multi-factor authentication, and complex authorization rules, it becomes apparent that the work is not a one-time effort and it is not easy. Rather than spend countless development cycles focusing on identity security—when the team should be focused on the core project itself—it is much easier and more secure to leave it to the experts. Okta is the most advanced identity platform on the market today and represents the best of breed solution for developers, including Game/XR developers creating within Unity.</p>

 Core Concepts 

<p>Before we jump into Unity, it is important to understand what options exist to handle authentication and authorization of users within your project. The most common designs are in engine with native UI, in engine with OAuth via browser, external with native UI, and external with OAuth via browser. The other option, as previously mentioned, is to trust authorization from another product such as a game store.</p>

<p>The decision that needs to be addressed first is the balancing act that every security team must make between what is most secure and what has the best user experience. If the decision is that the project is not storing sensitive user data, then it is reasonable to focus on user experience. However, if there is even a slight risk that a data breach would negatively affect individual consumers, security must take the front seat.</p>

<p>When a project accepts authorization from another product, one that is not a security product like Okta, there is a huge risk with that trust. Risk that users are not being challenged properly with MFA, risk that standards and technology get out of date from what is standard in the security industry, and risk that user data is not being secured and passed correctly and safely. This is the risk represented by delegating security to a game store.</p>

<p>The most secure option would be to leverage OAuth2/OIDC either in the engine or externally in the project’s launcher. OAuth2/OIDC is the industry standard best practice for authorization/authentication. OAuth specification defines multiple different flows, or grants, but the most recommended for security is Auth Code with PKCE. You can read more about OAuth2 <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/">here</a>. The complaint typically with OAuth, especially within a game engine directly, is that it traditionally leverages a browser and a hosted login experience. Okta provides a hosted login experience that is fully customizable via HTML/CSS and Unity is able to pop up a browser and receive tokens from it after authentication. How to do this will be described in this blog. What needs to be considered is if that user experience is acceptable for the project. The browser can also be embedded with different Unity browser plugins, found in the asset store, which might make the experience better because the user will not need to leave the game to interact with an external browser. OAuth is considered more secure because users are putting their credentials into a trusted browser and a trusted, secure, login page. Furthermore, the access token that is returned at the end of the authorization process is retrieved by code not running in a browser which means intercepting it is difficult to impossible.</p>

<p>Okta also supports a native UI experience both in engine or externally. This is a better user experience but considered potentially less secure because the project’s code is now required to accept a password from a user, properly handle it in a secure way from start to finish, and be secure enough that it can’t be exploited by bad actors or rogue software. Essentially you take all of the risk onto yourself to handle the information from the user with care. This concept also requires a bit more work in UI development because the UI will be entirely built in engine and Okta would be interacted with via API only. This option will be reviewed in this blog as well.</p>

<p>In order to help visualize the difference between these concepts, this blog will show you how to build for Native UI and OAuth via browser in engine. These same concepts can also be applied to external solutions, such as a launcher. developer.okta.com contains countless guides and blogs that can assist further with the external use case.</p>

 Create the Project 

<p>Get started by creating a new project in Unity Hub. Select 3D and give the project a name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unity will take a moment to set everything up and open the project. Once open, click Assets &gt; Import Package and select the <code>OktaSDK.unitypackage</code> file. The Okta Auth SDK will be used for the Native UI design. The SDK is not required for OAuth. A <a href="https://okta.box.com/s/m5q2ucervn03cbzu5dpgzx2vxmeg3xph">Okta SDK Unity Package</a> has been provided with this guide to simplify this process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet">Okta SDK for .NET</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-dotnet">Okta Auth SDK for .NET</a> can be found on GitHub and NuGet. However, Unity does not work well with NuGet and compiling from source should not be necessary. If manual installation is desired, there are numerous dependencies that NuGet would normally add to a project with the SDK. These dependencies will need to be manually downloaded and added to Unity. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet Gallery</a> is recommended for this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure all libraries are selected and click Import. This will create a Plugins folder inside the Assets folder which is how Unity knows to import the .NET libraries as <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingDLL.html">managed plugins</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on the Asset Store tab in the editor and search for <code>Unity Samples: UI.</code> This example asset was created by Unity Technologies as a learning asset, teaching best practices for building UI’s inside of Unity. For this guide, we will leverage this UI to build our login experience.</p>

<p>Click Import and import all of the assets in the package.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the import process is complete, click on the Scenes folder and open the <code>Menu 3D</code> scene. Click Play to run the project and make sure that the UI is properly functioning.</p>

<p>Save 2 copies of this scene, one for <code>Native</code>, and one for <code>OAuth</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Native: Build the Auth Menu 

<p>Open the example scene saved for the Native experience.</p>

<p>The UI sample asset does not come with any type of input field. We will need input fields for a <code>Username</code> box and a <code>Password</code> box. To create a new Input Field object:</p>

 
   Open the <code>Prefabs</code> folder 
   Duplicate the SF Button object (Ctrl + D) 
   Rename the duplicate object SF InputField 
   Delete the label element out of the object 
   Click the GameObject menu &gt; UI &gt; InputField 
   Position the new InputField where the label element was 
   Switch the gizmo to scale and resize the InputField to fill out the box 
 

<p></p>

<p>Next, a new menu will be needed for the Auth Menu. The simplest way to create this is to duplicate the existing <code>MainMenu</code> object and customize it. To create the Auth Menu:</p>

 
   Select <code>MainMenu</code> and duplicate it (Ctrl + D). 
   With <code>MainMenu</code> still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the <code>MainMenu</code> object disappear. 
   Rename the duplicated menu to <code>AuthMenu</code>. 
   Delete the <code>Continue</code> and <code>New Game</code> objects 
   Rename the <code>Settings</code> object to <code>Next</code> 
   Drag in 2 of the InputField prefabs and rename them to <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code> respectively. 
   Expand the <code>Password</code> object and click on the InputField object. In the Inspector, scroll down to Content Type and change to Password. 
   Change <code>Username's</code> position PosY to 70, and change <code>Password's</code> PosY to 0. 
   Expand the <code>Username</code> object, expand the InputField, select Placeholder, and change the text to <code>Username</code>. Do this for the <code>Password</code> object next. 
   With <code>AuthMenu</code> still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the <code>AuthMenu</code> disappear. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click <code>MenuManager</code> and make sure it is enabled in the inspector. Find the <code>PanelManager</code> script component attached to the <code>MenuManager</code> object and double click to edit. This will open up the primary IDE configured in Unity.</p>

 Native: Authenticate with Okta 

<p>Reference the <code>Okta Auth SDK</code> by adding the following to the end of the using statements.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Auth.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Abstractions.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>The login code will need to understand some of the elements in the menu to be able to interact with them. Expose public variables so that these elements can be configured in the editor. After the initiallyOpen Animator on line 11, add:</p>

   <code>public Animator authMenu;
public static bool isAuthenticated;

public InputField Username;
public InputField Password;
public string OktaDomain;
</code>   

<p><code>authMenu</code> will hold the <code>AuthMenu</code> object that was created earlier. <code>IsAuthenticated</code> will allow the UI to determine what to display. The two InputFields will hold the <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code> InputField objects that were added to the Auth Menu. The <code>OktaDomain</code> string will hold the <code>Okta Developer Org URL</code>.</p>

<p>At line 38, inside the <code>OpenPanel</code> method, add:</p>

   <code>if (!isAuthenticated)
{
   anim = authMenu;
}
</code>   

<p>In <code>OpenPanel</code>, anim is the variable holding what UI panel to open. If authentication is required or has not been completed, we always want to override whatever panel is in the process of opening and open the Auth Menu instead. This forces the user to log in when needed.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>Login()</code> function that the <code>Next</code> button will call on click. At line 86 add:</p>

   <code>public async void Login()
{
   var client = new AuthenticationClient(new OktaClientConfiguration
   {
      OktaDomain = OktaDomain,
   });

   var authnOptions = new AuthenticateOptions()
   {
      Username = Username.text.ToString(),
      Password = Password.text.ToString(),
   };

   try
   {
      var authnResponse = await client.AuthenticateAsync(authnOptions);

      Debug.Log("Authentication Status: " + authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus);
      if (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus == "SUCCESS")
      {
         //Store the token
         Debug.Log(authnResponse.SessionToken);
         isAuthenticated = true;

         OpenPanel(initiallyOpen);
      }
      else
      {
         //Handle Errors
         Debug.Log("Authentication Failed...");
      }
   }
   catch (System.Exception ex)
    {
      Debug.Log(ex.Message);
     }
 }
</code>   

<p>Save <code>PanelManager.cs</code> and switch back to Unity.</p>

<p>Make sure <code>MenuManager</code> is selected and notice the new properties in the <code>PanelManager</code> component attached to the <code>MenuManager</code> object. To configure the PanelManager, do the following:</p>

 
   Drag the <code>AuthMenu</code> object from the project hierarchy to the <code>authMenu</code> property in the inspector. 
   Drag the InputField from the <code>Username</code> object in the project hierarchy to the <code>Username</code> property in the inspector. 
   Drag the InputField from the <code>Password</code> object in the project hierarchy to the <code>Password</code> property in the inspector. 
   Enter the Okta domain from the Okta developer org “{yourOktaDomain}”. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now, wire the <code>Next</code> button’s OnClick event to the <code>Login()</code> method in <code>PanelManager.cs</code>. Click the <code>Next</code> button object in the hierarchy window, find the On Click () section in the inspector windows and change the dropdown to PanelManager &gt; Login().</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Play to run the project and log in using user credentials for a user in the associated Okta Developer Org.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If Authentication was successful, a session token will appear along with the <code>SUCCESS</code> result coming from the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">Okta AuthN API</a>.</p>

<p>Now that the client is able to authenticate users via basic auth, more advanced concepts can be added such as support for MFA and user account/profile management. This is done by adding logic to the code described in this guide that handles other authentication states within the Okta <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">AuthN</a> API. The SDK is already able to handle these concepts which means that the additional code is needed only for the UI in Unity. This code is outside the scope of this blog but the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">AuthN</a> API leveraged for this experience is documented on developer.okta.com</p>

 OAuth: Authenticate with Okta 

<p>Open the scene that was saved for the <code>OAuth</code> experience.</p>

<p>To protect the scene with OAuth, a simple GameObject is all that is needed. Create one by clicking GameObject and then Create New. Name this GameObject <code>OktaOAuth2</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Scripts</code> does not exist in the project, create a folder called <code>Assets</code> and a folder inside Assets called <code>Scripts</code>. Create a new cs script within the <code>Scripts</code> folder and name this script <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>. This script will be added to the GameObject and will force unauthorized users to authorize before interacting with the scene.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Edit <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>.</p>

<p>This example makes use of multiple libraries, all of which are included with .Net with the exception of Newtonsoft.Json. Start by adding the following references:</p>

   <code>using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.IO;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
</code>   

<p>Newtonsoft.Json is already included with the Okta SDK unity package. If this is already imported into the project, and a Plugins folder already exists with a Newtonsoft.Json.dll file inside, skip the next steps describing the manual installation of Newtonsoft.Json.</p>

<p>Next, go back to Unity and create a folder inside <code>Assets</code> called <code>Plugins</code>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to add Newtonsoft.Json to the Unity project is to manually download it and add it to the project. This is because Unity does not support Nuget directly.</p>

<p>Go to <code>nuget.org</code> and search <code>Newtonsoft</code>. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/</a> Download the package and open it as a zip file. Open lib &gt; net20 and extract Newtonsoft.Json.dll to the <code>Plugins</code> folder in the Unity project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go back to editing <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>.</p>

<p>Within the default class generated by Unity, create public variables to hold our Okta configuration information.</p>

   <code>// client configuration
public string clientID;
public string clientSecret;
public string authorizationEndpoint;
public string tokenEndpoint;
public string userInfoEndpoint;
</code>   

<p>In the <code>Start()</code> method, call <code>doOAuth()</code>, which is where we will process the OAuth logic.</p>

   <code>// Start is called before the first frame update
void Start()
{
   // Add logic to check current auth state and only doOAuth() when needed.
   doOAuth();
}
</code>   

<p><code>doOAuth()</code> will need to handle popping up a browser, redirecting the user for authentication, and receiving/validating access tokens upon return. How to design code in .Net for OAuth2 is a large topic and outside the scope of this blog. You can read more about OAuth2 <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/">here</a> on developer.okta.com. For this example, I am providing code that I am using in my own project to help explain the concept.</p>

   <code>private async void doOAuth()
{
    // Generates state and PKCE values.
    string state = randomDataBase64url(32);
    string code_verifier = randomDataBase64url(32);
    string code_challenge = base64urlencodeNoPadding(sha256(code_verifier));
    const string code_challenge_method = "S256";
    // Creates a redirect URI using an available port on the loopback address.
    string redirectURI = string.Format("http://{0}:{1}/", IPAddress.Loopback, /*GetRandomUnusedPort()*/51772);
    output("redirect URI: " + redirectURI);
    // Creates an HttpListener to listen for requests on that redirect URI.
    var http = new HttpListener();
    http.Prefixes.Add(redirectURI);
    output("Listening..");

<p>While the OAuth2 code can vary, so long as it follows spec, the part that is relevant for Unity is how to get the browser to appear and redirect the user to login.</p>

   <code>// Opens request in the browser.
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(authorizationRequest);
</code>   

<p>Passing a URL to <code>System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()</code> in Unity will launch a browser that can be used to log a user in. This part could be replaced with an <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/embedded-browser-55459">embedded browser</a> solution from the asset store to improve the user experience by keeping the user in the engine. However, the interaction with Okta would be the same.</p>

<p>The OAuth2 code provided does rely on a few helper methods around base64 encoding, cryptology, and logging.</p>

   <code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Appends the given string to the on-screen log, and the debug console.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="output"&gt;string to be appended&lt;/param&gt;
public void output(string output)
{
   Debug.Log(output);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns URI-safe data with a given input length.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="length"&gt;Input length (nb. output will be longer)&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string randomDataBase64url(uint length)
{
   RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
    byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
   rng.GetBytes(bytes);
   return base64urlencodeNoPadding(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns the SHA256 hash of the input string.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="inputString"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static byte[] sha256(string inputString)
{
   byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(inputString);
   SHA256Managed sha256 = new SHA256Managed();
   return sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Base64url no-padding encodes the given input buffer.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="buffer"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string base64urlencodeNoPadding(byte[] buffer)
{
   string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(buffer);

   // Converts base64 to base64url.
   base64 = base64.Replace("+", "-");
   base64 = base64.Replace("/", "_");
   // Strips padding.
   base64 = base64.Replace("=", "");

    return base64;
}
</code>   

<p>The most important logic still needed is calling out to UserInfo. UserInfo is an Open ID Connect defined endpoint that returns data on a user in exchange for a valid access token. Okta has the ability to add new data as claims to the access token itself so this may not be required, but if the goal is to keep the access token as light as possible, this type of introspection might be desired.</p>

   <code>async void userinfoCall(string access_token)
{
   output("Making API Call to Userinfo...");

   // sends the request
   HttpWebRequest userinfoRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(userInfoEndpoint);
   userinfoRequest.Method = "GET";
   userinfoRequest.Headers.Add(string.Format("Authorization: Bearer {0}", access_token));
   userinfoRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
   //userinfoRequest.Accept = "Accept=text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";

   // gets the response
   WebResponse userinfoResponse = await userinfoRequest.GetResponseAsync();
   using (StreamReader userinfoResponseReader = new StreamReader(userinfoResponse.GetResponseStream()))
   {
      // reads response body
      string userinfoResponseText = await userinfoResponseReader.ReadToEndAsync();
      output(userinfoResponseText);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Save the script and go back to Unity.</p>

<p>Click the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject and notice the public variables from the <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code> script in the inspector.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go to an Okta tenant, or create a new dev tenant at <code>developer.okta.com</code>, and log in.</p>

<p>Click on Applications &gt; Add Application and choose Web.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>This application is the representation of your OAuth2 client within Okta. Give the application a name and trust the local IP/Port that your client will be using to interact with Okta. By default, the sample code is set to <code>http://127.0.0.1:51772</code> where the IP is the client’s local IP address.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done.</p>

<p>The next menu will be the General tab for the application’s settings menu. At the bottom of General, there is a section containing a <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code>. Copy these and paste them into the inspector for the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject in Unity.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>For the three endpoint URL’s, go back to Okta. In the top menu click API &gt; Authorization Servers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click default to open the default authorization server. Click the Metadata URI link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Find the <code>authorization endpoint</code>, <code>token endpoint</code>, and <code>userinfo endpoint</code> urls, copy and paste into the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject inspector in Unity.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Fully log out of Okta and close the browser if possible before testing. Make sure the project is saved and run it. When the browser appears, log in. Close the browser when prompted and return to Unity. The console will contain tokens and claims for the user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The great thing about authenticating via OAuth2 and Okta’s hosted login widget is that the level of effort to build out the UI to support complex concepts like MFA is no longer required. Okta handles every aspect of authentication freeing up developers to focus on the project itself. Best of all, this hosted login experience can be fully customized. Everything from the domain of the page to its HTML and CSS is exposed within Okta so that users stay within your branded echo system.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To further enhance the example, code could be added to check a user’s authentication state on start of every scene or before secure actions are allowed. This is easily done by calling the <code>userinfoCall()</code> method from the example code. Simply save the access token on the user’s first login to a secure location, such as a vault, and check if there is a token on <code>Start()</code>. If a token exists, send it to the <code>userinfoCall()</code> method from the sample code and act on the results. If there is no token, or if the existing token is not valid, call <code>doOAuth()</code>.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Identity security is a very complex, but increasingly required, aspect of most game/XR projects today. The resource commitment required to build out all of the functionality needed, and then maintain and grow that functionality, is massive. When it’s done incorrectly it can be devastating. Leaving identity security to the experts and leveraging the best of breed Okta Identity Platform for all identity security needs in your project will save countless hours and ensure that intellectual property and customer accounts are properly secured.</p>

<p>To expand on the ideas discussed in this blog, I recommend further reading on securely storing access tokens using vaults, such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">HashiCorp Vault</a>, and authorizing users to Network Engines such as <a href="https://www.photonengine.com/pun">Photon</a>. Stay tuned to developer.okta.com/blog for further discussions on these topics and more.</p>

					 <p>The easiest way to explain <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is to pull out an item that people carry on a daily basis—a wallet.¹ It’s strange to use a leather pouch to explain such a complex, nascent technology as SSI, but it works! And it works because most of the magic of SSI happens within and between digital wallets.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Going from leather to digital 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Apart from money, the leather wallet you carry in your pocket or purse stores important identifying cards (i.e., your driver’s license, health insurance card, employee badge, etc.). We show these cards to people and organizations on a daily basis to receive access to services by proving we are who we say we are. A wallet makes it easy to access these cards when we need them, and it keeps the cards from being lost or stolen.²</p><p><br>Just like a leather wallet stores a variety of important physical cards, an SSI digital wallet stores your <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, making it easy for you to show those credentials to others in a secure, private way. As the name implies, a digital wallet is digital and can exist locally (ie., on your mobile device or desktop) or in the cloud. A more formal definition of digital wallets is below:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				A digital wallet, in the context of self-sovereign identity, is a software application and encrypted database that stores credentials, keys, and other secrets necessary for self-sovereign identity.³			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Each participant in the SSI ecosystem (the issuer, the holder, and the verifier) needs a digital wallet in order to issue, hold, and verify verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What can you do with an SSI digital wallet? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Collect credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Just like the leather pouch in your pocket stores important documents, your digital wallet stores your verifiable credentials. When you are issued a credential, it will be stored in your wallet. The wallet makes it so that the credentials are:<br><br></p>  Easily accessible: With a click of a button, you have access to all of your credentials which you can seamlessly share with others.  Secure: Your credentials are stored only on your device. No one else has access to them—not even the wallet provider (e.g., Trinsic).  Private: You are in full control of who you send the credential to and what pieces of information on the credential you show them.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Share verifiable information 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Here’s where the rubber meets the road. When you have a digital wallet, anybody can request information from you. The information is entirely under your control, so you can choose to share the information or reject their request. If you decide to respond, the wallet finds credentials with the relevant data and shares just what they need to know, without sharing everything. For example, you might share your address from your driver’s license credential without sharing your name or birthdate. This is possible through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs).</p><p><br>Best of all, the information you share is instantly verifiable, so you can receive access to services seamlessly, just like you do in the real world when you use your physical wallet.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Connect with others 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Finally, if there are parties you want to interact with frequently over time, you can establish a super-private, securely-encrypted connection between you and the other party. You can share information, messages, or any other interaction through this channel with a high degree of trust. While connections are powerful, they’re not always needed; <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">connectionless credential exchange</a> is sometimes a faster, more convenient way to interact, especially when the relationship isn’t long-term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making a connection is as easy as scanning a QR code with your wallet, after which your connection will show up under your “Connections” tab in your wallet. You can also create your own QR code so others can connect with you.</p>

 	 Drummond Reed, an SSI expert, is famous for pulling out his wallet during presentations on SSI. Timothy Ruff, wrote about this tactic in his blog “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">When Explaining SSI, Start with the Wallet</a>“. 
 	 Of course wallets are not foolproof. They can be stolen or lost, but overall, they do a pretty good job of keeping all of our cards in one place that we can keep on us most times throughout the day. SSI digital wallets have their own security protections that are not listed out in detail here as this is an intro post. 
 	 For simplicity’s sake, at Trinsic, we call it all a “wallet” although in more technical circles, you’ll find the term “agent” used for the application that routes messages and decrypts the wallet, and “wallet” used for the storage layer of the agent.

   Redefining Identity: ForgeRock Autonomous Identity&nbsp; 

<p>IT and Security teams are experiencing identity governance fatigue because they are exhausted from manually reviewing and approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications. To address this weariness, ForgeRock is providing a new modern approach to identity. ForgeRock Autonomous Identity is an artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">(AI)-driven identity analytics solution</a>, that allows you to overcome <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-identity-governance-fatigue"> fatigue</a>.</p>

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity provides real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation. By leveraging AI and machine learning techniques, Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes all identity data—such as accounts, roles, assignments, user activity, and entitlements—to identify security access and risk blind spots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The solution provides you with wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access by providing enterprise-wide contextual insights, high-risk user access awareness, and remediation recommendations. Autonomous Identity can be overlaid onto legacy IGA solutions, enabling your organization to increase operational efficiencies, accelerate decision making and maximize existing identity investments.</p>

 Leverage Your Existing Identity Investments&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity works with your existing identity infrastructure to develop a complete view of the user access landscape. This includes identity management, Microsoft Active Directory, identity governance, databases, LDAP systems, and other identity data sources in your organization. The landscape provides highly accurate models, showing what good access should and shouldn’t look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike legacy IGA solutions that are based on leveraging static rules, roles, and peer group analysis, Autonomous Identity relies strictly on the data in your organization to develop an analysis that is free from any bias coming from human-derived rules and roles that exist in your identity management or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> solution.</p>

 How It Works&nbsp; 

<p>Autonomous Identity links users to entitlements at the lowest attribute level. The solution uses profile data to determine the likelihood an individual will need an entitlement, based on how entitlements are currently distributed across the organization.</p>

   Why ForgeRock Autonomous Identity?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Autonomous Identity addresses identity governance fatigue with unique and highly differentiated capabilities, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Global visibility: By leveraging AI-driven identity analytics, you can collect and analyze identity data (examples: accounts, roles, user activity, entitlements, and more) from diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure solutions in order to provide enterprise-wide visibility of all identities and what they have access to across the entire enterprise. This approach provides your security and risk teams with contextual insights into low-, medium-, and high-risk user access at scale. 
	 Highly scalable: As new identity data is collected and old data is purged, the AI and machine learning model evolves and learns the dynamic changes within the enterprise. By leveraging predefined machine learning techniques and algorithms, you can quickly predict, recommend, and identify outliers. This intelligence-based approach allows your security and risk professionals to automatically analyze and model high volumes of identity data to identify high-risk user access and unauthorized or unknown user access across the entire organization. 
	 Data driven: With Autonomous Identity, you can contextually examine all identity-related data and identify and recommend the right level of user access rights. This approach provides the ability to identify and apply appropriate birthright or leaver user access rights to accounts, applications, systems, roles, entitlements, and more. This process reduces the overall request volume by predicting appropriate user access at the right time to the right resources. 
	 Transparent AI: Unlike “black box” identity analytics solutions, Autonomous Identity allows you to fully comprehend how and why risk confidence scores are determined. By visually presenting low-, medium-, and high-risk confidence scores together, your security and risk professionals can contextually understand which key risk indicators were met. This AI-driven approach recommends risk-based identity and governance remediation updates based on enterprise-wide confidence scores. 
	 Dynamic analysis: With intelligent data stream processing, you can leverage existing and diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure data sources to continuously collect and process high-velocity, high-volume data (examples: roles, entitlements, attributes assignments, and more) from across the enterprise. Combined with a highly scalable and distributed microservices architecture, enterprises can process and analyze tens of millions of data points quickly to predict and recommend user access rights and highlight potential risks. This intelligence-based approach enables security and risk professionals to accelerate their decision-making process. 
 <p>Autonomous Identity provides you the unprecedented ability to reduce costs while simultaneously lowering risks across your organization. It is a game-changing solution that is redefining identity by providing organizations with the following key business benefits:&nbsp;</p>

   Do you remember the days when people used tables to arrange content on websites? HTML tables were ideal for arranging content in a grid-style layout. But they had a serious problem.

  <p>Do you remember the days when people used tables to arrange content on websites? HTML tables were ideal for arranging content in a grid-style layout. But they had a serious problem. They mixed content with style, prohibited semantic markup, and made it hard for screen readers to sort the information in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>After dropping the use of tables, the first solution was to use the CSS <code>float</code> to position elements on a web page. But floats are clumsy, fragile, and generally hard to work with. CSS frameworks—like Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation—sprung up to help with the difficulties of creating a responsive grid layout. But these frameworks have their own learning curve and often introduce significant overhead in unused CSS code.</p>

<p>Along came flexbox to help with some of these problems. It made it a lot easier to create a responsive row or column-based layouts. While flexbox is a huge step forward, it doesn’t adequately address all the needs of front-end designers. Designers for print media usually work with a grid system that organizes content on a page. And the need for a method of arranging content in a 2-dimensional space that uses the same concepts that have been used by print designers for many years was recognized.</p>

<p>The CSS grid layout allows you to specify a grid system on your web page and place content inside the grid cells in a responsive manner. Elements inside the grid can span multiple rows or columns while maintaining the correct row heights and gutter spacings. The CSS grid is not supposed to replace flexbox but to work alongside it to create truly professional layouts.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a single page application that uses CSS grids to create a responsive layout without using media queries. The application will be a simple Unicode character browser implemented with React.</p>

 Create a Unicode Browser App with React 

<p>I will assume that you have some familiarity with JavaScript and that you have a recent version of Node installed on your computer. You will first create a React project using the <code>npx</code> command that comes with the Node installation. In a terminal, navigate into a directory of your choice and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app react-grid-unicode
</code>   

<p>This will create a new folder <code>react-grid-unicode</code> and install a skeleton React application into it. Before you start implementing the application, you need to obtain the data files that you will be using for the Unicode look-up. The raw data is available at <a href="https://www.unicode.org">https://www.unicode.org</a> but, to make your life easier, I have created two JSON files that you will be using for this project. In the terminal, navigate into your new project folder and then into the <code>src/</code> folder. Now create a new folder called <code>unicode</code> inside the <code>src</code> folder and download and save the following files into it.</p>

 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/license.txt">license.txt</a> 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/blocks.json">blocks.json</a> 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/unicode.json">unicode.json</a> 
 

<p>If you have <code>wget</code> installed on your system, you can grab these files with the following commands:</p>

   <code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/license.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/blocks.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/unicode.json
</code>   

<p>Next, open your favorite IDE in the project folder and create a new file <code>src/Unicode.js</code> and paste the following content into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import unicode from './unicode/unicode';
import blocks from './unicode/blocks';

class Unicode extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    this.state = { results: this.search('') };
  }

  search(query) {
    return unicode
      .filter((entry) =&gt; entry.name.toUpperCase().includes(query.toUpperCase()))
      .slice(0, 100);
  }

  selectChar(entry) {
    const codeInt = parseInt(entry.code, 16);
    const block = this.findBlock(codeInt);
    this.setState({
      selected: {
        ...entry,
        html: String.fromCharCode(codeInt),
        block: block &amp;&amp; block.name
      }
    });
  }

  findBlock(code) {
    return blocks.filter((b) =&gt; (b.from&lt;=code &amp;&amp; b.to&gt;=code))[0];
  }

  render() {
    const handleSelect = (entry) =&gt; () =&gt; {
      this.selectChar(entry);
    };

    const handleSearch = (event) =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        results: this.search(event.target.value)
      });
    };

    const resultList = this.state.results.map((entry) =&gt;
      &lt;li key={entry.code}
          onClick={handleSelect(entry)}
          className={(this.state.selected &amp;&amp; entry.code===this.state.selected.code) ? 'active' : ''}&gt;
          {entry.name}
      &lt;/li&gt;
    );
    const charInfo = this.state.selected
      ? &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-name"&gt;{ this.state.selected.name }&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-block"&gt;{ this.state.selected.block }&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-code"&gt;&amp;#x{ this.state.selected.code };&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      : undefined;

    return (
      &lt;div className="app-ui"&gt;
        &lt;div className="search-input" onChange={handleSearch}&gt;&lt;input type="text" placeholder="Search"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="search-results"&gt;
          &lt;ul&gt;{resultList}&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="char-display"&gt;{ this.state.selected &amp;&amp; this.state.selected.html }&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="char-info"&gt;{ charInfo }&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default Unicode;
</code>   

<p>In the code above, the top part includes the import of <code>./unicode/unicode</code> and <code>./unicode/blocks</code>. These lines import the JSON files that you downloaded earlier and make them available for the module. The <code>Unicode</code> class is a React component that will render the Unicode browser UI. It implements a number of functions:</p>

 
   <code>search()</code> will search for entries in the Unicode character table based on a search string. 
   <code>selectChar()</code> is called when an entry is selected, and the character information should be displayed. 
   <code>findBlock()</code> finds the Unicode character block for a given Unicode. 
   <code>render()</code> is the React function that renders the component. 
 

<p>In the return statement of the <code>render()</code>  function, you can see that the component has four main parts, a search input, the search results, an area that displays the chosen character, and a panel that shows some additional information about that character.</p>

<p>Now you can add this component to your application. Open <code>src/App.js</code> in your editor and replace its content with the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Unicode from './Unicode';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div className="App"&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
          Unicode Chart
        &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;div className="page"&gt;
          &lt;div className="content"&gt;
              &lt;Unicode /&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Notice how the <code>&lt;Unicode /&gt;</code> tag is used to place your Unicode component onto the screen. Next, you can give the page some styling by opening <code>src/App.css</code> and replacing the contents with the following.</p>

   <code>.App header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.page {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.content {
  text-align: left;
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1232px;
  padding: 16px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code>   

<p>At this point, you can try out your application. In a terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>Once the application has finished compiling, it should automatically open your browser to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The layout of the user interface is not very nice, of course, because you have not yet applied any styling to it.</p>

 Add a Responsive Layout with CSS Grid 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to create a responsive layout using a CSS Grid Layout. In your IDE, create a new file <code>src/Unicode.css</code> and paste the following style into it.</p>

   <code>.app-ui {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(384px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 16px;
}

.search-input {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}

.search-input input {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.search-results {
  grid-column-end: span 2;
  grid-row-end: span 2;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  overflow: auto;
  max-height: 500px;
}

.search-results ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 8px;
  margin: 0;
}

.search-results li.active {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.char-info {
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  padding: 16px;
}

.char-display {
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  padding: 16px;
  font-family:serif !important;
  font-size: 120px;
}
</code>   

<p>The line <code>display: grid;</code> in the CSS code above, instructs the browser to layout the contents of the <code>.app-ui</code> container as a grid. The <code>grid-template-columns</code> property specifies the columns of the grid. Using <code>auto-fit</code>, the code above tells the browser to create as many columns as possible but maintaining that each column should have a minimum width of 384 pixels. Specifying <code>1fr</code> for the maximum width allows columns to span the whole width of the container if required. The line <code>grid-gap: 16px;</code> creates a consistent gutter of 16 pixels between grid cells.</p>

<p>Each child element of the grid container can be positioned individually. Take a look at the styling of the search input.</p>

   <code>.search-input {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}
</code>   

<p>This forces the search input to always start in the first column and end in the last column of the grid. This means that the search input will always span the full width of the container. You can also force elements to span a fixed number of rows or columns. Have a look at the following lines.</p>

   <code>.search-results {
  grid-column-end: span 2;
  grid-row-end: span 2;
}
</code>   

<p>These ensure that the search results will always span at least two columns and two rows. Elements that don’t specify any specific CSS grid properties will, by default, always be placed into a cell spanning a single row and columns.</p>

<p>To make sure that the styles are applied to the <code>Unicode</code> component, open <code>src/Unicode.js</code> again and add the following import to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import './Unicode.css'
</code>   

<p>Now you can run <code>npm start</code> again to test the application. In your browser, you should see something as shown in the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On smaller screens, the number of columns in the grid decreases, and the two cells on the right will automatically be placed below the search results.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that this behavior has been achieved without the use of media queries.</p>

 Add Authentication with Okta 

<p>When developing web applications, you will at some point be faced with the need to provide user authentication. There are ways to implement this yourself, but they are difficult and require a lot of experience in order to ensure they are safe. With Okta, you can avoid these problems and you can set up authentication with just a few lines of code. In addition, Okta provides a single sign-on service, which means that a single user account can be used for multiple applications.</p>

<p>You need to register for a free account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">developer.okta.com</a>. Simply select Create Free Account and complete the registration process. Once complete, you will be directed to your Okta developer dashboard. Here you can register your application by navigating to Applications &gt; Add Application. On the next screen, choose Single Page App and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The following screen lets you edit the application’s settings. Make sure that the port number is 3000 and also change the base URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. Then set the Login Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code>. Port 3000 is used by the React development server to serve your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done and you should see a Client ID, which you will need to paste into your JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Next, open the terminal in your project’s base directory and install the Okta React SDK and React Router by running the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@3.0.4 react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/App.js</code> and add the following two imports to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
</code>   

<p>In the <code>render()</code> function, replace the <code>&lt;Unicode /&gt;</code> component with the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;Router&gt;
  &lt;Security issuer='https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
            clientId='{ClientId}'
            redirectUri={window.location.origin + '/callback'}
            pkce={true}&gt;
    &lt;SecureRoute path='/' exact={true} component={Unicode}/&gt;
    &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
  &lt;/Security&gt;
&lt;/Router&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{YourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain that you can find on the Okta dashboard (in the top right), and <code>{ClientId}</code> is the client ID that you created earlier when you registered the application.</p>

<p>That’s it! You have secured your application. Now, if you stop your application and restart it  (with <code>npm start</code>) you will have to log in to your Okta account before you will be able to access the Unicode browser.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you don’t see a login form, it’s because you’re already logged in. Using a private window will cause a redirect to Okta for authentication. If you’d rather have the login form in your application, you can use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/react/okta_react_sign-in_widget/">Okta’s Sign-In Widget with React</a>.</p>

 The GiD Report #123 — Balkanization and what that means for the future of the&nbsp;internet <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-122-what-will-replace-wechat-and-how-facebook-fueled-tiktoks-rise-ce34d1dc9ef0">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Hello, hello!</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Why a more balkanized internet is a sign that we’re entering a new chapter of decentralization (according to Peter&nbsp;Thiel)  Real demand for new solutions from mega corporations and individuals alike  It’s full circle for Apple circa 1984–2020  The EU version of a balkanized internet and the unintended consequences  An open question about moderation  Closing remarks from Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the&nbsp;U.S.   1. The biggest fear of a balkanized internet is that it means we’ll be more closed off and less connected. But the fear itself doesn’t mean it will become a&nbsp;reality. Image: University of&nbsp;Chicago<p>Because one reason we have this fear is because we’re looking at today’s events through the lens of today’s frameworks — which are grounded in a centralized approach.</p><p>China wants control so it won’t let in centralized Big Tech. The U.S. doesn’t trust China so ditto state-connected enterprises like ByteDance and&nbsp;Tencent.</p><p>But hey, email still&nbsp;works.</p><p>What that means is that a balkanized internet will only accelerate the transition toward new approaches so that we can continue to connect even as the rules of the game&nbsp;shift.</p><p>Anyway, that’s what Peter Thiel is betting on. (Always the contrarian and often controversial, but never disappoints with his insights.)</p><p>Here’s Peter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufm85wHJk5A">speaking at the Discovery Institute’s technology summit in&nbsp;July</a>:</p><blockquote>If we’d been assembled in 1969, the future of computers was going to be massive centralization. It was giant databases, giant AI-like computer intelligences that would run everything. IBM was HAL transposed in the movie The Space Odyssey, one letter off. It was one of the early Star Trek episodes. They come to the planet Beta, where thousands of years earlier, somebody had unified the planet and left a computer program that ran the whole planet and all the people were peaceful, but very docile — nothing ever happened. But the future of the computer age circa 1969 was centralization — a few large companies, a few large governments, a few large computers that controlled everything.</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 1999, the future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. It was sort of libertarian and anarchist. It was the corollary to the end of the Soviet Union, that information had this decentralizing tendency, and the internet was going to fragment things and it was going to be this anarchic libertarian place.</blockquote><blockquote>If we fast forward to 2019, the consensus view of the future today, I would submit, is that the pendulum has somehow swung back all the way to 1969. And the consensus view again is that it is about large centralization — Google like governments that control all of the world’s information in this super centralized way.</blockquote><blockquote>The Life After Google thesis that I agree with and endorse is that if we look at this past — and people got it terribly wrong in ‘69 — and things were going to go to decentralization in ’99, it actually started going back the other way from the point of view of 2019. Even if I’m hesitant to talk about the absolute future and where this all ends, ultimately, perhaps the contrarian thing is to say maybe the pendulum can swing back towards more decentralization, more privacy, and things like that. This is what seems to be at least contrarian and at least something we should always take more seriously.</blockquote><blockquote>If you want to frame it in terms of the buzzwords of the day, if it were in terms of crypto and AI, it is easily understood by people. It’s always understood that crypto is somehow vaguely libertarian, but we never are willing to say the opposite, which is that AI is communist. It’s because it’s centralized. The computer knows more about you than you know about yourself. It’s totalitarian.</blockquote><blockquote>Communist China loves AI and dislikes crypto. We should at least consider the possibility that Silicon Valley is probably way too enamored of AI, not just for technological reasons, but also because it expresses this sort of left wing centralized zeitgeist.</blockquote><blockquote>The first sort of contrarian idea I have is that perhaps it’s time for the pendulum to swing back and Life After Google, at its core, means that we are going to go back from this very centralized world today towards a more decentralized one. That seems to me to be the correct thing to bet&nbsp;on.</blockquote><p>Going by Peter’s timeline, 1999 might have felt like the height of the decentralization movement but it was also the beginning of the cycle for the rise of Google, Amazon, Apple (again), and later Facebook.</p><p>Those companies are now among the most valuable on&nbsp;earth.</p><p>So even if today feels like peak centralization, it’s reasonable — particularly if you’re feeling contrarian — that this only means that the pendulum is about the swing the other way. The forces are already in&nbsp;motion.</p>  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/13/1006631/wechat-ban-severs-a-hundred-million-ties/">The human cost of a WeChat ban: severing a hundred million&nbsp;ties</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/internet-freedom-nationalism-authoritarianism-767da13b-b6bf-4aac-8f05-78f0a6353f08.html">Nationalism and authoritarianism threaten the internet’s universality</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogBjqQbuiHw">Who wields the power online? | DW Documentary</a>  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/competition-bureau/news/2020/08/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-market-participants-to-inform-an-ongoing-investigation-of-amazon.html">Competition Bureau seeks input from market participants to inform an ongoing investigation of Amazon — Canada.ca</a>  <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-alibaba/trump-says-looking-at-pressuring-other-chinese-companies-after-bytedance-idUKKCN25B11B">Trump says looking at pressuring other Chinese companies after Bytedance</a>  <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-clean-network/">The Clean Network — United States Department of&nbsp;State</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wechat-ban-decentralized">A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not. — CoinDesk</a>   2. It’s unclear that things will play out as cleanly as Peter Thiel’s proposed logic. What’s clear is that there’s suddenly ample demand for new solutions. <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-america-worries-wechat-ban-could-be-bad-for-business-11597311003">WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>More than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns in a call with White House officials Tuesday about the potentially broad scope and impact of Mr. Trump’s executive order targeting WeChat, set to take effect late next&nbsp;month.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple Inc., Ford Motor Co., Walmart Inc. and Walt Disney Co. were among those participating in the call, according to people familiar with the situation.</blockquote><blockquote>“For those who don’t live in China, they don’t understand how vast the implications are if American companies aren’t allowed to use it,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “They are going to be held at a severe disadvantage to every competitor,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Other participants in the call Tuesday included Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Intel Corp., MetLife Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, United Parcel Service Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Cargill Inc., according to the&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><p>There’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-98146fea-684f-411e-b873-40fd00171f93.html">ample demand from individuals, too,&nbsp;BTW</a>:</p><blockquote>Americans using digital services would gladly switch to companies that are more committed to data privacy, according to survey results shared exclusively with Axios’ Kyle&nbsp;Daly.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s the latest sign people are frustrated with the digital status quo, even as companies make efforts to give users more control over how their data gets collected, stored and&nbsp;used.</blockquote><blockquote>Details: The survey of 1,018 Americans, conducted in June, found people want more control over what happens with their personal information and think existing tools seem outdated and should be easier to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><blockquote>93% of Americans would switch to a company that prioritizes their data&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>91% would prefer to buy from companies that always guarantee them access to their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>88% are frustrated that they don’t have more control over their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>73% reported finding the process of downloading their data from a company “outdated”; 32%, “hard”; 32%, “confusing.”</blockquote><blockquote>About two-thirds said they want to be able to choose what data companies can and can’t&nbsp;collect.</blockquote><p>They’re also just waiting for an alternative.</p> 3. And just to point out the swings of the pendulum — there’s Apple, complaining about the WeChat ban. Back in 1984, Apple released that iconic Super Bowl ad about IBM referencing George&nbsp;Orwell. <p>Now they’re getting a taste of their own medicine <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">with Riot’s Fortnite&nbsp;spoof</a>.</p><p>Of course, Facebook <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-apple-app-store-22774656-4221-40e7-b6b6-307a1a2de4d5.html">sees an opportunity</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: Facebook is trying to position itself as friendlier to small businesses than Apple, which also faces a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games over its commission and in-app payment restrictions.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook said Friday that it will launch “Paid Online Events” for small businesses in 20 countries around the world to charge Facebook users to attend their classes, instructions and other&nbsp;events.</blockquote><blockquote>The feature could be useful for any small business or individual offering a service, such a preacher, musician, yoga teacher or cooking instructor.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook asked Apple to either waive its 30% cut or let Facebook go around it and process event payments via Facebook Pay, in either case letting event hosts keep all the revenue they generate. Apple declined, according to Facebook.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/epic-sues-apple-google-as-fortnite-is-pulled-from-app-stores-9ebea67e-83b7-46ac-82c6-cfc25ccae04d.html">Epic sues Apple, Google as Fortnite is pulled from app&nbsp;stores</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">Apple, Epic, and the App&nbsp;Store</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/facebook-backed-group-american-edge-to-launch-its-first-ad.html">Pro-tech advocacy group backed by Facebook and other silent investors releases its first&nbsp;ad</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/ales">/ales</a>— <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-may-have-just-laid-the-perfect-antitrust-trap-1844714297?rev=1597347199045">Fortnite May Have Just Laid the Perfect Antitrust Trap for Apple — and They Fell For It [Another Update: Google Just Kicked Fortnite Out of Its App Store,&nbsp;Too]</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-apple-app-store-22774656-4221-40e7-b6b6-307a1a2de4d5.html">Facebook goes after Apple’s in-app purchases fee in wake of Epic&nbsp;lawsuit</a>   4. The other thing about technological balkanization is that it’s not always going to be black and white. A lot of the time it’s gray. That’s a good way to describe what’s been happening in Europe in terms of how they’ve dealt with the influence of American Big Tech. Rather than ban anything outright, they just force companies to play by their&nbsp;rules. <p>That’s well and good in theory. In practice, it’s really messy with a lot of unintended consequences.</p><p>For instance:</p><blockquote>Some businesses fear growing liability while others worry that small and mid-sized firms will get hurt as the U.S. and Europe begin work to replace Privacy Shield, the pact that let thousands of firms transfer data across the Atlantic without breaking EU privacy rules, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Without a replacement in place after the EU’s high court struck Privacy Shield down last month, thousands of businesses will be stuck complying with an agreement that no longer applies in the EU while scrambling to figure out how to get data over from Europe without exposing themselves to legal&nbsp;risks.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s new: This week, the Department of Commerce and European Commission announced they have started discussions to come up with a new framework to govern data transfers between the EU and the&nbsp;U.S.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21182755.18680/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29tbWVyY2UuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC8wOC9qb2ludC1wcmVzcy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtdXMtc2VjcmV0YXJ5LWNvbW1lcmNlLXdpbGJ1ci1yb3NzLWFuZC1ldXJvcGVhbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2xvZ2luJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB191b30f7">Joint Press Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and European Commissioner for Justice Didier&nbsp;Reynders</a>  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/889kyv/a-princess-is-making-google-to-forget-her-drunken-rant-about-killing-muslims">A Princess Is Making Google Forget Her Drunken Rant About Killing&nbsp;Muslims</a>  <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165131-strong-customer-authentication-a-requirement-to-combat-payments-fraud-might-lead-to-many-customers-abandoning-purchases-at-checkout/">Strong Customer Authentication, a Requirement to Combat Payments Fraud, Might Lead to Many Customers Abandoning Purchases at&nbsp;Checkout</a>   5. We’ve talked about balkanization. We’ve touched on regulation. One of the missing pieces that’s become a pivotal question of the day is moderation, which is understandably a controversial topic of the day. If you listened at all to the recent antitrust hearings, then you know that Republicans have their collective pitchforks out about platform censorship. <p>And it’s easy to think about moderation negatively particularly with what’s going on in&nbsp;China.</p><p>But just as not every habit needs to be labeled an addiction — there are good habits, after all — not all moderation should be labeled censorship.</p><p>Good moderation is helpful in creating the right incentives that align with a community’s core values — whether that’s a small group of friends or an entire&nbsp;country.</p><p>And good moderation will mean different things for different people.</p><p>A big part of why there’s such a negative slant to the idea of moderation with today’s status quo isn’t moderation itself, it’s the issue of centralized power and the lack of transparency and accountability.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/trump-twitter-facebook-and-the-future-of-online-speech">the New Yorker</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>In a 2018 article published in the Harvard Law Review, “The New Governors: The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech,” Kate Klonick, who is now a professor at St. John’s University Law School, tallies the sometimes conflicting factors that have shaped the moderation policies at Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. The companies, she writes, have been influenced by a fundamental belief in American “free speech norms,” a sense of corporate responsibility, and user expectations. They’ve also reacted to government requests, media scrutiny, pressure from users or public figures, and the demands of third-party civil-society groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League. They have sometimes instituted new rules in response to individual incidents. There are downsides to this kind of improvisational responsiveness: a lack of transparency and accountability creates conditions ripe for preferential treatment and double standards.</blockquote><p>It’s also the type of problem inherent to huge centralized organizations and platforms. The more decentralized, transparent, and flexible moderation is, the less oppressive moderation feels.</p><p>I mean I get it. Why should Mark Zuckerberg decide the rules for billions of people? Who made him king? (And I get Mark’s side — when you have your own employees protesting because you won’t take stuff down because they don’t like&nbsp;it.)</p><p>It’s like that thing that Aristotle said: That dude that has a lotta friends basically has no&nbsp;friends.</p><p>Mark gets it, too. That’s why he created an independent (supposedly) subcommittee to decide that&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>As a solution, though, it’s still kind of a bandaid. When you’re as big and as powerful as Facebook, any solution to the problem will be a bit cumbersome.</p><p>When you don’t have a system built on real trust and real identities, it’s impossible to delegate that responsibility to your users or your communities. If you never trusted them in the first place, how can you provide them&nbsp;agency.</p><p>It’s a point that we touched upon a couple weeks&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Vitalik Buterin:</p><blockquote>If you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><p>Anyway, this was more of an open question. Something to think&nbsp;about.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/08/07/google-documents-show-taboo-words-antitrust">To Head Off Regulators, Google Makes Certain Words Taboo — The&nbsp;Markup</a>   6. OK. I’ll leave you with a little more Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the U.S. from that same talk. (Sorry, Chamath is pushed back&nbsp;again.) <blockquote>If we look at the rate of progress in Silicon Valley, it was charismatic because it was the one place where things were still happening relative to the rest of the U.S., and it’s become a lot less charismatic in the last five&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>We think about the vibe in 2014, it was this place where the future was being built. In 2019, the big tech companies are probably as self hating in some ways as the big banks were in&nbsp;2009.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s a sense of, “uh, it’s not quite working.”</blockquote><blockquote>If you pick on Google a little bit here, the Google propaganda of the future was that it was all going to be more automation. The story in 2014 were things like Google Glass so you could identify anybody you looked at at any time. It was the self-driving car. I would say these aren’t that big of a set of innovations — a self-driving car is a step from a car but not as big a step as a far from a&nbsp;horse.</blockquote><blockquote>So we can debate quite how big these things are and how to quantify them. But that was still the narrative that was very intact in&nbsp;2014.</blockquote><blockquote>When you fast forward to 2019, it’s striking how there’s absolutely no narrative of the future left. Google doesn’t even talk about the self-driving car very much. There’s a sense that it may still happen, but it’s further in the future. The expected time seems to be getting further&nbsp;away.</blockquote><blockquote>So there’s sort of the sense that perhaps there’s this danger that we have slowed progress even in tech, even in the world of information technology.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>Somehow Silicon Valley has consolidated into larger companies. It’s gotten harder for new companies to break through, and it’s gotten harder because new companies or small companies are good at doing new things and people are doing fewer new things. Then the big companies are more dominant.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>The stagnation idea is that at the end of the day, technology is about people. It’s not about inanimate forces. It’s not some kind of Marxist historicism about the way things are inevitably going to happen. The stress is always on individuals, small teams that start companies, new projects that do new&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a question of human agency. It’s not deterministic. We have every possibility to do these things, but at the end of the day, it is up to us to make it happen.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Informatica has <a href="https://www.informatica.com/about-us/news/news-releases/2020/08/20200818-informatica-acquires-greenbay-technologies-to-advance-ai-and-machine-learning-capabilities.html">just announced</a> that they have made another acquisition this summer: GreenBay Technologies, a startup focused on AI and machine learning. Read about their July 2020 acquisition <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/big-data-informatica-announces-acquisition-of-compact-solutions">here</a>.</p>
<p>GreenBay Technologies brings CloudMatcher to Informatica’s Intelligent Data Platform (IDP). CloudMatcher uses machine learning to automate entity matching and schema matching tasks with high accuracy. This impacts several key data management capabilities such as master data management, data cataloging, data quality, governance, and data integration.</p>
<p>This acquisition adds to the core capabilities of Informatica’s CLAIRE® engine. Informatica has previously collaborated with and invested in GreenBay Technologies, with some elements of CloudMatcher technology already embedded in Informatica products. Founders and team members of GreenBay Technologies will join Informatica as full-time employees. The collaboration, investment, and mutual aim to provide a more complete view and understanding of enterprise data foreshadows a successful acquisition.</p>
<p>Empowering the Business User with AI-Powered Data Management Tools</p>
<p>CloudMatcher further strengthens Informatica’s approach to no-code data management. It brings innovations to both schema matching and entity matching. While schema matching determines that two columns in two tables, such as “ename” and “emp name”, are semantically the same, entity matching determines that two records, such as (David Smith, Acme Company) and (Dave M. Smith, Acme), are the same real-world entity.</p>
<p>Historically, entity matching has remained a complex problem because the solutions are rule-based that require skilled developers and a significant amount of time. GreenBay Technologies has created a blend of “declarative rules” and “AI rules” for match classification. Many existing solutions to schema and entity matching use hand-crafted rules. With this acquisition, Informatica adds a powerful machine learning model that can capture complex and powerful matching rules, the kind of rules that users cannot create manually. The supervised learning used in this approach requires relatively little effort from the user to train the system. The active learning stage presents the business user with interactive labeling exercises for tuple pairs from two separate tables. Simultaneously, the system learns from more user feedback and curation to continuously improve over time. This workflow goes through multiple iterations and yields a high degree of accuracy. CloudMatcher is also highly amenable to distributed and parallel processing, allowing the solution to scale to very large data sets and dramatically reduce manual data stewardship required.</p>
<p>This opens the door for many data management services to be “hands-off”, meaning easily usable by business users without the need for coding or a developer background. As data sets are getting larger and larger, the improved match rate offered by CloudMatcher will help reduce the false positives. By applying a crowdsourcing approach with business users labeling training data, Informatica can configure a sophisticated data matching system that adapts to an organization’s data landscape in a few hours as opposed to days or weeks. This technology also helps in extending matching beyond identity data by matching product, supplier, location, and other types of data domains with even higher accuracy.</p>
<p>AI on Demand: A Continuation of the Platform Economy</p>
<p>We see the trend of harnessing AI to make complex tasks more accessible to non-technical users rising in many different fields. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80384/conversational-ai-building-platforms/#article-slice-14228">Conversational AI Building Platforms</a> is one such area with many vendors providing the general technology and language capabilities, with support to train the chatbot on a customer’s specific industry and corporate knowledge. Other areas include <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a>, with AI capabilities already integrated into the cybersecurity solution and able to be trained in a context-specific environment rather than a “build it yourself” approach. This may shift in the future though, as methodologies for presenting the AI development process (data preparation, model selection, training, validating, implementation, maintenance, and retirement) to non-AI experts improve. Some tech companies (read about some examples <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80232/ibm-watson/">here</a> and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80233/microsoft-azure-ai-platform/">here</a>) are offering AI capabilities irrespective of industry; they aim to provide the infrastructure, data pipeline management, automated support to determine appropriate learning models, and governance for the AI lifecycle.</p>
<p>The data management use cases that we see Informatica addressing have the potential to unlock more data-based insights at a lower cost – be it through reducing time-to-value or by enabling subject matter experts to work with their data as a data scientist or developer would. Enabling more data-driven business will shape the processes, internal decisions, production goals, and much more. But this is only possible with strong data management practice, including the correct labeling of entities. User-friendly AI to manage this step is key to seeing more value from data management products.</p>

					 <p>“Portable” is one of the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 principles</a> of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). In order to achieve portability or self-sovereignty, an individual must be able to control where their identity information and credentials are stored. They must be able to leave their current provider and move to a new provider and never be trapped in vendor lock-in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wallet portability for individuals has always been an aspiration of wallet providers, but until today, has never been successful. We’re proud to announce that Trinsic has achieved interoperable wallet portability with two other SSI wallet vendors—<a href="https://lissi.id">Lissi</a> and <a href="https://esatus.com">esatus AG</a>. For the first time, an individual can “fire their wallet”¹ and use a new one.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is wallet portability? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>When we talk about wallet portability with other vendors, we mean you can seamlessly transfer your SSI wallet between these different applications by exporting from one wallet and importing into another (“import/export”). With import/export functionality, you are no longer tied to or reliant on a single technology provider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Portability between Aries wallets is a long time coming. It’s a huge win for the vision of SSI,” said Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes. “Import/export should be standard in any SSI wallet—because if a wallet doesn’t support portability, it’s not really self-sovereign.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This first implementation amongst 3 vendors is a first step in what we hope will be a larger community effort to converge on best practices for interoperability of SSI wallets.</p>

					 <p>Transfer credentials from the Trinsic Wallet to the Lissi app:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  In the Trinsic Wallet, go to Settings and click the Export Wallet tab.  Copy down the recovery phrase.  Click on the Export Wallet button.  Save the wallet to wherever you’d like to store it.  Open the Lissi app (this can be done with the esatus Wallet as well), go to Settings, and click on the Recover Account tab.  Click on Open File and choose the Trinsic Wallet file.  Paste in the recovery phrase that was copied from the Trinsic Wallet and click Recover Backup.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Transfer credentials from the Lissi app to the Trinsic Wallet:<br><br></p>  In the Lissi app, go to Settings and click on the Create Export/Backup tab.  Write down the recovery phrase and click Continue.  Verify the recovery phrase by clicking on the words in the correct order.  Name your backup file and click Export.  Unzip the exported file.  Open the Trinsic Wallet, click on Settings, and click on the Backup and Restore tab.  Click on the Restore Wallet button, select Local Backup, and choose the Lissi wallet file.  Type in the recovery phrase and click the Recover Wallet button.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>“We celebrate with the community in the achievement of SSI wallet portability and are proud that Lissi Mobile Wallet is one of the first truly portable wallets,” said Helge Michael, the Program Manager at Main Incubator who runs Lissi. “Self-sovereign identity has made incredible progress in the last couple of years, and we can now add wallet portability to the list.”</p>

					 <p>Our approach to wallet portability shouldn’t be viewed as the end-all be-all. Further iterations and evolution will happen over time as the SSI community continues to converge on standards and protocols relating to wallet portability. We do commit, however, to being involved in that effort. If you’d like to get involved, here are some things we’d love your contributions on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Currently connections are lost through the import/export process. Connections are a persistent 1:1 relationship between two parties and rely on endpoints provided by mediator agents to ensure messages are routed to the correct wallet. Because the approach to mediator agents aren’t completely standardized between vendors, connections do not transfer seamlessly across different vendors.  The export function creates an encrypted, duplicate wallet which you can use as a backup. This is extremely useful if you lose your device and want to restore your wallet. But it also enables you to upload your wallet to multiple devices. This is useful if you want a tablet &amp; mobile wallet to be in sync, but can be problematic if you duplicated your wallet onto other people’s devices, allowing them to present your credentials. Ensuring the integrity of credentials across the import/export process is the subject of future work.  All the mobile wallets that support portability are based on the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. Further testing will be required to determine whether the exported wallet can be opened seamlessly in other Aries frameworks or whether additional limitations will arise.  The import/export implementation is specifically geared toward local wallets and applications (ie., mobile wallets). Enterprise wallets and cloud wallets are out of scope.

<p>Poly Network will permit interoperability between multiple chains, offering a range of new advantages</p><p>In a bid to lay the groundwork for a more collaborative and transparent decentralized ecosystem, three leading global blockchain projects, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, <a href="https://neo.org/">Neo</a>, and <a href="https://www.switcheo.network/">Switcheo</a>, have announced the launch of <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a>, a heterogeneous interoperability protocol alliance.</p><p>In what is a major milestone for the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) industry, Poly Network will permit cross-platform interoperability, greatly increasing transparency and accessibility. Enterprises leveraging diverging systems can connect to Poly Network, and collaborate and interact with each other through an open, transparent admission mechanism.</p><p>Andy Ji, Co-founder of Ontology, the high performance, open source blockchain specializing in digital identity and data said, “By combining the highest standards of expertise and platform capabilities, Poly Network will have unprecedented benefits for blockchain developers, propelling the building of the decentralized ecosystem through a range of platform offerings that make the user experience easier.</p><p>“For a time now, the Ontology community has enjoyed the benefits of cross-chain functionalities with Ethereum. Now, through Poly Network, an enterprise leveraging the Ontology blockchain will be able to seamlessly interact with an enterprise leveraging Ethereum, Cosmos, or Neo, helping these platforms overcome challenges to scalability, mainstream adoption, and collaboration. To make it happen, Ontology has invested high levels of technical research, development, and financial support.”</p><p>Prioritizing key characteristics of efficiency, value transfer, privacy, and security, PolyNetwork’s core function is to enable cross-platform interoperability and atomic cross chain transactions, such as the swapping of digital currency for other tokenized assets. PolyNetwork will:</p>  Provide DeFi developers with new infrastructure for creating cross-chain compatible dApps  Support both heterogeneous and homogeneous chains including Ethereum, Neo, Ontology, and Cosmos, along with each platform’s homogenous chain forks, with future plans to support the Bitcoin&nbsp;network  Permit easy, eco-friendly access to cross-chain transactions, by requiring less smart contracts  Increase scalability of cross chain transactions by enabling the transfer of both assets and information  <p>Da Hongfei, Founder of Neo, an open-source, community driven platform, said, “I firmly believe that interoperability is the future of the blockchain industry. Within our current paradigm, both traditional and blockchain platforms exist as effectively isolated data silos — users and developers alike are restricted by each platform’s capabilities and limitations. With PolyNetwork, we are linking disparate and heterogeneous platforms to build a global cross-chain platform with the aim of realizing blockchain’s potential while overcoming its challenges — together. Moving forward, I encourage all interested projects and companies to join us in building the foundation for&nbsp;NGI.”</p><p>Ji concluded, “Cross-chain interoperability is becoming increasingly important as we focus on moving away from a siloed way of working. Ontology is committed to fostering an open and transparent blockchain ecosystem and we are proud to partner with Neo and Switcheo to deliver true cross-blockchain interoperability. We look forward to playing our part through this groundbreaking alliance.”</p><p>For more information on Poly Network and how to join, visit <a href="https://www.poly.network/">https://www.poly.network/</a></p><p>About Poly&nbsp;Network</p><p><a href="https://www.poly.network/">PolyNetwork</a> is built to implement interoperability between multiple chains in order to build the next generation internet infrastructure. Authorized homogeneous and heterogeneous public blockchains can connect to PolyNetwork through an open, transparent admission mechanism and communicate with other blockchains.

  <p>In most cities in China, citizens and visitors must download Health Code — an app that indicates COVID-19 status — to access many public and private spaces and services. A green screen means the person is free to travel, yellow indicates required quarantine and red means a confirmed infection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is a unique Hype Cycle that distills more than 1,700 unique technologies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In India, the Aarogya Setu app indicates which travelers are “safe” to use rail and air travel. The United Arab Emirates recently launched ALHOSN UAE, which also indicates via color if a person is okay, infected or need to be quarantined, but also has an option for “hasn’t been tested.” ALHOSN UAE is currently being used to grant access to air travel.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36598"]</p>
<p>All of these apps, called health passports, are examples of a pandemic/epidemic response technology and one of the new additions to the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2020. The sheer populations in India and China using health passports pushed this technology to a 5% to 20% market penetration, an unprecedented number for a technology just entering the Hype Cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“This Hype Cycle highlights technologies that will significantly affect business, society and people over the next five to 10 years,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/26081/Brian-Burke">Brian Burke</a>, Research VP, Gartner. “It includes technologies that enable a composable enterprise, aspire to regain society’s trust in technology and alter the state of your brain.”</p>
<p>The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is a unique Hype Cycle that distills more than 1,700 unique technologies into a list of must-know technologies and trends. This year’s list highlights five unique trends:</p>
 
 
<p>Composite architectures</p>
 
 
<p>Algorithmic trust</p>
 
 
<p>Beyond silicon</p>
 
 
<p>Formative artificial intelligence (AI)</p>
 
 
<p>Digital me</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1lNWZiNWRjMmRlNWIxMWVhYjFjMjBlNjhjZDJlOWEzMw=="></a></p>
 Hype Cycle Trend No. 1: Composite architectures 
<p>In the face of rapid changes and decentralization, organizations need to shift to more agile, responsive architectures. A composite architecture is made up of packaged business capabilities built on a flexible data fabric. This allows the enterprise to respond to rapidly changing business needs.</p>
<p>For example, a “composable enterprise” supported by a composite architecture offers increased business resilience. This modular design enables organizations to “recompose” when needed, like during a global pandemic or economic recession. The composable enterprise has four core principles: Modularity, efficiency, continuous improvement and adaptive innovation. Although many organizations apply these principles in a piecemeal fashion, a composable enterprise applies all four across all parts of its organization — from business models to how employees work.</p>
<p>This modular business model enables organizations to move from rigid, traditional planning to active agility. Composable enterprise thinking creates more innovation, reduced costs and better partnerships.</p>
<p>Other emerging technologies under this trend include packaged business capabilities, data fabric, private 5G and embedded AI.</p>
 Hype Cycle Trend No. 2: Algorithmic trust 
<p>Increased amounts of consumer data exposure, fake news and videos, and biased AI, have caused organizations to shift from trusting central authorities (government registrars, clearing houses) to trusting algorithms. Algorithmic trust models ensure the privacy and security of data, provenance of assets, and the identities of people and things.</p>
<p>For example, "authenticated provenance" is a way to authenticate assets on the blockchain and ensure they’re not fake or counterfeit. While blockchain can be used to authenticate goods, it can only track the information that it is given.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">The CIO's Guide to Blockchain&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>To adequately track assets, they must be tracked from their source. For example, if a counterfeit item is added to the blockchain as a genuine version, the blockchain will continue to verify its authenticity based on the bad original data input. Due to the nature of the immutable ledger, it can never be modified or deleted.</p>
<p>Gartner believes increased interest in <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-reality-of-blockchain/">blockchain </a>will create increased digital authentication and verification options.</p>
<p>Other emerging technologies in the algorithmic trust trend include differential privacy, responsible AI and explainable AI.</p>
 Hype Cycle Trend No. 3: Beyond silicon 
<p>Moore’s Law predicts that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit would double every two years, but technology is quickly reaching the physical limits of silicon. This has led to the evolution of new advanced materials with enhanced capabilities designed to support smaller, faster technologies.</p>
<p>For example, "DNA computing and storage" use DNA and biochemistry in place of silicon or quantum architectures to perform computation or store data. The data is encoded into synthetic DNA strands for storage and enzymes provide the processing capabilities through chemical reactions.</p>
<p>Despite two successful prototypes, the technology is currently rudimentary and expensive with significant technical barriers to mainstream use. However, the impact of a successful DNA computing and storage option would transform data storage, processing parallelism and computing efficiency.</p>
<p>Other emerging technologies in this trend include biodegradable sensors and carbon-based transistors.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
 Hype Cycle Trend No. 4: Formative AI 
<p>Formative<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/"> AI </a>is a type of AI capable of dynamically changing to respond to a situation. There are a variety of types, ranging from AI that can dynamically adapt over time to technologies that can generate novel models to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>For example, generative AI is a type of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-prevent-ai-dangers-with-ethical-ai/">AI</a> that can create new novel content (images, video etc.) or alter existing content. The new artifacts are similar to, but not exactly the same as, the original. This technology is responsible for deep fakes content, which can cause serious disinformation and reputational risk, and is expected to increase in numbers over the next five years. However, less nefarious uses like drug discovery and synthetic data generation — and even AI-generated artwork — are also increasing in popularity.</p>
<p>Other emerging technologies in this trend include composite AI, differential privacy, small data and self-supervising learning.</p>
 Hype Cycle Trend No. 5: Digital me 
<p>From health passports to digital twins, as technology integrates with people, there are more opportunities to create digital versions of ourselves. These digital models represent humans in both the real and virtual worlds.</p>
<p>For example, bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), are brain-altering wearables that enable two-way communication between a human brain and a computer or machine interface. BMIs can be either wearables or implants that monitor EEGs (electrical activity in the brain) and individuals’ mental states. The difference between regular monitoring BMIs and bidirectional BMI is that the latter can use electrostimulation to modify the mental state of the person.</p>
<p>In the business world, potential applications include <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">authentication</a>, access and payment, immersive analytics and exoskeletons. But other applications, which have their own social and ethical concerns, might include using stimulation to boost alertness in a fatigued employee or changing the mood of an irritable teacher by applying currents to the brain. While there are many potential use cases, BMIs also introduce an additional avenue of vulnerability for would-be attackers to exploit.</p>

<p>As far as tech industry standards go, it has been a slow burn <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">finding out exactly how</a> 130 Verified Twitter Accounts, and thousands of unverified accounts, came to suddenly begin promoting fake charities or Bitcoin giveaways last month. Piece by piece security experts have gleaned information directly from hackers, found tidbits on the dark web, and learned more from Twitter - the company has been updating their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident almost every day since it was first posted on July 18, 2020.</p><p>However, this type of hack can happen to any company that has an administration panel or dashboard for their app that’s protected by a username and password. Even taking the time and effort to fully integrate back end systems, enable two-factor authentication, and take other precautionary measures can still lead to a similar breach thanks to clever social engineering tricks and hacks that have become increasingly common. </p><p>One way to really lock down your administration panel, possibly the best method as of today, is to use a decentralized identity platform for authentication. For example, faking a BloomID is almost impossible -- only one BloomID can be created using an email address, it’s secured by a private key that cannot be duplicated or spoofed, and accessing the accompanying Bloom app requires physical access to someone’s iOS or Android device, or taking full control of their Apple ID or Google account and restoring everything to a new device, which would cause multiple emails and alarms to go off for the affected party. Your Apple ID has been used to sign in to a new device! Your Google account has a new device associated with it! It’s kind of hard to ignore, and the most security conscious of us have locked down our wireless carrier and Apple/Google accounts, leaving only the usernames and passwords we use left to secure, or rather abandon passwords entirely, which is a movement already <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">supported</a> across all the most popular platforms but not implemented widely. </p><p>So how do you lock down your administration panel, ensuring your God Mode or Super Admin mode is only accessed by those who are truly authorized to have it? Let’s dive in.</p> Server Side <p>We’re not going to use anything like Verify Kit this time, there’s no need. All we want to do is ensure that the person trying to access the administration panel has the appropriate rights, and that can be correlated by the email address they share via Bloom’s mobile app to an existing database that contains role-based access control permissions and rights. </p><p>We will assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of an Express-based app, or that can be passed a payload from an Express library. This is largely true for many administration apps since JavaScript is so flexible.</p> Let’s Use Bloom Starter for Auth <p>There are two parts to the Bloom Starter app; the server-side (Express) and client-side (React).</p><p>Getting Started</p><p>First we’re going to start the Express server, start ngrok to proxy the Express server so that the mobile app can POST share-kit data to the url, and then start the React app. </p><p>Follow these steps to make it happen:</p>  Run <code>git clone https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter.git</code>  And then <code>cd bloom-starter/bloom-starter-auth</code>  Then run <code>npm run deps</code> (this installs any dependencies for both the server and client)  Before starting up the dev server, you will need a .env file with these variables set:     <code>PORT</code>  <code>NODE_ENV</code>, and   <code>SESSION_SECRET</code>   <p>Please see the .env.sample file in the repository for an example of where your .env should be located, and what it should look like. There’s no need to go in blind. </p><p>And finally run <code>npm run dev</code>.</p><p>If all went well, and the <code>REACT_APP_SERVER_URL</code> env var is set to the ngrok url, then we can move on to the client.</p> Time for the Client Setup <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Since the administration app is a web app, we can continue leveraging the same Bloom Starter repository. </p><p>For this demonstration, we don’t need much. The only Verifiable Credential we’re going to use is <code>email</code>, which we can tie back to our existing database to ensure it’s someone that should have access to the admin panel.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/demo">Share Kit demo</a> to generate the code needed to place the QR code on the login page. For the DatingApp administration panel login, we end up with:</p> <code>import React from 'react'
import {RequestElement, Action} from '@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react'

const requestData = {
  action: Action.attestation,
  token: 'e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e',
  org_name: 'DatingApp Admin',
  url: 'https://receive-kit.datingapp.co/api/receive',
  org_logo_url: 'https://datingapp.co/images/DatingApp-Logo.png',
  org_usage_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/terms',
  org_privacy_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy',
  types: ['email']
}

const MyComponent: React.SFC = props =&gt; (
  &lt;RequestElement
    requestData={requestData}

    qrOptions={{
      size: 256,
      hideLogo: false,
      fgColor: '#16325b'
    }}
  /&gt;
)
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own token as a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources. This also ensures you are receiving data from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Also note that the <code>Action</code> in this request, unlike others, is <code>Action.authentication</code>. This ensures that Verify Kit knows that... </p><p>Once we have placed that on the login view, it should render like this:</p>DatingApp Admin Portal Login Page with Bloom QR Code Embedded<p>After scanning the QR code using Bloom's mobile app, this is what you would see:</p>The Data Sharing Request someone trying to log in to the adminstration panel will see.<p>Completing the ‘Slide to Share’ action will share the data with your Verify Kit instance, allowing you to ingest the data and verify it against your database. Assuming it’s successful, you can let the user in to the admin panel!</p><p>Your employees can use Bloom’s mobile app to log in to your administration panel instead of using a username and password. </p><p>To really beef up the security here, and ensure it is the same person with the same device (or a new device where they have restored a backup) each time, you could also ask for the following Verifiable Credentials:</p>  <code>phone</code>  <code>email</code>  <code>linkedin</code>  <code>full-name</code>  <code>birth-date</code>  <code>sanction-screen</code>  <code>pep-screen</code>  <p>Of course we don’t want to recommend you intrude into your staff’s personal lives, but you must consider the sensitivity of the data and the power the administration app they are accessing grants them. This is also all data you likely know about your employees already, and therefore you can verify the data received via Bloom.</p><p>This is just one of the many use cases where you can use Bloom’s open source technology to enhance trust and security within your own internal platforms while maintaining data security. Verify the data provided, delete it from your Verify Kit service, and allow your compliance and security teams to rest assured they have taken a concrete step towards better internal controls.</p> More Resources:   <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter">Bloom Starter GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/overview">Share Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit#TAttestationTypeNames">Share Kit Attestation Types</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/verify-kit">Verify Kit GitHub Repository</a>    Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p>Nothing felt strange when former president Barack Obama began his speech about the importance of taking a critical look at what we see on the internet. That is until he started making some, shall we say, uncharacteristic statements. The now-famous deepfake was one of the first of its kind to go viral, showing both how easy it is to be fooled and the dangers of not looking more closely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“This is a dangerous time, moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet. It’s a time we need to rely on trusted news sources,” </p>– Peele through Obama</blockquote>



 

 



<p>The word <a href="https://medium.com/@songda/a-short-history-of-deepfakes-604ac7be6016">deepfake was coined by a Reddit user back in 2017</a> and is a portmanteau of the words deep learning and fake. Today, it is a blanket term for artificial intelligence (AI) powered face swapping, i.e. when one person is replaced by another in a photo or video footage. On Reddit it began as a way to make fake adult videos of famous celebrities, and while that “trend” continues, deepfakes have become a way to create and disseminate misinformation and fake news. Peele’s decision to use Obama illustrates just how easy it is to manipulate politicians’ words, which is particularly worrisome as the 2020 election approaches. And while some can be fun to watch, like Bill Hader transforming into<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWrhRBb-1Ig"> Tom Cruise</a> or<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhUhypV27w"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, they all come with a warning bell.&nbsp;</p>



 How’d They Do That? 



<p>Deep learning is an AI technique that uses huge data sets to create standard models and formats. Inspired by artificial neural networks, a function of the biological brain, it is considered to be the breakthrough within the field of AI. By leveraging neural network powered AI and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into an algorithm that creates a “mask” which can be used to replace or manipulate original faces or and voices by using lookalike data. The algorithms train themselves to improve over time. If Peele hadn’t appeared in the video next to Obama, the manipulation would have been difficult for many humans to even detect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of the software involved in creating deepfakes is open-sourced like Google’s TensorFlow or uses widely available tools like Adobe’s After Effects. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, however. Peele’s skilled production team spent 56 hours to create the one-minute Obama video.</p>



 What Does This Mean for KYC?&nbsp; 



<p>The rise and advancement of deepfakes does pose a threat in that many organizations have found themselves wondering if these techniques could be used to create false identities not easily detectable within their onboarding processes. For sophisticated KYC and verification tools like <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s</a>, however, deepfakes can be thwarted at several entry points.</p>



<p>Authenticating one’s identity within a fully automated, robust KYC solution means that a person has to scan and upload a copy of their government-issued ID. The next step is to take a selfie and using facial recognition technology, the customer’s identity can only be verified once the biometrics of the selfie match those of the photo ID. The liveness check done with the real-time selfie also determines whether the customer is a real person, and so anything pre-recorded or played through a screen wouldn’t pass. Biometric authentication that doesn’t include a liveness check is only doing half the job as far as KYC efforts go.</p>



<p>Once verified within Authenteq’s system, spot ID checks can also be implemented if suspicious behavior is detected. If the identity does match the ID used in the onboarding process, the account could be flagged or even deactivated.</p>



<p>There has also been a series of legislation introduced to help tackle this problem. In 2019, the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230"> DEEPFAKES Accountability Act</a> was introduced in the House of Representatives, and California passed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902884/california-deepfake-political-ban-election-2020"> legislation</a> making it illegal to produce deepfakes of politicians. In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfakes can be<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-deep-fake-pornography-and-is-it-illegal-in-the-uk_uk_5bf4197ce4b0376c9e68f8c5?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANO465UhdTIOSqTKHRjw0X8c-MSstQyicQRLFRn2icdH1SuNC7u3R-zoqNfcARCzR-WeClmyXYgxvjChZ3zayJqECu8v_8LA3r5rdDhaz_-c5a3Sz2Y5oZkxi43chLqjGphrH5i9EUIiBHhEE13RXZkNQXCRBa01XfrK4OZomQWJ"> prosecuted</a> for harassment.</p>



 Looking Ahead 



<p>Much of the very warranted concern over deepfakes revolves around prominent public figures like politicians and celebrities, but what about the average consumer or businesses? Identity theft and fraud are a growing concern for people in every country and business in every sector. Like all technology, we can’t predict with any certainty what will be possible with deepfakes in the coming years but when it comes to identity verification, one thing is certain. As deepfake technology gets more sophisticated, so too will our KYC and identity verification tools.<br></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>NIST, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, recently released <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf" title="Zero Trust Architecture">SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture</a>. The NIST special publication examines the principles of and motivations for ZTA, as well as implementation considerations, security concerns, and suggestions for improvements to architecture. NIST SPs are authored primarily for consumption by other US government agencies. In practice, however, their documents often become de facto standards and guidelines used more broadly in industry. In this post I’ll review the strengths of the SP and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The NIST document serves as a good introduction for ZTA. The authors correctly describe the fundamental principles of ZTA, which are a combination of traditional security tenets of Least Privilege and Defense-in-Depth. In practice, Least Privilege means only granting sufficient permissions to accomplish specific actions and not more than that; Defense-in-Depth means inserting layers and gates of security at all relevant control points in a use case. Wide open networks behind firewalls are easy targets. These ideas have become more commonly accepted in modern security architectures, as organizations realize that firewalls and other perimeter-based designs are porous and not sufficient for protecting against proliferating threats.</p>
 Zero Trust Architecture is more than networks – it is also about data and applications 
<p>We have often heard about “Zero Trust Networking” at trade shows and conferences. SP 800-207 does a good job of explaining that ZTA is not limited to networks. In fact, ZTA must transcend network-layer thinking in order to be successful. ZTA requires proper authentication and authorization for each session involving users, applications, networks (including clouds), and data. Other key components of ZTA are continuous risk-adaptive authentication and dynamic policy evaluation.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 references OASIS XACML 2.0 architecture, including Policy Administration Points (PAPs), Policy Decision Points (PDPs), and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). The document should have referenced the updated <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html" title="XACML 3.0">XACML 3.0</a>, which contains the elements of Obligations and Advice that can be used in ZTA scenarios where risk-adaptive authentication and authorization may be required by policies. There are also rule and policy combining algorithm optimizations in v. 3 that fit better with the description of Trust Algorithms in the NIST SP (p. 17).</p>
 Does the new NIST standard meet all requirements? 
<p>SP 800-207 defines conceptual components that go beyond the standard XACML PAP/PDP/PEP reference architecture. In my view, the breakdown of PDP into Policy Engine and Policy Administrator doesn’t add value and can create confusion. The XACML 3.0 reference architecture is still valid today, and is used in authorization and access control solutions even where explicit support for the XACML language is missing.</p>
<p>The illustration and definition of contributing components in Figure 2 (p. 9), namely CDM System, Industry Compliance, Activity Logs, SIEM System, etc. adhere to other US federal program definitions, but do not exactly match common usage. For example, Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) roughly translate to asset, vulnerability, and configuration management. Industry Compliance is not a set of functions localized to one product or platform. Activity logs are consumed by SIEM, SOAR, and forensics tools. Some extrapolation and normalization of terminology and illustration may make this section applicable outside the US government.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 claims that threat intelligence “is the only component that will most likely be under the control of a service rather than the enterprise” (p. 19). Such a view discounts the prevalence and use of Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and other kinds of 3rd-party services, including discrete authentication services, and fraud risk services. At KuppingerCole, expect to see more usage and development of additional modular functional services that can enhance the ZTA authentication and authorization experiences for enterprises, covering all permutations of user-device-app-data interactions.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the new doc addresses use cases and deployment scenarios:</p>
 
 Enterprises with satellite offices (includes teleworkers) 
 Multi-cloud/cloud-to-cloud enterprises 
 Contractors and non-employee access 
 Cross domain collaboration 
 Public and/or consumer facing organizations 
 
<p>There are some variations to these use cases that could use additional detail, such as more about remote workforces and cloud-native enterprises. Section 4 is good starting point for planning how to migrate to ZTA.</p>
 What are the threats when looking into a Zero Trust Architecture? 
<p>Most discussions of ZTA tend to highlight the security advantages, of which there are several. Section 5 of SP 800-207 provides a list of possible threats specific to ZTA that industry needs to consider and begin mitigating against. Of special note here are DoS attacks on PDPs, the need for full enterprise monitoring (not just endpoint or network), and potential weaknesses in proprietary/non-standard APIs.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 also lists the use of non-person entities in ZTA administration as a possible threat. It is true that innovative IAM and IGA solutions increasingly employ non-person agents/processes to reduce the workload on human admins. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to:</p>
 
 assign roles and permissions to users at on-boarding based on attributes and entitlements that their peers have 
 perform User Behavioral Analysis (UBA) and provide confidence scores per session 
 analyze device intelligence to determine if the sources of access requests are originating from authorized locations, properly patched, free of malware, etc. 
 process the output of UBA, device intel, and other types of threat intelligence to generate risk scores per session. 
 
<p>It is possible that ML detection models can be manipulated (or gamed) to produce both false positives and negatives, and these outcomes can then be exploited by malicious actors. Even though these types of attacks require sophistication, such attacks have migrated from the theoretical to the real world. Vendors and implementers must take knowledge of these scenarios into consideration when performing threat modeling.</p>
 There is a need for standardization in Zero Trust Architectures 
<p>NIST correctly surmises the need for standardization in ZTA, especially in the areas of APIs. Most identity and security products expose APIs for other applications to use, therefore securing these APIs must be a top priority. The proprietary nature of APIs is itself a source of security concern.</p>
<p>In summary, NIST SP 800-207 is a good primer on ZTA which includes some high-level, practical design advice. The authors clearly state that there is no single ZTA solution, and that the road to fully instrumented ZTA is a long one.</p>

For those of you who’ve been involved in the identity discussion, you understand that it’s all about community, and it’s about connecting with others. Your identity is used to interact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We as physicians have to constantly interact with each other in order to coordinate care for patients. But right now, there’s no way for us to do that in a streamlined way. As with every other form of digital communication, the process is centralized. So if you’re working in a hospital, you only are able to communicate with doctors in that hospital. If you work for an insurance network, you’re only able to send patients to other doctors in that insurance network if you want the patient’s care to be covered. HPEC decentralizes all of that and allows everyone to interact with each other regardless of policy, practice, location, or specialty, so doctors can get their patients the best care.</p>

					 <p>When we document things as physicians, we’re really recording what happened in the patient encounter, so we can call upon the information in the future when needed. If the patient comes back in six months, we can look at the records and answer questions such as: Why did we give that medication, or what surgery did they have and when? But documenting the interaction is also important when communicating with other medical professionals. If I’m sending my private practice patient to an orthopedic surgeon, I want to be able to send the surgeon the patient’s relevant medical history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, physicians record their documentation on electronic health records (EHRs). And similar to any digital documentation, especially over the internet, we have the same problem where physicians have to choose one EHR, and then the information is all trapped there. The EHRs don’t talk to each other, and there’s no standards for interoperability. So there’s a lot of friction with being able to share that information among physicians and with patients being able to access that information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that we are building a self-sovereign identity solution for the practicing physician, so they can log in, document, and share this information in a streamlined and standardized way.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What was the catalyst for you to begin using SSI technology? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Something happened to me that made me really wake up to this problem and then this potential solution—a hospital that I was previously working for stole my identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were using my professional brand, NPI numbers, and license numbers to bill under my name when I wasn’t even in that hospital anymore. That kind of turned on a light bulb. I had learned about identity (self-sovereign identity was very, very early in that stage), but I had read about identity solutions around voting and around resource allocation, especially in emerging economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I realized that SSI would have not only prevented what happened to me but could be used to alleviate a lot of the friction in our current healthcare system.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 In the healthcare industry, what are the COVID-19 related use cases where SSI and verifiable credentials would be most helpful? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Self-sovereign identity brings privacy, security, and trust to the individual, without the individual having to reveal all of their identifying information. When it comes to COVID-19 and safety in businesses (especially in healthcare facilities like nursing homes), there might be some rules that employers create or that governments start mandating where you might need to have a recent negative COVID-19 test in order to go to work or enter the facility. But do you really need to show a piece of paper that contains a lot of personal information such as your name, phone number, and other lab tests you did that day? No. SSI makes it so you don’t have to.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What do you think it will take for the healthcare industry to begin adopting SSI as a viable solution to combat the risks of COVID-19 in the use cases you mentioned above? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Well, unfortunately as with everything else, show me the money. It has to demonstrate that it’s going to save money somewhere. If I am not allowed to go to work unless I prove that I’ve had a recent COVID-19 test, and I don’t have a solution for that, then that hits me in my wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if there’s an app that I can easily download, store my negative COVID-19 test result in it as a verifiable credential, and be able to show that to my employer, then we have a solution. So it’s going to have to be public, private partnerships and individuals who demand to use it. Those individuals may be CEOs of companies who want to get people back to work or they may be the individuals who want to be able to go back to work, board an airplane, go on a cruise, go to the movies, or send their children back to school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a bit of a leap when it comes to understanding how SSI is a solution, which I think is also somewhat of a barrier, but I think these kinds of conversations are going to help open that up.</p>

					 <p>What people really need are developers who can build these platforms and make them user friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if people want to just learn about SSI in general and understand what it means, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSI Meetup</a> has a lot of really good webinars on SSI. The people who’ve been doing this for a long time—Drummond Reed, Kaliyah Young, Christopher Allen, Kim Hamilton Duffy—these individuals have written a lot on the topic. The information and leadership is out there. It just takes a little time to understand it.</p>

According to <a href="https://defipulse.com/">Defi Pulse</a>, the total value locked in the DeFi sector hit an all-time high of $5.21 billion as of August 14,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Many developers have already been exchanging ideas and developing DeFi dApps in Ontology’s ecosystem. In the coming months, a range of new decentralized finance applications will be launched, as DeFi capabilities expand to reach more mainstream audiences.</p><p>In order to encourage pioneering DeFi developers to build on the Ontology blockchain, we’ve updated our Ontology dApp Incentive Plan to the new “Renaissance 2.0”, with the aim of boosting the DeFi ecosystem on the Ontology network. The Ontology Foundation will give the plan a 3-month trial period — from August 15th, 2020 to October 15th,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>A summary of the DeFi-exclusive Renaissance 2.0 plan is as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1. Active DeFi transaction fee rebate. 100% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by dApps listed in the Top 10 Ontology dApps on <a href="https://dappradar.com/search/ontology">DappRadar</a> on <a href="https://dapp.review/">Dappreview</a> will be returned to developers.</p><p>2. Developers can get DOUBLE the transaction fees returned if they integrate and use ONT ID in their&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>3. High performing developers will be provided with technical, marketing, and operations support from the Ontology&nbsp;team.</p><p>Following evaluation processes, accepted applications will receive coaching from experts to help chosen dApps with marketing and development.</p> Example <p>John and his team developed a DeFi dApp on the Ontology blockchain that utilizes ONT ID. They submitted their dApp to DappRadar and it became very popular, rising into the Top 10 Ontology dApps&nbsp;list.</p><p>With the new Renaissance 2.0 plan, John and his team will&nbsp;receive</p>  200% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by the dApp. That&nbsp;is,  <blockquote>1) 100% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by the dApp for being a DeFi&nbsp;dApp.</blockquote><blockquote>2) Another 100% of all transaction fees as a reward for integrating and using ONT ID in the&nbsp;dApp</blockquote>  Technical support and guidance on protocols, SDK, coding support, and auditing of smart contracts.  Marketing support on all Ontology’s social media platforms and 29 communities, as well as event planning (such as an AMA in Ontology’s community telegram groups), graphic designs, news releases and proofreading, real-time community maintenance, and feedback.  <p>Don’t miss out! The earlier you apply, the earlier you can start to earn rewards. The application review normally takes around 1 to 2 business&nbsp;days.</p> How to&nbsp;apply? <p>Develop a DeFi dApp on the Ontology blockchain first and then submit your dApp to either <a href="https://dappradar.com/submit-dapp">DappRadar</a> or <a href="https://dapp.review/login?next=/dapp/submit">DappReview</a>. The Ontology team will check the dApp ranking and announce the rewards distribution status on Twitter on the last week of each&nbsp;month.</p><p>Are you a developer?

 Ontology Completes DID Smart Contract Development on Ethereum to Boost the Decentralized Identity Ecosystem <p>This week, Ontology successfully completed the development of the next stage of its open-source DID smart contract on the Ethereum network, significantly expanding the purview of the platform’s decentralized identity ecosystem. Having defined the DID specification, submitted the required W3C registration, and concluded the DID smart contract development, Ontology’s bespoke Decentralized Identity Solutions now boast even greater chain interoperability and heightened technological capabilities.</p><p>The announcement means that Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solutions, defined in this instance by the addition of a new smart contract method <a href="https://github.com/ontology-tech/DID-solidity/tree/etho-did">did:etho:</a>, can now be used not only across the expansive Ethereum network, including a range of popular DeFi applications, but also most chains that run EVM virtual machines. Ontology aims to make its Decentralized Identity solutions available across any chain, as part of its ongoing effort to achieve full cross-chain functionality.</p><p>LI JUN, Founder of Ontology, said, “In line with Ontology’s defined objective to transform key processes pertaining to the management of individuals’ data, we are delighted to build on the significant progress that has been made with respect to our ever-expanding decentralized identity ecosystem. Successfully completing the open-source decentralized identifier smart contract development on the caliber of Ethereum is another milestone in what has been an incredibly successful Q3 for our platform.”<br> <br>This completion is the latest in a string of high-profile announcements for the company that specializes in digital identity and data. It follows the recent launch of ‘Ontology Mercury’, a trusted, Decentralized Identifier (DID) based peer-to-peer communication framework; the official release of Ontology’s new Decentralized Identity Solutions, designed to help crypto holders and traders manage and exchange digital assets in a more secure and streamlined manner; and a recent collaboration with NEAR Protocol, Elrond Network, and Waves Platform among others to advance the development of secure decentralized identity solutions.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-completes-did-smart-contract-development-on-ethereum-to-boost-the-decentralized-identity-c7a4564febc3">Ontology Completes DID Smart Contract Development on Ethereum to Boost the Decentralized Identity…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) software comes in many forms. Some are heavy with software components (the thick client model) while others are leaner (the thin client model). Since we at SSH.COM are firm believers in the thin client model, I wanted to present five solid reasons why this is the case.</p>
<p></p>
 1. No constant cycle of installing, patching and configuring agents 
<p>Thick clients require that you have to install agents on the client - and usually on the server as well. Moreover, you need to ensure that those agents are always up-to-date, patched and compatible with the operating system, and installed on every client necessary.</p>
<p>That’s not only a lot of steps but it’s a process that often requires the help of specialist staff which increases costs. On top of that, when access is no longer valid, you should ensure that the agent is actually removed from the client.</p>
<p>With a thin client, there is no need to install, remove or patch any agents at any point. We prefer a model where access is granted, managed and revoked using a standard browser - the only ‘software agent’ you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Less complexity means easier endpoint security management 
<p>Every piece of software component added to the environment adds complexity to the mix. The installation and configuration needs easily add up when people join the company, switch roles and leave. This is particularly true for 3rd parties whose access needs are often temporary.</p>
<p>Moreover, PAM solutions grant primarily admin-level access. Installing a required PAM agent requires (local) admin rights which in turn are often under the control of other solutions since they are privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Client installations might also require application black or whitelisting – which adds yet another management layer to the equation. In some cases, you might need to give local admin rights to 3rd parties to get them onboarded which might not always be a good idea or even against corporate policies.</p>
<p>All in all, having privileged software agents on clients adds up to surprisingly complex endpoint security management.</p>
<p>With a thin client model, you simply skip the PAM agent installation phase which saves a lot of time, effort and money and makes access management leaner. It also means that you can have an identical installation image for all clients intended for privileged users, and you can manage software and hardware upgrades, security policies, application changes virtually and remotely using that same image.</p>
<p>You can also ensure that the clients have only the bare minimum setup for the required tasks, so there is nothing to steal if the client is compromised.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this model reduces the number of misconfigurations. Since privileged users or 3rd parties don’t need to – and can’t - install anything to use the client, unauthorized software installations or installing viruses becomes unlikely.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/make_remote_work_secure_for_admins">making secure remote work fast &amp; secure for admins, devs and IT subcontractors here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Standard, plugin-free browser for minimized management 
<p>There are access management tools that work using browsers but require plugins for privileged user access to work. This is just points 1 and 2 wrapped inside a browser: are all the plugins up-to-date, who maintains them, who has the rights to install them, are they always compatible with the latest browser versions, is the browser set up correctly per client…</p>
<p>We believe in an approach where your standard browser is your only access management tool that you need to update. The official browser releases are always rigorously tested, and patches are fast and automatic which is not often the case with plugins or other software components. Once again, this model is straightforward and minimizes the number of configurations and reduces complexity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Thin in bloat, rich in features and usability 
<p>This point is almost ideological: many widely used applications – IT or otherwise - exist in the cloud and are based on thin clients, like Citrix Virtual Apps, Office 365 or Netflix just to name a few. With thin client PAM software, your developers get the same, consistent and secure experience across clients and your admins manage all access through a single pane of glass. Thin can be very rich in features: the features simply exist behind a clean looking UI.</p>
<p>This model is also very fast for onboarding: the developer just logs in to the centralized authority through a UI without anyone having to configure anything on the client. Switching clients becomes effortless. The number of access ticket requests is significantly smaller and training needs are radically reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Respect your environment, minimize all changes 
<p>If you are not familiar with the concept of immutable infrastructure, here’s a small breakdown of the idea. Once you have a particular environment set up and servers deployed, you don’t make any run-time changes to it. If you change something, you decommission the entire environment and spin up an entirely new instance instead. The benefit is more consistency, predictability and reliability in your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Again, thin is key. Don’t install anything on the client or the server for that matter. When granting privileged access, you don’t even need to create any one-time passwords or temporary accounts on the server side either. All these processes require constant run-time changes and add unwanted complexity and unnecessary processes. We are suggesting that privileged access can be granted without permanent credentials with what we call <a href="https://www.ssh.com/iam/ephemeral_access/">ephemeral certificates</a>, in a <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/zoom-and-who-data-breaches-prove-need-passwordless-it-solution">passwordless</a> fashion and without making any kind of changes to your environment.</p>
<p>This might sound radical and we are fine with that reaction. Not all PAMs need to be the same: we built ours with a strong focus in the future which is mostly multi-cloud and hybrid driven. The fact that our solution, PrivX, is based on just-in-time authentication without a need for any type of permanent credentials for privileged users was just one of the reasons KuppingerCole credited us with one of the Overall Product Leaders in their <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80088/privileged-access-management/">Leadership Compass 2020: Privileged Access Management</a>, as evidenced by the following quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s an innovative approach but one that does bring functional and security advantages – access is faster, onboarding and offboarding of privileged users is quick and there are no passwords to issue or lose, since there are no permanent leave-behind credentials”</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>The CEO of a startup gaming company is in the middle of developing its next big hit for gamers. Between ensuring the product is perfect for release, examining the workflow of the business and keeping employees engaged, the amount of to-dos and questions quickly becomes overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO makes the decision to build an advisory board for the company. As a first step, they identify and record all the gaps in the business, as well as specific questions that have come up in recent meetings that need unbiased answers. But the success of the company depends on choosing the right people to answer those questions and give advice on the gaps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building an effective board means CEOs must be open to accepting coaching and guidance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While advisory boards are not mandatory within an organization, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/technology-ceos-create-valuable-buyer-urgency-for-shorter-sales-cycles/">tech CEOs </a>can benefit greatly from the presence of a board, as each member can offer insights, ideas and strategic advice outside of the CEO’s expertise. For startups, establishing an advisory board can play a pivotal role in their corporate development.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36547"]</p>
 Understand the business needs 
<p>CEOs often begin the search for advisory board members prior to understanding the needs of the organization and the critical matters the board will be looking to solve. As a first step, tech CEOs need to identify goals and a clear path to accomplishing those goals. This in turn will offer insight into the type of individuals and skills needed on the board. Think about areas of the business that need improvement and find the gaps in knowledge, skill and experience.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-must-haves-in-the-ceo-chro-culture-conversation/">3 Must-Haves in the CEO-CHRO Culture Conversation</a></p>
 Welcome challenges 
<p>Although advisory board members are chosen by the CEO, they lack the legal liability and corporate power for decision making and strategic direction of the organization. Because of this, individuals are often selected based on relationships, a tech CEO’s network or on specific expertise, likely making them more hesitant to offer a counterargument to the CEO.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that building an effective board means CEOs must be open to accepting coaching and guidance, welcome challenging thoughts, and be willing to allow outsiders to help structure and build their organization.</p>
 Know what good looks like 
<p>The advisory board should consist of executives who have an interest in the company and are willing to contribute time to its development. Review backgrounds and experience to identify the skills that each individual has to offer. CEOs should keep the number of members small enough to make the group manageable, but large enough to get the talent needed. The larger the advisory board, the more attention and resources it will require.</p>
<p>Each advisor should be able to offer some of these attributes:</p>
 
 Industry knowledge 
 Customer contacts 
 Access to capital 
 Access to potential management team members and advisors 
 Partnership contracts 
 M&amp;A experience 
 General management experience 
 
 Avoid conflicts 
<p>CEOs will want to determine any conflicts of interest early on and have necessary agreements in place, including nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and conflict of interest agreements, as advisors will have access to confidential business plans, intellectual property and the organization’s overall strategy.</p>
<p>To prevent conflicts in positions, a set term limit and mandatory performance reviews should be put in place. This will also enable the board to remain fluid as the business needs of the organization change and new skills and experience are required.</p>
 Don’t rush the process 
<p>While it’s important to staff the board as soon as possible, it’s not necessary to choose the entire board at once. Begin with one or two strong candidates and fill each seat as you find the right individuals.</p>
 Motivate your members&nbsp; 
<p>Lastly, advisors should be incentivized via correct compensation when possible, through equity, cash or other expenses, to ensure members stay engaged. When deciding on compensation, take into account a prospect’s potential role, current position, strengths and what they bring to the table overall.</p>
<p>CEOs who prepare their company properly for the existence of an advisory board will set it up to play a key role in dealing with many issues, including finance, sales, marketing, expansion, production, funding and infrastructure. Ultimately, an effective advisory board can assist in many aspects of running a business, help lead strategic changes and actively contribute to the organization’s success.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity security is driving exceptional customer experiences 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day when you enter your username and password into your favorite website, you’re generating data. The average customer generates an eye-watering volume of data over the course of their digital day. When someone registers for a new website or app and creates a user profile, they’re creating a new dataset that can be analyzed by a new firm. When that phenomenon multiplies across cities, countries, and continents, the amount of information being created by customers across the globe is downright staggering. But managing that data properly and adhering to regional, national, and international guidelines can be a difficult task for even the most seasoned executive. It’s an organizational risk that more companies are coming to terms with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all that data is also an opportunity, one that allows companies to personalize their products and services and give their customers and clients incredible, engaging experiences—such as the ability to login without using a password. Personalization is key to success, but it has to happen in a way that makes data security simultaneously integral and invisible.</p>

   The Traditional Identity Journey 

<p>Over the past decade, organizations have gone through many different stages of the identity journey. Depending on the size and maturity of your organization, you are probably in one of six identity maturity categories (see diagram below). Your progress through the stages of maturity may be stalled—but not necessarily because of limited resources or for lack of trying. Your lack of progress is likely due to the limitations of your existing identity governance solution.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why? These legacy solutions fail to deliver on your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> requirements. Large enterprises need a model that provides visibility into who has access into what and why, eliminating manual access requests, approvals and certification rubberstamping. And, the identity model should grow dynamically as your organization changes over time.&nbsp;</p>

 Why Legacy Identity Governance Solutions are Destined to Fail&nbsp; 

<p>Legacy identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions are failing organizations today for&nbsp;several reasons:&nbsp;</p>

  Identity silos: Many IGA solutions are only integrated with a few authoritative identity sources, like Microsoft Active Directory, or your company's HR system, like Workday. The limited integrations result in poor user access visibility and a lack of consistent access visibility across the entire enterprise. As a result, you have many islands of identity sprinkled across your organization. 
	 Operational inefficiencies: IGA solutions are meant to automate access requests, approvals and certification reviews. The reality is quite different. Instead, your teams are so overwhelmed with access requests, approvals and certification reviews that they end up manually approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications. This results in the overprovisioning of user access privileges across your entire enterprise.&nbsp; 
	 No context: While IGA solutions are good at providing visibility into a single authoritative source, they don’t provide visibility and context across multiple authoritative sources. As a result, organizations struggle to determine what users need access to, what access they have, and why that access is needed. Without universal visibility and context across the entire enterprise, your organization is blind to inappropriate user access privileges and potential unauthorized user access.&nbsp; 
	 Static data: IGA solutions provide tools—like role modeling—to help organizations achieve better operational efficiencies and compliance. While role modeling helps to better align users with the right access rights, the organizational role model rapidly becomes stale and outdated. Your organization changes dynamically every hour, every day, every week, and every month. With outdated access rights, privileges, roles and entitlements of an IGA solution, your organization is more open to security risks and potential data breaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <p>These are the reasons why IT and Security teams are experiencing identity governance fatigue. They are exhausted from manually reviewing and approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications.&nbsp;</p>

 Don’t Run Your Business with a Crystal Ball 

<p>Is this how you want to run your business? With a crystal ball that provides predictions based on limited data. Of course not! That is why you implemented an IGA solution.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your existing IGA solution has provided you with an initial set of capabilities to manage and control the entire identity lifecycle. From a user’s birthright access to the removal of their access when they leave the organization. The point here is, access requests, access approvals, certifications and role modeling capabilities have gotten you to where you are today. You have made progress in managing and controlling user’s access. That’s the good news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bad news is legacy IGA solutions have created a new set of barriers to your organization’s growth and future success. Existing IGA solutions have stalled your progress because they have not addressed the core problem: “How do I develop a model to solve my access problem?”&nbsp; Until that question is addressed with a solution that meets today’s challenges and acknowledges the dynamic nature of your organization, you’ll continue to be in a “holding pattern” when it comes to managing and controlling user access across the entire enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Grow the Business with AI-Driven Identity Analytics&nbsp; 

<p>How do you evolve past the holding pattern?&nbsp; The answer is artificial intelligence (AI)-driven identity analytics, which address legacy IGA solution gaps.</p>

<p>Using AI and machine learning techniques to consume and analyze large data volumes, AI-driven identity analytics can detect user access patterns and inappropriate access privileges across the entire enterprise. By automating high-confidence and low-risk user access rights, your security and risk teams will have more time and resources to focus on higher priority tasks and projects.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>In their race towards digital transformation, organizations are using cloud services to accelerate the development of new apps and improve efficiency. They allow new applications to be rapidly developed, existing applications to be modernized and deployed without additional capital spend. This provides important business benefits but also increases the challenges for the cloud customer to ensure cyber-security and regulatory compliance. It is in this light that the recent announcements from GCP (Google Cloud Platform) need to be understood.</p>
 
 Trust but Verify 
 
<p>Initially, cloud service users were concerned that they had no control over the way in which the services themselves were managed and secured. The major CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) now go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments and it has become clear that many of the cloud security challenges lie with the customers’ own use of these services. For example, security and compliance are often outside the skills of DevOps teams or are overlooked and this can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber adversaries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An additional concern is the risk of government interference in the operation of the service or demands for access to the data it holds. This concern was recently rekindled with the EU <a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/judgment.pdf">Court of Justice Ruling</a> on the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>The onus is on the CSP to gain customers' trust in all of these areas.</p>
<p>GCP publish an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-clouds-semi-annual-transparency-report-now-available">Enterprise Data Transparency Report</a> that identifies the number of government requests received for Google Cloud Platform and G Suite Enterprise Cloud customer. This report claims that a very small percentage of requests were for enterprise data and that Google did not produce any GCP Enterprise Cloud customer data in response to government requests.</p>
<p>The customer always needs to verify the claims of the CSP. SLAs provide some reassurance but usually with limited recourse if they are missed. Contracts are usually written by the CSP and are not negotiable. Independent certification of compliance is useful to provide a snapshot in time. The best verification is proof that the service was designed, implemented, and is run with security and compliance built-in.</p>
 
 Securing Data and Access 
 
<p>When an organization uses a cloud service the responsibility for security and compliance is shared (see graphic). It is always up to the customer to classify the data that they hold in the service and to control access to this data according to the risks and their compliance obligations. The CSP must secure the infrastructure and should provide the capabilities for the customer to assess and control their use of the service.</p>
<p>One critical control for this is data encryption – however, customers need to consider which form of encryption is appropriate for their risks. For example, while data may be encrypted during transit on the network and at rest in the database and - this will protect against interception and media loss, but it does not protect against application-level attacks such as SQL Injection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GCP already provides the customer with the capabilities to encrypt their data and to manage their own encryption keys. This includes a cloud-hosted key management service that lets the customer manage their cryptographic keys for their cloud services the same way as on-premises. It also provides HSM as a service to provide hardware protection of the keys. Additionally, in beta is Key Access Justifications a capability that gives the customer visibility into every request for an encryption key, a justification for that request, and a mechanism to approve or deny decryption in the context of that request.</p>
 
 Confidential Computing 
 
<p>While data is being processed in the customer’s applications it needs to be decrypted. This creates a small but important risk to confidentiality through RAM scraping attacks for example. Intel SGX technology already enables applications to be written to process data within protected enclaves.&nbsp; However, this typically requires development changes to the application. GCP&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing">Confidential Computing</a>&nbsp;(in beta) is a technology that encrypts data in-use while it is being processed. Confidential Computing environments keep data encrypted in memory and elsewhere outside the central processing unit (CPU). Google claims that this can be implemented at a VM level without any need for code changes at the click of a button.</p>
 
 Assured Workloads for Government 
 
<p>Normally CSPs offer cloud services tailored to the specific compliance requirements of governments. Often, these are hosted in dedicated data centres and managed by government accredited staff to ensure compliance. However, this slows the deployment of new features and does not scale to support other highly regulated industries such as finance. In response to this GCP has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/assured-workloads-for-government-compliance-without-compromise">Assured Workloads for Government</a>. Google claim that this will allow them to support US Government workloads to IL4 within their normal infrastructure by:</p>
 
 Automatic enforcement of data location: to meet U.S. government compliance requirements by choosing to store data at rest in U.S. regions. 
 Personnel access: to limit Google support personnel access based on predefined attributes such as citizenship, a particular geographical access location, and background checks. 
 Built-in security controls: to reduce the risk of accidental misconfigurations by choosing from available platform security configurations. 
 Automatic enforcement of product deployment location based on organizational policy. 
 
 
 Certificate Authority Service 
 
<p>Digital certificates underpin identity and authentication for many networked devices and services. This is not new technology but is becoming more important as a mechanism to securely identify IoT devices. However, it is difficult to set up a CA (Certificate Authority) and manage digital certificates at the scale required where there may be many millions of devices. Google has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-cas-a-cloud-based-managed-ca-for-the-devops-and-iot-world">Certificate Authority Service</a>. This is in beta and will provide a scalable and available service that simplifies and automates the management and deployment of private CAs.</p>
 
 My Opinion 
 
<p>These announcements from GCP underpin the view that organizations are increasingly using cloud services for their business-critical applications as part of their digital transformation journey. This is leading to more scrutiny of the ways in which these services can help the organization to support their own specific security and compliance obligations. The customer still needs to map these controls back to their obligations and to ensure that the controls are effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While none of the announcements from GCP are for offerings that are completely unique they do provide useful differentiation that may sway some customers to choose GCP. However, most organizations will have a hybrid IT deployment model involving multiple CSPs as well as on services delivered on-premises and this will remain a significant challenge for the foreseeable future.</p>

  <p>Fakes are everywhere. From olive oil to pharmaceuticals, to seafood, sneakers and even digital content, criminals make big money by tricking consumers into buying their counterfeit goods. In fact it’s estimated that over 60% of olive oil is fake, and, in some places, there’s an 87% chance that red snapper is actually a cheaper fish, like perch or tilapia.</p>
<p>For some companies the costs of combating mislabeling and fakes outweigh the risks, and others actually benefit from the fake creation. For example, many social media platforms realize it’s not worth spending money ferreting out disinformation when that type of sensational content is so effective at increasing engagement and therefore advertising revenue.</p>
<p>“As a consumer, you really do need to be skeptical of everything that you're consuming and looking at,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">Avivah Litan</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.<br>
</p>
<p>According to a report prepared for the <a href="https://iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a>, counterfeit and other piracy will grow to 2.81 trillion dollars by 2022.</p>
<p>In times of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming/">disruption</a>, shortages and uncertainty, like a global pandemic or a divisive election season, counterfeiters become more active preying on people who have dropped their guard. It’s exactly these environments of desperation and distraction that cause people to become victims of counterfeits.</p>
<p>Here are three tools to spot and stop counterfeits. Gartner recommends that consumers look for at least one that has been used to verify that a product is what it says it is. But for organizations that must ensure products are 100% genuine, it’s best to rely on all three.</p>
 
 Human verification. This includes on-site auditing by regulators who conduct actual physical inspections, sampling and testing to deliver certificates of verification. In the digital space it may also include crowdsourced ratings of reputation, such as seller reviews online. 
 Algorithmic verification. Machine learning and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">AI models</a> are trained to analyze and recognize attributes, components and ingredients of the genuine article to provide verification. 
 Digital verification. Deployed for certification at the origin of a product or piece of content, these tools allow for quality control with digital techniques such as DNA analysis or spectral imaging to capture and record the original as a digital object. Then <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">blockchain</a> and digital tokenization enable tracking of this immutable object from origin to end user to provide certainty that nothing has been changed. 
 
<p>Because each tool by itself is not perfect, all three layered together provide the greatest verification. But the cost increases with each tool, so deciding which to use and when requires carefully weighing risks and benefits against cost. Whatever the level of need to assess the truth, these tools will help you spot fakes and protect yourself and your business from counterfeits.</p>

  <p>Organizations that hesitate to commit to a total migration to the public cloud model use a combination — or hybrid — of private-cloud-inspired and public cloud styles of computing. That is why, over the past three years, Gartner client requests to discuss hybrid cloud have grown 15%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Cloud computing promises that customers will gain advantages from several key propositions, for example by shifting the responsibility and work of running hardware and software infrastructure to cloud providers, leveraging the economics of cloud elasticity, benefiting from the pace of innovation in sync with public cloud providers, and more,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/6992/David-Smith">David Smith</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next generation of cloud computing, retains the advantages of cloud computing while extending the range and use cases for cloud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, hybrid cloud breaks these very value propositions: One part of a hybrid cloud is architected, owned, controlled and operated by the customer and the other by the public cloud provider. The customer retains responsibility for their part of the operation but cannot leverage the capabilities (such as the skills, innovation pace, investments and techniques) of the public cloud provider.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Newer generations of packaged hybrid cloud offerings can help reduce the impact of these shortcomings. Distributed cloud, the next generation of cloud computing, retains the advantages of cloud computing while extending the range and use cases for cloud. CIOs can use distributed cloud models to target location-dependent cloud use cases that will be required in the future.</p>

 What is distributed cloud? 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/distributed-cloud">Distributed cloud computing</a> is the first cloud model that incorporates physical location of cloud-delivered services as part of its definition. Historically, location has not been relevant to cloud computing definitions. In fact, location has been explicitly abstracted away from the service, which inspired the term “cloud computing” in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distributed cloud has three origins: Public cloud, hybrid cloud and edge computing. Public cloud providers have supported multiple zones and regions for many years. With packaged hybrid offerings, public cloud services (often including necessary hardware and software) can now be distributed to different physical locations, for instance, the edge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2024, most cloud service platforms will provide at least some distributed cloud services that execute at the point of need</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, ownership, operation, governance, updates and evolution of the services remain the responsibility of the originating public cloud provider. This is a significant shift from the virtually centralized model of most public cloud services and the model associated with the general cloud concept. It will lead to a new era in cloud computing.</p>
<p>Some might ask if distributed cloud is simply a case of edge computing, and the answer is both yes and no. All instances of distributed cloud are also instances of edge computing. But not all instances of edge computing are distributed cloud. This is because many uses of edge involve a public cloud provider that manages the evolution and ongoing control of the resulting environment.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-top-10-cloud-myths/">Top 10 Cloud Myths</a></p>
 The value of distributed cloud computing 
<p>Cloud services from public cloud providers become “distributed” out to specific and varied physical locations. Operations being physically closer to those who need the capabilities enable low-latency compute. This also ensures a consistent control plane to administer the cloud infrastructure from public to private cloud and extend consistently across both environments. Taken together, these items can deliver major improvements in performance due to the elimination of latency issues, as well as reduce the risk of global network-related outages or control plane inefficiencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distributed cloud will evolve in two distinct phases. Phase One will consist of like-for-like hybrid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distributed cloud creates strategically placed substations of cloud compute, storage and networking that can act as shared cloud pseudoavailability zones. Gartner uses the term “substations” to evoke the image of subsidiary stations, for instance branch post offices, where people gather to use services.</p>
<p>Because distributed cloud substations are the responsibility of the originating public cloud provider, the key cloud value propositions of productivity, innovation and support remain intact. In fact, by 2024, most cloud service platforms will provide at least some distributed cloud services that execute at the point of need.</p>
<p>Other specific advantages of distributed cloud potentially include:</p>
 
 Increased compliance with regulatory requirements that data must be in a specific customer location 
 Reduced network failure risk because the cloud services can reside in local or semilocal subnets, allowing them to operate intermittently untethered 
 A dramatic increase in the number and availability of locations where cloud services can be hosted or from which they can be consumed (compute zones) 
 
 What’s next for distributed cloud? 
<p>In practical terms, distributed cloud will evolve in two distinct phases. Phase One will consist of like-for-like hybrid, where enterprise customers will buy cloud substations to mimic the promise of hybrid cloud and avoid latency-based problems.</p>
<p>These customers will not initially embrace the idea of opening their substations to near neighbors, whether geographical or industry-based, and will keep the substation on their premises to themselves. This will have the effect of enabling true hybrid cloud by having public cloud providers take responsibility for everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next-generation cloud will work based on an assumption that cloud substations are everywhere — much like Wi-Fi hot spots</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase Two, or next-gen cloud, will consist of utilities, universities, city governments and telcos, among others, buying cloud substations and opening them for use by near neighbors. This will begin to establish the idea that distributed cloud represents the foundation of the next generation of cloud computing. This will also reflect the need for the continuum of distributed cloud. Next-generation cloud will work based on an assumption that cloud substations are everywhere — much like Wi-Fi hot spots.</p>
<p>“In both phases, location becomes more transparent again,” says Smith. “They allow customers to specify to a provider, ‘I need X to comply with policies Y and latencies Z,’ and then let the provider configure automatically and transparently. This could potentially represent future phases as well.”</p>
 Distributed cloud is not without its challenges 
<p>Within the distributed cloud model, some questions must be addressed before <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-lessons-learned-from-cloud-infrastructure-adopters/">the model can be widely adopted</a>. For example:</p>
 
 How much of the public cloud capabilities will be available on the distributed cloud substation? While this is not definitional to distributed cloud, it is a factor in deciding what flavor of distributed cloud will be necessary — fully distributed or partially distributed. 
 What custom scenarios for distributed cloud substations will emerge? 
 If distributed cloud substations are opened to near-neighbor companies, who pays for the increased bandwidth necessary for effective operation and how will it be paid? 
 How will revenue models play out for sharing substations across multiple companies? For example, do near-neighbor users of a substation pay the originating cloud provider or the enterprise that originally requested the substation be installed? 
 Must a distributed cloud substation always be connected, or can it operate with variable connectivity? 
 
 Considerations for CIOs 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-what-do-cios-need-to-consider-for-cloud-strategy/">In the eyes of the CIO</a>, the distributed cloud concept will guide the roadmap for cloud evolution. It will specifically benefit CIOs seeking new opportunities to reach customers in dispersed environments and those who need location-specific services with reduced latency. Using Phase One like-for-like hybrids without sacrificing cloud value propositions will enable real hybrid cloud computing. Thus, distributed cloud not only ushers in a next generation of cloud in Phase Two, but it also helps build a firmer foundation for hybrid as it exists today.</p>

 The GiD Report#122 — What will replace WeChat? (And how Facebook fueled TikTok’s&nbsp;rise) <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-121-what-we-learned-from-the-big-tech-antitrust-hearing-645d98b1fc61">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Two things mattered this last week: the state of the economy and the state of our technology.</p><p>On the economy, we still can’t seem to agree on the next stimulus bill and so the Fed has taken matters into its own hands — with a now redefined purview on expanding inflation with whatever tools necessary.</p><p>On our technology, President Trump banned a bunch of Chinese apps including TikTok and WeChat. Make no mistake, China’s played this game since day one, keeping out platforms like Facebook and Google so they could build their own tightly controlled variants. But in fighting China’s fight, the U.S. is creating an internet that more and more resembles that of its primary geopolitical rival.</p><p>All of this had the vibe of inevitability. With all the tension building up from the status quo, it was only a matter of time before something had to&nbsp;give.</p><p>These are the ongoing battles that will rejigger the world as we know&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so this week, the economy feels a little less free. And the internet feels a little less&nbsp;open.</p><p>Here’s what we have for you&nbsp;today:</p>  What will fill the WeChat&nbsp;vacuum?  How Facebook fueled TikTok’s&nbsp;rise  The New Brandeis Movement of antitrust thinking  NYTimes contemplates the challenge of antitrust regulations  Chamath Palihapitiya on the economy and Bitcoin (next&nbsp;week)  Stuff happens   1. Everyone is talking about TikTok. Microsoft has 45 days to complete a deal. Twitter apparently threw its hat into the ring over the weekend, according to the WSJ (they’re calling it “Twik Twok”). But let’s talk about&nbsp;WeChat. <p>Where TikTok is about ephemeral fun and also significant long term cultural (and in turn political) influence — soft power, basically — WeChat is as hard as it&nbsp;comes.</p>Photo: Sean&nbsp;Foley<p>Sure, WeChat hasn’t had the same kind of international impact outside of China that TikTok has enjoyed (which, BTW, isn’t even available in China — they use an alternative called Douyin). But if I want to chat with my cousin in Shanghai about the new guy she’s dating, I open up WeChat. If my sister wants to order some obscure product that only a niche Chinese manufacturer makes, she logs onto&nbsp;WeChat.</p><p>If you wanted to connect with people in China, you opened up China’s #1&nbsp;app.</p><p>So even though pretty much no regular American uses WeChat for their normal day-to-day stuff, it remains the central vector for connecting with mainland China both socially and economically. By banning WeChat, Trump is burning a key&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>And because China banned U.S. platforms long ago, there’s really no real alternatives from either&nbsp;side.</p><p>That’s a huge vacuum that’s going to need to be filled. Tensions are high between the two governments, but people are still people. They are going to want to chat and they are going to want to do business with the outside&nbsp;world.</p><p>So the real question is what fills that&nbsp;gap.</p><p>It’s hard to see something from the old guard rising to the task. They want too much control. They need too much of your data. And they lack the structural flexibility to appease both sides. It will be a nonstarter for either government.</p><p>New bridges will need to be built with new approaches.</p><p>That’s the new&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Anyway, this is a big deal. It’s not just about me or my sister. It’s also about Apple. Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-29d4148e-e21a-4b81-82c8-8e23fb4995d8.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Yes, but: WeChat is not only huge inside China but serves to connect users there with friends and family abroad, and shutting it down in the U.S. would be a major disruption to the Chinese diaspora. Beijing’s internet surveillance and censorship means most Chinese communication platforms stay domestic, and American tech platforms don’t extend into the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>Unlike TikTok, which doesn’t operate in China, WeChat can’t be cleanly severed from China, so there’s no path to a domestic acquisition, and the executive order likely amounts to a&nbsp;ban.</blockquote><blockquote>And if American companies can’t do any commerce involving WeChat, which is widely used for a vast range of functions within China, that could demolish the Chinese business of companies like Apple, observers <a href="https://twitter.com/guan/status/1291698934155489281">note</a>.</blockquote> 2. OK! With that out of the way, now we can talk about TikTok (the success of which Facebook is apparently responsible for). <p>If you watched the antitrust hearings the other week — and even if you only watched parts as I did, it was clear that Mark Zuckerberg was positioning Facebook as a democratic foil to TikTok (and parent owner ByteDance).</p><p>In other words, Mark believes we need companies like Facebook to be as big as possible in order to compete on the global stage with an emergent China — Tech Cold War and all that&nbsp;jazz.</p><p>It’s a compelling argument with some (emphasis some) undeniable merit. Companies, tech or other, benefit from scale and network effects, improving reach and efficiency. And having global corporate behemoths expands American hegemony.</p><p>And we all want to expand American hegemony don’t we? (Apologies to all the non-American readers, I’m just trying to make a&nbsp;point.)</p><p>With billions of users, Facebook helps better connect people everywhere, expanding American soft power, and for a time, even helping to spark democratic movements (arguably). The Arab Spring comes to&nbsp;mind.</p><p>But what if Facebook (sheer size and monopolistic behavior in tow) is also one of the main drivers of TikTok’s&nbsp;success?</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/08/07/tech-monopolies-are-the-reason-the-us-now-has-a-tiktok-problem/">Lucas Kunce</a> (via Matt Stoller’s newsletter BIG) for the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center ProMarket magazine:</p><blockquote>If you’re amused by the irony of Big Tech protecting us from an app that could be used for election meddling, given Facebook’s role in the 2016 election, the irony doesn’t stop there. Because TikTok, the app getting all the attention right now, owes its existence in large part to Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>Once upon a time, America had a popular video-sharing app similar to TikTok. It was called Vine and, like TikTok, all the kids used to share silly videos on it. Facebook didn’t like the competition and flexed its monopoly power to strangle it. As revealed in leaked e-mails, Mark Zuckerberg pulled the trigger himself, denying Vine access to Facebook and eliminating its ability to access&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>Curiously, Facebook didn’t do that with TikTok. In fact, it did the opposite. During the spring and summer of 2018, when Facebook was still pushing to access China and trying to open a subsidiary office in Hangzhou, Facebook allowed the Chinese app to blitzkrieg its site with advertising. The ad buys were so overwhelming — more than a billion dollars — that between 15 percent and 22 percent of all ads shown through Facebook on IOS during this time were TikTok&nbsp;ads.</blockquote><blockquote>In 2019, however, things changed, and it had nothing to do with patriotism or protecting the West from a Chinese app. Zuckerberg appeared to finally realize that he would never get into China, political scrutiny on Facebook’s outsized power intensified on both sides of the aisle, and TikTok stopped pouring $3 million a day into big ad buys on Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>In short, Facebook claims its size should be preserved in order to serve as a line of defense against adversarial companies and that it needs to be big to innovate. Yet the evidence indicates that the latest adversarial app owes its existence, in part, to Facebook’s pursuit of corporate goals like expanding into China and increasing ad revenue. The Vine story clearly illustrates how the large tech platforms are structurally unable to defend American interests and should never be trusted with that&nbsp;task.</blockquote><p>That’s the other side of the coin. Just because Big Tech is powerful doesn’t mean it’s good for America. Because ultimately, Big Tech is self interested. (Which in and of itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you know what I mean.) How many potential American Tik Toks has Facebook squashed along the way by pushing its sheer weight around? (Like it did with SnapChat as well when Evan Spiegel refused to&nbsp;sell.)</p><p>In crushing American competition, Facebook created space (and even supported) the rise of Chinese competition.</p><p>The consequences only become fully clear in hindsight. It’s the type of negative externality that’s sometimes hard to quantify — diminishing competition and innovation (although the numbers are now starting to back it&nbsp;up).</p><p>Related:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qpwtU9uoI">The TikTok&nbsp;Ban</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/">Ben Thompson: Antitrust Politics</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearing-cicilline-facebook-apple-google-amazon-230cca9a-eadc-4293-ad73-fc9c41696d20.html">Podcast: Big Tech hearing chair on which companies should be broken&nbsp;up</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/banning-tiktok-are-we-reproducing?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ODI0MDM4LCJfIjoiOUd5RkYiLCJpYXQiOjE1OTY4MjMwOTcsImV4cCI6MTU5NjgyNjY5NywiaXNzIjoicHViLTExNTI0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.RzCACSxUpx6CzohuN2uoIdIw-pVdbB6Fw-T0D7camuY">Banning TikTok: Are We Reproducing the Chinese Internet in&nbsp;America?</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449">WSJ News Exclusive | Twitter, TikTok Have Held Preliminary Talks About Possible Combination</a>  <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/08/07/tech-monopolies-are-the-reason-the-us-now-has-a-tiktok-problem/">Tech Monopolies Are the Reason the US Now Has a TikTok Problem — Pro&nbsp;Market</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2020/08/09/trumps-ban-on-tiktok-and-wechat-strengthens-cryptocurrencies/">Trump’s Ban On TikTok And WeChat Strengthens Cryptocurrencies</a>   3. So we’ve talked about Lina Khan here before, who wrote the seminal paper on antitrust (Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox), which helped spawn the New Brandeis Movement (Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis is heavily cited in Lina’s paper). The ethos of that movement got a nod by Chairman David Cicilline during the antitrust hearings (via Ben Thompson’s Stratechery): <blockquote>Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we’ve recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolies in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&amp;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy.</blockquote><p>Which touches upon our point about Facebook and the rise of TikTok. This isn’t just about keeping prices low, making platforms more useful, or optimizing for efficiency. It’s about upholding social, cultural, and political values and not allowing economic power undermine them.</p><p>In other words, we can’t lose sight of the big&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Those were Chairman Cicilline’s closing remarks to his opening statement. Ben has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/">a more in depth take on the hearings as a whole</a>, which is worth your time. (Incidentally, he didn’t feel like the rest of the show lived up to the spirit of those initial remarks.)</p> 4. The issue is that it’s easy to spot the problem. Figuring out a solution is less straightforward—especially from a regulatory perspective. <p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20200804&amp;instance_id=20964&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=35187&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fd75f7c23-4919-5b0f-99e6-c340a549cde8&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Shira: What’s been Europe’s approach to the American tech superpowers?</blockquote><blockquote>Adam: Europe started doing antitrust investigations several years ago. But the resulting lawsuits and regulation haven’t done&nbsp;much.</blockquote><blockquote>Google is the best example. Investigations into allegations of anti-competitive tactics took years. The European Union then fined Google several billion dollars for breaking the law. But critics say that Google wasn’t forced to change much, so this did little to restore competition.</blockquote><blockquote>What can American lawmakers and regulators learn from Europe’s mistakes?</blockquote><blockquote>Speed is crucial, otherwise regulators are fighting yesterday’s battles.</blockquote><blockquote>There was also a problem with enforcement. Europe passed a highly-touted privacy law called General Data Protection Regulation, but it’s been a flop at limiting data collection by the biggest tech companies. Much of the policing of the law was left to Ireland, which simply doesn’t have the resources to keep&nbsp;up.</blockquote><blockquote>It sounds as if the lesson is that you can believe there’s a problem with tech companies’ power, but it’s hard to craft an appropriate response.</blockquote><blockquote>Without a doubt. The authorities in Europe are changing their tactics now. They’re looking at rewriting laws to directly target the way big tech companies do business: How they use data or box out rivals, and ways they give their products preferential treatment.</blockquote><blockquote>But after a few years covering this in Europe, I have become much more suspect about these efforts at regulation. There’s a lot of potential for unintended consequences.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Does this mean we should be skeptical about any U.S. government action against Big&nbsp;Tech?</blockquote><blockquote>Maybe. But it’s still been interesting to watch this growing realization among the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the size of these companies and the influence they hold over their democratic societies and how they operate, including their communication systems, information flow and commerce.</blockquote><blockquote>You can sense this feeling that lawmakers think they must do something, but aren’t quite sure what that is yet. The next 12 to 18 months are going to be extraordinary.</blockquote><p>And because these are extraordinary times, things are moving faster than usual.&nbsp;Axios:</p><blockquote>After grilling the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple last week, members of Congress are grappling with whether to accuse any of the firms of illegal anticompetitive behavior, to propose updating federal antitrust laws, or both, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Congress is just one arm of government making the case against these <br>companies. Google is expected to be the first of the firms to face possible antitrust litigation from the Justice Department before summer’s end, but all four face a full-court press of investigations by DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: Following on from last week’s hearing, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is preparing a report of its probe’s findings, drawn from some 1.3 million documents and hours of calls and interviews. Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline told “Axios Re:Cap” he hopes to issue the report and recommendations by late August or September.</blockquote> 5. I was going to get to the economy next, referencing the interview with Chamath Palihapitiya I shared on Friday, but today’s newsletter has already gotten pretty long so I’ll save it for next&nbsp;week. <p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-eyes-token-bank-appoints-head-digital-assets">Goldman Sachs Eyes Own Token as Bank Appoints New Head of Digital Assets — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200806a.htm?utm_campaign=20200806_FS_PR_FN_FRN%203%20Release_Broad&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua">Federal Reserve announces details of new 24x7x365 interbank settlement service with clearing functionality to support instant payments in the United&nbsp;States</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-history-present-and-future-of-central-banks-feat-george-selgin">The History, Present and Future of Central Banks, Feat.

					 <p>It’s a tale as old as tech: Do I build it in-house or do I invest in a ready-made product? There are dozens of articles scattered around the web which can help you answer this question. But <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is a unique market with unique requirements. Here we seek to provide a comprehensive analysis of the advantages of building versus buying.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The classic question 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>There is a single question that can go a very long way in helping determine whether you should build a solution in-house or buy a product to solve your need:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				Where are you adding value to your customers, and therefore at what layer of the technology should you focus your time?			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>If you were developing a web app, you wouldn’t consider building your own RDBMS, front-end framework, or hosting service. Likewise, to add payments functionality, you would probably use a service from experts like Stripe in order to reliably process payments and ensure PCI compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a bank, on the other hand, payments is probably your bread and butter. You’ll either partner with someone like Stripe for their expertise in API/cloud development or hire a team and build it all yourself.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							 
											
													
										By leveraging existing tools, your team is freed up to focus all its efforts on what it's best at, while resting assured that world-class experts are taking care of the underlying critical components. 
									 
						 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Common build vs buy considerations 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At face value, the decision to build or buy seems like a relatively straightforward one; how much will it cost you to build and maintain an in-house system, and what’s the sticker price for the ready-built solution? But there are non-obvious and often hard-to-quantify considerations that you need to make sure to fully consider.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Reasons to buy</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Reasons to build</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Turnkey/speed</a>
					 
					 <p>A ready-made product should work off the shelf. Some products work better than others…but in principle, this is true.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Support</a>
					 
					 <p>If you’re building something in-house and you run into a roadblock, where will you turn? Consultants? Expensive. Forums? Unreliable, slow. Figure it out? Expensive (because it’s slow). The support that comes with a product, especially in an industry as nascent as self-sovereign identity, is extremely valuable.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Premium product</a>
					 
					 <p>When a vendor makes an update to a product you’re using, you inherit those features effortlessly. The product improves itself over time because there is a dedicated team working on it. Because of the nature of economies of scale, this always results in a premium product.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Scaling</a>
					 
					 <p>Open source reference implementations are meant to be a reference but are not ultimately meant to be a scalable solution. If you use a vendor, you’ll likely need to pay them more money as you scale; so they’re incentivized to ensure their product is scalable!</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Lower-cost</a>
					 
					 <p>It’ll always be lower-cost to buy than to build because the development costs of the product can be amortized across all their customers. If you build it in-house, you bear the brunt of 100% of the costs.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>  Control</a>
					 
					 <p>When you build the technology yourself, you have total ownership and control over the software. You’re not restricted by other software licenses, and you have full ability to change the codebase to accommodate your needs. You control where the data is hosted and don’t need to rely on legal agreements to control how it’s handled.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> In-house expertise</a>
					 
					 <p>Although it will be much more expensive and time consuming to build in-house, your team will build up an expertise. If this expertise is strategically important for your organization, this is an important consideration. You’ll need to make sure to retain the knowledgeable employees, however; I’ve seen key employees leave and wipe out their company’s SSI knowledge base.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Long-tail use case</a>
					 
					 <p>If your use case is uncommon or extraordinarily unique, you may be forced to build in-house. Ready-built platforms like Trinsic are built to accommodate all of the most common use cases, but there is a “long tail” of cases that aren’t economical for a vendor to cover. For these, you will likely need to go deep into the low level SDKs and build something custom.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Costs at scale</a>
					 
					 <p>Depending on the pricing model of the vendor you’re working with, it’s possible that it will be costlier at scale to use a vendor. For example, if a vendor charges per-issuance and your use case requires issuing millions of credentials, then you’ll either need to negotiate special pricing with the vendor or build your own solution to make it economical. This is rare, so it is a companion point to the “long-tail use case” point.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Avoid vendor lock-in</a>
					 
					 <p>Traditionally, enterprises would build in-house to avoid being locked in to a specific software vendor. Luckily, SSI protocols are open source and based on standards which means that Trinsic can’t lock you in even if we wanted to! So the value of this point is reduced in the context of self-sovereign identity.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Self-sovereign identity is unique 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In addition to the common considerations above, SSI has some unique properties that you should be aware of.<br><br></p>  Rapidly-moving space: The open source and standards work in the SSI community are moving at the speed of light. If you opt to build yourself, you’ll need at least two full-time engineers working solely on SSI just for your system to tread water; one to stay abreast of the evolving work going on at DIF, ToIP, Hyperledger, Sovrin, W3C, etc. and one to implement and maintain your software in response to those changes. You’ll bear 100% of the cost of these engineers. And the interoperability devil is in the details—with a vengeance.  Identity is high-stakes: Many verifiable credentials use cases involve high-value, highly-regulated data. Identity breaches are <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ponemon-institutes-2015-global-cost-of-data-breach-study-reveals-average-cost-of-data-breach-reaches-record-levels-300089057.html">costly</a>, making key storage, wallet management (especially in the cloud), and other architectural considerations crucially important. Are you a world-class expert in securing these components? Even if you have the know-how, do you have the engineering capacity for the build-out and maintenance? Once it’s secured, how will it scale?  <p><br>Self-sovereign identity is who we are. It’s what we eat, breathe, and sleep, so you don’t have to. Our expert engineering team ensures the most recent standards and protocols are implemented in our platform, so you never have to worry about interoperability or standards compliance. We spread the cost of these engineers across our hundreds of customers, meaning you get best-in-class solutions and maintenance for a fraction of the cost. Additionally, we’ve invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into our cloud platform with the best experts in the world for SSI security. We’ve learned the lessons and hit the roadblocks already so that you don’t have to.</p>

					 <p>Actually, you don’t need to ask a binary question like “build vs buy.” By buying a developer tool like the Trinsic platform, you avoid reinventing the wheel and get the peace of mind that comes with knowing experts have taken care of the hardest security problems and low-level protocols. This allows your development team the freedom to focus on what they’re best at: building the solutions that will add value to your organization.</p><p><br>With Trinsic’s fully-loaded package of 3 APIs, a front-end Studio, robust documentation, and SDKs in popular languages, your team is equipped with the flexibility and functionality needed to build something extraordinary.<br><br></p>  Trinsic Studio:&nbsp;An easy-to-use web interface for managing credential exchange with no code.

<p>It’s a commonplace nowadays that we live in an information age where society and the economy is increasingly driven by data. All you need for evidence of this is to look at the likes of Google and Facebook, companies that have embedded themselves into billions of peoples’ everyday lives. Or take a look at the increasingly fractious debate about who should be allowed to collect what data, how, for what purposes and whose&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>But actually we’re just at the beginning. At the very earliest stage. Why? Because the way that data is currently collected and used suffocates its true potential.</p><p>The unique and special thing about data is that it doesn’t get ‘used up’ when it is used. It can be used again and again. And it can be used by different people for different purposes. Your health data may be used by a doctor to help treat an illness for example, and by an insurance company to calculate your insurance premiums. You may use the data in your driving licence to prove that you are entitled to drive. A separate organisation may use it to help verify your identity.</p><p>Currently our entire data economy is organised around the assumptions of ‘OUOU’: that there is only One User of any piece of data that has been collected (the first ‘OU”) and there is only One Use for this data — the purpose they collected the data for (the second ‘OU’ of ‘one use’). This data system is almost 100% organisation-centric. It is organisations that collect and use data and they only use this data for their own purposes, jealousy guarding the data they collect, partly because for legal reasons if it is personal data, but also because they see this data as keys to their competitive edge and ability to make&nbsp;money.</p> From ‘OUOU’ to&nbsp;‘MUMU’ <p>Increasingly however, a new realisation is dawning: that data that was originally collected and used by a specific data controller for a specific purpose could be used by many other parties for many other purposes. As long as we live in an OUOU world the full potential of data can never be unleashed, because most users, and uses, of this data can never&nbsp;happen.</p><p>To unleash this potential, we need to move from OUOU to MUMU — many users, many&nbsp;uses.</p><p>Like the chick in the egg at a certain point the OUOU structures and assumptions that originally protected and nurtured data collection and use begin to constrain and suffocate it. For the data chick’s potential to be unleashed it has to break out of the OUOU shell to embrace MUMU&nbsp;instead.</p><p>You can see the MUMU trend everywhere we look, in issues relating to both personal and non-personal data. For example, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">new European Strategy for Data</a> has provisions to improve and increase data sharing between the public sector and business (government-to-business or G2B data sharing), between companies (business-to-business or B2B data-sharing), between businesses and government authorities (business-to-government or B2G data sharing), and between public authorities. It is developing strategies for increased data sharing in targeted industries such as automotive, financial services, health and Internet of&nbsp;Things.</p><p>Of course, citizen’s right to data portability is now enshrined in law via GDPR. Data sharing in one form or another is also an essential element of multiple initiatives including those to promote availability of Open Data, attempts to promote Open Banking and hot topics including so-called ‘Big Data’, AI, internet of things, smart cities and smart&nbsp;homes.</p><p>This shift from OUOU to MUMU represents a tectonic shift in the data economy. Its unfolding may be slow but it is also fundamental, structural, remorseless, relentless and unstoppable. the potential uses of data. And the more the idea ‘clicks’ in peoples’ minds (e.g. policy makers, regulators, innovators, entrepreneurs, opinion-formers as well as people like ourselves) the more unstoppable the pressure for MUMU&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>Looking back, once MUMU ways of collecting and using data have become the new normal, what we currently call ‘the ‘information age’ will seem extremely restricted, distorted and partial indeed, just as the age of steam seems extremely limited once viewed from the vantage point of an electrified society.</p><p>In their time, steam engines were dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact; widely seen as harbingers, symbols and catalysts of dramatic and far-reaching change. But ultimately, steam was a dead-end. When it was replaced by electricity — a far richer, more flexible, versatile, efficient, distributed way of accessing and using energy, economic growth really took&nbsp;off.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook are the steam engines of the information age. They, too, are dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact. But their OUOU nature means they don’t represent the MUMU&nbsp;future.</p> Multiple effects <p>MUMU will (is already having) multiple effects. Here are some of&nbsp;them.</p>  A growing increasing realisation that data storage needs to be separated from data use, with specialist organisations and institutions enabling the gathering, aggregation and storing data and helping specialist service providers access and use it for specific purposes. A central plank of the EU’s new data strategy for example is to “increase its pools of quality data available for use and re- use.” This is part of what it calls “a new data paradigm where less data will be stored in data centres, and more data will be spread in a pervasive way closer to the user ‘at the edge’ ”. Mydex is one of these specialist organisations.  The increasing importance of new mechanisms and enablers of safe, efficient data sharing. Well-formed APIs are an obvious example. They can help to turn a system of isolated data castles into a vibrant, pulsating nervous system driven by data sharing. But the development of new standards for the creation and use of metadata is also critically important along with data directories that act as signposts to where the data is held, and data inventories explaining what data is held by each&nbsp;party.  New forms of value and business model to go with these new approaches.  The collapse current notions of ‘private property’ which are of absolutist, binary, where something is either mine or yours. In its place: increased recognition of the importance of shared and divided rights and responsibilities with negotiated boundaries and&nbsp;limits.  Changes in value equations. Currently, in consumer/citizen facing services, the only value that matters relates to the content and quality of the service offered by a service provider. With the rise of MUMU, organisations will be increasingly expected to offer an added dimension of value: data. Citizens/customers will increasingly ask “what data has the service provider collected, generated or minted that I could use for other purposes elsewhere, outside of this relationship, with other parties?”   New dangers <p>The shift to MUMU won’t automatically usher in a new golden age of data sharing and use. Far from it. Predatory, parasitic and profiteering motives and strategies are likely to be inflamed even further, triggering new data land grabs that are even bigger, more vicious and more cynical than those we have yet seen. Sharks and opportunists will adopt ‘caring, sharing’ words to cover the real intentions. One example: Look at how new health data sets are being collated supposedly for the purpose of helping society tackle Covid-19, but actually represent power grabs and data monetisation. Beware also the new fashion for ‘data trusts’ which are already being eyed by some as a data land grab opportunity.</p> But also new opportunities <p>The existence of such threats makes Mydex’s work work even more important. We saw MUMU coming when we first launched 13 years ago. Everything we have done since has been designed to enable data sharing — to help MUMU happen in the realms of personal data — but only if it is safe and ethical, empowers citizens and ensures they realise the value of their own data. (That was our original slogan on formation: “helping individuals realise the value of their own&nbsp;data”.)</p><p>We’re getting closer to making it happen. With the work we have done for the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/03/06/what-are-smart-entitlements/">Scottish Government on its ‘Smart Entitlement’ strategy</a> we believe we have found a practical, doable way forward that achieves the goals of safety, efficiency and equity, and that helps unleash the full value of personal data for both individuals and the broader society and&nbsp;economy.</p><p>More on that&nbsp;soon.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">From OUOU to MUMU: why the real information age hasn’t even started yet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-mrowinska/">Katarzyna Kazimierczak-Mrowińska</a>, or Kasia to her friends and colleagues, is the COO of Authenteq. Not only does she oversee the day to day operations and operational functions of the business, but she’s also a new mom to two beautiful twins. We spoke to Kasia about juggling work and motherhood, what’s changed, and what she learned so far.<br></p>



<p></p>



 What led you to Authenteq and made you want to work in the KYC and identity verification space? 



<p>I worked indirectly with Authenteq through the company I worked with beforehand. I have a law degree but I never actively pursued any academic knowledge in the tech sector. I had been working in the tech industry for a few years, so when the GDPR passed in Europe and made <a href="https://authenteq.com/10-reasons-you-should-verify-identities/">privacy a much bigger topic to everyone</a>, I was able to get involved hands-on combing my skills.</p>



<p>The identity verification space has a lot to do with the law, new regulation and compliance, so for me, it was a way to build on the skills I already had and use my expertise, while continuing to learn. I’ve been able to watch as the law catches up, or tries to, to technology.</p>



 What do you like most about working at Authenteq? 



<p>It’s such an interesting industry and being a part of it as it evolves has been great. I have a lot of responsibilities, that are paired with a great level of autonomy to plan my own days and my schedule. Plus, the people at Authenteq are really incredible.&nbsp;</p>



 How would you describe the work culture at Authenteq? 



<p>I was always a fan of Scandinavian work culture and their seemingly perfect work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authenteq was established in Iceland, which is arguably one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Iceland#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20arguably%20one%20of%20the%20world's%20most%20gender%2Dequal,pay%20gap%20index%20since%202009.">world’s most gender-equal countries</a> in the world. It was listed as the number one best place to work by The Economist’s women index in 2016, has been named the most feminist country in the world, and has been listed number one on the World Economic Forum gender pay gap index since 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So having Scandinavian culture and women equality was the core of the culture, and we tried to translate that in the Berlin office as well. We are honest, transparent, and most importantly, we respect each other. Those are the most important principles within the team. Of course, a company is like a living body, it evolves and changes, people leave while new people join, so sometimes we struggle to keep that same level of culture, but I can say for sure that this is the best company I’ve ever worked with.&nbsp;</p>



 You are the mother of two beautiful twins. How did you manage your work while pregnant and what does your schedule look like today?&nbsp; 



<p>I was super supported when I was pregnant. My colleagues, many of whom I consider friends, brought me food, helped solve computer and software-related issues as I tried to work more from home. I left the office in August but continued working remotely, a few hours a day. I took September off and the twins were born in October.</p>



<p>The team has been as supportive of me coming back – that’s why I can efficiently juggle work and motherhood. Currently, I have set hours that align with my nanny’s schedule. It’s never an issue if I have to come in late or leave early, and meetings are scheduled around me, which is why I wanted fixed hours so that expectations could be set in both ways. It’s helpful for my teammates to know when I’ll be in and available and that it doesn’t change from week to week. The kids will be in Kita (Kindertagesstätte, or a nursery school for pre-school children) as of January so I’ll be back part-time as of February.&nbsp;</p>



 How do you balance motherhood and acting as the COO of a thriving startup in a fast-paced city?&nbsp; 



<p>A friend told me that if you work part-time, it will require the same amount of effort and energy as working full time, and I have found that to be helpful and true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have to be super focused at work because I know once I’m back at home with the kids, I can’t do any work until the babies are asleep. I also make sure I take time for myself. Every day I do some sort of sports or pilates. I took an online business course with <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/courses/core/">Harvard Business School</a> back in May so I would go from checking in at the office, back home to take care of the kids, put them to bed, exercise, and then study or do homework until midnight. It was crazy!</p>



 Has your leadership style changed since becoming a mother? 



<p>Now that I’m juggling more, I’m definitely more careful with my time. I plan better, attend fewer meetings, and I’m more organized in terms of my own agenda.&nbsp;</p>



 What’s been the most surprising thing about motherhood so far?&nbsp; 



<p>How patient I can be, and how little sleep I need to operate!</p>



 What are some tips or advice that you’d share with new moms going back to work after maternity leave?&nbsp; 



<p>Don’t try to be the best right away, just take your time and take time for yourself. No one is going to expect you to be operating at 100 percent as soon as you’re back, so don’t stress yourself out. Stress can have such negative impacts on your productivity and your mood, which is only going to make things harder at work, and harder at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would recommend taking fewer responsibilities at the beginning, starting with just one or two projects that you can manage on your own, with realistic deadlines. You’ll find your own rhythm as you ease back into your routine. It was really hard for me to focus the first four weeks after I had the twins, my mind was somewhere else, but slowly it got better and better. Never forget that work-life balance is key – that’s what makes juggling work and motherhood possible. Once you start building a family, your priorities will shift, and I promise you that you won’t regret a single day spent outside of the office to focus on them.&nbsp;<br></p>

The term “verifiable credentials” can seem a bit technical and overwhelming at first glance. But in reality, verifiable credentials are simpler than you think.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Start with what you know 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Let’s begin with the word “credential.” When we use the word credential, we are talking about any document, card, certificate, etc. that contains information about something. We use credentials every day, including driver’s licenses, passports, diplomas, insurance cards, medical test results, employee badges, and more.<br><br>All of these examples are physical, paper, or plastic credentials that you can hold in your hand. However, a credential becomes a verifiable credential once it is in a standard, digital format which you keep in your phone or the cloud. And that leads to our simple definition of verifiable credentials:</p> 
				 
				 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				Verifiable credentials are standardized, digital certificates that make it easy to share information online in a private and secure way.			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
				 
				 
					 <p>We say “standardized” because the way verifiable credentials should be built&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">has been standardized</a>&nbsp;by the internet’s leading standards body. That means there is a correct way to create a verifiable credential, and at Trinsic, we make it easy for you to do so.<br></p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The verifiable credential model 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>When it comes to using verifiable credentials, it important to know these three roles:<br><br></p>  Issuer: The issuer is the person or organization that creates the verifiable credential and gives (“issues”) it to a person, organization, or thing. (e.g., a DMV)  Holder: The holder is the person or organization that holds the verifiable credential in their digital wallet. (e.g., a person who receives a digital driver’s license from the DMV)  Verifier: The verifier is the person or organization that gets information shared with them. They can authenticate the information they receive instantaneously. (e.g., a security agent at the airport checking your license)  <p><br>Often called the “Trust Triangle,” the image below is a classic diagram used to help conceptualize the verifiable credential model.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>An important thing to note is that while the integrity of the information can be verified, the truthfulness of it cannot. So although the verifier needs to trust the source of the credential (ie., the issuer) it doesn’t need to contact the issuer directly in order to verify the information.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The unique properties 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Verifiable credentials are unique from other kinds of digital documents because they are:<br><br></p>  Portable: With just a few clicks, you can send the credential online to anyone you please. You can also move wallets between different providers if you’d like.  Verifiable: The reason why they are called verifiable credentials is because they allow you to verify the following things: 1) who issued the credential, 2) who the credential was issued to, 3) if the information within the credential has been tampered with, and 4) whether the credential has been revoked.  Private: Through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, you can pick and choose what information you want to share on a credential (you don’t have to share all of it).  Tamperproof: Verifiable credentials can’t be altered or forged.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic's role in all of this 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic is the best way to implement verifiable credentials.<br><br></p>  Simplicity:&nbsp;We make integrating verifiable credentials easy to do.&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a>&nbsp;removes all of the complexity of getting started, and our APIs abstract low-level protocols to help developers get going fast.

<p>Enterprise wants to focus on the value identity can bring beyond verified access.</p>
<p>Whilst reducing identity management compliance risk and storage costs, more organizations are giving customers their identity ownership back. They are using intelligent agents, real-time data updates and new conferred trust verification methods to leverage (consented-for) identity data insights for cross-sell and up-sell - and to better service customers, employees and partners.</p>
 
 
<p>Distributed graph technology is enabling this. It guarantees privacy, anonymity and security – ensuring no unauthorized access to any user data. And it solves blockchain scalability, compliance and speed limitations – offering data compliance for both organizations and their stakeholders. A million graph vaults for a million customers – not one database or ledger block holding a million customer records.</p>
<p>We'll explain why intelligence-driven identity verification, sovereign identity ownership and compliant identity security built from the bottom up can offer enterprise the value-add they seek.</p>

Now, a number of companies have been selected to work with DHS on implementing digital versions of identity documents such as the Permanent Resident Card (Green Card).

<p>The overall objective is to make use of SSI technologies in order to increase security and efficiency as well as user control and transparency. Another key parameter of the project is that all technical components must be interoperable and based on standardized interfaces.</p>

  <p>Many B2B technology and service providers approach go-to-market strategy in silos. First, they develop the product and identify the market segmentation, then they create sales and marketing strategies. But buyers increasingly expect more. They seek providers that offer the product they want through their desired purchase experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand and meet these needs, sales, product marketing and product management must work together to take a more complete view of their go-to-market strategies. Product marketing is in the right spot to take the lead on this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36456"]</p>
<p>“Greater integration places a premium on internal collaboration, customer experience and data-driven decision making,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/80790">Mark Stanyer</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “These are all disciplines that play to the strengths of experienced product marketers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, according to Stanyer, many providers take baby steps when it comes to taking a unified approach. What’s getting in the way?</p>

 Understand the role of product marketing in technology-centric and sales-centric cultures 
<p>Culture is often the single biggest factor in determining the actual roles and responsibilities of product marketing, which can vary widely between providers. This makes it difficult to align sales, marketing and product management and execute a common go-to-market strategy, especially when company culture favors a specific role.&nbsp;</p>
 Technology-centric culture 
<p>Here, the center of power is the product development organization. Product marketers are often viewed as tactical rather than strategic, mandated to focus on creating collateral, presentations, and sales enablement tools, and staffing booths at tradeshows. They have limited input into enhancements, roadmaps, creating new solutions and launches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales models are often product-led, where positioning and differentiation are based on technological superiority. This approach tends to work better when selling to IT as opposed to line-of-business buyers because the requirements are generally much more technical.</p>
 Sales-centric culture 
<p>Product marketing may have an even more limited role in a sales-centric culture. In this model, product marketing focuses on demand and lead generation, and creates some sales enablement tools. Because salespeople are the primary interface to the market, customer needs drive the product strategy. However, the market-led sales model often fails to be truly customer-centric, delivering what customers ask for rather than what they need.</p>
<p>As product marketing roles center on generating demand, they end up being filled by individuals without critical product marketing skills like storytelling, market analysis and customer engagement. There also tends to be a fairly frequent pivoting of storyline and product developments as sales chases big deals with specific requirements, thus confusing the message to the market.</p>
<p>Gartner has observed that this lack of expertise around messaging and positioning causes significant issues. Buyers can easily look elsewhere for alternatives more clearly targeted to their specific needs.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/technology-gms-adjust-your-product-strategies-and-vision-for-covid-19/">Adjust Your Product Strategies and Vision for COVID-19</a></p>
<p>To tackle these issues, make product marketing more strategic and expand its responsibility. Here are four actions product marketers can take to coordinate across teams and facilitate buyer-centricity into the go-to-market strategy.</p>
 1. Create consistent, compelling stories to drive high-performing content 
<p>It takes more than writing expertise or intimate knowledge of the product to develop effective messaging.</p>
<p>“The most compelling marketing stories are often the ones that are driven by product marketers, particularly those practitioners who have access to customers, prospects and salespeople,” Stanyer says.</p>
<p>Leverage your acute understanding of the market, the products, the customers and the competition to create a clear marketing story and a unique value proposition.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Focus on down-the-funnel conversions 
<p>Do more than drive activity at the top of the sales funnel. Ensure that leads are likely to convert into revenue and happy customers. By handing off responsibility for demand and lead generation, you can focus your expertise and knowledge on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-multichannel-marketing-to-generate-more-demand/">driving conversions</a>.</p>
 3. Become a key contributor to product strategy 
<p>Get more involved in gathering and prioritizing feature and enhancement requests. But don’t simply provide a laundry list of feedback to product management and product development. Frame the argument in terms of how it advances market leadership, offers competitive advantage and provides significant revenue opportunity.</p>
 4. Coordinate cross-team participation in key activities 
<p>Sales, marketing and product management should all be involved in segmentation, win/loss analysis and sales enablement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, although product marketing might have direct responsibility for win/loss analysis, sales has to be involved in the design and implementation of the process, and product management has to be committed to using the data to inform roadmap decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s very tempting to revert to cultural norms. Product marketing can use data to drive consensus and smart decision making, but cannot impose itself on others. It must demonstrate how it will create value across teams by, for example, becoming a “trusted” advisor to product management. Additionally, clear organizational ownership of specific objectives must be defined so each team knows each other’s responsibilities.</p>

 The GiD Report#121 — What we learned from the Big Tech antitrust hearing <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-120-how-persistent-identity-can-shape-better-online-communities-7ed6daaad889">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  What we learned from the antitrust hearing  Tiktok  Stuff happens   1. As everyone already knows by now, the big news of the week was the antitrust hearing in DC, attended by the Big 4 tech CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple. As is typical, these hearings are hardly conclusive. YouTube: House Judiciary<p>What’s atypical especially in our current political environment is to have something both sides can actually get together on and while they often came from different angles, there’s a general consensus that this conversation is super necessary.</p><p>And it’s the type of conversation that will help define competition, innovation, and even consumer preferences in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Let’s be clear. None of these companies are going anywhere. That was made readily apparent by <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-624bc8f7-fb1f-4c4e-9d39-5cf041af45a1.html">their earnings report the day after</a> (Google’s lackluster showing notwithstanding).</p><p>And frankly, they shouldn’t.</p><p>But this is certainly the beginning of a long term reorganization of a technological landscape. It might happen because of regulators taking bold action. It might happen because of consumers shifting their expectations and preferences. It might happen because of innovation emerging elsewhere. Whatever the case, it’s happening. It’s also necessary. We’ve learned plenty from this last cycle of Big Tech. We’ve gotten a lot out of it. And we’ve also learned some important lessons about the double edged sword that is progress.</p><p>So we also know we can do a little bit&nbsp;better.</p><p>Anyway, here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e24f4690-028f-4f39-9ba3-af1019b33b54.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>House lawmakers aired an enormous array of grievances with the CEOs of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple Wednesday, throwing everything in their arsenal at four of the most powerful men in the world for six hours, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Quick take: The antitrust hearing, which wandered far afield at times, didn’t nail a case that these companies are harmful monopolies. But the representatives succeeded in wringing some surprising admissions from the executives about how they wield their market power, providing ammunition for regulators now conducting investigations — and possibly a spur for Congress to strengthen antitrust law for the digital&nbsp;era.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook: Panel Democrats said the social network’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were plainly anticompetitive — that the company made the deals to stop Instagram from becoming a competitor to its main platform and WhatsApp from becoming a competitor to its messaging service. (CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had no idea the two would become such juggernauts when it bought&nbsp;them.)</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>All the companies, subcommittee chair David Cicilline said, have become bottlenecks for distribution, using their chokehold over data to surveil potential competitors and their control over technologies to extend their&nbsp;power.</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/scoring-the-tech-ceos-the-informations-tech-briefing">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Perhaps the most damning episodes of the hearing involved disclosure of internal company emails that appeared to support the politicians’ contention that the big tech companies used their size to squash competitors. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who represents the Seattle area, said Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom confided in an investor that he was worried Facebook would go into “destroy mode” if Instagram didn’t sell. — Martin&nbsp;Peers</blockquote><p>Cool NYU guy Scott Galloway provided <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/fire-fawning">a preview of events that outlined the sheer size of the entities that we’re dealing with</a> while also providing (much better) hypothetical questions to grill our favorite tech&nbsp;bosses.</p><p>Check out these&nbsp;charts:</p><p>Likewise, new efforts to take on the titans has&nbsp;waned:</p><p>Of course, on the surface, it’s pretty clear that Tech has gotten monstrously Big, while crowding out new entrants with their sheer scale — sometimes underhandedly.</p><p>But maybe the positive slant is also just how much tech has transformed our economy and our lives in the last few decades — that seismic shift from the physical to the digital, data now overtaking Oil as the greatest modern value proposition.</p><p>To put it plainly, this is well and truly the tech&nbsp;era.</p><p>The difference here though — say, compared to a time when the biggest companies were sucking petroleum out of the ground is that tech is malleable. There are constraints in the physical world that govern how things are played. In the digital one, there’s a lot more room to define the rules of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>That’s what this next chapter will be all about. How do we rewrite those rules in a way that optimizes incentives and balances power for individuals and communities — from both a regulatory and platform perspective. And consumers will have choices to make as certain core values come to the&nbsp;fore.</p><p>The thing is, we’ve watched this movie&nbsp;before.</p><p>There were a lot of kings back in the day. Today, there are still some kings. But there’s also a lot more democracy.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/scoring-the-tech-ceos-the-informations-tech-briefing">Scoring the Tech CEOs: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-marshals-a-right-leaning-army-of-allies-for-antitrust-fight-155d5760-86d4-4ce0-9cda-734dbc95e252.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Big Tech marshals a right-leaning army of allies for antitrust fight</a>  <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/fire-fawning">Fire &amp; Fawning | No Mercy / No&nbsp;Malice</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-boycotters-lobby-lawmakers-on-antitrust-4816702f-e9bc-41ae-a2c4-1201e65873cd.html">Scoop: Facebook boycotters lobby lawmakers on antitrust</a>  <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=3113&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 6: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and&nbsp;Google</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/house-antitrust-investigation-documents/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Secret documents from US antitrust probe reveal big tech’s plot to control or crush the competition — TechCrunch</a>   2.

					 <p>In response to COVID-19, businesses and industries around the world have had to reduce spending and cut costs in order to continue operating. This has led to businesses being reluctant to hire new employees and unfortunately having to lay off employees. Recent college graduates and youth are having to navigate this difficult economic situation as they search for employment.</p><p><br>In Africa, these difficulties are magnified by the pre-existing high unemployment rate among African youth. <a href="https://www.yoma.africa">Yoma</a> is a platform that uses verifiable credentials to help African youth build up their digital CV and find employment that matches their skills. Although Yoma and its benefits were relevant and needed before the pandemic, the economic impacts of COVID-19 have only increased the platform’s effectiveness for African youth.</p><p><br>Below is the interview we had with Lohan Spies, the individual responsible for integrating verifiable credentials into the Yoma platform using the Trinsic platform.</p>

					 <p>I have been a co-founder of various cybersecurity and blockchain-based ventures in digital identity and personal data protection. I am also the Chair of the Sovrin Steward Council and an ex-officio Board of Trustees member at the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>. My passion and motivation are to leverage the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> stack to develop solutions that will have a profound and lasting impact on humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My latest venture, <a href="http://www.didx.co.za/">DIDx</a>, focuses on SSI and is a <a href="https://sovrin.org/stewards/">Founding Steward</a> of the Sovrin Network and a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/members/">Founding Contributing Member</a> of the Trust over IP Foundation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is Yoma? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Globally, one out of five young people between the ages of 15-24 live in Africa and are largely underemployed or at worst, are unemployed. According to the African Development Bank, youth unemployment occurs at a rate that is more than twice of that for adults in most African countries. Many of these individuals are unable to secure jobs due to a lack of education, experience, and financial means. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of decent job opportunities that could use employees to their full potential in most African countries. Skills needed in Sub-Saharan Africa are shifting, and the region’s educational system is underprepared, resulting in a skills mismatch between the skills being acquired and those required by companies.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our aim is to unlock the youth’s potential across the African continent and beyond by integrating privacy-preserving personalized learning pathways across the <a href="https://www.yoma.africa/">Yoma platform</a>. Yoma, a youthagency marketplace, aims to use AI to match youth with individualized learning pathways, impact tasks to positively contribute to their community, and jobs based on their aspirations and psychometric profile. Youth are incentivized to participate via a digital token that can be redeemed in a physical or intellectual marketplace. Each individual youth has a digital identity wallet that contains their engagement and certificates, thus building a digital CV that is verifiable through blockchain technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The Yoma marketplace brings together youth, NGOs/grassroots organizations, governmental youth agencies, social impact investors, corporate, SMEs, educational providers, and more. Yoma is supported by a strong group of collaborators such as <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a>, <a href="https://www.didx.co.za/">DIDx</a>, <a href="https://rlabs.org/">Rlabs</a> and <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/">Cartedo</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A brief explainer video of Yoma can be found below.</p>

					 <p>The Yoma concept was relevant prior to the COVID-19 crisis but given the disproportionate impact on young people’s learning and employment, there is an even greater need for a solution like Yoma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the pathways into the Yoma platform was via a COVID-19 <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/project/8/covid-19-challenge">UNICEF innovation challenge</a> implemented by <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/sign_in">Cartedo</a>, an online design thinking platform. Users who completed the challenge were redirected to the Yoma platform to acquire their certificate of completion. This UNICEF innovation challenge aimed to support youth agency during the COVID-19 pandemic through critical soft-skill development and by identifying high potential individuals whose ideas could be supported and developed further. The core goals for the challenge were to: 1) Give youth a voice, 2) Provide access to credible information, 3) Drive awareness around COVID-19, 4) Develop critical soft skills and future-readiness, and 5) Enhance employability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge was well received with 85,000 youth showing interest, 35,000 starting the challenge, and 9,500 who completed the challenge. For all youth that completed the challenge, Yoma issued a verifiable credential as a proof of completion and as the first verifiable credential added to their verifiable, digital CV.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An explainer video of the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge can be found below.</p>

					 <p>Trinsic provides a full-stack self-sovereign identity platform leveraged by Yoma. Yoma currently makes use of the cloud wallet and credentialing APIs to provide youth with digital identity wallets into which Yoma issues verifiable credentials to develop their verifiable, digital CVs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The speed of implementation required by Yoma made Trinsic a preferred choice as most of the hard work is already done and ready for consumption. Future iterations of the Yoma ToIP stack implementation will be focused on a blended approach where Trinsic and open-source SSI components will be made available to Yoma ecosystem partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We decided to develop on the Sovrin Network as it was purpose-built to solve the pressing problem of SSI. DIDx has a long history of working with Sovrin, and it was the obvious and preferred choice of technology for us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Yoma might spin up its own Indy network in the future, and ongoing analysis will contribute to our long-term strategy and decision-making. For the foreseeable future, Trinsic and the Sovrin Network are a part of our technology stack.</p>

					 <p>In addition to our success with the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge, Yoma recently won the joint <a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/smartdevelopmenthack/winners/">EU/BMZ #SmartDevelopmentHack</a> to accelerate the development and adoption of Yoma with <a href="https://www.atingi.org/">atingi</a> as an ecosystem partner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Future challenges are already planned and will soon launch on Yoma, spanning multiple countries with increased access to opportunities for youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the COVID-19 crisis, the concept and value of the Yoma platform is more relevant than ever, and implementation must be accelerated. Therefore, as part of the #SmartDevelopmentHack, the Yoma initiative has committed to reaching 1.5M youth within 24 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(End of interview)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are an African youth interested in building your digital CV through the Yoma platform, <a href="https://app.yoma.africa/auth/create-account">get started</a> by creating a Yoma account.

<p>When e-cigarettes first hit the market, they were touted as a less nicotine intensive alternative to cigarettes and as a way to help those struggling to quit to make the leap. As with any new popular innovation, opportunist players entered the field, bringing along with them counterfeit products and youth-targeted marketing tactics. <br><br>According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44295336">BBC and Euromonitor</a>, the number of vapers increased from seven million in 2011 to 41 million by 2018. They project that this number will grow to 55 million globally by next year. As the world leader in the tobacco sector, every major tobacco company utilizes <a href="https://www.hauni.com/de/home/">Hauni</a> equipment, and as they watched the market’s exponential growth materialize before their eyes, they chose to use their position within the industry to push for stricter guidelines and safer products to protect minors.</p>



 Hauni for consumer safety 



<p>The Hauni Vaping Technologies team saw a few key issues happening in the space, including the refilling of pods with illegal liquids, the use of flavors that appealed to younger people, and the teen vaping epidemic in the US. Dangerous open tank systems and faulty devices were the cause of over 2,000 hospitalizations last year, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>



<p>“The industry’s big players are serious about consumer safety but because it’s a regulated product, it’s difficult to solve the problem,” says Dr. Joseph Capone, the Digital Program Manager. “We said ‘Look, if we’re going to do e-cigarettes then we’re going to do right.’ That’s when we reached out to Authenteq about integrating into the app, to give users the ability to not only control their vaping experience but also to give us the ability to secure the whole experience.”</p>



 Nicotine industry, innovation, and age verification 



<p>Nicotine is classified as a tobacco substance meaning that e-cigarette manufacturers have to go through the whole battery of tests, both lengthy and expensive, that pharmaceutical companies do because nicotine is technically a pharmaceutical product.</p>



<blockquote><p>“That’s one reason why there’s been little innovation in the sector since 2014. The products on the market today are pretty much all the same because they base themselves on an approved product. It’s very difficult to get approval for a new product and it’s very expensive bringing this kind of product to market because you need approval in every country.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>In addition to building an automatable, fully digital, and less harmful product, the Vaping Technologies team has been leveraging data to create in-depth profiles. They analyze 40 different data points per puff. Some of these data points, including preheat time, energy time, and total voltage are designed to enhance the user’s vaping experience. Other data points like pressure and puff duration are crucial to restricting minors from using the products. A female, or younger user, inhales less deeply than a heavy smoker or a healthy man, according to their data. By comparing and analyzing these different interdependent data points, unique user profiles are created as are generational unique profiles.</p>



<p>“Teenagers are really smoking because they think it’s cool, not because they need a nicotine hit,” says Capone. “Teenagers vape much differently than somebody who was a smoker and has switched to vaping. They are doing what is called grazing. Their puff count or frequency is very high, and the puff volume is very small.”</p>



<p>“A smoker who has switched and is an adult will puff five to seven seconds, take a 30-second break, and then take another five to seven second inhale,” he continues. “This puff topography is very unique to each person but also unique for different segments. Of course, it’s all statistical but if we’re 92 percent accurate, it’s better to turn off a device when we suspect it’s a teenager then to allow a teenager to vape.”</p>



 Leading the change to protect minors 



<p>The legislation that has been enacted thus far focuses solely on the purchasing of e-cigarettes, but Capone and his team think that usage must be monitored and legislated in order to truly protect minors. As more consumers look to purchase these devices online, imbuing age, and identity at the very beginning of the process is the only way to ensure this. <a href="https://authenteq.com/authenteq-identity-verification/">Authenteq’s age and identity verification</a> are integrated into their app for precisely this reason, meaning that a user must verify themselves before a device can even be activated. Once verified, if the device usage deviates from the user’s profile, a spot ID check is mandated. If the identity does not match the ID used to activate the device, it is disabled.</p>



<p>Authenteq and Hauni’s Vaping Technologies team are also looking at further protection measures, including the possibility of incorporating lip imprints into the user profile.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lip print is just like a fingerprint. It’s unique to every person and it never changes throughout your entire life. If we could manage to map a groove pattern, a lip signature could be created so that only that person who activates it can ever use it.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>Capone sees the progress they’ve made as applicable to other industries as well. The technology they’ve built is not exclusive to vaping liquids and could be implemented for asthma inhalers and CBD or THC devices used for therapeutic purposes. Identity verification can validate users, but also match users to the proper prescriptions. In addition to protecting minors and preventing misuse, there is also general risk mitigation in these methods.</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lot of organizations have no idea what is possible today in the areas of identity and age verification, they don’t realize what is possible with data now to identify early indicators of substance abuse or addiction. The whole vice sector needs more information about technologies that are available.”</p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>The wearables don’t collect or process any data, and they don’t track where the wearer has been. The result is a wearable that enables the employer to provide employees both safety and privacy without having to trade one for the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trade-off would be, how much do we invade privacy to offer a certain level of safety?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While balancing safety, productivity and privacy — three goals seemingly at odds — creates dilemmas for employers, there are ways to achieve all three without trade-offs.</p>
<p>“Take privacy versus safety for example,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/61755">Bart Willemsen</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “The trade-off would be, how much do we invade privacy to offer a certain level of safety? It's making a concession between both values. It would actually be better to try and fulfill both values.”</p>

<p>As employees return to work, employers are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-ethical-data-collection-during-pandemics/">collecting more data</a> to ensure both safety and productivity. By taking a risk-based approach, which considers what data is being collected and how it’s being used, organizations can<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-technology-can-curb-the-spread-of-covid-19/"> protect employees</a> while managing privacy risk.</p>
<p>“The higher the risk, the more important it is to justify that a particular solution is indeed balanced and proportional to the risk we are assessing,” says Willemsen.</p>
<p>Here are six principles to guide risk-based employee data collection.</p>
 No. 1: Purposeful processing 
<p>If you do decide to collect data, make sure it has a predefined purpose. Once data has fulfilled its purpose, there’s no reason to keep collecting and storing it. Removing data can also lead to significant cost savings for the organization when it comes to storage.</p>
 No. 2: Proportionality 
<p>Default to the least invasive measure possible to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">satisfy your goals</a>. Once a measure becomes disproportional to the risk or the purpose can be achieved in a different way, remove it.</p>
 No. 3: Subsidiarity 
<p>Ask yourself, what amount of data is enough? Can you achieve the same purpose with less personal data or without processing personal data at all? Only collect the minimum amount necessary.</p>

 No. 4: Transparency 
<p>Don't do anything in the dark. Be abundantly clear to staff what data you collect, for what purposes and who has access to it.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/are-your-new-remote-workers-visible-to-security-operations/">Are Your New Remote Workers Visible to Security Operations?</a></p>
 No. 5: Mandatory or not 
<p>Apply measures equally for all staff to prevent discrimination and protect autonomy.</p>
 No. 6: Risk-based 
<p>Make decisions in light of the risks you are trying to mitigate, and acknowledge that decisions are subject to change. Don’t hesitate to retrace steps taken early and adjust accordingly as things change.</p>
<p>When it comes to returning to the workplace, every decision leads to a certain risk. Following these principles equips employers to assess and mitigate privacy risk by making decisions based on the current situation and continue to measure the relevance of decisions as conditions change.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>MITRE recently published the detailed results of their second round of tests. This test pitted APT29 malware and methods against <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/evaluations.html?round=APT29" title="Cybersecurity Vendors">21 cybersecurity vendors</a>. The MITRE testing is an excellent benchmark for comprehensively exercising Endpoint Protection (EPP) and Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) tools in real-world scenarios where organizations find themselves under attack by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). MITRE describes the environments, methodology, and operation flow of their testing regime in great detail <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/" title="Mitre testing regime">here</a>. The raw results are available for review, and they have created a <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/data_analysis_tool.html" title="data analysis">tool to help with data analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the participating vendors have analyzed and posted their interpretations of this latest round of testing. In general, each vendor’s internal analysis tends to focus on their areas in which they do well. In this article, we will call out the most serious of the commonly missed detections of specific procedures in the framework.</p>
<p>There was a wide range in the success rates experienced by vendors, with higher success rates equating to low values for missed detections. As expected, there is a fairly strong correlation between a vendor’s product having specific techniques for detection of procedures and steps in the ATT&amp;CK framework and catching a would-be malicious actor utilizing those actions.</p>
<p>The ATT&amp;CK framework features a matrix of 11 tactics and 171 techniques that adversaries use to conduct a cyber-attack. MITRE has just released an <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/" title="MITRE update">updated version</a> of the ATT&amp;CK framework which contains sub-techniques. The techniques and sub-techniques depicted generally relate to application or system level API and/or procedure calls. Legitimate software including operating systems use these API and system calls to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. This is what makes the job of anti-malware and other security tools difficult: they must distinguish the “intent” of the calling code. For example, encrypting files is most often a legitimate operation to protect data. However, ransomware also attempts to encrypt files. How does anti-malware decide to allow some operations to proceed and stop others?</p>
 What is the code’s intent? 
<p>Intent can be discerned by context. Context can be probabilistically inferred by looking at the calling process: which user account launched it, how long has it been running, have other processes injected it, what other calls precede or follow it in the queue, etc. Security vendors build detection models using analysis of code and memory enhanced by Machine Learning (ML) to make these kinds of determinations. Security tools are also informed by collections of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</p>
<p>The following list of techniques are those which many vendor products were not able to detect in the latest round of MITRE testing, and those which we consider the most consequential if exploited.</p>
 Missed detections 
 
 Sandbox evasion techniques such as checking BIOS, manufacturer, model, version 
 Attempts to use PowerShell to get system, domain, logged-on username, running processes, anti-malware presence, and endpoint firewall status 
 Reconnaissance of lateral assets using PowerShell 
 Manipulation of access token for PowerShell 
 Enumerating files in directories commonly used for user data; enumerating media files 
 Enumerating registry keys 
 Capturing screenshots and clipboard contents (lesser instances of keylogging) 
 Decryption of Chrome browser username and password databases 
 Creation of pre-exfiltration staging directories 
 Simple attempts to encrypt C2 traffic using standard crypto techniques 
 Reading user files, while connected to C2 
 Encryption of user data files 
 Exfiltration over non-standard TCP ports 
 Exfiltration over HTTPS 
 Establishment of persistence via javavmtsup 
 
 Recommendations for vendors 
<p>Threat actors are constantly improving and adapting to innovations in security products. Thus, security products with deficiencies in detecting items on the preceding list should focus on:</p>
 
 Anti-evasion: malware detonation sandboxes are standard features in EPP and NDR products, but they can’t help if malware is designed to lay dormant if it can figure out that it’s in a sandbox. Sandbox evasion used to be limited to the most sophisticated malware, but it has become more of a commodity feature. 
 PowerShell scrutiny: PowerShell is a powerful and useful tool, as its name implies. However, given the massive proliferation of file-less malware that uses PowerShell (as a means to avoid detection by signature-based and static file scanners), security solutions must scrutinize every invocation by pulling more context for deeper examination. 
 Recon and lateral movement: APT actors learned to go low and slow to avoid setting off SIEM alerts. Extending data retention periods can make it easier to group what may seem to be outliers into suspicious incidents. For example, seemingly random enumeration requests over long periods may point to a concerted effort to map resources. 
 Secure the browser username/password database. Users often rely on browsers for generating, storing, and protecting credentials. Besides data exfiltration by APTs, insecure browser password databases can lead to Account Takeovers (ATOs) for users’ personal information. 
 Stop staging: Users don’t often move and rename data files, then package it all up to be sent elsewhere. 
 Lock down comms: Applications sending traffic on non-standard ports and/or to suspicious IPs should send up red flags, even if the traffic volume is very low. Continuously updated high quality threat intelligence can mitigate this risk. 
 Encryption scrutiny: Ransomware is still rampant. While many garden varieties can be interdicted by most security tools, ransomware authors are also evolving their tools to defeat ransomware protection. For example, some ransomware groups use APT tactics of making an initial silent compromise, surveying enterprise assets, staging the malicious payloads in various places around the target environment, then simultaneously detonating them to limit the effectiveness of anti-ransomware prevention and detection techniques. Some security tools need to view ransomware in the same way as APTs and combine detection and prevention methods to help at-risk clients. 
 
<p>The good news is that several endpoint and network security vendors did very well in this run of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation. We have noted this in our latest research: <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response/" title="Market Compass Endpoint Protection">Market Compass Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response</a>. While the MITRE test is significant in that it covers EPP and EDR, it is only a single test. There are other independent test regimes that should be considered when evaluating endpoint security solutions. If your organization is considering upgrading or replacing EPP or EDR, or adding Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), KuppingerCole can assist with reviewing your requirements and crafting an RFP based on our up-to-date research. Also, for cybersecurity vendors that need help in prioritizing their product or service roadmaps, we can provide tailored advisory services as well.

<p>“Cicero accuses Catiline” 8 November 63 BC, a painting by Cesare Maccari (Public Domaine)</p>



<p>This is the third in the series on the paradigm shift
to a digital state. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">Part 1</a>, I pointed out that no
pillar of government is going to remain untouched. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">Part 2</a>, I showed how the technology
of elections is changing. And in this article, I look at how law-making is going
digital.</p>



<p>Rome, 63 BC</p>



<p>There were no physical
distancing measures in the Roman Senate in the session depicted in this
painting. The scene here is of Cicero delivering the breaking news that he had
uncovered a shocking plot by Catiline to bring down the government of the Roman
Empire. Catiline’s motive was that he thought he would be able to have his
debts, and those of his supporters, cancelled in the ensuing chaos. Even in ancient
Rome, not everyone in power was a stable genius.</p>



<p>In that story we find that
the “checks and balances” against power worked – but only in the nick of time,
and only because the legislators were able to meet physically. Had the
legislators been hiding at home in a lockdown imposed by the executive, things
might have turned out differently.</p>



<p>Other cities, 2020 AD</p>



<p>Fast-forward to the
year 2020. What grand painting about today’s legislatures might be left to
posterity? At the very least, an empty chamber. Despite our advanced digital
societies, our legislators were unable to meet at the height of the pandemic.
For a while, there were few formal “checks and balances” on executive power.
It’s not that the legislators couldn’t arrange a conference call among
themselves – they all have access to phones and computers; and it’s not that
parliaments do not adopt the latest technology – they have already switched
from candles to electric lights; it’s just that their protocols were not
written for the digital age. </p>



<p>The existing protocols
were handed down from an era when grand halls with marble floors and tall columns
defined gravitas and power – like in the painting above. </p>



<p>What would happen to a
bank that doesn’t offer e-banking and insists that its customers have to come
into a branch? What would happen to a stock exchange that doesn’t permit
electronic trading and insists that trading should be done on the marble
trading floor? Would they not become irrelevant? </p>



<p>Can there be any doubt
that parliaments might now look to tweak their protocols to be able to function
during future pandemics? Can there be any doubt that parliaments might now look
to move away from the Roman model from 63 BC? </p>



<p>On that there can be
no doubt. Here is an overview of some of the parliamentary upgrades being worked
on for the digital age. These measures are defined in terms of increasing
citizenship involvement and are not sequenced, i.e. they can run in parallel.</p>



<p>Level 1 upgrade:
remote voting for legislators</p>



<p>The parliamentary votes by legislators on legislation are usually not secret, which makes the votes personally and publicly knowable and auditable. This transparency makes it easier to quickly set up remote voting systems for members of parliament. The picture below shows one such remote voting application by the e-Government firm, Procivis AG.</p>







<p>Source: A remote
voting application for legislators designed by Procivis AG.</p>



<p>In cases where members
of parliament are required to vote in secret (see some examples <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/dt/562/562487/562487en.pdf">here</a>), we face the same
hurdles that a remote electronic voting system needs to meet, including the
ability of each voter to verify that their vote was actually cast and delivered
as intended. Some of the considerations in such an upgrade are discussed <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Level 2 upgrade: more differentiated
voting options</p>



<p>In the digital age,
parliaments are struggling to reflect the preferences of increasingly diverse
societies. Survey after survey reveals that voters are not very happy with
their legislature. From the sample data in Figure 1 – for Argentina, Australia,
Chile, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the United States – the percentage
of people who say they have a “great deal” of confidence in their national
legislature ranges from a low of 0.4% (Egypt) to a high of 3.8% (Australia). </p>



<p>Figure 1: Legislatures in trouble</p>



<p>% of respondents saying they have “a great deal” of confidence in their national legislature [1]</p>







<p>Such widespread unhappiness with a legislature is not a new phenomenon, of course, but it is potentially destabilising. When democracies were imploding in Europe in the 1930s, Friedrich August von Hayek&nbsp;(1899-1992), who won the Nobel Prize for economics, tried to understand why the shift away from democracy was occurring. Hayek’s conclusion was that “it is the ineffectiveness of parliamentary majorities with which the people are dissatisfied…the higher the education and intelligence of individuals becomes, the more their views and tastes are differentiated and the less likely they are to agree on a particular hierarchy of values.”[2]</p>



<p>There are numerous ideas how to better align
parliamentary outcomes to what the people want. One solution is to change what
people vote on and how they allocate their votes. By giving voters a
“voting budget”, they can allocate their votes according to their preferences.
One such method is called “quadratic voting” and was tested in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">experiment</a> for real legislation in the United
States. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving voters (both members of parliament as well as
the public) more differentiated options becomes easier if the technology is a custom-built
digital voting application, as opposed to a pen and paper. As with any proposal
to tweak voting arrangements, there will always be pros and cons, and it will
be for each democracy to decide what trade-offs they are prepared to accept in
order to best align legislative outcomes with what the people want.</p>



<p>We also know that trust in parliament is highest when people
are satisfied with their democracy (figure 2). We cannot expect voters to be
satisfied with their democracy when every time they go and vote, the policy
outcomes of the newly elected legislature and executive do not sufficiently represent
their preferences. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 2: The correlation between satisfaction with democracy and trust in parliament [3]</p>







<p>Level 3 upgrades:
Hybrid systems</p>



<p>Legislatures are
slowly but surely being “disintermediated”, in other words, they are losing
their erstwhile prime real estate monopoly in the capital city as their clients
go online. In practice, this means that at all three levels of government
(national or federal, state or provincial, and local or municipal) people are increasingly
getting involved directly in the business of initiating, drafting and even
approving legislation. Details about these trends can be found under concepts
such as the “<a href="https://procivis.ch/2019/05/21/technology-and-citizen-participation-%EF%BB%BF/">crowd-sourcing of legislation</a>” and “<a href="https://procivis.ch/2019/03/22/how-to-spend-it-a-focus-on-participatory-budgeting/">participatory budgeting</a>” –
both links here include examples, from Madrid to New York City, and from
Finland to Brazil.</p>



<p>Concluding thoughts</p>



<p>Just as this pandemic
has greatly accelerated structural changes that were already under way in the
private sector (such as the move to the home office), the same thing is
happening with regard to citizen interaction with the state: you don’t have to
leave your home. The power shifts are even more radical in democracies: you can
now govern from your lockdown.</p>



<p>Of course, not
everyone is happy with these trends – and some even fear them – but the point
is that digitalization is making them easier and easier. These developments are,
in any case, as unstoppable as the move away from the definition of power
captured in the painting above: white men in togas. </p>



<p>There is no getting
away from the central question, though: In the digital age, how can we better align legislatures with the
people’s priorities? Some states will actually figure this out and get it
right. It is inconceivable that this won’t involve more power to the people as
well as new digital forms of interaction between citizens and their
legislature. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next article, Part 4, I’ll look at the digitalization of state-issued money and the implications for financial governance in the digital age.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-successful-chinese-companies-adapted-to-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>has revolutionized the way people work. To maintain the safety and well-being of the workforce, the majority of organizations across the world have adopted a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-lead-better-remote-meetings/">remote work culture.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accurate expectation-setting and transparency of data are key to build mutual trust and lead successful remote teams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gartner research shows that organizations with high levels of trust increase their average employee engagement by 76% over those with low levels of trust. Managers must establish mutual trust to build successful remote teams.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
  Be transparent 
<p>Managers often worry about the lack of visibility in the workflows and routines of their remote direct reports. Create a transparent system of performance measurement that quantifies outcomes, not just activities or the amount of time spent on tasks. Accurate expectation-setting and transparency of data are key to build mutual trust and lead successful remote teams.</p>
  Be accessible and responsive 
<p>Remote working may trigger feelings of isolation and not being unnoticed. Prioritize employees' needs when they are stuck on a project and they require your feedback to progress. Be clear on what communication tools you prefer to use, share your availability frequently and organize regular scheduled calls for everyone. Communicate a response time when acknowledging a request and encourage others to do the same.</p>
  Create team profiles to increase engagement 
<p>Remote working has put pressure on teamwork and camaraderie. Some companies have started creating groups to share coffee chats and pictures, and using apps like Houseparty to organize virtual pizza team parties, farewells and welcomes. They have also accepted other forms of virtual social interactions using apps like Prelude, VirtuWall, QuizBreaker, Kahoot and Water Cooler Trivia to increase engagement among team members.</p>
<p>Have team members create profiles of their personal interests, hobbies and development areas so that employees who have the same interests can share photos and conversations that ultimately foster friendship and enhance collaboration with work colleagues.&nbsp;</p>
  Maintain confidentiality 
<p>As employees work remotely, they continue to have the same obligations to maintain the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-communicate-important-covid-19-data/">confidentiality of personal data</a>, client information and all third-party work. Agree on norms for what information can be shared outside the team and what access control is required.</p>
  Assess progress proactively 
<p>Remote workers can feel sidelined or isolated, which can affect the progress of their workload. Proactively ask your staff if they are facing challenges in advancing their projects or are unable to prioritize their work. Ask if they need extra support and assistance. You can easily detect signs of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/manage-employee-stress-with-flexibility-and-transparency/">anxiety and stress in the office</a>, but remotely it is more difficult to discern. Therefore, you need to be more proactive and understanding.</p>
  Recognize the team 
<p>In a remote working culture, visual signs of recognition are nonexistent. Managers must appeal to the most intimate needs for recognition of human beings. Identify what the employee is seeking — achievement, status or affiliation.</p>
 
 If the need for achievement prevails, recognize their good work by engaging them in challenging projects. 
 If the need for status prevails, involve the person in a prestigious project, let them lead a working group or engage them in a project sponsored by top management 
 If the need for affiliation prevails, involve them in a project or product that is not working well because of tensions between team members.

<p>We used to send long letters by airmail to keep in touch with friends overseas. Today, we stay connected electronically with free messaging that takes just an instant to send. While the tools we use to stay in touch have evolved over time, other ways such as the process of sending gifts, can still be an expensive, slow process.</p>



<p>Now, an easy new option for sending a gift to keep in touch recently became available with Civic Wallet. You may now send small virtual gifts to friends and family in the form of crypto. The process is fast, so compared to other methods of sending money, or even shipping something physical, gift-giving with crypto has become a much easier option. Whether your friends use Civic Wallet or another digital wallet, sending and receiving crypto is nearly instant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, the crypto you hold in Civic Wallet is protected by a <a href="https://www.civic.com/faq/#coincover">$1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee</a> (<a href="https://www.coincover.com/terms-and-conditions">full terms &amp; conditions</a>). If your friends are receiving money via Civic Wallet, they are also covered by the guarantee.</p>



 



 How to send crypto from your Civic Wallet to a friend’s Civic Wallet 



<p>There are two ways to send funds to a friend who is receiving it via Civic Wallet:</p>



<p>By username</p>



  



<p>Select the digital currency you’d like to send. Tap the Send icon and enter your friend’s username. Once you locate the username, enter the payment amount, and press Confirm &amp; Send.</p>



<p>By QR code</p>



<p>The second way to send crypto works if you are physically in the same room as the recipient.</p>



  Your friend begins by selecting the currency they’d like to receive in their wallet and tapping the Receive icon to generate a QR code on the next screen.  Open your Civic Wallet, tap the green Scan button on the bottom of the screen.  Scan your friend’s QR code using your phone, and enter the payment amount.  



 



 How to send crypto from your Civic Wallet to a friend outside of the Civic network 



<p>The last way to send currency is directly to an address, which varies by currency type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By receiving address</p>



  



  Your friend should begin by opening their digital wallet and locating their receiving address. From here, your friend should copy the receiving address and text it to you.  Next, open your Civic Wallet and tap the Send icon for the crypto you’d like to send. Paste in the receiving address, enter the payment amount, and press Confirm &amp; Send.

  While digitalization is a major challenge for all kinds of enterprises, it is particularly hard for medium sized enterprises. For many years, medium sized enterprises have struggled to deploy Identity Management as well as Identity Governance (IGA) solutions and show true business value and a return on investment. This is largely due to the complexity of implementation and the level of configuration and customization to fulfill the requirements. As a result, many companies have deployed Access Management solutions like single sign-on only to find that while great for user convenience, they bring little to the table for proper lifecycle management and governance.

<p>In contrast to common perception, app security testing doesn’t always have to be a heavy investment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-ways-to-quickly-reduce-it-costs/">reduced IT budgets</a> meant that chief information security officers (CISOs) had to cut costs and compromise on risk management programs. One area of focused budget cuts was application security testing, an expensive but imperative part of the process.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-security-and-risk-leaders-can-prepare-for-reduced-budgets/">How Security and Risk Leaders Can Prepare for Reduced Budgets</a></p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Security testing helps identify vulnerabilities early on in the application development process,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/62770/Mark-Horvath">Mark Horvath</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “However, CISOs find it difficult to justify the costs of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/future-proof-application-strategy/">application</a> security testing. Compromising on this step can have serious implications, and it is important to not skip it.”</p>
<p>In contrast to common perception, app security testing doesn’t always have to be a heavy investment. CISOs can consider these seven tips to conduct security testing effectively without putting a strain on their budgets.</p>
 Include security experts in the architectural review at the start of development 
<p>Early testing minimizes the cost of fixing software defects. Including security experts at an early stage of development helps identify the gaps in security and remediate the risks. Organizations can avoid remodeling and remediation efforts if threats are mitigated at the very beginning.</p>
<p>Threat modeling is an expensive exercise, but in many cases can be done internally with free downloadable software. This is not restricted to new applications and can be extended to existing software, too. Especially when existing software is being repurposed or exposed as web services, a structured assessment of the risks and scenarios where an application can be attacked offers the opportunity to create test cases.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-9-security-and-risk-trends-for-2020/">Gartner Top 9 Security and Risk Trends for 2020</a></p>
 Select affordable testing options when budgets are reduced 
<p>In scenarios where budget constraints are a big hurdle to security testing, CISOs can benefit from affordable and open-source options. While these alternatives are often incomplete in terms of language, framework and vulnerability coverage, and functionality, with the appropriate customization and plug-ins, they can enable an effective application security program with minimal resources.</p>
<p>The free software doesn’t come with enterprise functionality such as dashboards, comprehensive reporting, distributed scanning sensors or plug-ins to integrate into the software development life cycle. However, internal experts can fill this gap by writing their own scripts, or can operate the tools manually where needed.</p>
 Use security testing services to jump-start your application security program 
<p>Involve developers in the testing process so that they can produce high-quality code once they understand the possible threats. “Assign one of your developers to shadow the pentester or application security testing service, or have your developer manage the program,” says Horvath.</p>
<p>Gartner research suggests that developers in this kind of program are prone to make significantly fewer security errors. These developers can also act as subject matter experts or security champions and identify issues more quickly for the team in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to involving developers in testing, CISOs can also introduce numerous “ethical hacking” courses available online to developers. This can enable developers to understand the world view on securing applications and how attackers operate.</p>
 Reevaluate your mix of security techniques on a periodic basis 
<p>As the program matures, and as new styles of coding and new technologies are introduced, vulnerabilities evolve. CISOs need to plan for this by scheduling periodic evaluations of the security techniques in practice.</p>
<p>For example, “If you have an application that is mostly in maintenance mode and requires mostly cosmetic changes, move resources from code scanning into pentest,” Horvath says.</p>
<p>Periodic testing is wrongly perceived as a cost-draining process. However, semiannual or quarterly reevaluation of priorities can optimize resources and ensure that development and security teams are familiar with all the tools.</p>
 Rotate testers and apply time limits to prevent overfamiliarity and burnout 
<p>Gartner research suggests that the number of threats found by a security tester reduces gradually over a period of five weeks and significantly declines after eight weeks of running a code. This doesn’t mean that the threats have been reduced. Because the tester is viewing the code multiple times, fatigue sets in. This can be a problem with critical sections of code or software, especially when the full functionality of the code may not always be tested or exercised.</p>
<p>Introducing code testing to a fresh set of eyes can help identify vulnerabilities that someone who has been working on the software for too long may have overlooked.</p>
 Avoid wasting paid testing hours 
<p>Underpreparedness is not new to the testing environment. Often when consultants arrive to begin testing, they are not fully briefed or prepared for the kinds of tests that have been requested. This causes delays in testing, less accurate results, and lower productivity for development teams and pentesters.</p>
<p>Prepare for the testing ahead of time by meeting with vendors and discussing the types and scale of testing you want to conduct, and preselect areas of code, infrastructure and processes you identify as gaps in your overall testing coverage. Use external testers to find business logic errors instead of the more “low-hanging fruit” types of issues that your internal testing can uncover.</p>
 Be flexible when scheduling opportunities for testing 
<p>Rolling out testing changes to a small population is a common practice within DevOps organizations. As these tests are performed in a controlled environment, it reduces the risks of exposing the entire organization to threats. CISOs can plan for canary or A/B testing during breaks in normal business hours, such as weekends and holidays. Another option is to set up parallel environments for security testing.</p>
<p>“Issues that appear as security vulnerabilities are often a product of poor code development. By using these security testing tips, organizations can create a robust framework for their applications’ security,” says Horvath.</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-119-ray-dalio-examines-history-to-understand-the-chaos-were-experiencing-today-690ec1c73548">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we’ve got for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  1a. Vitalik Buterin on persistent identity + free&nbsp;speech,  1b. Juan Benet on identity baked into the&nbsp;browser  1c. Balaji Srinivasan on portable identity network effects for 2-sided marketplaces  2. Big 4 antitrust hearings pushed to&nbsp;Wed  3. New OCC guy allows bank custody of&nbsp;crypto  4. Chinese state launches blockchain network  5. Ray Dalio on the Big Cycle of the U.S. and where it is&nbsp;now   1. For all the ways our internet platforms have better connected us, made it easier to create and to consume, there are some striking issues with the place we’ve arrived at in 2020. I won’t get into that since we’re all pretty aware of the primary critiques. <p>What about solutions?</p><p>Juan Benet (Filecoin), Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum), and Balaji Srinivasan (former Coinbase CTO, a16z) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxE9KV3YrE&amp;feature=emb_logo">gave their future-y takes in a “debate” last wee</a>k (via <a href="https://global.id/junhiraga">/junhiraga</a>).</p><p>For starters, we need to rethink the incentive structures that drive our behavior. We also need to rethink how our platforms are structured. And we also need a lot more experimentation around&nbsp;both.</p><p>But we also need to rethink identity.</p><p>Here’s a thought exercise for you. How could we foster the free and independent speech and thought that comes with anonymity without devolving into a free for all like 4Chan and all the bad behavior that comes with&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here’s Vitalik:</p>Vitalik Buterin, TechCrunch<blockquote>So I feel like a 4Chan type of thing is a great example of the difference between anonymous and pseudonymous. 4Chan is much more on the anonymous side of the spectrum. And I think the difference is that you can focus on decentralization in the sense of avoiding other people’s negative incentives. That’s definitely part of what’s going on, but the other important thing is actively creating positive incentives right?</blockquote><blockquote>And if you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><blockquote>You can have pseudonyms, but then you could even do crazy things — for example, you switched to a new pseudonym every two weeks, but you would have some zero-knowledge proofs that links your pseudonym to some older pseudonym, and you don’t really know which one, but some kind of reputation score carries&nbsp;over.</blockquote><blockquote>You could even have negative reputation scores carry over potentially on someone — and if the research came up with a way of doing that in a privacy-preserving way so that there was a lot of room in terms of designing incentives to encourage actively good behavior.</blockquote><blockquote>And in that sense it can mean a lot of things. It can mean micropayments and monetary rewards. It could be just a reputation and having more people see your content. There’s a lot of things you can do that are fully compatible with the idea that people should be able to post under identities that are separate from their real identities that they use for personal like and work and so&nbsp;forth.</blockquote><p>All of which, BTW, is aligned with the spirit of the GlobaliD namespace. Your GlobaliD name doesn’t have to be your real name. And you can always have more than one name. That’s your prerogative.</p><p>It’s also the super exciting thing about identity in general. The deeper you dive into it, the more you start to understand how it can help reshape the way we interact and transact online in a fundamentally constructive way — far beyond the limits of what we’ve experienced so&nbsp;far.</p><p>Even simple things such as account recovery have creative solutions that both enhance trust while removing bottlenecks.</p><p>Here’s Vitalik on the concept of social recovery:</p><blockquote>If you lose your account, you have to appeal to customer service and sometimes they just never respond. More privileged people can have private channels where they could yell more and get listened to more. A lot of people just don’t have access to those kinds of channels. It’s a problem where people think that you can just talk to the kindly human at the end, they’ll figure it out. But often, it just isn’t true. This is an idea where you have some group of friends — somewhere between five and 10 contacts — and say any two thirds of them can reset your&nbsp;account.</blockquote><p>Of course, Vitalik also concedes that certain functions are simply better served by verification providers — and here, Vitalik is still speaking our language:</p><blockquote>The other half of the identity problem is proving real-world properties about yourself that are attested by authorities — like proving you’re a citizen of some country, proving that you graduated from some university, all of those things. And ultimately, you can’t decentralize those because they’re just fundamentally dependent on the centralized authority. But what you can do is create a kind of common standard and common platform for these attestations to&nbsp;happen.</blockquote><p>Now here’s Juan echoing Greg’s thoughts on baking identity into the&nbsp;browser:</p><blockquote>I think we need to return to the idea of persona, which was like Mozilla’s effort to create identity directly baked into the browser. I think if the operating systems we had coupled identities for data closer to the kind of identities for logging into the device, that would be a good win. The browser or the O/S might be the right place to put&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>The long time upside, though, will be the network effects of having these verified, persistent, and portable identities.</p><p>Here’s Balaji:</p><blockquote>One thing I want to just point out — this may be very obvious — but I think it’s actually pretty interesting for us. One of the advantages of Substack is there’s a hundred thousand people on there who have credit cards. And so a new publication has a built-in network effect. If you had an Ethereum ID with crypto in there, you start to get a network effect among things where all Ethereum users or all Bitcoin users can go and sign up for a site and you have a similar kind of network effect — where you would prefer it to be logged in with Ethereum or logged in with Bitcoin, and then you can pay and you’ve got identity and so on and so&nbsp;forth.</blockquote><blockquote>In some ways, that’s an obvious use case, but I think it rotates it a little bit where you just need a community of those folks who will all go and just click to sign up at a site and you start to get a network effect, and then you start getting more products built around that core. And the critical thing there, of course, is that the account and the money are both decentralized. So they’re not associated with Amazon.com or Substack or what have you, but with a decentralized community.</blockquote><blockquote>Then you can also have something where you have an Ethereum wallet, for example, or a Bitcoin wallet where you are pushing notifications and you get paid.

A number of empires and dynasties have sustained themselves for hundreds of years and the United States, at 244 years old, has proven itself to be one of the most durable now in existence. I think the most important question is how we adapt and change by asking ourselves and honestly answering some difficult questions.</blockquote><p>And there are certainly some difficult questions to contend with.

					 <p>When I was hired at the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> as the first software engineer, my #1 task was to help developers start using <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk">Hyperledger Indy</a> quickly. It wasn’t an easy task—two years, loads of documentation, an entirely <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">new Hyperledger project</a> (Aries), and countless workshops later, we’d taken what used to take about six months to accomplish and reduced it to a couple of weeks. I took that knowledge and created a paid training course for SSI developers that brought in $100k+ of revenue for the Sovrin Foundation. However, I’ve always had a bigger vision of what could be done for the SSI developer community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I helped start Trinsic, I wanted to create the best developer experience possible. The first version of our API was released exactly a year ago, with only four developers as the first users. Since then, we’ve grown into a community of hundreds of developers. We’ve released two additional APIs and worked hard to make it easy to start building applications that utilize SSI capabilities.</p>

			 Introducing Trinsic's documentation site 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our engineering team at Trinsic is thrilled to present our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">new documentation site</a>, which we believe is the best place for someone new to SSI to get started learning. To begin, we explain the concepts of SSI in understandable terms. Our API reference then shows how these concepts are applied in workable building blocks. The reference applications we’ve built will make it easy to call the API in the programming language of your choice. If you have any questions, we have a discussion board for you to ask any questions you might have. Let’s dive in to some of the major features of this new developer hub.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Knowledge base 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Good knowledge about SSI has historically been hard to come by. Distributed across multiple blogs, repos, docs, webinars, and online courses are hundreds of pages of content, some of which is out of date. We’ve taken the knowledge that has historically only been available from hours of searching or paid consultants and made it accessible for everyone. The knowledge base includes:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					   Conceptual documentation  Technical documentation  Guides/tutorials  Reference applications  Glossary<br><br>  <p>We have big plans for this knowledge base and intend to continually improve it over time. Please let us know if there are topics you’d like to see explained, and we’ll make sure to cover it. The best way to understand something is not by being taught but by actually doing it. That’s why the best part of the knowledge base is that it’s right next to the API Reference.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 API reference 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our APIs are our core product, used all around the world by developers in all industries. Previously, accessing the API was a multi-step process, including copying &amp; pasting API keys (and remembering to use the ‘bearer’ scheme!) and navigating to a SwaggerHub page. The new API reference lives in the same place as the documentation and will soon share authentication with the Trinsic Studio, which means you’re automatically authenticated while you’re logged-in to your Trinsic account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That means you can go from reading this blog post to making API calls in less than 30 seconds—seriously. Getting started couldn’t be easier.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Community 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A public community forum is a part of the documentation site as well. That means you can read documentation, make an API call, and ask a question without ever leaving the site. You can also search through questions previous developers have asked and contribute your answers. This forum is indexed by search engines, which means your comments can be discoverable by future developers who run into similar issues.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We’re also launching a private Trinsic community in Microsoft Teams for our paid subscribers. Here our customers get early access to features, co-marketing opportunities, and a private support channel with our team. See our <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">plans &amp; pricing</a> to learn more.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Conclusion 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We still have a long way to go, but I’m thrilled at how far the SSI developer community has come since I joined it three years ago. With this new documentation site coupled with our APIs, it’s now easier than ever for developers to get started with verifiable credentials. Check out the documentation site for yourself at <a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">docs.trinsic.id</a>. Then, join the hundreds of developers using our API by signing up for a Trinsic account at&nbsp;<a href="http://studio.trinsic.id/">studio.trinsic.id</a>. We can’t wait to have you join our community.</p>

  People have experienced issues verifying the identity of potential dating matches for years. It is impossible to know if the person you're messaging is the love of your life or a scammer. With Verifiable Credentials like email, phone number and ID documents, BloomID can help solve all of that.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>People have been experiencing issues with verifying the identity of potential matches while dating for hundreds of years. Classified ads in newspapers made that worse, and online dating has made it nearly impossible for you to know if the person that just messaged you is, in fact, the person of your dreams, someone trying to scam you, or even someone who poses a potential danger in real life.</p><p>Lots of solutions have been tried and tested to resolve this problem, but none have stuck. Whether you were on Lavalife in the 90s, Match.com or Plenty of Fish in the early 2000s, or are using Tinder or Bumble today, you may always have that sneaking suspicion about who’s really behind the keyboard until one of you gets the courage to ask for a video call or to meet up in person.</p><p>BloomID can help solve all of that. With Verifiable Credentials, like email address, phone number, ID document (with facial matching), social media accounts and more, adding Bloom’s technology to a dating app can significantly reduce the number of people getting fooled and, therefore, souring on your product and the experience. This can have a snowball effect, especially on a smaller platform. Authentic identity makes for authentic connections.</p><p>Today, Match.com provides ID verification for paid users, and checks that ID against a variety of databases to ensure the individual is not a criminal. However, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hillaryflynn/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the">Match Group does not implement this security feature across any of their free platforms</a>, including Plenty of Fish, Tinder, Meetic, Pairs, OkCupid, and others. It readily admits registered offenders are using its free products.</p><p>We didn’t come across any other dating platforms that allow you to verify an identity, including platforms targeted at seniors and retirees, therefore putting individuals at risk of being scammed, assaulted, or worse (<a href="https://www.datingnews.com/industry-trends/online-dating-statistics-what-they-mean-for-future/">see statistics 23-27</a>).</p><p>This problem can be seen as a tradeoff between bringing in a high number of users to your platform versus fewer people using a paid platform, although the latter would introduce more inherent trust. What you can do, instead, is introduce a middle-path: allow people to bring their reusable Verified Credentials to your dating platform to enable verified profiles, and have people self-select whether they want to focus on chatting with people with verified identities or not.</p><p>Let’s see how you can implement BloomID in your app!</p> Let’s Start Server Side <p>Let’s assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of Node.js, or that can be passed a payload from said Node.js library. </p><p>To that end, we’re going to implement <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit</a> so that we can verify someone’s name on their profile is, in fact, the name on their photo ID that they have already verified. Verify Kit makes it simple to go from an http payload to a verified identity document in just a few steps.</p><p>We’re going to install Verify Kit using this command:</p> <code>npm install --save @bloomprotocol/verify-kit
</code> 
<p>Use the validateUntypedResponseData function from verify-kit, which returns an object with a kind property with potential values of 'invalid' or 'validated'. Assuming a 'validated' payload, the object will contain a data property structured as a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">verifiable presentation</a>.</p><p>Next, given a verifiable presentation, we extract the id-document from its verifiableCredential property and parse the JSON payload to receive the raw identity document data, which is structured like this:</p> <code>export interface IBaseAttIDDocData extends IBaseAttDataObj {
    date: TDateOrTime;
    name?: TPersonalName;
    country?: string;
    document_type?: string;
    authentication_result?: 'unknown' | 'passed' | 'failed' | 'skipped' | 'caution' | 'attention';

<p>The most important properties of an identity document are the authentication_result and facematch_result. Any value in authentication_result that is not 'passed' requires manual review to verify the authenticity of the document. </p><p>Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the server side code from <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter/tree/master/bloom-starter-kyc/server">bloom-starter-kyc</a> as a way to kickstart your integration efforts!</p><p>Once you have all that in place, you’re ready to accept data from Share Kit!</p> Let’s Head Client Side <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Let’s assume you are building an Android app. You can find the Java Share Kit library here in Bloom’s GitHub account.</p><p>For this demonstration, let’s keep it simple by requesting the ‘id-document’ and ‘facebook’ verifications since you can extract ‘full-name’ from both and, with your own code that we will leave you to write in the language of your choice, compare the two server side!</p> Building the Android Library   Open the ShareKit project in Android Studio and let the project sync with gradle.  When the project is ready, click on the Build menu and then select Clean Project i.e. Build -&gt; Clean Project, in Android Studio.  Then also click on the Build menu and then select Rebuild Project i.e. Build -&gt; Rebuild Project, in Android Studio.  Finally navigate to the ShareKit directory and open the folders app -&gt; build -&gt; outputs -&gt; aar and copy the app-debug.aar library file generated. Paste this file anywhere in your filesystem and preferably rename it to sharekit.aar   Android Installation <p>Make sure your Android project has a minSdkVersion of 16 or greater, otherwise adding the library will cause your project to fail to build.</p><p>Add the sharekit.aar library generate above by doing the following in your Android Studio project:</p>  Click File -&gt; New -&gt; New Module.  Click Import .JAR/.AAR Package then click Next.  Enter the location of the compiled sharekit.aar file then click Finish.  Then make sure the sharekit library is added in your settings.gradle file i.e. include ':app', ':sharekit'  In your projects build.gradle file add a new line for the sharekit lib in the dependencies block i.e. dependencies { implementation project(":sharekit") }  Finally click on Sync Project with Gradle Files for your project to sync with the sharekit library.  <p>If the above steps are done successfully then you should be able to clean and Rebuild your project successfully as specified above i.e. Build -&gt; Clean Project &amp; Build -&gt; Rebuild Project</p> Usage <p>To use RequestButton in your project, do the following:</p>  Import the ShareKit class into your Activity/Fragment i.e. import com.bloom.sharekit.ShareKit;  Then initialize the RequestButton, set the share-kit request data &amp; callback-url and add it to your layout view programmatically like this:   <code>@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        LinearLayout layout = findViewById(R.id.example_activity);

        // initialize the request data JSON Object and the types array
        JSONObject requestData = new JSONObject();
        JSONArray attestationTypes = new JSONArray();
        try {
            requestData.put("action", ShareKit.attestation);
            requestData.put("token", "3b922185-68c6-4e83-9b79-30e0b5fbf873");
            requestData.put("url", "receive.datingapp.co/api/receive");
            requestData.put("org_logo_url", "https://commcomm.xyz/bloom/DatingApp-Logo.png");
            requestData.put("org_name", "DatingApp");
            requestData.put("org_usage_policy_url", "https://datingapp.co/legal/terms");
            requestData.put("org_privacy_policy_url", "https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy");

            // add the attestations
            attestationTypes.put("id-document");
            attestationTypes.put("facebook");
            requestData.put("types", attestationTypes);
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // this is the callback-url/deep link for your app which will be used by the bloom app to re-direct you to your after the request is handled
        String callbackUrl = "https://datingapp.co?token=3b922185-68c6-4e83-9b79-30e0b5fbf873";

        // initialize the button by passsing the activity, bloom requestData and your app's callback-url
        Button bloomButton = new ShareKit().RequestButton(this, requestData, callbackUrl);

        //add button to the layout
        layout.addView(bloomButton);

        // set the button padding if necessary
        layout.setPadding(30,50,10,10);
    }
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own as it’s a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources, or to ensure the data is being shared from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Note that for a new Android Studio project, the layout created will be a ConstraintLayout instead of a LinearLayout as shown above. Also please add an id to the layout xml file before initializing it so that it looks as follows:</p> <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout 
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/example_activity"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

   
&lt;/android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout&gt;
</code> 
  And then initialize the layout as a ConstraintLayout instead of a LinearLayout i.e. ConstraintLayout layout = findViewById(R.id.example_activity);  After this, everything else in the above example will remain the same.  <p>4. Finally build and install the APK into a device or emulator and once your app pops up, you should see the RequestButton displayed!</p><p>Also, the first time you tap the button, you'll be presented with a variety of options for which app to use to open the link. Just select Open With -&gt; Bloom -&gt; ALWAYS so that it defaults to opening the Bloom App if it's installed instead of a web browser.</p><p>So how can this look and feel in a dating app? Let’s see some examples.</p><p>Here’s what the view for editing your own profile could look like:</p>A screenshot of our demonstration dating app featuring the "Verify with Bloom" button<p>And if “Felix” goes through the process of verifying his ID, that process looks like this.</p>  Tap “Verify with Bloom”  View and confirm the data sharing request  The Bloom data sharing request for DatingApp, our demo app<p>3. &nbsp;Success!</p>The success screen. We completed the data sharing request!<p>Felix’s view of his settings and profile could now look like this, with the Bloom icon (or another indicator of some kind) showing that he has verified his name is actually Felix.</p>The user's view of their own profile after verifying their name<p>Ta-da! He’s verified his name is actually Felix, we confirmed this server-side using the two Verifiable Credentials provided (the ‘full-name’ subtype from the ‘id-document’ and ‘facebook’), and so now can apply some kind of indicator to his profile to show that. </p><p>Now, how would this look to other users when viewing profiles of potential matches? We have some examples of that as well. </p>A view of Felix's profile when viewed as othersAnd a view of Mia's profile as seen by others<p>You could also provide the ability for users to verify their age, their phone number, email address, or implement some computer vision to compare the photo on their ID document to their dating profile photo!</p><p>That is just one of the many use cases where you can use Bloom’s open source technology to enhance trust and security within your platform on a user-permissioned basis, while maintaining data security and privacy. Verify the data provided, delete it from your Verify Kit service, and allow your users to connect knowing you have taken at least one concrete step towards making your dating platform safer for all parties.</p><p>More Resources:</p>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/overview">Share Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit-android">Share Kit Android GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit-ios">Share Kit iOS GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/verify-kit">Verify Kit GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter">Bloom Starter GitHub Repository</a>   Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/ready-for-scale-may-june-product-update/">Last month at Authenteq</a>: don’t have a developer team on-site? We have your back! Last month we wrapped up the building of the new infrastructure that allowed for API simplification, improved security measures, and integration speed. What is more, we added more languages to our service and implemented nifty image compression features to make sure that you can maximize your conversion. And even though we work hard this month, our product update is short, sweet, and full of automation. Here’s what we achieved this month:</p>



 Automated flagging&nbsp; 



<p>Automation is the key to successfully scaling internal ID verification and KYC processes. As we want you to become efficient with your time and resources, we decided to automate the flagging process. What does this mean? Instead of your compliance team having to flag suspicious users, our technology does that for you – automatically. This improvement allows for eliminating the negative side of the human factor. Therefore, lean back, save time, and let our AI-powered solution handle the fraudsters for you.&nbsp;<br></p>



 Data quick view&nbsp; 



<p>Every click matters, and we’re aware of that. To simplify the dashboard and your daily workflow, we’ve improved dashboard data visualization. Now you can take a glimpse at the user data by hovering over the user account instead of having to view the user information and come back to the main dashboard.&nbsp; </p>



 All onboard&nbsp; 



<p>Remember our old blockchain system – the idea is still extraordinarily futuristic and something we might come back to once the world is ready for <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/privacy-by-design/">privacy-by-design</a> notions. Long story short, we shut it down and migrated the last client to the new system. All of that went hassle-free, and we’re happy to run our services and cater to our customers on one, continuously improving the system.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The “bricks to clicks” trend of retailers ramping up their e-commerce presence to keep up with the likes of Amazon is at light speed amid the pandemic, and it’s upending retail supply chains everywhere. There are many reasons for this turmoil: Retailers may keep less stock on hand, people may not be buying as many things for outside the house (clothes, jewelry, etc.), manufacturers themselves may need to slow production, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><br>
The disruption is driving a need for manufacturers to take more digital paths to market. Don’t get me wrong—supply chains will always exist—but we’re seeing an increase in the number of manufacturers who are shifting how they connect with customers. And it’s raising the bar for customer shopping experiences, making the demand to offer <a>extraordinary digital experiences</a> an imperative.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is undeniably the first line of defense for organizations worldwide. It enables employees to securely access applications while enhancing control and transparency. But IAM is also on the change. It is already more than just the traditional employee IAM. Digital business requires advanced identity services, well beyond the human identities.</p>
<p>The segregation between various dimensions of IAM is blurring. IAM today treads the line between providing security and acting as a business enabler. It has left behind the notion of being "just IT" and turned into a necessity for implementing security and policy and a facilitator of modern business models.&nbsp;But how can security leaders turn the challenges, both legacy and new, into opportunities to mitigate risk and add value to the business? And all this in a way that will elevate the position, and change the perception, of security at the same time?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/remote_work_iam"></a>

					 <p>Last week, the Decentralized Identity Foundation <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/building-interoperable-zkp-credential-systems-70bc20a8a809">announced work on interoperable zero-knowledge proof schemes</a> that Trinsic participated in. Since then, we’ve had some folks ask us, “What are zero-knowledge proofs?” It’s a great subject for our first Trinsic Basics post—a series of blog posts geared toward educating people who are new to the community about the powerful aspects of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) and verifiable credentials. So let’s kick it off!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow you to prove a piece of information is true (like, that you’re over 18) without revealing the information itself (your birthdate). For this post, we’ll talk about ZKPs in the context of SSI.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The concept 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Suppose there’s a circular cave that has a door in the back (see the drawings below for detail). The door in the back requires a 4-digit code to unlock, and the only way from one side to the other is through the door. If you want to prove to your friend that you know the code without revealing the code, how could you do it? Easy! Hangout at the back by the door and come out whichever side your friend asks you to. If you do this enough times successfully, your friend will feel confident you know the code. Through this process, you will have proven you know the code without revealing the code.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					When your friend isn't looking, you go into one side of the cave.¹
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					You wait for your friend to tell you which side to come out of.²
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					If you succeed enough times, your friend will trust that you know the code.³
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Applying ZKPs to verifiable credentials and SSI gives individuals the ability to leverage this power in their everyday lives.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 When would ZKPs be helpful? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Consider a simple proof-of-age scenario. In the United States, for example, you must be 21 years old to rent a car. What if you could prove you are at least 21 years old to the rental car company without revealing your actual birthdate? Instead of handing them your driver’s license (which includes your birthdate and other personal information such as your home address), a ZKP would allow you to send a digital <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/glossary#proof">proof</a> that simply states you are 21 or older.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other potential use cases for ZKPs include the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Qualifying for a loan. Instead of revealing your actual credit score to the bank, you can use a ZKP to prove that your credit score is above a certain number. The bank can trust that your credit is above a certain threshold that it defines, and you don’t have to reveal more than is necessary.  Proof of Address. If you needed to prove you lived in a certain voting district, you could use a ZKP to prove you lived in the correct area, without disclosing your address.  Not a Bot. Using ZKPs, you could prove that you are a verified person through any business flow, without disclosing any information about yourself.  <p>These scenarios center around human traits, but there are plenty of industrial, medical, automotive, and other interesting use cases as well. ZKPs are useful any time privacy or data minimization is a priority.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How you can use ZKPs 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic allows you to take advantage of the power of ZKPs through our platform. First, you will need a digital wallet. The <a href="http://www.trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet">Trinsic Wallet</a> is a great place to start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, you’ll need some credentials in that wallet. You can use the Trinsic Studio to create your own credentials in less than 5 minutes. Or you can get some sample credentials by doing a <a href="https://trinsic.id/getting-essential-workers-back-to-work-with-ssi/">demo</a> or <a href="https://www.metadigital.tech/demo/">two</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have a digital wallet with credentials, you’re ready to prove some stuff about yourself! To create a verifier, head to the <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a> and click on “Verifications.” Click the “Create Verification Template” button, then the “+ Policy” button, then select “Predicate.”</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>There are a lot of powerful things you can do with these verification templates, but we’ll just focus on the ZKP for now. As you can see, in this example we’re setting up a verification policy that will ask someone to prove their age is ≥ 18.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>After I’ve set up the policy, I can send it to the digital wallet. Here’s what it looks like:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>From here, the digital wallet allows you to select from any credential that satisfies the policy you sent to it.&nbsp;It’s that easy! You’ve successfully presented a proof of age without revealing any personal data.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Decentralized Identity is a concept that may not be mainstream yet, but it is a term that embodies the sentiment that many individuals feel regarding the control they wish they had over their personal data. The public has become increasingly more vocal about the misuse of their data, and global regulation has responded to this outcry with the GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, and more. While this grants some control over some aspects of user data, there is an assumption that underpins these privacy regulations: that personal data can be held and used by an entity other than the owner.</p>
 Identity verification a promising use case for decentralized identity 
<p>But for a decentralized identity solution to succeed, it will likely need to make a place for itself in the enterprise space first, rather than going directly to the masses. And for this strategy to work, it needs a different business case, one that addresses the public’s needs from the angle of the enterprise. This should take the difficulties that enterprises face into consideration; that enterprises are saddled with a honeypot of data – a vulnerability that must be protected – and users seek out ways to simplify their many accounts by reusing passwords. A promising use case for decentralized identity is identity verification, possible in various iterations of customer onboarding, reusable KYC, or proof-of-(attribute).</p>
 Is blockchain the obvious choice? 
<p>A decentralized architecture appears to be the most promising way forward. The entire concept is decentralized – instead of an organization holding a mass of employee and end-user data centrally, the SSI concept envisions a way where each individual is the only one that holds their identity data.</p>
<p>Blockchain has been the decentralized architecture of choice, given its strengths in the chronological sequencing of events with transparency and tamper-proof auditability. It does face a trade-off with scalability and decentralization: when a blockchain is fully decentralized, the work and time it takes per block consensus is quite high. Sacrifice the decentralized format for a network of trusted nodes (usually operated by a consortium of organizations, or a single organization), and the transactions can be trusted without such labor-intensive consensus processes.</p>
 Privacy as a challenge to blockchain 
<p>The other challenge that blockchain faces for decentralized identity is privacy. Any data published to the blockchain is permanent, making it an ill-suited match for exchanging identity data which must have the power to be removed at the owner’s request. There are workarounds, such to anonymize or pseudonymize identity data stored in each block.</p>
<p>So, is blockchain really the technology that will deliver decentralized identity solutions? We already see a few solutions coming on the market that use alternatives to blockchain, like directed graph technology. Some notable differences between the directed graph approach and the blockchain are:</p>
 
 Directed graphs do not arrange linkages in a chronological chain – as transactions are ordered with blockchain – but in a web of interconnected digital repositories. 
 Consensus is reimagined, without cryptocurrencies and mining. Some implementations require nodes issuing a transaction to validate two transactions from other nodes before its own is validated. This resolves scalability challenges that Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains face, because the more exchanges that are made with a directed graph implementation, the faster they are validated. 
 Data held in the nodes of directed graphs can be linked to a single source of truth. This means that if a piece of identity data, for example the expiration date on a license, is updated in the “off-graph” storage, it is updated in each instance throughout the graph. This is unlike blockchain, where a transaction published to the chain is permanent without the option of updates. 
 
 Directed Graphs could be better suited to identity use cases 
<p>Directed graphs seem to be better able to handle relationships, instead of transactions as we’ve seen with blockchain implementations of decentralized identity. This leaves more room for roles to change, for identity attributes to become valid and invalid, and for different personas to be used in private and professional settings. Directed graph solutions for decentralized identity are still new on the market, and more research and the test of time will reveal how this technology plays out.</p>

 What is API Security? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether an application is targeting consumers, employees, partners or otherwise, the client-side of an application (e.g., a mobile app, a web app) interacts with the server-side of an application via an Application Programming Interface (API). Simply put, APIs make it easy for a developer to create a client-side app. Microservice architectures are also made possible by APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because they’re often available over public networks (access from anywhere), APIs are typically well documented or easily reverse-engineered. Also highly sensitive to denial of service (DDOS) type incidents, APIs are attractive targets for bad actors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attack might include bypassing the client-side application in an attempt to disrupt the functioning of an application for other users or to breach private information. <a>API security</a> is focused on securing this application layer and addressing what can happen if a malicious hacker were to interact with the API directly.</p>

Or it could mean a secret passcode, a photograph, or even facial biometric data. With your GlobaliD digital identity, you collect verifications of those identifiers, which allows you to develop your reputation and digital trust, providing access to products and services.</p> What makes my GlobaliD different from social&nbsp;login? <p>Most digital identity platforms take ownership and control of your digital identity and your data for their own purposes. For instance, social media companies make money from selling your data to unauthorized third parties. Further, common forms of digital identity are limited and siloed, meaning that if you develop a positive reputation on one platform, you aren’t able to reuse that reputation elsewhere.</p><p>In contrast, GlobaliD is privacy-first by design, allowing you to take ownership and control of your own digital identity, so that you can use it any way you and anywhere see fit. This means that you can represent and verify yourself online in a trusted way, while retaining ownership and control of your digital identity and your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Only you can decide how your data is accessed or used, and who can access and use it. Since you own your GlobaliD digital identity, it is fully portable, allowing you to take the trust and reputation that you develop with you wherever you&nbsp;go.</p> What is a portable identity? <p>A portable identity is one that you can take with you along with the trust and reputation you’ve already established, meaning that you can use it to access and to use services anywhere.</p><p>Common forms of digital identity today aren’t portable and are instead locked within their respective platforms, so that a trusted reputation that you have worked hard to build — such as on a social media platform cannot be used at&nbsp;, an auctions marketplace, or a home rentals marketplace.</p><p>With GlobaliD, your identity is fully portable, meaning that you can take your trusted reputation with you wherever you go. This is analogous to how phone numbers were once fully-owned by network carriers, requiring you to get a new phone number every time you switched, but are now portable so that you can keep the same number even if you switch carriers.</p> What is self-sovereign identity? <p>The Sovrin Foundation: Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a term used to describe the digital movement that recognizes an individual should own and control their identity without the intervening administrative authorities. SSI allows people to interact in the digital world with the same freedom and capacity for trust as they do in the offline&nbsp;world.</p> What are verifications? <p>Verifications are credentials you can collect that provide objective proof that your provided information has been verified as true by a specific third-party verification agency.</p> What are verification providers? <p>Verification providers are independent, third-party agencies that provide verifications for your GlobaliD digital identity. You can collect verifications from providers of your choosing to develop your reputation and digital trust. New verification providers are regularly added to the GlobaliD ecosystem.</p><p>Examples of verification providers you can access&nbsp;today:</p>  Email (Ekata, Berbix, Mandrill, and&nbsp;others)  Age (AgeChecker.Net)  Phone number (Ekata, Berbix, Civic, and&nbsp;others)  Address verification (Ekata, Onfido, Yodlee, and&nbsp;others)  Liveness (Google, Verifi.me)  Government ID (Onfido, Berbix, Veriff, Civic, and&nbsp;others)  Social media account (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google)  Bank account (Yodlee and&nbsp;others)  Cryptocurrency wallets&nbsp;(Zabo)  Accredited investor status (InvestReady)  Sanctions watchlists screening (Uphold)  College degree (National Student Clearinghouse)  Peer-to-peer vouches  Among many&nbsp;others!   What is a GlobaliD&nbsp;Name? <p>Your GlobaliD Name is a unique handle that represents your digital identity. Any verifications you collect are tied to your GlobaliD Name, allowing you to build a trusted reputation for this identity. You can claim any GlobaliD Name of your choosing as long as it’s available — it doesn’t have to be your real name. You can also claim more than one GlobaliD&nbsp;Name.</p> How does GlobaliD protect my privacy and my&nbsp;data? <p>GlobaliD protects your privacy and data through our verifications system and industry-leading security practices. GlobaliD verifications are statements that describe something about you that an independent, third-party verification agency has verified to be&nbsp;true.</p><p>Using public key cryptography, your private data is encrypted and stored in the GlobaliD Vault and can only be accessed or shared with your explicit consent. This means that your data isn’t being redundantly stored by each new service provider you choose, is only accessed on a need-to-know basis, and that these verifications of yours are portable since they can be used to verify your identity with other GlobaliD partners.</p><p>In the case of a partner data breach, your data is safe since they were never storing it themselves. That service provider can then request to delete your private data from the GlobaliD Vault. Nobody — including GlobaliD — can decrypt your personal data without your express permission.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-frequently-asked-questions-738947ebcfeb">GlobaliD—Frequently asked questions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On July 22nd, 2020 IBM announced their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services">IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a> – what is this, why have IBM taken this step, and what does this announcement mean?</p>
 Financial Services Compliance Challenges 
<p>One recurring challenge for all organizations is complying with the ever-increasing number of laws and regulations. When IT services are delivered on-premises organizations often believe that this ensures the oversight, control and visibility needed to ensure and prove compliance. This is not the case with cloud-delivered services where there is a shared responsibility model and less visibility of the CSP controls. However, digital transformation initiatives are adopting cloud services to provide speed and agility, and this is leading to tensions between the organization's functions for digital transformation and those responsible for risk and compliance. Nowhere is this more apparent than in financial services.</p>
<p>The hyperscale CSPs such as AWS, Azure and IBM provide easy access to the capabilities needed by development teams to accelerate the creation of critical new business applications. While the major cloud service providers go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments it is up to the customer to secure their use and to prove compliance. This is often outside the skills of DevOps teams or is overlooked and can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber adversaries.&nbsp;</p>
 Compliance is not enough – you need to prove you are compliant 
<p>Another challenge is that even where a cloud service is well secured and is being used in a compliant manner, the customer must prove that this is the case to regulators. CSPs often approach this by publishing long lists or the laws and regulations with which their service is compliant. However, this is not sufficient to solve the customers’ compliance challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the customer’s perspective, there is a need to show how the controls that they have in place contribute to meeting their regulatory obligations. These obligations vary from customer to customer as do the risks and so each customer will have an individual mapping between risks, controls, and obligations. This mapping is complex and must include all IT services involved irrespective of how they are delivered. This means including how the controls within the service are governed as well as how they are used and there must be adequate proof the controls not only exist and are effective but also how they map to obligations and risks. In effect, this is a specialized form of cloud security posture management described in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/cloud-security-posture-management-tools">blog</a>.</p>
 IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services 
<p>It is in this area that IBM have taken action for Financial Services.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Bank of America, and using the knowledge from the IBM Promontory, IBM has created the IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services. This is intended to deliver the benefits and flexibility of a public cloud in a secure environment, to enable financial institutions, ISVs and SaaS providers to host apps and workloads in the cloud with confidence and trust.</p>
<p>IBM has established an Industry Cloud Advisory Council in support of the IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services. This will support this effort and advise on its ongoing advancement. Chief Technology Officer Tony Kerrison will represent Bank of America on the Council, which will be led by Howard Boville, SVP, IBM Cloud. The Council will be focused on bringing major financial institutions together to help drive the strategic evolution of cloud security in this highly regulated sector.</p>
<p>This Policy framework defines a set of controls based on financial services needs mapped into specific controls on the IBM Cloud. For example, the obligation to protect data end to end is supported by a wide range of IBM Cloud features and controls. These include IBM Cloud™ Hyper Protect Crypto Services which is a key management and cloud hardware security module (HSM) and puts controls of keys into clients’ hands to meet obligations for key management and data protection.</p>
<p>The Policy Framework is based on:</p>
 
 IBM public cloud controls aligned with NIST that are relevant to financial services’ needs. 
 Implementation and deployment practices to guide ISV and SaaS providers with cloud services architectures. 
 Implementation and evidence guidance for ISV and SaaS providers to complete and evidence compliance to the Policy Framework. 
 
<p>In support of this IBM have also announced their Financial Services Compliance Centre which is based on their OpenPages GRC tool augmented by assets acquired through their <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-06-15-IBM-Acquires-Assets-from-Spanugo">recent acquisition of Spanugo</a>.</p>
 My Opinion 
<p>This is an interesting development in the cloud space. It addresses the compliance challenges that are faced by financial services organizations and which according to IBM are limiting their adoption of public cloud services. It illustrates the difficulties faced by all organizations where the hybrid IT delivery model driven by digital transformation has added to the complexities of matching controls to risks and demonstrating compliance in a consistent manner. This approach is likely to become important in other regulated industries.</p>

 Attacks and account take-overs like last week’s Twitter hack are completely avoidable. Enterprises must implement biometric multi-factor authentication to ensure that only the right users have access to the right systems at all times. If they don’t, users will continue being vulnerable to hacks and&nbsp;scams. <blockquote>“A New York Times report that has yet to be confirmed by Twitter said that hackers breached employee Slack accounts and found credentials for the Twitter backend pinned inside a Slack channel,” — <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">ZDNet</a></blockquote><p>The hackers responsible for last week’s attack were able to breach Twitter’s backend systems by stealing credentials from within the social media platform’s private employee Slack channel. Once inside Twitter’s systems, the attackers were then free to take over at least <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">103 accounts and download the personal data of at least 8 accounts</a>.</p><p>In light of this unprecedented attack, we have to ask ourselves some serious questions — what were login credentials doing on the public Slack channel in the first place? Why were they posted there publicly for ease of access? How did the hackers get access to Twitter’s slack? Were those credentials phished out of an employee in an advanced social engineering attack?</p><p>If there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that passwords are inherently insecure, and failing us. Despite the known security risks, even the world’s biggest companies still struggle with enforcing proper password&nbsp;hygiene.</p><p>Why then, are companies like Twitter still using passwords as a means of accessing their backend systems, when biometric multi-factor authentication solutions for the workforce are on the&nbsp;market?</p><p>To avoid disastrous hacks and breaches, companies must immediately stop using passwords to authenticate employees and start embracing biometric multi-factor authentication as a weapon to permanently end hacks caused by compromised credentials.</p> Why would biometric multi-factor authentication have stopped the Twitter&nbsp;attack?  1. Without passwords, there is nothing to steal, lose or remember. <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication can help secure corporate systems by removing human error from the equation altogether. Unlike passwords, biometrics can’t be easily stolen, faked, or phished. Biometrics also can’t be shared between multiple users, written down and published online, or forgotten.</p><p>If Twitter (and Slack) were using biometric multi-factor authentication, the entire attack could have been foiled — saving Twitter and Slack their respective reputations, and Twitter’s users hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;dollars.</p> 2. Biometric MFA can stop bad actors from moving through a&nbsp;network <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication solutions allow for seamless and secure authentication that is minimally disruptive to workflow and the user-experience. This means biometric MFA can be used to set stringent access controls for users, ensuring that only the right people have access to the right systems at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>In last week’s attack, once the hacker gained access to Twitter’s systems via the compromised credentials found on the company’s Slack channel, they were then free to move through the network until they found a way to hack the accounts of prolific&nbsp;users.</p><p>The hacker’s ability to move through the network indicates that Twitter wasn’t using MFA to secure employee access at multiple entry points to its corporate systems.</p><p>Access controls ensure that lower-level employees aren’t able to move through a network, meaning that if a single set of login credentials are compromised, a hacker can’t then use them to freely move within a network until they find sensitive and private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Having biometric MFA checks at each access point in Twitter’s system would have prevented the attacker from moving laterally through Twitter’s network, which would have stopped them from breaching multiple&nbsp;systems.</p> 3. Biometric multi-factor authentication provides greater security than two-factor authentication <blockquote>“Twitter said hackers got “through” their two-factor protections but did not specify if it referred to the backend accounts or the Slack accounts.” — <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">ZDNet</a></blockquote><p>Why didn’t Twitter’s two-factor authentication stop the&nbsp;attack?</p><p>The short answer is obvious: Twitter’s 2FA solution still relies on passwords — which are inherently insecure.</p><p>Twitter uses 2FA solutions that combine passwords (something only the user should know) and one-time codes (sent to either the user’s phone via SMS or push or the user’ email address — which only the user should have access to) to authenticate its&nbsp;users.</p><p>The problem with 2FA solutions that partly depend on passwords is that one half of the entire solution is unreliable. If a password is compromised or shared willingly between people (as was the case with credentials being pinned in Twitter’s Slack), all a bad-actor then needs to do is compromise the user’s device or email accounts to bypass 2FA. Unfortunately, this is easily done if the user’s passwords for these accounts have also been compromised.</p><p>One-time codes (the second half of 2FA solutions) sent via text or email have their own security risks; if an email account or phone number has been compromised without the victim’s knowledge, then bypassing the 2FA security becomes entirely possible.</p> If one thing is certain: Biometric multi-factor authentication would have stopped the Twitter&nbsp;hack <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication solutions depend on the user proving who they are via their unique biometrics (something that can’t be easily stolen or faked), and via proof that they have their registered device (by only logging into accounts from these devices). With biometric MFA, the reliably strong methods for authenticating users are fundamentally more secure than 2FA solutions that depend on inherently insecure authentication methods.</p> To prevent hacks for good, biometric MFA must also be privacy-enhancing and universal <p>While biometrics remove human error from the cybersecurity equation, they aren’t necessarily immune to being hacked — that’s why it’s critical that biometric multi-factor authentication solutions are also privacy-enhancing.</p><p>At <a href="http://keyless.io">Keyless</a>, we combine multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing technology to provide a passwordless, secure and privacy-enhancing authentication solution. Our multi-factor solution can be implemented at every access point, ensuring that only the right users have the right access at the right&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>“Designed with privacy in&nbsp;mind”</blockquote><p>By providing a secure, frictionless way to establish access controls at multiple entry-points, Keyless prevents unauthorized movement through a company’s private systems. This protects from threats like the Twitter hack, where an unauthorized user wreaked havoc simply by stumbling upon a set of compromised credentials.</p> Privacy-enhancing technology allows Keyless to do two&nbsp;things:  1) Ensure biometric data is never&nbsp;exposed. <p>Keyless uses <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">privacy-enhancing technology</a> to transform biometric data so that it never represents personally identifiable information. This is done via a one-way encryption function. The transformed data is then split into fragments and stored on different servers (nodes) in the Keyless Cloud Network (instead of on the user’s device). This means that even if one (or all) of the nodes are compromised, that a user’s personal information is never at risk of being compromised.</p> 2) Authenticate users without viewing raw biometric data. <p>Keyless uses <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-secure-multiparty-computation-dc3fb9365458">secure multiparty computation </a>— a privacy-enhancing technology — that allows multiple nodes in our network to authenticate users without needing to view the raw components of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>To protect end-users and organizations against fraudulent takeovers, Keyless leverages advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing techniques, in addition to the built-in multi-factor security. This allows Keyless to ensure that only the real user gains access to private accounts.</p> There’s no excuse to continue using passwords — it’s time to go passwordless <p>At Keyless, we believe biometrics are the answer for solving the key challenges that have arisen in cybersecurity, which ultimately led to the Twitter hack last&nbsp;week.</p><p>Biometric multi-factor authentication allows us to close the gap between security, privacy, and convenience. By leveraging biometric solutions, organizations can offer both a seamless authentication experience and powerful security. Thereby putting a permanent stop to hacks and threats caused by compromised or weak credentials.</p><p>If companies want to avoid future large-scale attacks and hacks like last week’s Twitter hack, then they should immediately be looking to ditch passwords for good. It’s time for enterprises and technology companies to embrace passwordless authentication to secure corporate systems, implement access controls, and protect their&nbsp;users.</p><p>If they don’t, they’ll leave themselves and their users vulnerable to financial scams, privacy breaches, fraud, and identity&nbsp;theft.</p> Request a Free Trial of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/if-twitter-did-this-one-simple-thing-last-weeks-attack-would-never-have-happened-fca128786bd3">If Twitter did this one simple thing, last week’s attack would never have happened</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Shortly after 4PM last Wednesday, the Twitter accounts of major celebrities, tech companies, and CEOs all began posting tweets promising free cryptocurrency to followers who sent Bitcoin to a specific address within the next 30 minutes. The crypto scam turned out to be part of a massive coordinated hack affecting dozens of major Twitter accounts with millions of followers, the largest security breach in the company’s history.</p><p>The hack compromised the Twitter accounts of former U.S. President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Joe Biden, billionaire tech founders and CEOs Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and major tech companies such as Apple and Coinbase. Overall, 130 accounts were targeted. After fears grew that Twitter had been fatally compromised, the company blocked tweets from verified accounts as it assessed the damage, many of which were restored a few hours later. </p><p>According to the Bitcoin address used in the tweets, scammers likely made off with over a hundred thousand dollars within just a few minutes. The tweets were all a variation of the same message, offering followers a chance to double their Bitcoin in return for simply sending some to a specified address.</p><p>“I am giving back to the community. All Bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back doubled! If you send $1,000, I will send back $2,000. Only doing this for 30 minutes,” read a typical tweet. The crypto scam closely followed the Bitcoin impersonation scams that proliferated on Twitter following the big crypto boom in 2017, except this time, instead of scammers impersonating Twitter accounts, they hacked them.</p><p>While on the surface it appears like the attack was primarily carried out to scam followers out of Bitcoin, it’s possible that the attackers were actually after something more valuable - the direct messages of high-profile politicians, tech executives, and celebrities. According to Twitter’s official support account, attackers were able to download all of the data for eight of the compromised accounts using the platform’s “Your Twitter Data” tool.</p><blockquote><p>For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “Your Twitter Data” tool. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true.</p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1284331132255756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <p></p><p>That would include direct messages and, in some cases, synced address books. Depending on which accounts the attackers stole data from, this information could be worth far more than whatever Bitcoin they collected from the crypto scam. While Twitter has not directly disclosed the eight impacted accounts, the company has said that none of the eight were Verified accounts.</p><p>Regardless, the fact that the attackers were able to download user data signals that they most likely had full access to the accounts. In order to carry out the hack, it appears as though the attackers targeted Twitter employees to gain access to the company’s internal systems. In a Twitter Support tweet, the company said, “We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”</p><p>In a followup thread on Thursday, the company said that there was no evidence that attackers accessed passwords and that instead they accessed tools only available to Twitter’s internal support teams. As of Saturday, the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">confirmed in a blog post</a> that of the 130 accounts targeted, “for 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets.”</p><p>Social engineering remains one of the most glaring weak spots when it comes to cybersecurity, as shown by last week’s hack. Some of the biggest data breaches of all time have been the result of social engineering schemes, from a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180762/inside-the-russian-hack-of-yahoo-how-they-did-it.html">phishing attack that led to 3 billion Yahoo accounts</a> being compromised to a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anatomy-of-the-target-data-breach-missed-opportunities-and-lessons-learned/">major breach that exposed over a 100 million credit cards at Target</a> in 2013.</p><p>With such vast reach, a critical security compromise of a major social media platform such as Twitter could have a far more disastrous impact if, for instance, more nefarious hackers were to gain access to and send threatening or alarmist messages from the account of a high profile politician or executive. Such a scenario could severely impact the stock market or elicit a negative response from another country.</p><p>That exact scenario happened in 2013, when a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-day-in-history-hacked-ap-tweet-about-white-house-explosions-triggers-panic-2018-04-23">single post from the Associated Press’ Twitter account</a> sent the Dow Jones into a tailspin and momentarily wiped $136.5 billion off of the S&amp;P 500’s total market capitalization. “Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama Injured,” read the tweet. It turned out to be fake and was quickly deleted, but it made clear the real world effects of insecure social media platforms.</p><p>We’re lucky that Wednesday’s hack was used for the rather mundane purpose of attempting to get followers to part with some of their cryptocurrency, it could have been much worse. Still, the frequent occurrence of major hacks and data breaches continues to be alarming.

<p>Dental staff are among the most vulnerable professions for COVID-19 infection risk. In March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that healthcare systems prioritize urgent visits and delay elective care to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings.</p>
<p>According to the April 1, 2020 edition of ADA News ("HPI poll examines impact of COVID-19 on dental practices"), by early April, 95% of dental practices were fully shuttered—or open only for emergency care.</p>
<p>A COVID-19 pandemic does not mean your teeth go on a vacation from needing cleanings, fillings, or root canals. Eventually, dental-office staff and patients need to go back to supporting their communities with peace of mind.</p>
<p>In order to enhance safety and confidence, the Georgia Academy of General Dentistry (GAGD) has partnered with MedCreds to more safely bring its members and their communities together. By promoting FDA-approved COVID-19 tests and using MedCreds’ verifiable credentialing for those tests, dentists, staff, and patients can now verify one another’s COVID-19-test-result status before any dental procedures.</p>
<p>Through COVID-19 testing and using MedCreds’ privacy-preserving COVID-19 test result credentials — which are owned and controlled exclusively by the patient—dentists can better protect staff and patients from COVID-19 infection risk.</p>
<p>ESSENTIAL TO THE PUBLIC’S HEALTH</p>
<p>In an April 17, 2020 letter written by American Dental Association (ADA) President Chad P. Gehani and Executive Director Kathleen T. O’Loughlin to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, dentistry was labeled “essential to the public’s health”.</p>
<p>“Enabling dentists to test patients prior to dental treatment will help lower the ‘very high exposure risk’ of dental personnel in contracting COVID-19 when treating infected but asymptomatic patients,” wrote Gehani and O’Loughlin in the HHS letter.</p>
<p>O'Loughlin added that testing patients prior to dental treatment would add a layer of safety for both dental personnel and the patients they treat.</p>
<p>DENTAL STAFF TEAM SAFETY</p>
<p>Dentists, dental assistants, dental hygienists, and office staff are among the most at-risk medical professions in this pandemic.</p>
<p>By strictly following ADA and CDC guidelines, and incorporating MedCreds’ verifiable COVID-19 test results credentials into safety protocols, dentists make a visible commitment to the safety of patients, staff, and their families.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>At its core, MedCreds offers a digital verifiable credential that is a simple, private, and trusted way for a person to hold—and verify to others—their medical test results.</p>
<p>Built on blockchain and cryptography technology and accepted as an open-source global technology standard, MedCreds’ verifiable credentials allow people to verify and share their health status from a smartphone or personal computer, while fully controlling who is able to access their health status information.</p>
<p>By using blockchain-supported verifiable credentials, dental patients can prove their COVID-19 and other health test result status without also sharing unnecessary personal information. This protects personal privacy, and empowers individuals to securely share personal health information.</p>
<p>At the same time, dental practices have greater confidence that staff and patients are meeting best-practice requirements for COVID-19 safety.</p>
<p>THE ‘TRIANGLE OF TRUST’</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials facilitate interactions using a pattern called the "Triangle of Trust"</p>
<p>Issuers (e.g. a certified lab or doctor) issue digital credentials to a patient.</p>
<p>Holders (that would be you) receive a digital credential from an Issuer. This credential is stored in a “digital wallet” (a mobile app) which is accessible from a phone or computer.The holder can then share their COVID-19 test result status.</p>
<p>Verifiers (e.g. a dental receptionist) are those who may request a patient’s COVID-19 test result by sharing a web-link or QR code that prompts a patient for their consent to share their test result status.</p>
<p>HOW TO IMPLEMENT MEDCREDS</p>
<p>Any dentist office can simply and quickly have a MedCreds account created. After that, dentist-office staff can invite all patients and staff to create their free accounts at MedCreds.com by sending to them an email or SMS. The test result credentials can be easily and securely issued via the MedCreds web-portal platform.</p>
<p>When a patient arrives at a dentist office, the receptionist will request that they share their COVID-19 test result (and/or other type of test such as body temperature) by scanning a QR code, or responding to an email or text message. The credential verification proof will show the required information, such as COVID-19 test date, who administered the test, and the test result. But, that verification proof will only be shared after the credential holder (the patient) reviews and approves the sharing of their credential information.</p>
<p>In addition, your patient can also share this status at other locations (e.g. schools, office buildings, airplanes), or any place/situation that requires verifying their COVID-19 test result.</p>
<p>MedCreds enables your patients and staff at your dental office to confirm that each others’ COVID-19 test results were issued by an authorized medical authority.</p>
<p>When a patient schedules a dental appointment, there are important steps that should be taken before issuing a MedCreds “digital credential.”</p>
<p>THE MEDCREDS PATIENT PROCESS</p>
<p>Step #1: A patient remotely asks a dentist to order an FDA-approved COVID-19 test from their local lab.</p>
<p>Step #2: The dentist chooses a lab where the test will be performed.</p>
<p>Step #3: The dentist receives and reviews the test result, and—using the MedCreds’ platform—issues to the patient their personal, verifiable test-result credential.</p>
<p>Step #4: The patient now owns and controls the digital COVID-19 test result credential, and can share their result using a scannable QR code.</p>
<p>Step #5: Upon arriving at the dentist office, a patient scans the QR code prepared by the office staff, and the credential verification is instantly received, proving the legitimacy of their test result. This can also create an anonymous “paper trail” of office visitors’ health test results status, if desired by the dental practice manager.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS RECOMMENDED TIMETABLE</p>
<p>Due to the current challenges and limited availability of testing in some locations, it is advisable for dentists and their patients to follow a schedule such as the one below:</p>
<p>3 Weeks Before A Dental Appointment - Schedule an appointment with a doctor to get a referral for a COVID-19 test,</p>
<p>2 Weeks Before A Dental Appointment - Have a telemedicine visit with a doctor to have a health screening. The patient will be referred to a COVID-19 test at a convenient location,</p>
<p>[NOTE: The 2 items above may be accelerated for short-notice needs]</p>
<p>1-4 Days Before Your Dental Appointment - Visit a testing site to have a test administered using an approved COVID-19 test,</p>
<p>1 Day Before Your Dental Appointment - The patient receives a medical-professional-issued COVID-19 test-result credential from MedCreds.</p>
<p>Day of Patient’s Dental Appointment - Prior to arriving at the dental office, the patient shares with the office a verification proof of their COVID-19 test result via the MedCreds app. The dental office will then have a cryptographically verifiable record of COVID-19 test results issued by an authorized medical provider.</p>
<p>This process provides assurance that all dentist-office visitors have a suitable COVID-19 test result, prior to visiting, that has been issued by an authorized medical professional.</p>
<p>By following this procedure, patients and their dental-care team are assured that participants have made extensive efforts to create a safe environment for everybody, including having cryptographically verifiable records documenting the process.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARD</p>
<p>According to a May 29, 2020 ADA press release ("CDC Guidance for Dental Settings Echoes ADA Guidance"), the CDC's Guidance for Dental Settings provides detailed patient management and facility consideration information for before, during, and after dental appointments.</p>
<p>This is in close alignment with the ADA’s Return to Work Interim Guidance Toolkit.</p>
<p>CDC and ADA recommendations include:</p>
 
 Request that dental staff call patients prior to the scheduled appointment to ask questions about their current health status.<br>
Advise patients to wear a face covering when entering the dental practice. 
 Limit the number of people who accompany a patient to the appointment. If possible, the patient should make the visit alone. 
 Assess all patients upon arrival; temperature checks may be completed. 
 Remove items in office waiting rooms such as toys or reading material to limit potential transmission through high touch surfaces. 
 Encourage social distancing practices by minimizing the number of patients in the waiting room by spacing appointments thoughtfully and perhaps by asking patients to wait in their car until the dental staff is ready to treat the patient. 
 Advise dental staff members to wear additional personal protective equipment (PPE) as appropriate, such as surgical masks or N95 masks, full face shields or goggles with side shields to ensure an environment that is as safe and healthy as possible for patients and the dental team. 
 Place hand sanitizer generously around the office for use, and ensure surfaces are cleaned regularly. 
 
<p>Headquartered in Pacifica, CA, MedCreds enables anyone that has a COVID-19 test result to hold a digital verifiable credential that can instantly and privately prove the results of their COVID-19 test, using only their mobile phone or personal computers</p>

<p></p>



<p>As the whole world has grappled with COVID-19, consumer behavior has shifted dramatically, and businesses had to respond in real-time. And while some of the changes will be temporary, industries like telemedicine, entertainment, hospitality, and fintech may never look the same. However, within real estate and self-tour, COVID-19 has acted as an accelerant, pushing companies to live in a reality that likely would have taken years to reach under any other circumstances. It’s a reality that one company is welcoming with open arms.</p>



<p>Self-isolation and social distancing have become a new way of life for most and legally mandated for many. Adapting to these new rules and norms as an individual does not mean that plans will follow suit; leases expire, families grow, and out of town job opportunities are all still very real. For an industry that has seen a rise in fraudulent actors on both sides, companies and renters alike typically only had two options: group open houses or one on one viewings, neither of which are seen as safe options today. For <a href="https://walk.in/">Walk.in</a>, a self-touring app, COVID-19 has acted as a means to expand offerings to those looking for a new home or office space in a way that feels comfortable and safe on their own terms.<br></p>







<p></p>



<p>Walk.in had already started outfitting properties with smart locks before the pandemic hit. They also built an app to facilitate self-tours to rental properties either with or without smart locks and used their own company as a test pilot.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>“The whole tour was a black box. A decision was made. We needed follow up, we needed metrics.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in<br></blockquote>



<p>Before they found <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s KYC solution</a>, interested prospective renters selected a listing online and once they clicked on it, were prompted to provide a cell phone number where a link to download the app was sent. Sperling began researching the space for identity verification tools that could be integrated into the process.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>“A lot of companies were offering a lot of unnecessary services, too many bells and whistles, Authenteq took a surgical approach to ID verification and that’s what we really needed.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>



<p>For Sperling, while identity verification was crucial, it didn’t allow for confirmation of who was actually entering the building and when. Authenteq’s selfie verification – which matches biometric data to the verified government-issued identification – allows them to not only answer those questions but brings peace of mind as it keeps the privacy and security of residents already living at that property at an all-time high. Choosing a fully automated system ensures that this all happens in real-time, eliminating both any lag time, thus enhancing the overall user experience, and the risk of human error. They have also included an AI-enhanced chat option for live feedback during tours.</p>



<p>Sperling and his team are currently collaborating with Authenteq on an advanced dashboard that will include the option for rental agents to manually override certain decisions in the rare instances where human intervention may be needed. </p>



<blockquote><p>“We do want to give our managers autonomy in the ID verification process where special circumstances may arise, but those are very rare.”&nbsp;</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>







<p>Within the last 10 months, Walk.in has expanded from a simple auto-generated SMS text message system to a fully automated sophisticated KYC and identity verification system that allows for in-depth metrics to better evaluate business operations and reduces fraudulent claims overall.</p>



<p>The launch of Walk.in during COVID-19 was a daunting feat but as Sperling puts it, “it was the ideal real-world stress test for the system,” as they were able to make ad hoc adjustments and upgrades during the launch based on usage, feedback, and any new or temporary legislation. As a family-owned business with nearly 70 years in real estate, Walk.in’s team is uniquely positioned to understand what all parties involved need and they have brought that knowledge and experience into the technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before COVID-19 hit, 30 percent of their properties were listed on the Walk.in app, after the integration with Authenteq, 100 percent are now on the platform. </p>



<blockquote><p>“If you look at history, sometimes the biggest accelerators are disasters. There are a lot of technologies that come out of wars, it’s the same thing in medicine. And if you look at the self-tour space, it was us and two other companies, now there are at least 10 others that emerged during COVID. Our main advantage is that we come from this world of real estate, we grew up here, we know it much better than somebody coming from the tech world, just trying to capitalize on this moment.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p> 
<p>Back in February (oh, how time flies! Just to think that it was right before the&nbsp;beginning of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic…) I wrote a blog post looking at Oracle’s ambitious plans for developing&nbsp;its&nbsp;cloud strategy and expanding&nbsp;its&nbsp;worldwide infrastructure footprint. The post was titled “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/will-2020-be-the-year-of-oracle-cloud">Will 2020 Be the Year of Oracle Cloud?</a>” and just five months later the company has already demonstrated that it&nbsp;does not just&nbsp;finally&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;promising&nbsp;vision for Oracle Cloud, but also a strong commitment to delivering&nbsp;on&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>A week&nbsp;ago,&nbsp;I attended an online event (yet&nbsp;another sign of the post-COVID times) hosted by Oracle’s Larry Ellison, where he spent a whole hour outlining his company’s recent achievements. And those are quite impressive indeed.&nbsp;The company’s cloud infrastructure shows significant growth not just in customer adoption, but physical size as well – currently, Oracle Cloud already has 24 regions worldwide, same as AWS,&nbsp;and planning to&nbsp;reach 36 regions by 2021. Very attractive pricing for customers with massive egress traffic requirements has already made a few prominent companies switch to Oracle from other clouds to reduce their costs – perhaps the most notable being Zoom.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>However, as I mentioned a few times in earlier posts already, Oracle has finally learned to focus their marketing efforts not on pricing alone, but on their unique differentiators – capabilities no other cloud service provides&nbsp;currently have. The key buzzword of this strategy is of course “autonomous”. Starting with the Autonomous Database in 2018, Oracle has brought Autonomous Linux to the market a year later and this time, Autonomous Data Guard was announced as a service to&nbsp;protect business-critical data in the cloud from disasters and network outages.&nbsp;Sealed from any external administrative access and powered by artificial intelligence, autonomous solutions&nbsp;largely&nbsp;eliminate the possibility of&nbsp;human&nbsp;negligence, misconfiguration, vulnerabilities left unpatched, or&nbsp;many&nbsp;kinds of malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>The biggest announcement however was that autonomous services, which for several years were only offered as a part of Oracle’s public cloud portfolio, are finally available in the company’s private cloud platform,&nbsp;Cloud@Customer. Powered by the next-generation Exadata&nbsp;Cloud@Customer&nbsp;platform, Oracle’s Autonomous Database, with all its performance benefits and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/can-autonomous-improve-security-posture">security features</a>, is finally available to customers which for various reasons were avoiding the public cloud. While the hardware and the data reside on the customer’s premises, the infrastructure is fully managed by Oracle Cloud’s engineers and the pricing is equal to the one in the public cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Thanks to the company’s cloud infrastructure platform which&nbsp;maintains&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict separation between the cloud control plane and customer&nbsp;instances and ensures that Oracle’s engineers can never access sensitive customer data, this allows for completely new hybrid deployment scenarios.&nbsp;For example, Oracle can now build a new cloud datacenter for a single customer and operate it as a dedicated&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;region with full feature parity with its public cloud&nbsp;and the same unified management console. It is by no means a cheap solution with pricing starting at $500k per month, but this just announced service already has several early adopters.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Even though Oracle has entered the cloud race significantly later than current market leaders, it had an&nbsp;opportunity to learn from their mistakes and avoid repeating them. Instead,&nbsp;it&nbsp;focused&nbsp;on its unique expertise and made&nbsp;autonomous security the foundation of its development strategy. With the latest announcements of its Gen 2&nbsp;Cloud@Customer&nbsp;platform, Oracle can offer its customers exactly the same functionality on-premises as in its public cloud, ranging from just the Autonomous Database to a full-featured private cloud datacenter with over 50 managed services. To the extent of my knowledge, no other major CSP has anything comparable to offer&nbsp;at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Last but not least, it’s worth mentioning that Oracle’s second-generation cloud infrastructure has been architected&nbsp;with a much stronger emphasis on “security by design”. Incorporating such features as advanced tenant- and resource-level isolation and off-box network virtualization, it can ensure that customers’ sensitive data is kept off-limits not just from “nosy neighbors” but from Oracle’s own administrators as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Oracle has never positioned itself as a security vendor, its cloud strategy clearly indicates that security is the company’s top priority and a foundational principle for their cloud infrastructure. This might be just the right thing you need in these turbulent times.</p>

  <p>OpenID Connect has become a leading standard for providing relying parties with identity information. With a growing global adoption, OpenID Connect faces new use cases, like eGovernment, telecommunications, and health applications, where just providing identity information is not enough. Instead, the identity provider (IDP) needs to explicitly attest the verification status of the claims delivered. More precisely, it must distinguish verified from unverified claims and provide information about the verification itself: What data was verified? How was that checked and according to which rules? When was it checked and by whom? What evidence was used in the process? This information facilitates mapping between regulatory/legal contexts and provides a basis for dispute resolution and auditing. OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance aims to solve this problem: The standard defines a robust and unambiguous representation of verified claims and verification metadata. Based on global collaboration, it includes identifiers for various international trust frameworks, identity documents, and verification methods. Fine-grained data minimization controls ensure user privacy and compliance. This talk gives an introduction to the current status of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance: From the design objectives to the data structures.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve5_2020_07_16_lodderstedt"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It looks like the whole world is currently talking (at least, tweeting) about the latest large-scale Twitter hack. High profile accounts of the likes of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos, as well as companies like Apple or Uber, were suddenly promoting a cryptocurrency scam. At first, they referred to a specific crypto-related website, but as it was quickly taken down, the hackers switched to spreading multiple Bitcoin addresses, asking people to send money to them to get a double amount of their investment back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though this type of scam is nothing new and should look obviously suspicious to anyone, the sheer size of the Twitter platform allowed hackers to reach enough gullible people to collect over $100,000 within hours.</p>
 The hack was an inside job 
<p>Looking at the number of accounts affected (including major corporations with strong security practices), it quickly became obvious that the attack was performed by a single actor with a possibility of it being an insider job at Twitter. The company later confirmed “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”</p>
<p>Several screenshots of the alleged internal tool have also leaked, showing what an employee could do to an account, including changing the email address linked to it to prevent legitimate owners from restoring their access. Various press outlets are currently speculating about the methods the hacker could have gained access to this tool from a Twitter employee: was it really a social engineering attack or an action of a malicious insider.</p>
 Inconvenient assumptions 
<p>For me, however, this is by far not the biggest question. Judging by the attack timeline and Twitter’s reaction to it, it becomes rather clear that they were not aware of malicious activities happening on such a massive scale until the attack was already underway, causing public outcries and even calls from concerned politicians. Does it imply that the company has no appropriate security monitoring tools in place, which would have at least alerted about suspicious behavioral anomalies in their network?</p>
<p>Also, the idea of employees having unchecked access to such powerful administration tools, giving them a potential ability to manipulate any account, access sensitive personal data, or even post on their behalf raises a lot of concerns. Does Twitter even have any privileged access controls in place for these tools? How could it be compliant with regulations like GDPR and CCPA?</p>
 What can users do? 
<p>Can we even trust anything posted on the platform anymore, if nobody can be protected from such attacks, not even Elon Musk or Donald Trump? And by the way, who is supposed to be held responsible for this debacle? The first thing I tried to do after I’ve read about the attack is to find the name of Twitter’s chief security officer. But apparently, the company does not have one since 2018…</p>
<p>Finally, what can we the users do? Nothing apparently. Protecting sensitive systems from malicious insiders can only be done, well, from inside the company. Unfortunately, it’s apparently too late to teach Twitter about PAM, compliance and security best practices, but at least we could teach you… Check out our latest <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/kcvepam">KCLive Event on Privileged Access Management</a>, for example – this could be a good start towards becoming smarter than Twitter!</p>

  Digital transformation has made it possible for the Organisations to become more effective and more efficient in developing new products and the ways of working, at the same time Organizations now face many challenges to their digital security. The increased connectivity needed to support mobile employees, to integrate business partners into internal processes and to get closer to their customers has increased digital risks. Protecting the digital assets, the systems, and applications in this complex hybrid IT environment requires a well-thought-out understanding of risks and countermeasures.

Identity and Access Governance (IGA) with its two core elements, Identity Provisioning and Access Governance, is essential to enabling and securing digital transformation.

This KCLive Event will focus on the main points of IGA, Its core capabilities, how to enable and protect the Digital Transformation with IGA.

Help you understand Why having infrastructure for Identity Provisioning and Access Governance in place is the cornerstone for successfully managing identities, their accounts, and their entitlements across the heterogeneous and increasingly hybrid IT infrastructure of organizations.

<p>Emerging technology is incredibly stimulating, yet so often it is idealistic in nature and seemingly theoretical. The self sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI)&nbsp;conceptual architecture has existed in the ‘idealistic’ bucket for some time. This is familiar territory — to win hearts, souls, and break new ground, it’s proponents must be prepared to set fire to ingrained foundations. If the SSI community had incepted too close to traditional archetypes it would have risked a constrained imagination. The only real option for emerging technology is to build a far, faraway island, and beat your drum loud enough for people to hear. With that comes an obligatory&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle">hype cycle</a>, and the requirement to at some point close the technical chasm. The SSI community has built that isolated island (all a little too familiar for us kiwis), and now it’s time to build the boat.</p>



<p>SSI offers an opinionated shift in the way traditional Identity Management (IdM) is architected, which often results in the two models being pitted against each other — as if one must disappear for the other to exist. This dogmatic framing overlooks the potential which exists to extend traditional IdM protocols (think boat…) towards a more user-oriented SSI model.</p>



 OpenID connect, and its advantages 



<p>When it comes to interactions that involve expressing a digital identity, the web takes the lion’s share. In relation to IdM on the web today, one core protocol that has consistently grown in popularity is OpenID Connect (OIDC). For those unfamiliar, OIDC provides the pipes that enable the use of a third party login service (eg. “Login with Facebook”) rather than creating a new account with every website you visit. OIDC provides&nbsp;many&nbsp;practical benefits — it is a pervasive, simple login service. It has reduced administrative overhead, allowing individuals to simplify the number of accounts (or distinct digital identities) they have to maintain.</p>



 OpenID Connect — what’s missing? 



<p>With all of its success, OIDC has failed users in ways that were likely unforeseen at the time. It does not provide users with a way to organise their digital existence in one place, and fails to provide complete transparency over where and how their information is used. Keeping track of, and being able to utilise our digital information to access services shouldn’t be difficult in the first place. The currently constrained (and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">damaging</a>) user experience is symptomatic of broader problems with how traditional IdM and protocols like OIDC are architectured — best illustrated by the&nbsp;<a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">identity NASCAR problem.</a></p>



The Identity Nascar Problem



<p>The term was coined to describe the assemblage of third party icons on a websites login page, which resemble the crammed sponsorship decals covering&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>&nbsp;racing cars. This has long been lamented by designers because it creates an overwhelming and crowded user experience. The logos impose a cognitive burden on users who have to choose an Identity Provider (IdP), and keep track of which one they use and where.</p>



<p>This style of federation also has distinct market consequences. In order for a website to reduce the crowd of logos on their login screens, they have to pick (say, two or three). To ensure sufficient user coverage, the websites will pick the most well known (say, Facebook and Google), creating a predictable cycle where the popular become more popular.&nbsp;Like in NASCAR, it is now near impossible to break in, as a few large oligopoly-like brands are incumbent. This can hinder the progress and adoption of emerging technologies, particularly if they threaten incumbent business models. But the evidence is showing us we need a better way — entrusting something as fundamental as how users identify on the web to a select few sets up a dangerous environment, one where even brands like Apple who pride themselves on privacy are unable to avoid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/researcher-sign-apple/">massive mistakes</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, because users converge around a few main IdPs, the amount of data accumulated is colossal (known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/samuelgoto/WebID#the-rp-tracking-problem">relying party tracking problem</a>) — this includes what sites you visit and services you use. They do not have in place measures to minimise their data collection or reduce correlation. Many Governments legally forbid the assignment of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-ids">national identifiers</a>. Good digital identity will exist only when corporations operate in frameworks where global identifiers aren’t assigned to us either.</p>



 How do we make things better? 



<p>SSI advocates for a component between the issuer/IdP and the relying party that acts on behalf of the user. This independent piece of software infrastructure acts to better preserve a user’s privacy and&nbsp;improve&nbsp;their experience. The component is often referred to as a ‘digital wallet’ or in other terminology circles as the&nbsp;‘holder’)</p>







 What makes an ecosystem that features a digital wallet more resilient against problems described above? 



<p>A couple of key points:</p>



 1. Separation of Authority and Facilitation 



  In traditional IdM, the IdP is both the issuer of the user’s identity information, AND the facilitator of services around how the user expresses their identity. This necessitates a close relationship between the issuer and the relying party (and the aforementioned&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/samuelgoto/WebID#the-rp-tracking-problem">tracking and correlation</a>).  In SSI, the digital wallet is an intermediary that acts on behalf of the user — akin to their agent. The facilitator component is removed from the IdP and is reassigned to the digital wallet. This means that the relying party doesn’t need to ‘phone home’ to validate the information from the authoritative source.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Kim Cameron</a>&nbsp;calls this “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruF1s9jF6_w&amp;feature=youtu.be">the separation of claims and recognition</a>”, acknowledging it as SSI’s biggest value.  



 2.&nbsp;Portable Identity 



  With today’s IdM technology, whether a user likes the practices of the IdP or not, it is incredibly difficult to switch to another provider. For example if you have an identity with a service that is dependent on your google account (centered around an @gmail.com address) and you would like to keep that identity but use another provider instead of google, this is virtually impossible.  In SSI, digital wallets utilise underlying technologies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers</a>&nbsp;(DIDs), which enable users to seamlessly move between different wallets — without losing their identity.  



 3. A single view for where and how your information is being used 



  In traditional IdM, individuals have no single place to go to view and organize the different dimensions to their digital identity. They have different siloed apps and website accounts, sure, but no way to view and manage this in one place. This leads to fragmentation and lack of transparency for users. A digital wallet represents a new opportunity to fill in these gaps and provide users with greater visibility into the digital presence.  



 4.&nbsp;Finally, a note on standards 



  Behind the glossy and simple user interface (isn’t this just a simple app?), digital wallets are&nbsp;incredibly complex technical beasts. This can’t really be understated. There is a robust standardisation progress occurring around the SSI community. Standards compliance and interoperability is a&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;(albeit not easy). This takes time and effort, and arm-waving is incredibly detrimental to progress. We hope to see emphasis on standards compliance show up in trust framework accreditation processes.  



 Did someone mention a boat? 



<p>Little known to many, when OIDC Core was being standardised (back in 2014), a chapter in the original specification alluded to a world similar to that put forth by SSI proponents. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self-Issued OpenID Provider&nbsp;</a>(SIOP) chapter sets out a way (albeit incomplete) on how something akin to a “digital wallet” component could fit into infrastructure based around OIDC.</p>







<p>The diagram shows the introduction of an intermediary piece of software which acts on behalf of the subject/user facilitating interactions involving their identity. SIOP introduced the idea that the user could have a role to play between the two parties, and that there could be multiple issuers of claims that could be provided to a relying party to access services. Unfortunately at the time there was no concept of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers</a>&nbsp;(DIDs), so whilst the idea was good, it was found wanting.</p>



<p>Now that we have technologies like DIDs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, decentralized ledgers, and a thriving SSI community progressing and aligning to the standards, the idea is back on the table. There is a laundry list of things to bring this to reality.&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">Client Bound End-User Assertions</a>&nbsp;is one contribution we have made to this effort. This specification addresses the need for a more formal binding mechanism between the issuer and the digital wallet.</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>There are lots of organisations involved in the effort to bring SSI and existing IdM closer together, and it is spawning momentum. To get involved look out for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/siop-virtual-meetup-2-tickets-113754506792">second&nbsp;SIOP virtual meetup</a>, and initiatives occuring in OpenID and DIF. As always,&nbsp;<a href="http://mattr.global/">reach out to us</a>&nbsp;if you want to chat. This particular effort just might be the sail for our boat.</p>

<p>Liveness Detection is an important element in user identity fraud protection. IDnow has just launched a vastly improved Liveness Detection solution for IDnow AutoIdent. Our blog article explains what Liveness actually is and what this means for our users.</p>
  
 What is “Liveness”? 
<p>In biometrics, Liveness Detection is an AI computer system’s ability to determine that it is interfacing with a physically present human being and not an inanimate spoof artifact. So, fraudsters using stolen photos, Deep Fake videos, or masks in order to access or create online accounts will be uncovered and stopped.</p>
 How to measure the successful of the application. 
<p>The sophistication of a biometric system is measured by the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). This is a specific key performance indicator that measures false acceptances with a biometric security system. It tracks and evaluates the precision of a biometric system, and therefore determines the rate at which unauthorized users are verified by the system.</p>
<p>Current regulations require a biometric system for governmental use to have a FAR of below 0.1%. In general, AI-powered solutions are able to outperform even these very high requirements. IDnow AutoIdent has a FAR of only 0.05%.</p>
 The new IDnow Liveness Detection solution. 
<p>The new solution offers an even better False Acceptance Rate of 0,00002% (that’s 1/4.2 Million!). Furthermore, the user experience has been significantly improved based on usage data and user feedback: our previous design required users to rotate their heads, which wasn’t too comfortable for many. With the new solution, the user just has to move his face closer to the camera, and the Liveness Detection will recognize and confirm in less than two seconds that it is indeed a live person’s face. This is not only an incredibly smooth user experience, but it also provides the highest level of security: even advanced masks, imposters, lookalikes, and doppelgangers can be spotted with an unprecedented level of accuracy.<br>
</p>
 Trust in AI-powered solutions. 
<p>IDnow continues to see an increasing trust in AutoIdent – from January until June, transactions have increased over 1000%. And based on our expertise, this confidence is justified: with the new Liveness Detection solution, we are able to provide an outstanding user experience and reliably prevent identity fraud at the same time.</p>

<p>by Jacqueline Arlt, Senior  Recruiting Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the last couple of years, IDnow has been growing exponentially, not just in its number of employees, but also concerning market share and global expansion.</p>
<p>Today, we tend to look at IDnow as a scale-up, rather than a start-up. There are a few key differences between those two notations: A start-up is highly experimental with short product and engineering iteration cycles. They are often in the early stages of the funding cycle and haven’t yet figured out which processes work best for them, e.g., in Sales or Marketing. On the contrary, over the course of the last couple of years, IDnow has validated the main building blocks for accelerated growth: product-market fit, a proven go-to-market strategy in its core DACH region, as well as an established business model.</p>
 
  To be able to ensure the product-market-fit, it is not only essential to understand the market needs, but also how to satisfy those needs in the best possible way: we have proven that our product suite is beneficial to a lot of companies and we completely validated its distribution channels. This is true not only for the financial services sector but also for other market segments like mobility, gaming or insurance. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  In October 2019, we concluded our series C funding round with Corsair Capital LLC as the leading investor. Since then, we have invested in further developing our growth plans – for example, we opened up offices in London and Paris for our 10 colleagues being based in the UK and France. In addition to that, we concentrated on sharpening our technology and on scaling up our team.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  IDnow set out to hire a strong pool of talent. Instead of hiring all-rounders, we started advertising for more focused roles, so that we could boast an array of experts joining across different departments. Moreover, we concentrated on enhanced delegation in hiring department heads and team leads.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  At IDnow, we have an established onboarding process. All new starters take part in a number of sessions with every single department to get fully immersed into the IDnow team. This way, they get introduced to our company culture and mission to make the connected world a safer place. On top of this, all new starters get assigned two buddies – one within the respective department and one from another team – who will support them during the onboarding process.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Marketing also plays a major role during the scale-up phase. One has to find the right balance between efficiency and volume – plus dive deep into the data and look at the various channels in their entirety. Our Business Intelligence team is playing a key role in enabling the commercial teams to review dashboards each week and, in turn, measure performance. 
 
<p>While focusing on growth the majority of the time, it’s still important to develop the organization in a healthy manner. With some of the changes last year, we put the company’s management on a broader footing. Now we are working with the next level of leadership to empower and enable them to take the company to the next level as a scale-up. The last couple of months have also seen a strong focus on building a comprehensive and robust reporting grid for both operational and financial key performance indicators. Given the complexities of our business in terms of products, technology, and business model, it’s key to perform an in-depth analysis to be able to base&nbsp;decisions and strategies on it.</p>
<p>One of the questions we get asked in pretty much every interview is, “What’s it like working for IDnow?” In short, the culture is really open and collaborative – if you need help, you will find at least a handful of colleagues being there to answer any question you have, and it’s really fun working together. Even though we now have around 130 employees within the core team, everyone still knows each other by name, thanks to the close-knit culture IDnow displays. This isn’t just within the respective team but also between different departments – and even with colleagues based in different locations – thanks to after-work events, workouts and interdisciplinary projects. By now, we have a lot of processes and structures in place, but nothing is set in stone – if you have an idea and want to try a different course of action, then you don’t have to wait weeks for the approval. The management is highly responsive and open, so if you are up for it, you can easily make a great impact at IDnow. Even though we are not a start-up anymore, we have held on to the most important characteristics of it. We want to keep the atmosphere of a young, agile business, and continue to combine it with the benefits of an established company.&nbsp;What’s next for IDnow – what are we working toward?</p>
<blockquote><p>“The current challenge is to accomplish the scaling phase in a healthy and successful way. IDnow is well-known and established in the DACH region – we have a comprehensive customer portfolio and strong market access. Now we are focusing on the mission to expand this success and the company’s footprint to other markets and industries whilst broadening our product portfolio – we aim to be scalable, replicable and projectable. Therefore you need an experienced and passionate team that’s able to grow in an efficient way,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Authenteq, we’re continuously perfecting our product and services. However, we’ve always been silent about what we’re up to. As the security space is becoming crowded, and the Covid19 pushes the need for further digitalization in the business landscape, we are ready to break the silence and pledge to share our product updates.</p>



<p>After all, great technology is transparent technology! Here’s what we’re up to during May and June:</p>



 Building a new and fast infrastructure 



<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/privacy-by-design-and-electronic-identity-verification/">Privacy-by-design</a> is our aspiration; however, we noticed that the market is not ready for fully decentralized ID verification and <a href="https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc/">KYC</a> solution. Therefore, we decided to take a step towards building a new system that is built to meet&nbsp;the highest data security standards. Also, the new system is not only faster, but it will also give an opportunity to larger firms that require top-level security to store the data locally. We’re ready to enable our larger customers to scale with ease, while we’ll handle the data security and fraud prevention.</p>



 Image compression to decrease the drop-off rate 



<p>We understand the importance of your user experience, and therefore, over the last couple of months, we worked on improving our image compression services. With the current set-up, your users can upload their documents and selfies and finish the full onboarding process under 60 seconds.</p>



 Benefit from the localization functionality 



<p>As an internationally operating organization with various clients across the globe, we understand the importance of language. Therefore, we strive to continuously add more languages to our product. This month we added Russian language support to our Mobile SDK. We now support English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, and Russian languages! The language detection depends on both your application and the Users phone settings, and we know that this nifty localization-centric functionality will increase your conversion rates.</p>



 Simplified API 



<p>We want the Authenteq technology to be accessible to any organization that needs a trustworthy partner in navigating the ID authentication and KYC space. That’s why we improved our API and API documentation – to provide your team with a frictionless integration process even when you don’t have a delegated developer on site.</p>



<p>These couple of months enabled us to step back, evaluate our dreams, and take a healthy step forward in rebuilding the product infrastructure. The new infrastructure is future-proof and is ready to grow for scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all for the past two months! The upcoming period will be even more exciting as the new infrastructure will allow for more functionality to ease and enhance your user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to give it a try and explore what Authenteq has to offer? Start your <a href="https://customer-dashboard.app.authenteq.com/registration/">30 days trial</a>, get to know your customer, and mitigate risk.</p>
