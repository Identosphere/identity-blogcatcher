<p>Small businesses face special challenges in managing their employee onboarding and offboarding processes with limited resources. Without a fully staffed IT or HR department, there’s often just one person covering “operations” for the whole organization. And in some companies, someone with a totally unrelated job ends up running these functions.</p>
<p>We’re like that, actually. <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">As a startup</a>, YeshID has a small staff. In addition to my founder duties, I’m the one to handle IT employee onboarding and offboarding for our team. And that’s the way we want it for now — we’re keeping overhead low so we can concentrate on building the best product. But that doesn’t mean we want to skimp on laying a good foundation for tomorrow.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, efficiency and simplicity are so important. It’s not just about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-non-technical-guide-how-to-streamline-employee-onboarding-in-google-workspace/">providing an email address for new employees</a>. You have to add them to the correct organizations and groups in your Google Workspace; keep track of who has permissions for what applications; track the number and cost of app and software licenses, keep up with which teams own which services, and the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology can help you streamline, templatize, and automate your user onboarding and offboarding procedures. In this post, I’ll talk about what to look for in a tool.</p>
 User-friendly IT onboarding and offboarding 
<p>The first thing you should consider when evaluating an onboarding solution is its user-friendliness. You need a tool that is easy for both administrators (aka you) and users to navigate. The last thing you want on your already overloaded calendar is extensive training for a complicated system. Look for a solution with an intuitive interface and a straightforward setup process.</p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of a user-friendly onboarding solution is its ability to templatize and automate repetitive tasks. Look for a solution that offers customizable templates, task assignments, and email notifications. This not only saves time but also minimizes the chances of errors. You’ll also want to make sure the tool lets your employees request access to the apps they need — and that access is routed to the appropriate approver.</p>
 A secure and compliant employee onboarding and offboarding tool 
<p>Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Look for features like passwordless encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Ensure that the onboarding solution aligns with these requirements. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs.</p>
 New employee onboarding and offboarding that grows with you 
<p>Your business may be small today, but tomorrow’s looking bright! Consider whether the onboarding solution can grow with you. It should be able to accommodate a growing number of users without significant disruptions. Scalability ensures that you won’t outgrow your onboarding tool as your business expands. And with the right tools, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Beware the SSO tax</a> on this one though. Some access management solutions require you to advance your engineering practices far beyond what most small- to medium-sized businesses need. Don’t settle for a solution that requires you to jump over unnecessary hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
 Cost-effective IT onboarding solutions 
<p>Until someone invents the money tree, it’s essential to consider the overall cost of the tool in relation to the value it provides. This includes licensing fees, implementation costs, and ongoing maintenance. Make sure you’re getting the features and support you need without breaking your budget. A cost-effective solution should offer a good balance between functionality and affordability.</p>
<p>The flip side of this one is to make sure you’re not signing up for a solution that you’ll have to grow into fast. Many of the options in this space are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
 The best onboarding and offboarding for small businesses 
<p>Identity and access management in the 21st century means digital onboarding, provisioning of the hundred-and-one software apps your org uses, plus traditional hardware setup. It’s become complex (and often frustrating) for both managers and employees. Finding the right onboarding solution for your small business can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your onboarding and offboarding processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 
 Templatize and schedule onboarding and offboarding tasks to set up a repeatable process for ease and speed. 
 Assign application administrator(s) then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper owners. 
 Track provisioning/de-provisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. 
 Empower employees to initiate requests for new application access that are automatically routed to the proper application administrator. 
 And because it’s in beta, YeshID Onboard is free (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">yes, like free free</a>) for the first 100 companies to sign up (must be in Google Workspace and have 50-250 employees). 
 
<p>Start streamlining your onboarding and offboarding processes without the need for budget approval or credit card information. You’ll also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. Take something off your never-ending to-do list and <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">sign up today</a>.</p>

<p>Holochain is a framework that can augment the powers of blockchains by offering control, trust, and transparency in a local, private network — while also being able to reference a specific transaction, action, or other data on a public blockchain. </p><p>In a Holochain application every action is validated and has a cryptographically signed provenance. This validation does not require consensus, making it hyper scalable. It does this by using a mix of technologies from BitTorrent, git, and GNUPG. </p><p>The Fractal Tribute game is a Holochain application designed to address several technical challenges that groups and applications often encounter when looking for ways to deliver NFT content that is both dynamic and decentralized. It also addresses the challenge of bridging state across decentralized systems, in this case from Holochain to an EVM blockchain. Those technical challenges are solved in Fractal Tribute which enables permissionless minting of dynamic content, facilitates the distribution of raised funds based on player activity, all whilst ensuring compatibility with existing NFT metadata consumers, like OpenSea.</p> Permissionless Minting of Content <p>Although there is growing popularity for entirely on-chain NFTs, for the most part NFT content is stored somewhere off-chain for reasons of scalability. It is prohibitively expensive to store content on a blockchain. So, the usual approaches to this would be to either store the content on a network like IPFS or Arweave, or put it behind a centralized API. The former is obviously the preferable option, however if you’d like the content to be dynamic you’re still left with a problem as both IPFS and Arweave only store static assets.&nbsp;</p><p>This problem is solved in Fractal Tribute. Players are able to create artwork with each other in a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Holochain app, then permissionlessly mint it on-chain. The solution involves creating a unique ID for each NFT that combines the content and your wallet address (ID = hash(content + wallet)). This ID is generated within the EVM smart contract and a matching reference is created on the Holochain app. Because it is partly generated from the wallet doing the minting, it makes it impossible for anyone else to create the same ID. A binding between your Holochain agent and EVM wallet is established, ensuring that only you can mint NFTs for your content on both networks.</p> Making the Game Compatible with OpenSea <p>To ensure that content from the Holochain app can be seamlessly integrated with platforms like OpenSea, the project utilizes Holo gateways. These gateways are hosted on Holo, a distributed hosting platform for Holochain apps, and can request content for a specific token ID from the app and generate the necessary metadata in JSON format.</p><p>Going forward, this approach has the potential to be applied in various scenarios where tokenization of events or assets on a peer-to-peer Holochain network is desirable, including identity solutions for private Holochain networks, audits, or backing for real-world assets on-chain.</p> Distribution of Funds <p>The challenge is to fairly distribute funds raised in the minting of the limited open edition NFTs based on a percentage of contribution to the artwork produced in the game. So far, the only link between Holochain and the NFT contract is by ID. The blockchain has no awareness of player contributions in the Holochain app. To address this, a "game steward" concept is introduced. This steward, a participant in the Holochain app, calculates each participant's contributions at the end of the game and signs the percentage claim of the fund pool with their EVM private key. The smart contract on the EVM side only accepts data signed by the game steward, allowing individuals to make their claims. While this system depends on the honesty of the steward, the transparency of the process and the ability to hold the steward accountable mitigate risks.The result? All players of the game will receive a percentage of the sale of any NFT minted during the game.</p> New Utility <p>Three primary technical challenges have limited the ability of NFTs to be both dynamic and decentralized in the current ecosystem. These can be solved by bridging between a Holochain app and an EVM. The NFT is effectively minted on both networks by the binding of a Holochain agent and an EVM wallet that results in a single NFT ID. This demonstration provides significant, new utility to the NFT space and broader Web3 ecosystem.</p> Play Fractal Tribute <p><a href="https://bit.ly/fractal-tribute-blog?ref=blog.holochain.org">Play the game of Fractal Tribute</a>&nbsp;running from November 2nd at 15:00 GMT to November 7th 15:00 GMT.</p><p></p>

<p>When it comes to modern IT infrastructure, the role of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>—the open-source <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration</a> platform that automates the deployment, management and scaling of containerized software applications (apps) and services—can’t be underestimated.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-project-journey-report/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) report</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), Kubernetes is the second largest <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open-source</a> project in the world after Linux and the primary container orchestration tool for 71% of Fortune 100 companies. To understand how Kubernetes came to dominate the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a> marketplaces, we have to examine its history.</p>



 The evolution of Kubernetes 



<p>The history of Kubernetes, whose name comes from the Ancient Greek for “pilot or “helmsman” (the person at the helm who steers the ship) is often traced to 2013 when a trio of engineers at Google—Craig McLuckie, Joe Beda and Brendan Burns—pitched an idea to build an open-source container management system. These tech pioneers were looking for ways to bring Google’s internal infrastructure expertise into the realm of large-scale cloud computing and also enable Google to compete with Amazon Web Services (AWS)—the unrivaled leader among cloud providers at the time.</p>



 Traditional IT infrastructure versus virtual IT infrastructure 



<p>But to truly understand the history of Kubernetes—also often referred to as “Kube” or “K8s,” a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym#:~:text=A%20numeronym%20is%20a%20number,or%20after%20it%20is%20repeated.">numeronym</a>” (link resides outside ibm.com)—we have to look at containers in the context of traditional IT infrastructure versus virtual IT infrastructure.</p>



<p>In the past, organizations ran their apps solely on physical servers (also known as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/bare-metal-dedicated-servers">bare metal servers</a>). However, there was no way to maintain system resource boundaries for those apps. For instance, whenever a physical server ran multiple applications, one application might eat up all of the processing power, memory, storage space or other resources on that server. To prevent this from happening, businesses would run each application on a different physical server. But running apps on multiple servers creates underutilized resources and problems with an inability to scale. What’s more, having a large number of physical machines takes up space and is a costly endeavor.</p>



 Virtualization 



<p>Then came <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a>—the process that forms the foundation for cloud computing. While virtualization technology can be traced back to the late 1960s, it wasn’t widely adopted until&nbsp;the early 2000s.</p>



<p>Virtualization relies on software known as a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hypervisors">hypervisor</a>. A hypervisor is a lightweight form of software that enables multiple <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a> to run on a single physical server’s central processing unit (CPU). Each virtual machine has a guest operating system (OS), a virtual copy of the hardware that the OS requires to run&nbsp;and an application and its associated libraries and&nbsp;dependencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While VMs&nbsp;create more efficient usage of hardware resources to run apps than physical servers, they still take up a large amount of system resources. This is especially the case when numerous VMs are run on the same physical server, each with its own guest operating system.</p>



 Containers 



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">container</a> technology. A historical milestone in container development occurred in 1979 with the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroot</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), part of the Unix version 7 operating system. Chroot introduced the concept of process isolation by restricting an application’s file access to a specific directory (the root) and its children (or subprocesses).</p>



<p>Modern-day containers are defined as units of software where application code is packaged with all its libraries and dependencies. This allows applications to run quickly in any environment—whether on- or off-premises—from a desktop, private <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a> or public cloud.</p>



<p>Rather than virtualizing the&nbsp;underlying hardware like VMs, containers virtualize the&nbsp;operating system (usually as Linux or Windows). The lack of the guest OS is what makes containers lightweight, as well as faster and more portable than VMs.</p>



 Borg: The predecessor to Kubernetes 



<p>Back in the early 2000s, Google needed a way to get the best performance out of its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-server">virtual server</a> to support its growing infrastructure and deliver its public cloud platform. This led to the creation of Borg, the first unified container management system. Developed between 2003 and 2004, the Borg system is named after a group of Star Trek aliens—the Borg—cybernetic organisms who function by sharing a hive mind (collective consciousness) called “The Collective.”</p>



<p>The Borg name fit the Google project well. Borg’s large-scale <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.1?topic=model-cluster-management-software">cluster management system</a> essentially acts as a central brain for running <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization">containerized</a> workloads across its data centers. Designed to run alongside Google’s search engine, Borg was used to build Google’s internet services, including Gmail, Google Docs, Google Search, Google Maps and YouTube.</p>



<p>Borg allowed Google to run hundreds of thousands of jobs, from many different applications, across many machines. This enabled Google to accomplish high resource utilization, fault tolerance and scalability for its large-scale workloads. Borg is still used at Google today as the company’s primary internal container management system.</p>



<p>In 2013, Google introduced Omega, its second-generation container management system. Omega took the Borg ecosystem further, providing a flexible, scalable scheduling solution for large-scale computer clusters. It was also in 2013 that Docker, a key player in Kubernetes history, came into the picture.</p>



 Docker ushers in open-source containerization 



<p>Developed by dotCloud, a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a> technology company, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker">Docker</a> was released in 2013 as an open-source software tool that allowed online software developers to build, deploy and manage containerized applications.</p>



<p>Docker container technology uses the&nbsp;Linux kernel (the base component of the operating system) and features of the kernel to separate processes so they can run independently. To clear up any confusion, the Docker namesake also refers to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docker.com/company">Docker, Inc.</a> (formerly dotCloud, link resides outside ibm.com), which develops productivity tools built around its open-source containerization platform, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/">Docker open source ecosystem and community</a> (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



<p>By popularizing a lightweight container runtime and providing a simple way to package, distribute and deploy applications onto a machine, Docker provided the seeds or inspiration for the founders of Kubernetes. When Docker came on the scene, Googlers Craig McLuckie, Joe Beda and Brendan Burns were excited by Docker’s ability to build individual containers and run them on individual machines.</p>



<p>While Docker had changed the game for cloud-native infrastructure, it had limitations because it was built to run on a single <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/bg/cpl?topic=process-concept-nodes">node</a>, which made automation impossible. For instance, as apps were built for thousands of separate containers, managing them across various environments became a difficult task where each individual development had to be manually packaged. The Google team saw a need—and an opportunity—for a container orchestrator that could deploy and manage multiple containers across multiple machines. Thus, Google’s third-generation container management system, Kubernetes, was born.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/kubernetes-vs-docker/">Learn more about the differences and similarities between Kubernetes and Docker</a>



 The birth of Kubernetes 



<p>Many of the developers of Kubernetes had worked to develop Borg and wanted to build a container orchestrator that incorporated everything they had learned through the design and development of the Borg and Omega systems to produce a less complex open-source tool with a user-friendly interface (UI). As an ode to Borg, they named it Project Seven of Nine after a Star Trek: Voyager character who is a former Borg drone. While the original project name didn’t stick, it was memorialized by the seven points on the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">logo</a> (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



 Inside a Kubernetes cluster 



<p>Kubernetes architecture is based on running clusters that allow containers to run across multiple machines and environments. Each cluster typically consists of two classes of nodes:</p>



 
 Worker nodes, which run the containerized applications. 



 Control plane nodes, which control the cluster. 
 



<p>The control plane basically acts as the orchestrator of the Kubernetes cluster and includes several components—the API server (manages all interactions with Kubernetes), the control manager (handles all control processes), cloud controller manager (the interface with the cloud provider’s API), and so forth. Worker nodes run containers using container runtimes such as Docker. Pods, the smallest deployable units in a cluster hold one or more app containers and share resources, such as storage and networking information.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/kubernetes-clusters-architecture-for-rapid-controlled-cloud-app-delivery/">Read more about how Kubernetes clusters work</a>



 Kubernetes goes public 



<p>In 2014, Kubernetes made its debut as an open-source version of Borg, with Microsoft, RedHat, IBM and Docker signing on as early members of the Kubernetes community. The software tool included basic features for container orchestration, including the following:</p>



 
 Replication to deploy multiple instances of an application 



 Load balancing and service discovery 



 Basic health checking and repair 



 Scheduling to group many machines together and distribute work to them 
 



<p>In 2015, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Open_Source_Convention">O’Reilly Open Source Convention&nbsp;(OSCON)</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), the Kubernetes founders unveiled an expanded and refined version of Kubernetes—Kubernetes 1.0. Soon after, developers from the Red Hat® OpenShift® team joined the Google team, lending their engineering and enterprise experience to the project.</p>



 The history of Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation 



<p>Coinciding with the release of Kubernetes 1.0 in 2015, Google donated Kubernetes to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF) (link resides outside ibm.com), part of the nonprofit Linux Foundation. The CNCF was jointly created by numerous members of the world’s leading computing companies, including Docker, Google, Microsoft, IBM and Red Hat. The <a href="https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md">mission</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) of the CNCF is “to make cloud-native computing ubiquitous.”</p>



<p>In 2016, Kubernetes became the CNCF’s first hosted project, and by 2018, Kubernetes was CNCF’s first project to graduate. The number of actively contributing companies rose quickly to over 700 members, and Kubernetes quickly became one of the fastest-growing open-source projects in history. By 2017, it was outpacing competitors like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-a-comparison/">Docker</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-a-comparison/"> </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-a-comparison/">Swarm</a> and Apache Mesos to become the industry standard for container orchestration.</p>



 Kubernetes and cloud-native applications 



<p>Before cloud, software applications were tied to the hardware servers they were running on. But in 2018, as Kubernetes and containers became the management standard for cloud vending organizations, the concept of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> applications began to take hold. This opened the gateway for the research and development of cloud-based software.</p>



<p>Kubernetes&nbsp;aids in developing cloud-native microservices-based programs and allows for the containerization of existing apps, enabling faster app development. Kubernetes also provides the automation and observability needed to efficiently manage multiple applications at the same time. The declarative, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-an-application-programming-interface-api">API</a>-driven infrastructure of Kubernetes allows cloud-native development teams to operate independently and increase their productivity.</p>



 The continued impact of Kubernetes 



<p>The history of Kubernetes and its role as a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and microservices, continues to unfold.</p>



<p>Since Kubernetes joined the CNCF in 2016, the number of contributors <a href="https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-project-journey-report/#:~:text=Since%20joining%20CNCF%20in%20March,%2C%20representing%20a%202%2C688%25%20increase.">has grown to 8,012—a 996% increase</a> (link resides outside ibm.com). The CNCF’s flagship global conference, <a href="https://www.cncf.io/kubecon-cloudnativecon-events/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), attracts thousands of attendees and provides an annual forum for developers’ and users’ information and insights on Kubernetes and other <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> trends.</p>



<p>On the cloud transformation and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a> fronts, the adoption of Kubernetes shows no signs of slowing down. According to a report from Gartner, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3988026">The CTO’s Guide to Containers and Kubernetes</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), more than 90% of the world’s organizations will be running containerized applications in production by 2027.</p>



 IBM and Kubernetes 



<p>Back in 2014, IBM was one of the first major companies to join forces with the Kubernetes open-source community and bring container orchestration to the enterprise. Today, IBM is helping businesses navigate their ongoing cloud journeys with the implementation of Kubernetes container orchestration and other cloud-based management solutions.</p>

 An economic stroke of genius or a deathknell to a thriving community? IDnow investigates how the Brazilian gambling community feels about the upcoming regulations. 



 



<p>While Brazilian gambling operators eagerly await the approval of online gambling regulations, and the resulting new revenue streams, Brazilian players have rather mixed feelings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;July 2023, an <a href="https://igamingbrazil.com/legislacao/2023/07/26/regulamentacao-das-apostas-esportivas-6-em-cada-10-brasileiros-acreditam-que-sera-positiva/">opinion poll on upcoming Brazilian gambling regulation</a> revealed that only 64% of Brazilians&nbsp;thought that regulating sports betting in Brazil would have a positive impact on the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The top benefit of the regulation, according to 45% of respondents, was that the regulation would help reduce fraud. Other benefits mentioned were more security for bettors, and transparency of information offered by bookmakers, at 40% and 39% respectively. Around half of respondents said they would continue to bet with the same regularity as before, but 31% believed that they would bet less because of the regulation.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on players? 



<p>While there are clear economic opportunities for Brazilian operators and the government, there are also concerns in the betting community that the new rules, which would require operators to have an office in Brazil, could drive international operators away, which in turn would affect sponsorship opportunities in, for example, the Brazilian football league. An incredible <a href="https://www.gamesbras.com/english-version/2023/3/30/betting-sites-dominate-brazilian-serie-and-sponsoring-39-teams-36411.html">39 out of 40 football teams</a> in the nation’s top two leagues are sponsored by international betting sites. One of the possible consequences of the regulation is a withdrawal of sponsorship, which would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12brzcq/clubes_se_posicionam_sobre_regulamenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_das/">negatively affect the competitiveness of Brazilian clubs.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players are also showing their opposition to the way in which they will be taxed. As the proposals aim to only tax&nbsp;profits, and not factor in a player’s history of losses, players are pointing out that as most gamblers lose money most of the time, the few times they will win, they will be taxed, which they believe is unfair. The <a href="https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vida-e-cidadania/como-sites-apostas-esportivas-contornam-lei-antijogo-pais/">rate payable is 30% (withheld by operators),</a> and players must declare winnings when filing income tax.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, some Brazilian players believe that some of the higher spending and professional bettors will simply utilize VPN services to continue playing on international sites.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on operators? 



<p>One of Brazilian operator’s chief objections to the new regulation is the cost (BR$30 million) of a Brazilian gambling license (read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazliian gambling license structure here</a>), which they say is too much, especially when compared to other markets, such as <a href="https://brazilian.report/tech/2021/09/03/online-gambling-disabilities-venture-capital/">Malta (5%), Greece (5%) and the United Kingdom (15%),</a> which all arguably offer more attractive regulatory environments. However, the UK is itself going through considerable changes to its regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the plans being undertaken by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">‘From government paper to UKGC Plans: What’s next for the UK’s gambling sector.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many operators and players are also understandably wary as to where exactly the 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue tax will be generated. Many players have expressed concerns that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12q8yd8/apostas_esportivas_ganhador_ter%C3%A1_de_pagar_30_de/?rdt=33846">operators may opt for extra fees, such as account maintenance fees and withdrawal fees</a>.</p>



 A nation ready to risk it all. 



<p>It’s clear to see that&nbsp;while the general population, and of course, the Brazilian gambling industry is in favor of regulating sports betting, due to the anticipated positive impact on the country’s economy, the view from the Brazilian betting community is mostly negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is widespread fear that new restrictions could affect the competitiveness of the sector, resulting in fewer active operators, a deterioration in odds, the appearance of additional fees on platforms and even a decline in the quality of national football. Of course, it could also result in players simply deciding to flee to foreign platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as the Brazilian government expects&nbsp;to receive between BR$6 billion to BR$12 billion per year when the regulated market is operational, it appears to be a risk it’s prepared to take.</p>



 Play on. 



<p>Identity proofing and fraud protection are two areas that will become paramount in the new era of Brazilian gambling.</p>

  <p>In the first post of this three-part series, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/harness-power-your-identity-data">Harness the Power of Your Identity Data</a>, we talked about the importance and potential power of using identity data to grow your business by providing tailored digital experiences. In our second post, we took a closer look at two of the three steps you can take to grow your business with identity data. The first step is to get connected to all of your various and siloed identity data sources. The second step is to leverage the built-in ForgeRock relationship model so that your data is arranged in a way that best supports your specific business needs. Read the details of steps one and two <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/grow-your-business-identity-data">here</a>. And now let's explore the third step.</p>

 Step 3: Scale Your Operations 

<p>Connecting your data silos and designing the desired relationships among different types of identity data lays a strong foundation for a converged identity and access management (IAM) platform. This concept can hold all of your identities in a single system while catering to the unique needs of different identity populations: customers, brands, partners, suppliers, employees, and devices. However, the benefits of bringing everything together under one roof can also introduce new complexity issues if you don't have a scalable way for your IT staff to manage ongoing operations and maintenance.</p>

<p>The identity management capabilities of the ForgeRock Identity Cloud include a feature known as the Organization Model, or Org Model for short. The Org Model is what helps you bring everything together to operationalize your identity data in a way that scales across your IT teams. The Org Model is an out-of-the-box identity object that has pre-defined relationships with other identity objects, such as users, roles, and applications. It empowers you to quickly create a hierarchy of "organizations," each with their own unique identity and attributes that support the tailored experiences you need to deliver for different populations of identities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The easiest way to understand the Org Model is to imagine the organizational chart of any large company. Visualize interconnected boxes arranged in a top-down hierarchy. The CEO at the top maintains overall control and responsibility for the company, but also delegates specific responsibilities to leaders in finance, HR, legal, marketing, and other functional areas. Those leaders have specific autonomy to define the boxes in their organizations and the people within them. In the same way, our Org Model empowers you to define any kind of hierarchical identity structure that represents the reality of your business. And just like the company's organizational structure, our identity Org Model enables delegation so that the IT administrators that are closest to a given identity population can be put in charge of managing the organization, the users in it, and all the granular permissions and customizations required by that group of identities. This is the first half of how you scale your identity management operations.</p>

<p>With the ability to implement a scalable span of control through delegated administration, the Org Model is similar to how a company's organizational structure scales as it grows and changes over time. Let's look at one more analogy to understand the second half of scaling your identity management operations: inheritance.</p>

<p>Imagine an organization with many franchises around the country or even the world. Whether the franchise is a fast food chain, or an automotive dealership, certain policies and multi-brand experiences need to remain consistent. Other facets of the business need to be flexible to accommodate different supply chains, partners, and local government policies. This is why inheritance capabilities are so important. With the ForgeRock Org Model, changes made to the top-level organization, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-Orgs without requiring administrative intervention. And where required, separate organizational structures can maintain distinct policies, all subject to the requirements of the business.</p>

<p>Take the example of an automotive manufacturer looking to manage all of its independent dealerships and you giving them the flexibility to manage their business while maintaining a certain level of central visibility and control. The top CEO box in the manufacturer's Org Model gives the company this level of control in their world of digital identity. Next, the company creates Level 2 boxes, or "Orgs," for each of their defined regions in the U.S. This gives regional managers a level of control over the dealerships in their territory. The Level 2 boxes are connected and roll up to the Level 1 CEO box, just as in a company's organizational chart</p>

<p>At the third level, new Org boxes are created, which also have their own unique identity, relationships in the identity hierarchy, and the ability to have custom attributes. These Orgs are created to represent each dealership. And the owner of each dealership is given the authority (delegation) to manage certain aspects of the user experience. These could be different multifactor authentication (MFA) enrollment choices, for example. Then there's the inheritance factor, which dictates certain configuration consistencies across the entirety of the organization–maybe in this case a password length and complexity policy.</p>

 Using Identity Data to Drive the Runtime User Experience 

<p>Now that your identity data is organized according to your business needs and you have a scalable process for managing the maintenance and dynamic changes that are the reality of your business, it's time to put the data to work on the front lines.</p>

<p>This is where identity data meets access orchestration. With the right data at your disposal and an access management system with dynamic orchestration capabilities, each user's experience can be tailored to their specific needs. In one moment, a customer of yours enters their account name and, based on the data retrieved and fed into the orchestration workflow, this customer experiences a low-friction, passwordless login that is personalized. At the very same moment, one of your suppliers enters their account name into a different application and receives a tailored MFA experience based on the security negotiated between your company and the supplier's company. For this supplier, union rules prevent management from requiring their users to authenticate on their personal mobile phones. So based on your identity data, including this supplier's Org Model affiliation, the user receives a sign-in link by email. When the user clicks on the link from the computer, the user signs in with a passwordless experience that doesn't require the use of a phone.</p>

 We sit down with the Head of Compliance at Hero to discuss money laundering trends, Russians and real estate, and how companies can protect their business and customers from fraud. 



 



 What are some of the new trends you have seen in money laundering in 2023? 



<p>In 2023, the landscape of money laundering has shifted significantly, with the emergence of new methods and the adaptation of old ones. One of the most striking trends is the increasing use of cryptocurrencies. The anonymity provided by these currencies allows scammers to transfer significant funds without detection. In 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/crypto-fraud-in-2023-how-can-security-teams-fight/">hackers stole $4.3 billion</a>&nbsp;worth of cryptocurrency, marking a 37% increase from 2021. Most of these scams were carried out through social media, highlighting the need for stricter regulation in this area.</p>



<p>Furthermore, real estate remains a favored sector for money laundering. The high value of properties and the ability to transact in cash make it an attractive tool. For instance, in February 2022, Transparency International revealed that Russians linked to corruption charges had invested&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/uk-money-laundering-stats-russia-suspicious-wealth">£1.5 billion in the UK real estate market</a>. This trend underscores the importance of implementing stricter regulations to monitor and regulate real estate transactions.</p>



 Is there a noticeable difference in the money laundering techniques deployed in different countries, for example in France, compared to the UK? 



<p>While the basic techniques of money laundering are universal, each country has its nuances based on its regulation, economy, and culture. In France, for instance, the regulation is quite stringent, with bodies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/glossaire/acpr/">Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution&nbsp;(ACPR)</a>&nbsp;closely monitoring financial activities. This might push criminals to adopt more sophisticated methods or use intermediaries to launder money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, with a broader financial market and a significant presence of international finance, techniques might be more varied, ranging from shell companies to complex real estate transactions. Moreover, Brexit might have created new opportunities for money launderers due to changes in information-sharing and oversight agreements.</p>



 In France, the regulatory landscape for identity verification has changed dramatically with the introduction of PVID. Do you think PVID, and other government-approved Trust frameworks make a difference in rates of fraud and money laundering? How do you see PVID changing in the coming years? 



<p>The PVID is a tangible example of how regulation can adapt to the modern challenges of identity verification. By combining document verification with facial recognition, it provides an added layer of security, thereby reducing the risk of identity theft. This has a direct impact on fraud and money laundering rates, as it’s more challenging for criminals to deceive this system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as with any technology, it’s crucial to remain vigilant and adapt to new methods that criminals might develop to bypass these measures. In the future, I anticipate PVID to incorporate newer technologies and verification methods as they become available, while strengthening existing protocols.</p>



 What role does technology play in the proliferation of fraud and money laundering? Are there any new uses that are particular causes for concern for you? 



<p>Technology has always been a double-edged sword when it comes to fraud and money laundering. On one hand, it provides innovative tools to enhance fraud detection and prevention like advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, which can help pinpoint suspicious transaction patterns that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, technology also gives fraudsters new means to impersonate or deceive individuals. Deepfakes, for instance, can be used to fraudulently open accounts or extort money. Moreover, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, criminals have found new ways to launder money outside of traditional financial systems.</p>



 Besides adhering to regulation, what else can companies do to protect their business and customers from fraud? 



<p>Beyond mere regulatory compliance, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to protect their operations and clients. This involves investing in cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analytics, to detect and prevent fraud in real-time. Utilizing public and private databases can also assist in verifying the authenticity of clients and transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, data pooling among financial institutions can provide a holistic view of suspicious activities. Lastly, continuous training of employees on the latest fraud techniques and prevention best practices is paramount. Companies must also foster a culture of compliance, where every employee understands their role in fraud prevention.</p>



 What regulations/obligations should different sectors, including the crypto, gambling and financial sectors, expect in the coming years? What changes would you like to see implemented? 



<p>The rapid evolution of technology and financial markets means that regulation must adapt accordingly. In the cryptocurrency sector, we can expect increased regulation, especially in countries that have yet to adopt robust regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This might include stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the gambling sector, regulation might focus more on preventing gambling addiction and ensuring operators aren’t taking advantage of vulnerable individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the traditional financial sector, data pooling and increased use of artificial intelligence might be encouraged to detect and prevent fraud and money laundering.</p>



 Are there different types of fraud risks that a traditional financial service needs to be aware of compared to a fintech? 



<p>Fintechs and traditional financial institutions face unique challenges when it comes to fraud. Fintechs, especially in their early stages, might have limited resources and feel pressure to quickly onboard clients, potentially making them less vigilant. It’s a delicate balance between risk exposure and the need for growth. However, fintechs also have the advantage of being agile and can quickly adopt new technologies to combat fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, large financial institutions, while having significant resources for staffing, tools, and training, have to deal with massive transaction and onboarding volumes. This can make detecting individual fraudulent transactions more challenging. However, the future looks promising with the prospect of data pooling among financial institutions and increased use of AI for real-time fraud detection.</p>

<p>Fractal Tribute is a collaborative art game built on Holochain and inspired by r/place.&nbsp;</p><p>In this real time game, players make “moves” by placing pixels on a shared canvas, building upon all previous moves, and thus coordinating to draw new patterns and art. Each player is limited in the number of pixels they can place at one time, requiring them to work with other players to shape the canvas into particular designs. It’s a game of community building, artistic expression, and collaborative play.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can also take snapshots of the collaborative art after they make their moves. These snapshots are simultaneously minted as limited open edition NFTs on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in this case, using the Polygon network.</p> The Tech Stack <p>The game is built on the Holochain application framework, which manages app networking, data validity, and databasing in a peer-to-peer system without need for a central server. The application runs locally on players computers and is networked between them for collaboration.</p><p>When users sign into the game, they are required to bind an ERC-20 wallet to their instance of Fractal Tribute. It is this binding between Holochain private keys and the crypto wallet private keys that enables full validation of both the art itself and the NFT.&nbsp;</p><p>The Holo hosting network is used as a gateway to the Fractal Tribute application so that anyone can fetch validated content directly from the peer-to-peer game using HTTPS. These always-on nodes provide an easy, low-friction way for players and non-players to view NFT payloads — allowing a marketplace like OpenSea to make them available for purchase.&nbsp;</p> Why Connect Holochain and Blockchain? <p>Fractal Tribute was built as a demonstration of the possibilities opened by combining Holochain and Blockchain. But it is just one possible arrangement of application rules and smart contracts.</p><p>In Fractal Tribute:&nbsp;</p>  Only the original creator of the asset can mint the NFT.&nbsp;  Holochain lets you audit an accountable history of all interactions with the underlying asset. This ensures data provenance.&nbsp;  Storage of the NFT asset is distributed.  Blockchain validates the token in a public space, Holochain validates the underlying asset created in a private application.  A single, shared NFT ID referenceable in both spaces.  <p>Essentially Holochain enables unforgeable NFTs because owners can prove ownership of the NFT on a blockchain, and they can trace back to the digital asset and confirm that the NFT was minted by the creator and owner of the underlying asset.</p><p>When an artist takes a snapshot, they create an immutable bundle of actions that is cryptographically signed within the app directly. Because every move or brushstroke is signed with a private key, every artist involved in the game can audit who did what and when.&nbsp;</p><p>The snapshot is simultaneously minted as a limited open edition NFT on the Polygon network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of a URL that points to the artwork on a centralized server, which may be taken down or otherwise controlled by someone with admin privileges, NFT payloads created in Fractal Tribute are held in the distributed Holochain application where they were created, which is then bridged by a gateway node running on the distributed Holo hosting network for public visibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain’s data storage isn’t just decentralized, it’s distributed. This means that as a player you will always hold a verifiable copy of your own data, at the same time as it is backed up across the network. With accountable histories, data hashing, and distributed storage, Holochain provides a high level of security in comparison to IPFS and traditional client-server models.</p> What’s Next? <p>Fractal Tribute is a proof of concept, showing the ways that blockchain wallets and Holochain agents can be bound together and what possibilities that binding enables. The interaction between a fully distributed application for collaborative art and an NFT marketplace built on blockchain is just one possible arrangement where we can see the multiplier effects of these technologies working together.&nbsp;</p><p>How will this pattern be used? We see the possibility for creator economies not based around centralized platforms, we see value creation which doesn’t require consensus, we see games where players control their identity and data, we see new ways to create trust and provenance on the web.&nbsp;</p><p>What possibilities do you see?</p> Play Fractal Tribute <p><a href="https://bit.ly/fractal-tribute-blog?ref=blog.holochain.org">Play the game of Fractal Tribute</a> running from November 2nd at 15:00 GMT to November 7th 15:00 GMT.</p>

  <p>In today's digital landscape, the threat of malicious bots and botnets looms large over the retail industry. Manipulated by cybercriminals, these devices and networks can wreak havoc on your e-commerce platform and disrupt your customers' experience.</p>

<p>Bots and botnets are able to vigilantly monitor your inventory for must-have items, pretend to be customers, and swiftly buy up your inventory (before your actual customers have a chance to) — often reselling the items at inflated prices on third-party websites.</p>

<p>Botnets are everywhere, and this type of activity happens all the time. This practice not only impacts your sales, but it also creates a negative customer experience for customers who are eager to buy the latest and greatest item, only to find that it is already sold out. Retailers are not only left to deal with frustrated customers, but often also find themselves processing numerous returns if the bad actors fail to resell the items. The only people who benefit from this trend are the cybercriminals.</p>

 The Crucial Role Digital Identity Plays In Combating Botnets 

<p>The key to fighting back against bots and botnets is to quickly identify and authenticate those behind online activities. For example, retailers must quickly discern whether their products are being purchased by a legitimate, loyal customer who has been eagerly waiting for a new product release — or by an impersonal, automated bot from the darknet.</p>

<p>To do this, you need the ability to examine contextual identity information and use it to make informed decisions. At the same time, rather than burdening your legitimate customers with onerous authentication steps, you need to make sure the process is invisible. This involves striking a careful balance between customer experience and security.</p>

 Beating the Bots With Identity and Access Management (IAM) 

<p>ForgeRock's enterprise-grade digital identity platform enables you to identify and stop bots and botnets without driving away your real customers. With <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Authentication</a>, you can use AI-driven threat detection, plus a range of environmental, contextual, and behavioral factors, to make authentication and authorization decisions in real time — unmasking the bots. Intelligent Access also adapts login and checkout journeys to make them more challenging and complicated when there's a suspected bot. Adversely, legitimate, authenticated customers are able to check out without any hurdles whatsoever.</p>

<p>Don't let retail bots and botnets ruin your customers' experiences or your bottom line. Get an in-depth examination of how a retail bot works and how you can leverage ForgeRock to defend against bots today and as they evolve in the future by reading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/block-bots-keep-your-customers-coming-back">Block the Bots to Keep Your Customers Coming Back</a>.</p>

<p>IBM® and Microsoft—the two largest global IT companies—are working together.</p>



<p>While many may see IBM and Microsoft as competitors, we are much better partners bringing the best of both companies together to accelerate impact and influence at scale. We provide current and new clients the unique opportunity to take advantage of the combined value from our technology, cloud, and consulting services alongside our ecosystem of partners to meet ever-evolving business needs.</p>



<p>We have a proven track record of delivering meaningful innovation and industry firsts through the combination of our aligned technology portfolios and consulting services. We boast a robust partner network of hybrid multicloud, AI and security professionals and teams that are vertical smart and multicloud adept. </p>



<p>Companies can engage one of IBM and Microsoft’s distinguished roster of top worldwide global systems integrator (GSI) partners, such as IBM Consulting™. With IBM Consulting and technology, Microsoft Cloud, and Azure Red Hat® OpenShift® (ARO), companies can simplify application modernization and speed cloud adoption with flexibility and security. As a result, companies can break down silos and open closed systems to increase operational efficiency and drive real business transformation.&nbsp; </p>



 Providing joint solutions 



<p>For IBM and Microsoft, it’s not just a platform discussion. It’s about providing joint solutions companies seek to improve costs, productivity and resilience by accelerating their hybrid cloud and AI journeys. Why? Because we know a hybrid cloud approach brings an average of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/LVGDJE9N">2.5 times higher ROI</a> versus public cloud alone. And <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/ai-powered-marketing-and-sales-reach-new-heights-with-generative-ai#">trailblazers investing in AI</a> are seeing a revenue uplift of 3 to 15 percent and a sales ROI uplift of 10-20%.</p>


<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-08-17-IBM-Consulting-Collaborates-with-Microsoft-to-Help-Companies-Accelerate-Adoption-of-Generative-AI">Read more about how IBM and Microsoft are collaborating on generative AI</a>



<p>Through our dedicated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/microsoft">IBM Consulting Microsoft practice</a> we have co-funded and co-developed key solutions with Microsoft and have invested in training our consultants on Microsoft Cloud while expanding our bench of experts and capabilities through acquisitions like Neudesic. We are the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/YKRJZRPV">#1 Red Hat GSI</a> specialized in ARO. This commitment has helped us become recognized in 13 categories for this year’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-weve-progressed-our-partnership-microsoft-chris-mcguire?trackingId=vMWquV3EQN2p83L7YJDWgA%25253D%25253D/?trackingId=vMWquV3EQN2p83L7YJDWgA==">Microsoft’s Partner of the Year Awards</a>, including Microsoft’s U.S. <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/inspire/awards/winners">Partner of the Year Winner for GSI Growth Champion</a>.</p>



<p>Leveraging our deep <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/id/1_zv78wxtw?_gl=1*1pnskif*_ga*ODAxMzU2NDUyLjE2ODkxMDY4NDk.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY4OTE4MjUyMC4xMS4xLjE2ODkxODI1MjYuMC4wLjA.">expertise in managing large SAP environments</a>, we are working tightly together on numerous modernization projects like the one led for international oil and gas company<a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/omv-ibm-consulting-sap"> OMV Aktiengesellschaft</a> to drive digital transformation.</p>



<p>Many companies still see incredible value in their on-premise technology: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/application-modernization-mainframe">71% of executives</a> say mainframe-based applications are central to their business strategy. This is why our technology teams co-developed key patterns to accelerate <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/kara-todd/2023/06/20/ibm-z-and-cloud-mod-stack-on-microsoft-cloud">mainframe application modernization</a>, enabling companies to leverage both IBM Z and Microsoft Cloud capabilities to quickly grow and extend where best to meet business needs.</p>



<p>We are also working together to drive more sustainable, resilient operations through <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-asperia.ibm-maximo-application-suite-byol">IBM Maximo Application Suite</a> the <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/ibm-maximo/reviews">top-rated</a> intelligent enterprise asset management software combined with Microsoft Azure, now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ibm-maximo-application-suite-tops-list-sustainability-software/">certified for Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing</a>. This power duo has helped transform how clients like <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/t/1_ioa1i8b0">Sund &amp; Baelt</a> approach business outcomes and drive accelerated deployment, minimized costs, and ensured compliance.</p>



<p>Through our notable technology efforts, IBM has been designated as an official <a href="https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/partner/accelerating-isv-partners-growth-through-isv-success/">Microsoft independent software vendor (ISV) partner</a>. This designation distinguishes the partner solution’s interoperability, specific capabilities, commercial marketplace transactability, and demonstrated track record of customer success. This helps clients better identify proven software solutions that are best-suited for their business needs and provides IBM enhanced benefits from Microsoft to better deliver for our clients. </p>



 Power of the Microsoft Azure Marketplace 



<p>Digital marketplaces are disrupting the way clients buy software. <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/marketplaces-make-their-mark-in-the-channel/">Forrester projects</a> a shift of USD 2 trillion away from traditional direct sales to digital marketplaces.</p>



<p>We are seeing this with our clients who are asking to deploy more IBM software on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. With <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/us-partner-blog/2021/12/14/reach-4m-active-customers-by-publishing-on-microsoft-commercial-marketplace/">4 million active visitors</a> every month across 140+ geographies and ranked as one of the most favored cloud service providers, the Azure Marketplace is critical for the IBM and Microsoft partnership and our ecosystem partners.</p>



<p>To that end, IBM has deployed <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?search=ibm&amp;page=1">over 36 software offerings on the Azure Marketplace</a>, including the following SaaS products on Azure: <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-asperia.nps-saas-ibm?tab=Overview">IBM® Netezza® Performance Server</a>, <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-asperia.turbonomic_azure">IBM Turbonomic Application Resource Management</a>, <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-asperia.aspera-on-cloud?tab=Overview">IBM Aspera® on Cloud</a> and <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-asperia.singlestoredb-saas-ibm?tab=Overview">SingleStoreDB as a Service with IBM</a>. We plan to deliver more offerings on the Marketplace, in addition to the recently launched <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700076341632478&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9tGyh_mJgAMVaAutBh2NOAzXEAAYASAAEgLw7_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM watsonx</a>. With a strategic roadmap to be available on Azure, watsonx enables businesses to harness the power of foundational models and generative AI through an exceptional SaaS experience.<a>[1]</a> More offerings mean more value for our clients, helping them use up their Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitments (MACC). And in support, Microsoft recognizes Marketplace purchases as Azure Consumption Revenue (ACR) for our wider partner ecosystem.</p>



 Looking ahead 



<p>Underlying the strength of the growing IBM and Microsoft partnership is great alignment and a shared commitment to ongoing co-development, co-investments, and co-delivery for our joint clients. This means expanding our dedicated team and portfolio of offerings, and extending and building our overall ecosystem of partners that are critical to our joint clients’ growth and success. We are actively working with Microsoft engineering teams to explore areas of integrations and complementary offerings in hybrid cloud and AI and are excited for the key launches and announcements in the year ahead.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>HYPR is expanding its original mission to take a more comprehensive approach to Identity Assurance. We have introduced two cutting-edge products, HYPR Adapt and HYPR Affirm that round out the HYPR platform.</p> 
<p>We grew from a small team around a table to a multi-team organization with a range of talented specialists. Arriving at this milestone after many lessons learnt, we took a pause and looked at what worked over the last 5 years, and how we could apply them going forward.</p> 
 Exciting New Changes  
<p>As part of these changes, we are excited to announce that <a href="mailto:baljeet.sandhu@hypr.com">Baljeet Sandhu</a>, formerly our Chief Architect has been promoted to CTO. Baljeet joined us several years ago and his contributions have been invaluable to the business around too many areas to count. Robert Panebianco, is promoted to the chief architect position after many great years of service here at HYPR. Rob has been our resident cryptography expert and has done amazing things in our efforts to build a highly scalable and secure SaaS platform.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="mailto:shaun.gerner@hypr.com">Shaun Gerner</a>, who was one of our first engineering hires and first mobile engineer many years ago has been promoted to VP of Engineering. He is now responsible for running the various feature teams at HYPR who have been working with Shaun shoulder to shoulder to deliver the amazing products our customers use today.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We’re also happy to announce that Sal Rizzari is now our official VP of Infrastructure. Sal’s ability to organize a team to automate and deploy HYPR at scale has been a force multiplier for our development teams as well as our customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Our Engineering Philosophy&nbsp;  
 Solving a Problem&nbsp;  
<p>Building software is, at its core, an exercise in solving a problem for your customers; understanding the things that matter to them. As we grow we want to preserve HYPR’s traditional cycle of working with customers, delivering the next iteration, listening and refining.</p> 
<p>With this in mind, we organized around delivery-oriented feature teams. Each team includes the complete set of specialists needed to deliver the solution — developers, QA, Product and DevOps. The team takes on a customer problem and owns solutioning through delivery. They build, own and operate. It's a close group which relies on each member operating with a high context and owning their role in the team delivery. Working with a high context and problem solving mindset is fun!</p> 
 Iterating Fast  
<p>We believe that software is a process of continuous refinement and ideation. This can only happen if we move forward quickly, in small steps. We love showing our early work to feature partners and gathering feedback. Some of our best ideas have in fact, come from our customers! However, this needs to be balanced with the stability needs of a critical platform like HYPR. We facilitate this by releasing all of our features in alpha, beta and GA cycles. The expectations and guardrails in each of these are well-defined internally. Most of the iteration happens in alpha and starts tapering off as we approach GA. At GA, change control and release compatibility guidelines kick in.</p> 
 Using the Best Tools  
<p>The best available tools are necessary to enable our teams. HYPR’s tech stack uses proven platforms, like JDK, .Net and Node. We upgrade aggressively and are on the latest stable within a few months of release. Being techies at heart, we continuously watch and experiment with a wide variety of new tech. Native images for Java, Flutter for mobile UIs, WebAssembly in browsers, are just a few of the things we evaluated in 2023. Experimentation usually starts on non-critical utilities and moves gradually to core if proven successful.&nbsp;</p> 
 Baking Security In  
<p>We take a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-security-company-with-a-security-first-approach">security-first approach</a>, baking it into the design at all stages. Security design is vetted by our in-house experts. During build, automated checks in our CI pipeline continuously run static and dynamic analysis. Additionally, separate scans continuously look for CVE vulnerabilities in our libraries. We take CVEs seriously. A CVE trip will break the build at HYPR. During the testing phase, our in-house experts try to compromise the solution. The findings are reviewed with the feature team. But we don’t stop there — we invite even deeper scrutiny through our public HackerOne program.&nbsp;</p> 
 Automation Everywhere  
<p>Running a successful SaaS platform needs fast testing feedback and consistency in deployments. HYPR got this right early on. We treat our test automation code with the same standards as our production code and it lives alongside in code repositories. Highly recommend it! Our DevOps team brings similar discipline to the job. Manual configuration is for experiments only. For everything else there is Infra As Code (IAC).</p> 
 Doing More With Less  
<p>At HYPR we have always taken a pragmatic approach to building software. We choose good tools and keep the number of frameworks limited. We endeavor to apply these uniformly across teams. This gives us an advantage of being able to move people between teams and get up to speed quickly. On a new team, engineers can focus on the difference in product; the tech is already familiar.</p> 
 Our Team and the Work Ahead  
<p>HYPR aims to be the best place for engineers to work. We highly value all team members and are committed to individual empowerment aligned around not just our engineering philosophy but shared values of transparency, collaboration, impact and adaptability. I am extremely excited for our engineering voyage ahead.</p>

<p>With more and more countries implementing the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">FATF Travel Rule</a>, it has become crucial to be prepared and choose <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-ultimate-explainer-on-the-travel-rule-solution#:~:text=Shyft%20Veriscope%3A%20A%20Seamless%20%26%20Privacy,data%20retention%20features%20stand%20out.">a Travel Rule Solution</a> that can meet all your needs. But that is easier said than done, as there are several Travel Rule Solutions available in the market today, each with its specific set of features and functionalities.</p><p>In this analysis, we will juxtapose Veriscope’s features against other notable solutions in the market to provide a clearer picture of where each stands in addressing the challenges and needs of VASPs concerning Travel Rule compliance.</p> Decentralization <p>While Veriscope, Sygna, and TRUST all champion a decentralized approach, it’s Veriscope’s commitment to decentralization that truly stands out. By ensuring that its operations aren’t tied to a single point, Veriscope minimizes vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity.</p><p>This decentralized foundation, when combined with its other robust features, positions Veriscope as a holistic solution in a decentralized ecosystem.</p> No Centralized Storage of&nbsp;PII <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, VerifyVasp, TRP, TransactID, and Trust, places a high emphasis on user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>After all, in a world where data is the new gold, the decentralized storage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) becomes pivotal. And by ensuring PII isn’t stored centrally, Veriscope greatly reduces the risks of data breaches, guaranteeing users a safer environment for their&nbsp;data.</p> Open Source <p>Veriscope and TransactID have embraced the open-source model, a testament to their commitment to transparency and innovation.</p><p>This makes a big difference, as open-source platforms invite collective intelligence, allowing a community of developers to contribute, detect vulnerabilities, and enhance the system. It also ensures the platform remains up-to-date and robust against evolving&nbsp;threats.</p> Automatic Counterparty VASP Discovery <p>Veriscope and TRUST take user experience up a notch with their automatic counterparty VASP discovery feature.</p><p>This automation simplifies processes, reducing the need for manual lookups. For businesses and individuals, this means faster, more efficient transactions without the hassle of manual interventions.</p> Secure P2P PII Transmission <p>Among the available Travel Rule Solutions, Veriscope, VerifyVasp, and TransactID prioritize the secure transmission of PII between peers. This is vital in ensuring that personal data remains confidential during transit and is not vulnerable to malicious interceptions or unauthorized access.</p> Robust Counterparty Due Diligence <p>Both Veriscope and TRUST excel in performing thorough due diligence on counterparties. This rigorous process ensures that interactions are made with verified entities, minimizing the risks of fraud and enhancing the overall security of transactions.</p> Pay-as-you-go Model <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers a pay-as-you-go model, a feature that is both cost-effective and flexible. Instead of being tied down to long-term commitments, VASPs have the flexibility to pay for only what they use, making it an economical choice.</p> Interoperability <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, NotaBene, Sygna, and TRISA, emphasizes interoperability.</p><p>In an industry where systems need to communicate and integrate seamlessly, this feature ensures that Veriscope can work in tandem with various other platforms, ensuring flexibility and broader usability.</p> Historic Transaction Lookback <p>Veriscope’s historic transaction lookback feature is the only one of its kind among the Travel Rule Solutions.</p><p>This is how it works: when VASPs integrate with the Veriscope network, they are not only positioned to receive current but also historical Travel Rule requests. This ensures that VASPs maintain continuous compliance, regardless of when their partnering VASPs began complying with the FATF Travel Rule or their location globally.</p><p>As such, it confirms transactions right from the beginning and provides VASPs with the opportunity to produce any required records afterward, ensuring everyone adheres to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> User Signing (Non-Custodial Wallet Signing): <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers user signing for non-custodial wallets. This feature positions Veriscope as the definitive solution for Travel Rule compliance.</p> Address Proofs (Custodial Wallets): <p>Veriscope stands out with its address proofs for custodial wallets. This feature confirms that VASPs truly control the crypto addresses they claim, ensuring accurate data exchange for Travel Rule compliance. It shows that Veriscope emphasizes both user security and operational efficiency.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The ultimate choice isn’t about simply selecting the Travel Rule Solution with the most features, but rather, one that aligns with specific VASP needs — whether it’s decentralization, secure PII storage, or flexible payment models. As this analysis has highlighted, understanding each solution’s nuances can guide VASPs toward making informed decisions.</p><p>The right Travel Rule solution will allow VASPs to satisfy regulatory obligations while operating effectively within their unique constraints. With the regulatory landscape continuing to evolve, taking the time now to thoroughly assess and identify the optimal Travel Rule solution will establish a strong foundation for success in the approaching compliant future.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Confused over which crypto regulations are applicable in the UK? Read on to discover all about the Travel Rule, MiCA, and the UK’s proposed regulatory regime. 



 



<p>The release of the UK government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">‘Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets: Response to the consultation and call for evidence’ </a> signifies yet another significant step on the UK’s road toward crypto regulation.</p>



<p>In February 2023, in perhaps the clearest sign to date that the UK government was finally taking the challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry seriously, HM Treasury released a consultation paper on the proposed regulatory regime, which is billed by many as the UK’s answer to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>.</p>



<p>The 77-page document featured information on the current regulatory landscape for cryptoassets, definitions of different types of cryptoassets, and geographic scope of cryptoasset activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as more general guidelines regarding cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, the paper set out a proposed policy approach to bringing cryptoasset activities into the UK regulatory perimeter.</p>



 Call for evidence on UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime. 



<p>From February to the end of April 2023, the public and private sector, and those inside and outside Parliament were invited to provide feedback on the proposed policies and legislations. IDnow’s crypto regulatory experts, Rayissa Armata and Jason Tucker-Feltham pored over the consultation paper, and along with 130 other respondents and institutions, provided detailed feedback and analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2023 <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">HM Treasury published its response to the consultation</a>. In the foreword, Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The learnings gathered from our engagement have been invaluable for further informing our approach. With the future regulatory framework now taking clear shape and the Financial Services and Markets Act now passed, the UK is the obvious choice for starting and scaling a crypto asset business.</p>Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>While the vast majority (80%) of respondents were positive about the proposals, 10% had mixed feedback, and 10% were “largely critical” about the proposals. The main objections were from those who fundamentally disagreed with bringing cryptoassets within the financial services’ regulatory perimeter. Objections fell into three camps: crypto should be banned; crypto should treated in line with gambling regulation; crypto should be regulated on assets, not activities.</p>



 Feedback on UK’s proposed crypto regulations. 



<p>Feedback was collected from a mixture of industry associations, crypto native firms and FinTechs, legal and consulting firms, traditional financial services, and members of public and academia. Twenty themes and topics were identified that need to be addressed:</p>


 
 
 
 1. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) &amp; utility tokens 
 

<p>Clarify proposed treatment of NFTs and utility tokens – especially on what constitutes a financial services use case.</p>

 
 
 
 2. Geographic scope 
 

<p>Give further consideration to the treatment of overseas firms, including making clear the applicability (or not) of the Overseas Persons Exclusion (OPE), reverse solicitation, and intra-group exemptions.</p>

 
 
 
 3. Phase 1 vs phase 2 
 

<p>Delineate phase 1 and phase 2 activities in more detail, and give further consideration to potential challenges for firms and consumers.</p>

 
 
 
 4. Wholesale vs retail 
 

<p>Make stronger distinctions between services provided to professional / sophisticated investors versus retail consumers (e.g. lending, venue disclosures).</p>

 
 
 
 5. Timelines 
 

<p>Provide more clarity on timelines for phase 1 and phase 2, and seek to accelerate the overall implementation programme.</p>

 
 
 
 6. Security tokens 
 

<p>Make clear the proposed treatment of security tokens, and ensure overlapping regimes are avoided (e.g. through an explicit carve-out).</p>

 
 
 
 7. Token scope 
 

<p>Ensure cryptoasset definition used in secondary legislation is not too broad (e.g. make sure it excludes e-money, loyalty schemes, in-game money),</p>

 
 
 
 8. Staking 
 

<p>Provide clarity on the definition and future treatment of staking and consider accelerating legislation process. Consider carve-out from the scope of the collective investment scheme (CIS) regime.</p>

 
 
 
 9. Disclosures liability 
 

<p>Ensure liability framework for disclosures is proportionate –especially for tokens without an identifiable issuer.</p>

 
 
 
 10. Market abuse (cross-venue) 
 

<p>Consider a phased implementation approach toward market abuse surveillance obligations, recognizing issues associated with cross-venue information sharing.</p>

 
 
 
 11. FSMA authorization process 
 

<p>Streamline authorization process – in particular, consider appropriate transition pathways for firms registered with the FCA under its AML regime and/or already authorised under Part 4A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).</p>

 
 
 
 12. Custody scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated cryptoasset custody activities, especially with regards to self-hosted wallets and third-party arrangements.</p>

 
 
 
 13. Investment advice 
 

<p>Reconsider sequencing of cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management activities, and ensure these are included in the perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 14. SMEs 
 

<p>Take steps to minimize barriers to entry for smaller firms – e.g. through careful design of prudential requirements and issuance requirements.</p>

 
 
 
 15. Cross-border enforcement 
 

<p>Clarify how cross-border enforcement can work in practice to ensure fair and level playing field for UK-regulated firms.</p>

 
 
 
 16. Permissionless blockchains 
 

<p>Ensure the regulatory framework appropriately reflects the risks associated with permissionless (public) vs permissioned (private) blockchains.</p>

 
 
 
 17. Trading platform scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated trading platform activities, e.g. with regards to airdrops and decentralized exchanges.</p>

 
 
 
 18. Banning crypto 
 

<p>Ban certain cryptoassets from retail consumer use – or treat them akin to gambling rather than bringing them into the financial services regulatory perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 19. Transitional disclosure arrangements 
 

<p>Consider transitional disclosure arrangements for well-established tokens (e.g. Bitcoin) to differentiate them from recently issued tokens.</p>

 
 
 
 20. International coordination on DeFi 
 

<p>Avoid front-running international work on DeFi by imposing a prescriptive domestic framework.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>In light of the above, HM Treasury has pledged it will be setting out ‘modifications’ to the original proposals to provide further clarity on key areas of interest. The government’s aim is for secondary legislation to be laid in 2024, subject to Parliamentary time.</p>



<p>“It is important that the regime’s credibility be seen as robust rather than light touch, so I welcome the decision by the UK government to take the feedback from invested parties very seriously,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>A balanced and well thought out regulatory framework will likely lay the foundations in support of the UK becoming a major global crypto hub.&nbsp;The latest developments are music to the ears of traditional financial institutions, as clear rules for conducting crypto business in and out of the UK provides a level of certainty not yet demonstrated by the jurisdiction.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</blockquote>



 What should crypto firms do while they await crypto regulations?&nbsp; 



<p>While firms await rules outlined in the UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime, crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK must register with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>, and therefore comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (including the FATF guideline amendments). Only firms with appropriate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20means%20“Know%20Your%20Customer,KYC%20ebook%20for%20more%20insights">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.</p>



<p>At the beginning of 2023, out of 300 applications to the FCA, only 41 had become registered. FCA spokesperson, Charles Randell, Chair of the FCA and PSR said that more than 80% of crypto firms that had begun the process to become registered had either withdrawn their applications or been rejected. The most common reasons for not passing were that they did not meet the required AML standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the UK no longer being legally required to follow the rules outlined in the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> (5AMLD), the UK did decide to transpose the cryptocurrency regulation criteria from 5AMLD and 6AMLD into domestic legislation.&nbsp;Other relevant rules include the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps22-10-strengthening-our-financial-promotion-rules-high-risk-investments-firms-approving-financial-promotions">Financial Promotions Regime</a>, which is currently under consultation, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/2a647zxame68p5gagy3uo/devil-is-in-the-detail-for-uk-stablecoin-plans">Financial Services and Markets Bill</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-protect-access-to-cash-announced-in-queens-speech">,</a>&nbsp;which includes stablecoin regulation. </p>



 What is the UK’s ‘Travel Rule’?&nbsp; 



<p>From September 1, 2023, crypto firms operating in the UK will be required to store, verify, and&nbsp;share all information regarding crypto transfers, as per <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">the ‘Travel Rule’</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although well established among traditional financial service providers, the Travel Rule was extended to incorporate crypto activities in the revised Transfer of Funds regulation, which alongside MiCA, was officially officially published in the European Official Journal on June 9, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a>, regarded as the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, recently acknowledged the challenges associated with setting adoption and enforcement timelines across different juristictions and regions. Each FATF member state is currently madating travel rule compliance.</p>



<p>In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined what it expects from firms:&nbsp;</p>



  Take all reasonable steps and exercise all due diligence to comply with the Travel Rule.&nbsp;  



  Assume responsiblity for complying with the Travel Rule, even when using third-party suppliers.&nbsp;  



  Comply with the Travel Rule when sending or receiving a crypto to a firm in any jurisdiction that has implemented the Travel Rule.&nbsp;  



  Regularly review the implementation status of the Travel Rule in other jurisdictions and adapt business processes as appropriate.&nbsp;  



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification services for crypto </a>work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including crypto. Whether automated or expert-assisted, its online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

				  In a world of scammers attempting to separate people from their hard-earned money, the next step in security is to be able to automatically verify who you are talking to before you tell them anything.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>As of 2022, Forbes reports that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/banking-trends-and-statistics/#:~:text=The%20tides%20have%20shifted%2C%20and,prefer%20to%20bank%20in%20person.">78% of American adults</a> prefer to do their banking digitally through an app or a website. It’s not hard to see why: it’s a quick and easy way to manage your money. Unfortunately, it also provides a new way for bad actors to try to gain access to accounts by pretending to be your bank, usually through text or email. This technique, sometimes known as <a href="https://www.bancosantander.es/en/glosario/spoofing#:~:text=This%20technique%20involves%20sending%20an,or%20any%20other%20criminal%20act.">bank spoofing,</a> can be very convincing, with scammers able to edit the messages to look like they are coming from a legitimate source.</p>
<p>While most consumers will not respond to a message out of nowhere, a small percentage will respond by providing their personal information to sort out whatever problem they’ve been told is happening with their account. The result is devastating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks have numerous ways to verify their customers online, but customers have no way to verify their banks.</p>
<p>Currently, if a customer tries to access their bank account online they will need to provide their account name and password, and hopefully either some sort of multifactor authentication tied to their phone or a set of security questions. This provides a degree of security and confidence that only the correct person gets access to the account.</p>
<p>But, if the direction of interaction is reversed, and a customer receives a communication from their bank, they have three options:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Independently verify the message by logging in to their bank portal or showing up in person. (This requires additional time and energy, resulting in poor customer experience.) 
 Ignore it, assuming it is a scam. (It’s never good to have customers dismiss messages by default, particularly if the message is legitimate and urgent.) 
 Do what the message says. (Risk being scammed.) 
 
<p>So how do we tackle this problem?</p>
<p>The answer would seem to be: give banks a way to prove who they are to the customers. But our current systems simply aren’t set up for that. Would we give banks a username and password for them to use when getting in touch with a customer? That leaves the customer needing to remember two passwords, and what if the customer forgets that password? Then we’re back where we started with just having to trust the bank’s outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity offers a simpler and much more effective way for customers and banks to mutually authenticate each other before exchanging any information. It allows both parties to cryptographically verify that they are who they say they are and to do so automatically and before sharing any data.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>This ability is impossible to spoof and by connecting customers and banks this way, not only can you eliminate the need for passwords and MFA, which can be lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, the customer can verify that they are indeed interacting with the bank.</p>
<p>According to BioCatch, scams now account for <a href="https://www.biocatch.com/resources/white-paper/digital-banking-fraud-trends-apac-2023">54% of cybercrime</a> across the APAC region, with a 200% surge in voice scams from 2022 to 2023. There is an inherent lack of certainty in knowing who we are communicating with online, which is enabling these criminals. Fraud&nbsp; losses across banks amounted to <a href="https://seon.io/resources/global-banking-fraud-index/#h-costs-of-fraud">$1.6 billion</a> in 2022. Adopting these new systems will save financial institutions real money, improve your customer’s experience, confidence, and retention, and save time and energy combating fraud.</p>
<p>This communications channel can be used for so much more than verification. Once the connection is established, you can be confident in who is on the other end, enabling secure messaging between parties (from both sides the bank can send the customer updates, and the customer can ask questions or send their own messages back), banking functionality such as payments or transfers can be accessed through APIs, and much more.</p>
<p>This article is not to say how we think “oh this would be nice…” or “in a perfect world…”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Electronic design automation (EDA) is a market segment consisting of software, hardware and services with the goal of assisting in the definition, planning, design, implementation, verification and subsequent manufacturing of semiconductor devices (or chips). The primary providers of this service are semiconductor foundries or fabs.</p>



<p>While EDA solutions are not directly involved in the manufacture of chips, they play a critical role in three ways:</p>



 
 EDA tools are used to design and validate the semiconductor manufacturing process to ensure it delivers the required performance and density. 



 EDA tools are used to verify that a design will meet all the manufacturing process requirements. This area of focus is known as design for manufacturability (DFM). 



 After the chip is manufactured, there is a growing requirement to monitor the device’s performance from post-manufacturing test to deployment in the field. This third application is referred to as&nbsp;silicon lifecycle management (SLM). 
 



<p>The increasing demands for computers to match the higher fidelity simulations and modeling workloads, more competition, and the need to bring products to market faster mean that EDA HPC environments are continually growing in scale. Organizations are looking at the best leveraging technologies—such as accelerators, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization">containerization</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a>—to gain a competitive computing edge.</p>



 EDA software and integrated circuit design 



<p>Electronic design automation (EDA) software plays a pivotal role in shaping and validating cutting-edge semiconductor chips, optimizing their manufacturing processes, and ensuring that advancements in performance and density are consistently achieved with unwavering reliability.</p>



<p>The expenses associated with acquiring and maintaining the necessary computing environments, tools and IT expertise to operate EDA tools present a significant barrier for startups and small businesses seeking entry into this market. Simultaneously, these costs remain a crucial concern for established firms implementing EDA designs. Chip designers and manufacturers find themselves under immense pressure to usher in new chip generations that exhibit increased density, reliability, and efficiency and adhere to strict timelines—a pivotal factor for achieving success.</p>



<p>This challenge in integrated circuit (IC) design and manufacturing can be visualized as a triangular opportunity space, as depicted in the figure below:</p>







 EDA industry challenges 



<p>In the electronic design automation (EDA) space, design opportunities revolve around three key resources:</p>



 
 Compute infrastructure 



 Designers 



 EDA licenses 
 



<p>These resources delineate the designer’s available opportunity space.</p>



<p>For design businesses, the key challenge is selecting projects that promise the highest potential for business growth and profitability. To expand these opportunities, an increase in the pool of designers, licenses or compute infrastructure is essential.</p>



 Compute infrastructure 



<p>To expand computing infrastructure on-premises, extensive planning and time are required for the purchase, installation, configuration and utilization of compute resources. Delays may occur due to compute market bottlenecks, the authorization of new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a> resources, and the construction of electrical, cooling and power infrastructure. Even for large companies with substantial on-premises data centers, quickly meeting the demand for expanded data centers necessitates external assistance.</p>



 Designers 



<p>The second factor limiting realizable opportunities is the pool of designers. It is a challenge to hire designers, being highly skilled engineers, swiftly. The educational foundation required for design takes years to establish, and it often takes a year or more to effectively integrate new designers into existing design teams. This makes designers the most inelastic component on the left side of the figure, constraining business opportunities.</p>



 EDA licenses 



<p>Lastly, EDA licenses are usually governed by contracts specifying the permissible quantities and types of tools a firm can use. While large enterprises may explore enterprise licensing contracts that are virtually unlimited, they are prohibitively expensive for startups and small to medium-sized design firms.</p>



 Leveraging cloud computing to speed time to market 



<p>Firms (irrespective of size) aiming to expand their business horizons and gain a competitive edge in terms of time-to-market can strategically leverage two key elements to enhance opportunities: cloud computing and new EDA licensing.</p>



<p>The advent of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> enables the rapid expansion of compute infrastructure by provisioning or creating new infrastructure in public clouds within minutes, in contrast to the months required for internal infrastructure development. EDA software companies have also started offering peak-licensing models, enabling design houses to utilize EDA software in the cloud under shorter terms than traditional licensing contracts.</p>



<p>Leveraging cloud computing and new EDA licensing models, most design houses can significantly expand their business opportunity horizons. The availability of designers remains an inelastic resource; however, firms can enhance their design productivity by harnessing the automation advantages offered by EDA software and cloud computing infrastructure provisioning.</p>



 How IBM is leading EDA 



<p>In conjunction with IBM’s deep expertise in semiconductor technology, data, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, our broad EDA and HPC product portfolio encompasses systems, storage, AI, grid, and scalable job management. Our award-winning storage and data transfer products—such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/storage-scale">IBM Storage Scale</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/hpc-workload-management">IBM Spectrum LSF</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera">IBM Aspera</a>—have been tightly integrated to deliver high-performance parallel storage solutions and large-scale job management across multiple clusters and computing resources.</p>



<p>IBM Cloud EDA infrastructure offers foundry-secure patterns and environments, supported by a single point of ownership. EDA firms can quickly derive value from secure, high-performance, user-friendly cloud solutions built on top of IBM’s industry-leading cloud storage and job management infrastructure.</p>



<p>In the coming months, IBM technical leaders will publish a white paper highlighting our unique capability to offer optimized IBM public cloud infrastructure for EDA workloads, serving both large and small enterprise customers.</p>

 Towards radical transparency — between liveability, affordability, and polycrisis <p>This 2nd blogpost of the series marks the next milestone in the collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB), to increase transparency regarding the largest urban landowners in four European cities (see: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/urban-land-ownership-mapping-towards-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-1-72ff315fefff?source=collection_tagged---------0----------------------------">Blog 1</a> explaining the project purpose). This study mapped land ownership in Copenhagen (as of August, 2023) aiming to reveal the largest land owners, patterns in management of land, and resulting power dynamics in city space production.</p><p>Through these findings, we also suggest initial ways forward with regards to city space production and ownership transparency. We would love to hear your&nbsp;views.</p> Summary (short&nbsp;read) <p>Transparency is a cross-cutting human rights principle, which helps to strengthen decision-making to enable better outcomes for people. <a href="http://ihrb.org">IHRB </a>is partnering with <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> to identify the largest owners of urban land in four European cities, as part of its project <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and the Future</a>. This recognizes that knowledge of who owns space within a city is one important step (in tandem with many others) to strengthen decision-making, as well as social and environmental outcomes.</p><p>Copenhagen is known for its high quality of living, deeply rooted culture of public welfare and participation, resistance to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/blackstone-rebellion-how-one-country-worlds-biggest-commercial-landlord-denmark">speculative foreign investments</a> as well as rich urban planning and architectural scene: it is often held up as an example of equitable space production and a “liveable” city. However, in the recent decades, the d<a href="https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/architectures-dismantling-and-restructuring">ismantling and restructuring of the Danish Welfare State</a> and private-led urban development patterns have contributed to Copenhagen’s high levels of unaffordability, as well as spatial disparity and <a href="https://www.justiceinitiative.org/voices/q-and-a-my-fight-to-save-my-home-under-denmarks-harsh-ghetto-plan">discrimination</a>. Across Danish cities, the housing cost overburden (reflecting housing cost as a share in disposable income) is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">second highest</a> in Europe (see also the <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/26">Right to Dwell — Un-liveability Trends, KADK&nbsp;2018</a>).</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">Housing in Europe: Housing cost overburden: cities or rural area - Compare your country</a></p><blockquote>→ Data transparency and accessibility in Copenhagen set an example for other cities, as this information is relatively easy to access. However, from our research it is clear that, in contexts such as this, the understanding of the wider city political dynamics, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the static accessible ownership data registers.</blockquote><p>One might therefore want to call for an additional set of tools to increase the transparency and accountability for decision-making. Tools which unlock greater insights into areas such&nbsp;as:</p>  the reasons for value appreciation of land and properties (e.g. through public infrastructure development — see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">A Smart Commons</a>);  real estate transactions; and;  their main beneficiaries.  <p>As this might sound complex… the data, at least for Copenhagen, is largely&nbsp;there.</p><p>Accessibility to static <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/706756/bpfg/bbr/bygning/856a5e15-195a-4570-b387-68ef85bcf408">datasets</a> (or <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/map/706756/bpfg">map</a> interfaces — as the Little Mermaid fortunately resting on the municipal soil) sets a good ground for basic analysis of who owns what, which is still an impossible task in most&nbsp;cities.</p><p>However, extending the sensing infrastructures (civic and public) might render a possibility of updating the predominantly debt-driven land-value capture model → (see: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/cities/land-value-capture.htm">OECD</a>, 2022 &amp; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cities+for+free&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_deDE1034DE1034&amp;oq=cities+for+free&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MggIARAAGBYYHjIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMgoIBBAAGIYDGIoFMgYIBRBFGD3SAQgyMzgxajBqOagCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#">Cities for Free</a>) to better serve the greater public and environmental good in the long-term.</p> The blog that follows&nbsp;shares: <blockquote>1.

Conclusion <p>Some of the key reflections include:</p>  One of the key insights from studying land ownership in Copenhagen — a place where data transparency and availability is exemplar, is that understanding the processes, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the accessible ownership data registers.  Despite some of the aforementioned trends, Copenhagen still remains a city with large amounts of land owned by the municipality and non-profit associations. This provides lots of scope for change in face of unaffordability and future cascading crises incl. the need for climate adaptation. Here, an update to the land-value capture model where climate risks are accounted for might be of&nbsp;value.  The celebrated land-value capture model with multiplicity of its sub-mechanisms (infrastructure levy, developer obligations etc.) needs to be analyzed in its nuance. There are multiple forms of capturing value uplift and some might contribute to progressing unaffordability. For example unbalanced sale (by e.g. provision of affordable housing in the same area) of land to the highest bidder to repay infrastructure loans is still based on economic principles inadequate for the ultra-long term planning horizons cities need to look at in face of the cost of living crisis and climate adaptation necessities (see DML’s upcoming report with the Scottish Land Commission (link upcoming)).  - The attempt of fixing spatial segregation issues with neoliberal means (via the sale of non-profit land, or commodification of non-profit housing) has proven to achieve the opposite, exacerbating city-scale spatial inequalities. Dissolution of the vulnerable neighbourhoods with the goal to create a “<a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/usc">blended city</a>” in the context of decreasing affordability indicators (Fig 1. are going down) may contribute to a) pushing the “problem” to other locations b) contributing to other forms of spatial segregation and c) nimbyism.  Recognition of lack of institutional capacities to host alternative city and <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/92">housing development models</a>. The dominant debt-driven logic of the city and its infrastructure development which privileges premium price housing units is not only caused by the widely presumed single-mindedness of politicians or greed of developers. How the wider systemic context is structured sets a fertile pre-condition for this pattern: the financing sector, insurance, education and skills within municipalities or capacities to imagine alternative futures are just some of&nbsp;them.  European, and global mobilization for sustainable, affordable and liveable cities. Copenhagen is a great city and one could argue if it became more inclusive and more affordable in the current globalized context, it would face even harsher population increases which eventually would prevent affordability.  Lack of a long-term perspective — the greatness of Copenhagen is dictated not by the upscale starchitecture developments. It is the welfare state heydays stemming commons: the bikes, the open libraries with baby worlds, the work-life balance, the time to enjoy the good quality public spaces, the scale of the city, access to water, or Christiania neighbourhood in the middle of the&nbsp;city.  <p>Finally, several complex questions which require further consideration came out of this initial investigation:</p><p>In addition to relatively transparent ownership &amp; transaction <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/100060818/sfe">databases</a>:</p>  How can we increase political, societal sensing and sense-making capacities that allow us to foresee the socio-economic futures of the city based on ongoing developments e.g. on models such as land-value capture?  <p>Responding to findings around Almene boliger / Tingbjerg</p>  What institutional infrastructures can be built to make citizens resilient to gradual institutional changes that may undermine their democratic mandate?

How can local and national policy, regulation, spatial planning &amp; institutional capacities efficiently support and create favourable context for these alternative models to be efficiently deployed?  <p>Some ways forward to explore — context specific (broked down&nbsp;above)</p>  Radical, dynamic land-value uplif transparency  Capacity for new modes of governance of whole city-region land governance  Capacity to sense policy and econmic activity effects on socio-economic indicators  <p>Further, basing on DML, UNDP collaboration “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58727b5a9de4bbf0b38db631/t/5f12f01c4eab05002211f4a0/1595076643699/ExO+A+Way+Forward_System+Transformation+v07+2.pdf">A way Forward</a>”:</p>  New national statistical offices (<a href="https://pat-kane-xcjl.squarespace.com/s/ExO-A-Way-Forward_System-Transformation-v07-2.pdf">see p.&nbsp;32</a>)  New, and radically trasparent digital infrastructures that enable “<a href="https://nowthenmagazine.com/articles/verbs-not-nouns-how-language-can-shape-alternate-worldviews-giyu-tjauvaljian-yu-chieh-wu">noun to verb</a>” planning.

 The Unified Investor App is Coming… 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we’re thrilled to introduce the new white-label&nbsp;Unified Investor App, an all-in-one platform for&nbsp;issuers&nbsp;to provide their investors with a seamless experience to explore, subscribe, and manage digital securities.</p>
<p>In addition,&nbsp;distributors&nbsp;(including broker-dealers, marketplaces, exchanges, etc) can leverage this app as well to streamline operations with a fully digital experience. Distributors will now be able to effectively offer more capabilities and features for their clients to expand reach and easily handle a high volume of activities.</p>
<p>We’ve integrated the entire investor experience into one streamlined web application without needing to go to different links with all needed integrations (e.g., e-signing and liveness KYC solutions, etc.).&nbsp;Investors can now do everything with their digital securities in one place, from onboarding, searching for suitable investment opportunities, and managing their portfolio; thereby, merging the three.</p>
 The Three Features That are Consolidating: 
<p>Discover tokenized securities:&nbsp;The Invest section consists of opportunities that are available to eligible users directly on your platform.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Qualifying/subscribing:&nbsp;This part of the investor process pertains to KYC/AML checks, document signing, and payments.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			<p>Manage and trade tokenized securities:&nbsp;A dashboard for the investors to visually organize and see in real-time their portfolio, and to conduct peer-to-peer transfers, as well as to access secondary solutions such as Billboard and exchanges.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 This consolidation offers several advantages: 
 
 All-in-one UX:&nbsp;A complete and fully digital dashboard simplifying the investor’s journey. It leverages the blockchain infrastructure to make actions possible directly on the buy-side: get qualified, find opportunities, invest, redeem, trade, access asset data, etc. 
 Easier access to liquidity:&nbsp;Investors can access liquidity solutions such as centralized exchanges that issuers authorized,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--erKLTEKUWtOo_kuIOhCTreB70d4vEcyXFIWVkhInQ6fpqku7RQ6HNNNTzvl-FPtXkFZ9g">T-REX billboard</a>&nbsp;(our white-label secondary market solution for digital securities), or even DeFi protocols. 
 Secure and scalable: The cloud-based platform doesn’t require any maintenance from the operator. It is secure and scalable thanks to Tokeny’s scalable infrastructure. 
 
 How do Issuers and Distributors Benefit? 
<p>Beyond elevating the investor experience, our white-label enterprise platform significantly benefits issuers and distributors alike.</p>
<p>Issuers:&nbsp;From the issuer’s perspective, the platform seamlessly integrates the entire investor journey to reduce investors’ drop rate due to redundant processes and attract more digital-first investors, from onboarding to transferability options.</p>
<p>Distributors: The Unified Investor App is white-label, offering these distributors the opportunity to provide a branded all-in-one distribution platform to their investors. They can list carefully curated digital securities, enabling their audience to subscribe. They can qualify investors, and validate transfers with the same workflows as traditional methods, but with the added benefit of a fully digital and real-time experience.</p>
 Currently in Beta Testing 
<p>The Unified Investor Application is set to launch its first version in November, introducing a groundbreaking technological workflow that allows&nbsp;investors, issuers, and distributors to manage and navigate everything seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No longer will investors have to use separate dedicated landing pages for utilizing all of these different features, it will all happen in one place.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for our beta set to go live in the near future. We can’t wait for you to experience the convenience and seamless benefits.</p>
<p>Interested in being a beta tester, please contact us&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/contact/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--erKLTEKUWtOo_kuIOhCTreB70d4vEcyXFIWVkhInQ6fpqku7RQ6HNNNTzvl-FPtXkFZ9g">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, stay tuned for next month’s edition!</p>

<p>Many crypto wallets are out on the market, but they don't all have the same capabilities. They may be specific to a particular ecosystem or lack dapp functionality. But what if there were a way to expand a wallet's abilities to surpass these limitations? </p><p>The Filecoin network has only a few native wallet clients. How can we increase the adoption of the Filecoin network so developers and users can access the ecosystem while also integrating the benefits of the EVM? <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">Metamask's Snaps</a> are one way to add custom functionality to a widely used wallet.</p> Understanding Filecoin Wallet Addresses <p>First, for clarity, let's review some <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/wallet-stack/">wallet terminology</a>. Wallets can contain multiple accounts. Each account has an address. Think of it like a bank account with a checking account number. </p><p>Getting more technical, wallets have Secret Recovery Phrases. Accounts are derived from SRPs, creating private keys that control the account. Addresses are public and are tied to the transactions executed over the blockchain.</p><p>Filecoin has five types of addresses. The ones we'll focus on are F1 and F4. F1 is the Filecoin native address for transactions done solely over the Filecoin network. F4 is the FEVM address. FEVM, or the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine, allows developers to port any existing EVM-based smart contracts straight onto the FVM. The F4 address is a translation layer to the EVM ecosystem. &nbsp;</p><p>EVM-compatible wallets support native Ethereum addresses (Ox) and F4 addresses. But what if you want to send Filecoin from a native F1 address to an F4 or Ox address to take advantage of the FEVM ecosystem? And what if that same wallet could support native FIL transactions?</p> Introducing Filsnap <p>Filsnap is a MetaMask plugin, or <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">snap</a>, that adds support for Filecoin native accounts and functionality. MetaMask only supports the EVM ecosystem, so Fission's plugin enables users to utilize MetaMask as a Filecoin wallet.</p><p>Filecoin native wallet: Filsnap can send transactions and receive assets using F1 addresses.</p><p>F1 to F4: Say a person has a wallet supporting only Filecoin native F1 addresses. The user could send their assets to Filsnap and, from there, send assets to F4 addresses. The same goes for exchanges like Coinbase, which doesn't support F4 addresses yet. </p><p>F4 to F1: Say a user wants to withdraw yield from a liquidity pool and put it in cold storage. They can send assets from an F4 address in the Filsnap wallet to the cold wallet that supports F1 addresses via a FilForwarder smart contract. This contract translates from FEVM to native.</p> The Filsnap Library <p>Although Filecoin JS libraries were already available, we chose not to reuse them for a few reasons. First, MetaMask is constantly changing, and we wanted to ensure the code was as up-to-date as possible. Second, the existing libraries are big and weighed down by many dependencies. A lightweight wallet client is preferred for a better user experience when working with the blockchain. Third, because we take security so seriously, we had all of the cryptography dependencies in our library independently audited for peace of mind.</p><p>The new <a href="https://github.com/hugomrdias/iso-repo/tree/main/packages/iso-filecoin">Filecoin JavaScript Library - iso-filecoin</a> is the foundation for three packages - Filsnap, Filsnap Adapter, and Filsnap Adapter React. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/snap">Filsnap</a> is the snap installed in the MetaMask extension. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter">Filsnap Adapter</a> enables developers to interact with Filsnap from a dapp. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter-react">Filsnap Adapter React</a> includes React-specific hooks for dapp integration. &nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, there are few native Filecoin wallets, and the existing ones don't expose their functionality to dapps. Filsnap, however, has an API for transactions on the native layer, enabling developers to build apps with native Filecoin functionality! </p> The Filsnap Demo <p>The Filsnap demo supports Filecoin native and FEVM transactions using either Filsnap for native or Metamask for EVM. As mentioned above, it's a great way to manage your assets despite the current technical limitations in wallets and exchanges. <a href="https://filecointldr.io/article/guide-how-to-transfer-fil-from-coinbase-to-a-metamask-wallet-0x">It used to be much more complicated</a>, but now you can do it all in the Filsnap demo app.</p><p>Another benefit of using the Filsnap demo app is security through verifiability. Anyone can verify the snap installed in Metamask through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/filsnap/v/0.3.2#user-content-provenance">NPM Provenance</a> and the app code using <a href="https://bafybeihevfatvsypn35ywbloc4vrjpjpk5akhqv7yi4d7mrahzaaatcmp4.ipfs.dweb.link/">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/actions/runs/5984204522/attempts/1#summary-16235152758">GitHub</a>.</p>Release Information: https://filsnap.fission.app/<p>Every app release and git tag is published to IPFS using <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/cli/working-with-apps">Fission apps</a> and can be cloned/forked from <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap">GitHub</a> if a user wishes to self-host or verify integrity using content addressing.</p> Getting Started <p>The Filsnap package has been audited, and the <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">MetaMask Snaps are now in open beta</a>.</p><p>The Fission team, lead by Hugo Dias, implemented the audited Filsnap as part of a contract with Protocol Labs. As part of this process, Hugo also wrote and open sourced the isomorphic filecoin utilities, which is now the recommended way to work with native Filecoin accounts and supporting cryptography.</p>  Isomorphic Filecoin abstractions for RPC, signatures, address, token and wallet <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/filecoin">https://github.com/fission-codes/filecoin</a>   API Docs <a href="https://fission-codes.github.io/filecoin/">https://fission-codes.github.io/filecoin/</a>  NPM <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso-filecoin">https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso-filecoin</a>  <p>Please get in touch if you'd like to support long term maintenance of core open source Filecoin utilities.</p><p>Try the <a href="https://filsnap.fission.app/">Filsnap demo</a> today, and let us know what you think!

 Discover all about the darkest form of identity theft, and how to protect your company from the threat of ghosting fraudsters. 



 



<p>Have you ever been ghosted or a victim of ‘ghosting fraud’?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While ‘ghosting’ is widely known as the sudden and random disappearance of a potential suitor, the term ‘ghosting fraud’ refers to something far darker.&nbsp;Ghosting fraud describes the theft and fraudulent use of a deceased person’s personal information.</p>



<p>One of the most notorious cases of ghosting fraud happened in 2016 in Florida, US. Two fraudsters managed to hack into a computer system, and access the records of the deceased to collect names, addresses, birth dates, and social security numbers, which they used to commit tax fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By filing multiple fake tax returns, the two scammers received fraudulent refund checks worth millions. This was all at the expense of the IRS, which had no idea that these identities were fraudulent, or even that these people were deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s unknown how many identities the fraudsters stole, they were ordered to pay back over <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/two-broward-residents-sentenced-12-and-11-years-prison-stolen-identity-tax-fraud-scheme">$1.26 million</a>, and sentenced to 11 and 12 years respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s shocking, this isn’t the only story of its kind. In fact, as the cost of living rises, ghosting fraud is becoming increasingly common.</p>



 What is ghosting fraud? 



<p>Ghosting fraud is the term used to describe a form of identity theft, where perpetrators impersonate a deceased person for financial gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraudsters will use a deceased individual’s name, address, and other confidential information to open up new lines of credit, take out loans, or, as the example above, request tax refunds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghosting fraud is made possible thanks to vulnerabilities and failures in internal controls, record keeping and monitoring systems, as well as lags in system updates. In the UK, for example, relatives have up to <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/">twelve months</a> to register a death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s worse though, is that in some regions, credit unions and lenders won’t know of a customer’s death unless they receive a dedicated phone call from a relative. Of course, this is not often a priority for grieving family members. Lenders have been known to keep lines of credit open – and charge interest – for years without an official death notification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s not necessarily the individuals of the deceased that should be most concerned, but businesses. Unlike <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, ghosting fraud doesn’t hinge on social engineering, but rather knowledge of the customer.</p>



<p>More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the different types of ghosting fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Within the realm of ghosting fraud, there are three common scams to be aware of:</p>



 Credit fraud. 



<p>Credit fraud in this context can work in two separate ways. The first involves someone close to the deceased, who has physical access to their credit accounts. Here, the perpetrator simply starts using the credit cards of the deceased without notifying the provider of their death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, credit fraud can happen when external scammers get hold of the details of the deceased. By accessing information such as their name, date of birth and social security number, the fraudster has all the information they need to apply for new accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, approximately <a href="https://business.time.com/2012/04/24/grave-robbing-2-5-million-dead-people-get-their-identities-stolen-every-year/">800,000 cases of ghosting fraud</a> happen every year for the purposes of opening new lines of credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies that should be most concerned about credit fraud are credit providers, such as credit card companies or lenders. Without specific identity checks in place or a tool to flag suspicious signals, these financial institutions stand to lose the most from ghosting fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Tax fraud. 



<p>Ghosting fraud can also affect tax authorities on a global scale. Here, criminals get hold of deceased individuals’ details, and file false tax statements in order to generate refund checks.</p>



<p>Tax fraud with ‘ghost details’ primarily affects the tax authority in the country it is happening. This year, the IRS identified approximately <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/irs-flagged-more-than-1-million-tax-returns-for-identity-fraud-in-2023.html">12,617 cases of identity theft tax fraud</a> in the US, leading to refunds of over $6.3 billion. And unfortunately, it’s highly likely that this is only the tip of the iceberg, with a high proportion of cases still undiscovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Workplace data breach. 



<p>It might not be your first thought when someone says ghosting fraud, but workplace data breaches are also high risk when an employee dies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One famous data breach at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/technology/twitter-hack-bill-gates-elon-musk.html">Twitter in 2020</a>, for example, led to over $800,000 in losses and a drop in the share price. It happened because fraudsters convinced employees that they were part of the security team, and needed to verify the identity of the workers by getting their passwords when the company moved to remote work. The fraudsters then began tweeting links to cryptocurrency scams from high-profile and celebrity accounts, generating hundreds of thousands in profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same vein, scammers can use the log-in details of deceased employees if their accounts have not been shut down by their employers.</p>



<p>Alongside the threat of huge financial consequences, falling victim to ghosting fraud might also result in reputational damage, and make it hard for businesses to attract new customers.</p>



<p>Large corporations can’t rely on death notifications from family members or on third party log-in software. Instead, continuous monitoring is key in preventing fraudulent access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the key fraud challenges for companies? 



<p>While the vast majority of ghosting fraudsters are seasoned scammers, others might be family members looking to exploit their relative’s death. This makes the fraud even harder to fight against.</p>



<p>A major challenge for some businesses is that sophisticated fraudsters can easily bypass outdated identification methods, such as only requiring details like date of birth and social security numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should be a key concern for organizations, and they should prioritize updating their identity verification services to reflect the threat of ghosting fraud, among other types of scams, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/money-laundering-threat-online-casinos/">money laundering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 How to detect and prevent ghosting fraud. 



<p>While death registers may be still stuck in the stone ages, that does not mean your organization needs to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrust the detection and prevention of ghosting fraud to a dedicated fraud prevention and identity verification platform like IDnow.</p>



<p>Our six-pronged approach to data checks involves:</p>



  A derogatory financial score<br>  Property data<br>  Vulnerability data<br>  Application data<br>  Geo-affordability&nbsp;<br>  And all-important mortality data: to ensure that the applicant is not deceased, and is therefore who they say they are  



<p>Alongside mortality data, IDnow conducts <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> for a comprehensive overview of who your customers are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ongoing monitoring, through <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/strong-customer-authentication">Strong Customer Authentication</a>, allows our clients to comply with regulatory requirements. Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">identity verification services</a> combine <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/biometric-checks-at-the-airport-ready-to-board/">biometric information</a> (such as face ID or a fingerprint) and possessions (such as a code sent to their mobile phone) alongside knowledge, for better validity in customer identity checks.&nbsp;</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 18th October to 30th&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this issue, we’ll explore the US stance on cryptocurrency mixers, the UK’s new legislation on illicit crypto, Taiwan’s initial steps into crypto regulation, and Turkey’s progress on the crypto front. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Major Global Crypto Regulatory Developments Unveiled <p>The US: As regulatory scrutiny tightens, FinCEN is eyeing increased transparency measures for crypto “mixers.”</p><p>The UK: Meanwhile, the UK has given royal assent to a bill that arms law enforcement with the power to seize crypto linked to crime. Introduced last September, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill addresses a spectrum of crimes and enables asset seizure without a formal conviction.</p><p>Taiwan: Amidst global regulatory shifts, Taiwan steps into the crypto regulatory arena with a bill presented to the Legislative Yuan. This draft legislation seeks to define operational standards and emphasizes industry affiliations. Notably, it flags potential divergences between crypto derivatives and traditional finance, hinting at tailored regulations down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>Turkey: Positioned between Europe and Asia, Turkey is charting its regulatory course. Their recent Presidential Annual Program hints at a structured crypto framework by 2024, encompassing clear legal definitions and tax guidelines, though details are still under&nbsp;wraps.</p><p>Now, with this global panorama in view, let’s delve deeper into a couple of these significant shifts and explore their broader implications for the crypto ecosystem.</p> UK Passes Law to Seize Illicit Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK’s new Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill addresses cryptocurrencies linked to illicit activities like money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorism, and cybercrimes.</p><p>One of the key provisions of the bill permits swift recovery of crime-associated crypto assets without conviction. Lawmakers expect this would enhance the capability of law enforcement agencies for quicker and more impactful asset seizures.</p><p>On the upside, this bolsters security and trust in the UK’s cryptocurrency landscape, aiming to shield consumers, appeal to institutional investors, and align with international norms. Conversely, these measures could risk overreach, infringing on individual rights, and potentially stifle innovation. There’s also the concern of unintentional asset seizures from innocent individuals, posing legal and reputational issues.</p> FinCEN Proposes New Regulation for Crypto&nbsp;Mixers <p>The US Department of the Treasury’s financial crimes unit is considering the designation of crypto mixers as a primary concern for money laundering, given their potential use by malicious actors like cybercriminals and terror&nbsp;groups.</p><p>If greenlit, financial firms would be mandated to report suspicious mixer-related transactions, possibly leading to further restrictions in their dealings with these mixers. This comes after US sanctions on mixers like Tornado Cash and Blender and increasing concerns over illegal crypto&nbsp;use.</p><a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1715427363045982413?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The proposed rule, which will be open to public feedback for 90 days, is part of FinCEN’s efforts in the crypto market&nbsp;domain.</p><p>While this initiative aims to highlight potentially dubious transactions, it might inadvertently affect legitimate users who prioritize privacy. Additionally, the increasing scrutiny might elevate operational costs for financial entities and challenge the intrinsic privacy values of the crypto&nbsp;sphere.</p> Reminder: Shape DeFi’s Future with the Shyft Network&nbsp;Survey! <p>Your opinion matters in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

<p>On November 29, 2022, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-kms-external-key-store-xks/">announced</a> the eXternal Key Store (XKS) capability for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a>. It allows customers who have a regulatory need to store and control their encryption keys on-premises or outside of the AWS cloud to do so through AWS KMS. As a result, customers can use their existing hardware security module (HSM) infrastructure to effectively store and manage their AWS KMS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide">Customer Managed Keys</a> (CMKs) on-premises or at any location of their choice.</p>
<p>Customers are therefore able to easily encrypt data with externally managed keys with their applications and more than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration">100 AWS services</a>.</p>
<p>In a previous blog titled <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/12/ownership-control-and-possession-a-new-aws-feature-for-key-management-with-the-cloud/">Ownership, Control, and Possession – A New AWS Feature For Key Management with the Cloud,</a> we focused on AWS KMS XKS integration with the Entrust enterprise key and secrets management solution KeyControl. In this blog, we’ll provide more detail relating to the AWS KMS XKS integration directly with an Entrust nShield HSM.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When data is encrypted for a customer within AWS, a unique data encryption key is generated, which is then encrypted with a CMK following a scheme known as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping">envelope encryption</a>. XKS enables this CMK to be protected and managed externally, such as within a tamper resistant and FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or FIPS 140-3 Level 31 certified HSM.</p>
<p>Instead of storing and managing the CMKs entirely within AWS KMS, with XKS they are additionally encrypted by an external key which resides and remains entirely outside the AWS cloud and under the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#xks-how-it-works">sole control of the customer organization</a>.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for providing and managing the infrastructure necessary to securely hold and manage such external keys themselves, which does introduce an additional operational burden and some greater risks to availability and performance. However, this can enable cloud use cases for several regulated workloads where encryption keys are required to be directly held by specific organizations and/or in particular geographic jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Controlling access to these externally managed CMKs provides for a customer “break glass” capability so that they can easily control access and use of CMKs supplied to their applications and other AWS services. By disabling or removing access to the externally stored key, data within the cloud can be rendered inaccessible on a temporary or permanent basis.</p>
<p>Customers have two options for building infrastructure to integrate with AWS KMS XKS:</p>
 
 Customers can use an AWS KMS XKS proxy, which is provided as <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-kms-xks-proxy">sample code online</a>. This option uses the Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)#11 interface in order to support any compatible hardware security module. Entrust nShield HSMs integrate with PKCS#11 compatible applications and are already deployed within organizations and enterprises for keeping their cryptographic key material protected on-premises. 
 Several organizations (including Entrust) offer multi-cloud key management systems, that can interface with a number of cloud service providers (CSPs), including AWS, for importing and managing CMKs using a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) approach, as well as enabling usage of CMKs through XKS with the Hold Your Own Key (HYOK) approach. These provide customers with a comprehensive lifecycle management capability and a single platform for consistent operations of multiple key types across an organization. Typically, they also use an HSM for protecting the keys within such system. 
 
<p>Using Entrust nShield HSMs in conjunction with an AWS KMS XKS proxy can be straightforwardly achieved using a suitable configuration file that references the PKCS#11 library, allowing the proxy code to work with any number of nShield Security World AES-256 keys. For increased availability, and to maintain the continued operation of applications and integrated AWS Services dependent on XKS managed CMKs, it is recommended to deploy the AWS KMS XKS proxy and nShield HSMs in multiple locations or geographies.</p>
<p>With either deployment type, internet bandwidth requirements will need to be measured, monitored, and accommodated to ensure that any network bottlenecks introduced using the AWS KMS XKS proxy or key management system do not impede or impact the operation of applications running on AWS.</p>
<p>Not all data classification categories will require external storage of keys, so AWS recommend only using this capability for scenarios where there is a regulatory or compliance need – for example, keep minimal data protected by XKS to meet requirements, but continue using AWS KMS CMKs for the rest of your data.&nbsp;It is important to remember that if an external key is permanently lost or deleted, any ciphertext encrypted under the associated KMS keys will be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>So, if you are already using AWS services and thinking about utilizing their KMS XKS capability or are planning to migrate to the cloud in the near future and are concerned about the impact of the control of your cryptographic keys, consider <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/hsm/products/nshield-hsms">Entrust nShield HSMs</a> in conjunction with AWS KMS XKS.</p>
 
<p>Note 1: nShield <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List">5c</a> and 5s FIPS 140-3 certifications currently FIPS pending (In coordination)</p>

<p>Munich, October 30, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, in collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.iata.org/">IATA</a>) and other industry partners, supported the first integrated digital identity travel experience, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. The demonstration took place on a journey from London Heathrow (LHR) to Rome Fiumicino (FCO) with British Airways.</p>



<p>“Working closely on this project with IATA and the other partners underlines our commitment to a future travel experience that is digital, efficient, and seamless. The integrated journey we demonstrated at the World Passenger Symposium in Chicago paves the way for simpler and more seamless travel experiences,” says Dr Heinrich Grave, Senior Vice President Digital Identity at IDnow.</p>



<p>“Thank you to IDnow for their collaboration in demonstrating the first fully integrated digital identity travel experience, from shopping for flights to arrival. Our goal has always been a future of travel that’s fully digital and secured with biometric identification. Though we’ve had the technology for individual steps, bringing them together has been a challenge. Today, with the support of our partners, we’ve shown it’s achievable. This is a significant stride towards simpler and smoother travel experiences in the future,” says Nick Careen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security.</p>



<p>Key highlights of the digital travel experience include:</p>



  Personalised Offers: Leveraging data, such as loyalty card details stored securely in digital wallets, to curate personalised offers for travellers.  Simplified Orders: Streamlined order generation that eliminates the need for traditional tickets, storing all essential journey details in a verifiable digital credential accessible via a QR code.  Effortless Travel Requirements Check: Pre-journey processes to confirm travel requirements, backed by IATA’s Timatic system.  “Ready to Fly” Simplifying and Securing Check-ins: Enhancing the check-in process by sharing necessary digital documents with the airline, ensuring passengers are ready for their journey.  Contactless Airport Experiences: The potential for a hands-free airport experience, facilitated through biometric gates, from security checks to boarding.  



<p>IDnow supported the project with its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>. The IDnow Wallet is used for storing and presenting digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and Digital Travel Authorizations, such as digital visas. IDnow also provides the remote identity verification solution that is used when the passenger enrolls for digital credentials in the wallet solution.</p>



<p>The LHR-FCO journey serves as a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2023-releases/2023-10-25-02/">“Proof of Concept” incubated in the IATA Innovation Lab</a>.

<p>Shared finance is defined by Forrester Research as: “Any situation in which a person acts as an observer of, partner in, or proxy for another person's finances" (Forrester, 2021). The clearest examples that fit this definition are standard joint checking accounts and shared credit cards, which are extremely common and offered by most if not all financial institutions to their customers. However, in reality, shared finance spans many use cases beyond a typical married couple’s joint finances. Examples include: parent-child finances, financial co-parenting between separated or divorced individuals who share a child, management of accounts for elderly relatives by proxy, roommates pooling funds to share common bills such as rent and utilities, and more. Many of these financial relationships are less clear-cut, grant different levels of access to different users, and their duration may vary from months to years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is value to be found for both customers and financial services organizations in each of these use cases, but this evolving approach to money management also presents a variety of challenges for financial institutions.</p>

<p>"We should hold a protest outside the Mayor's office."</p><p>So began a typical conversation at a political action meeting I attended in 2015. The discussion frequently went one of two ways. One option was disagreement — someone may raise a concern or objection like "Why should we focus on the Mayor's office when we should be trying to reach people in more populated areas?" or "We need to focus on fundraising right now, not action." Such disagreements could cascade into potentially endless debates, consuming our limited meeting time and rarely leading to consensus. Another, and in my opinion worse, option was lack of debate. A few might voice approval, and then someone would declare: "It looks like we have consensus." Over time, I grew wary of that phrase because it was almost always a lie. Rather than reflecting genuine commitment, universal approval, or even general non-opposition, it signified a group of people hesitant to face the potential discord of scenario #1. Consequently, only a few enthusiastic individuals would participate, later resenting those who abstained from a plan "the group" had supposedly endorsed.</p><p>This phenomenon is, in my experience, typical for most groups that lack explicit decision-making systems, and to some extent even those that do. I view coordination issues as central to every aspect of civil life, and its challenges as a major barrier toward prosperity. In the case of grassroots activism, I find it especially disheartening to see so many people willing to freely contribute their time toward helping others, but end up struggling with effective collaboration. The problem of how to make decisions is not new to humanity, and there are a plethora of prescriptions including various forms of despotism, democracy, and consensus. I mention the group above because its chaotic nature illustrates the organizing problem in its purest form, but I have participated in many groups with a range of structures, including traditional corporate hierarchies, Parliamentary Procedure, and Sociocracy, and in every case I have witnessed profound dissatisfaction and conflict over decision-making.</p><p>The core problem lies in balancing cohesion with scale. As more individuals participate in a decision, communication challenges escalate, potential conflicts multiply, and individuals feel their influence wane. This leads larger groups, typically, to either fail or centralize power in the hands of a smaller group of decision-makers. Even with the purest intentions, these decision-makers cannot truly harmonize vast, diverse opinions. Inevitably, they end up enforcing their chosen resolutions rather than fostering genuine consensus. Cohesion, then, arises from coercion, either overtly through force and incentives or subtly via social pressures.</p> Scaling Without Centralized Decision-Making <p>But there are some who believe it is possible to achieve group cohesion without central leadership, even at scale. They hold the dream of entire organizations, nations, and even the whole world working together and solving shared problems horizontally. Advances in internet accessibility have spurred experiments in "e-democracy," such as the citizen-generated legislation tool <a href="https://info.vtaiwan.tw/?ref=blog.holochain.org">vTaiwan</a>, Occupy Movement-inspired <a href="https://www.loomio.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Loomio</a>, and the <a href="https://pol.is/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Polis</a> polling system. Additionally, a growing academic discourse, notably <a href="https://www.ieee-jas.net/en/article/doi/10.1109/JAS.2022.105617?ref=blog.holochain.org">LSGDM</a> ("Large-Scale Group Decision Making") predominantly from Chinese universities, aims to improve collaboration among myriad stakeholders from businesses, state agencies and the public.</p><p>In 2017, I set out to make my own software to address these issues. I envisioned a user-friendly suite of digital tools that could transform any group of like-minded individuals into a cohesive organization without centralized decision-making. I gradually developed a three-part model based on research in game theory and LSGDM, my own experience, and a mediation process called <a href="https://convergentfacilitation.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Convergent Facilitation</a>. I also pulled ideas from scientific research on how birds, ants and even children manage to work together without designated leaders or concrete rules.</p><p>This package consisted of three interoperable tools:</p>  Mobilization Tool: Rooted in the principle of contingent agreement, this feature enables users to propose collective actions or events. With it, anyone can suggest a joint action or event, which other people can agree to on the contingency that every necessary role is filled. This allows group action to grow effortlessly from idea to reality without anyone having to worry about its viability. It can be used in a wide variety of contexts from hosting a party with friends to forming business agreements.  Deliberation Tool: Focused on consensus-building, this tool allows stakeholders to shift focus from outcomes to refining a set of criteria that has maximal support. Using this list, they can evaluate and refine proposals to meet those broadly supported criteria. Use cases have included forming covid policy for a school and deciding how to use a large monetary donation.  Strategy Building Tool: Designed for infinitely detailed and broad strategy mapping, this tool facilitates the construction of intertwined multi-step strategies. Participants can outline their goals as sequential phases within a grander scheme, and also identify shared objectives with others.  <p>All three pieces are designed to be used in conjunction. Deliberations and actions can be linked to goals, and actions can be linked to deliberations.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I had a basic version of each tool, I approached a handful of groups to test them, including activists, Nonprofits, and intentional communities. Several groups used them and offered feedback. I steadily improved and simplified the processes, and as I did so, I began to see their potential to achieve truly decentralized organization.</p> Why Holochain? <p>Despite several successes, a few challenges soon emerged. First, many of these groups wanted their information to be completely secure — that meant heavy encryption and private servers. Second, they had no money to pay for those servers. I did not intend to profit from these tools, but it became difficult to host new instances of my software for every group that was interested. I also realized that if my technology was ever to be used by large groups, that system was untenable.</p><p>That’s one reason I decided to move to Holochain. If I, or an organization I created, owned and controlled the software, it would exist only as long as I could support it. Investing in a structure to support group coordination requires trust, and it would help if that trust didn’t rely on the stability of one person or company. Furthermore, Holochain addressed another problem: with traditional architecture, I would have the power, and in some cases legal responsibility, to monitor and censor users. For a system to provide real liberatory power, it couldn’t be run this way. A platform designed for individuals to organize horizontally requires infrastructure that is also horizontal. With Holochain, the platform can be completely controlled and powered by its users. Moreover, as a designer and developer, I am free to focus my energy on improving the tools, without worrying about bureaucracy or scaling.</p><p>So far, I have developed two of the three tools for Holochain — "Who’s in?” to mobilize people for events or joint actions, and “Converge”, for deliberating and making collective decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>To download and try these apps, visit: <a href="https://dcan.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://dcan.app/</a></p> Who's In?: A Mobilization Tool <p>With Who’s In?, anyone can add suggested actions which can be joined by anyone in your network. They can add necessary roles for an action, and other members can commit to participating if the action gains necessary support.</p><p>Watch the Who's In? demo.</p> Converge: A Deliberation Tool <p>With the Converge app, you can start a new deliberation that anyone else in your network can join. Anyone can add and evaluate criteria, as well as add and evaluate proposals against those criteria. Controversial criteria can be objected to and alternatives can be proposed and accepted.</p><p>Watch the Converge demo.</p> Strategy Building Tool <p>The strategy mapping tool will be released soon. It will allow users to list goals they might share with others, as well as sub-goals and sub-sub-goals, and so on. These goals may then be adopted by other users, creating a unified list of popular goals. This makes it easy to see where there is shared motivation, and find out who might be interested in collaborating on what.</p> Are you in? <p>For as long as humans have existed, they have been forced to reckon with the fact that the bigger their groups, the more powerful they can be, but also the more difficult it is to organize without entrusting that power to a few people. The problem has been tackled from every possible angle, but with the advent of peer-to-peer information technology like Holochain, there is an opportunity for brand new forms of organizing to emerge, allowing humans to coordinate organically as peers. If we can crack this problem, I’m hopeful that we can unleash vast amounts of untapped human potential — and if I’m lucky, I won’t have to attend those lengthy and unproductive activist meetings ever again.</p><p>For anyone interested in learning more, visit the <a href="https://dcan.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DCAN website</a> to download and explore Who's In? and Converge.

<p>Businesses rely heavily on monitoring solutions to ensure the optimal performance and availability of their applications.&nbsp;While features and capabilities are important to evaluate, it’s also important to consider pricing to ensure the right solution that will meet your needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, many legacy APM providers have developed complicated pricing structures that make it difficult to understand exactly what the solution will end up costing and discourages broad adoption by charging per user seat. That may have worked well in the past, but it can be insufficient for today’s modern cloud-native environments. </p>



<p>Remember the issue last year when a company got a <a href="https://thenewstack.io/datadogs-65m-bill-and-why-developers-should-care/">USD 65 million surprise bill</a> from their observability solution?&nbsp;While that specific pricing policy may have been changed, many legacy APM vendors still employ complicated pricing structures that produce unexpected charges and fees.&nbsp;Let’s take a look at some key pricing features to consider when evaluating an APM or observability platform.</p>



 Transparent and predictable pricing 



<p>Instana’s pricing structure is transparent and predictable. Instana follows a per-host pricing model, where customers are charged based on the number of hosts — physical or virtual — that need to be monitored. This straightforward approach eliminates confusion and simplifies budgeting, making it easier to estimate and control monitoring costs. In contrast, legacy APM tools like New Relic employ a more complex pricing framework, including charges for a combination of hosts, user seats, throughput and data retention, leading to potential surprises in monthly bills.</p>



 All-inclusive monitoring 



<p>Be careful with solutions that offer a low entry price but have additional charges for different features. With Instana, customers get access to all features and capabilities — all included in the base price. This means that you don’t have to worry about paying extra for essential capabilities such as distributed tracing, root cause analysis, service mapping, synthetic monitoring or anomaly detection.</p>



 Pricing built for microservices and containers 



<p>As the industry shifts towards microservices and containerized environments, Instana’s pricing structure aligns perfectly with these modern architectures. Instana offers granular pricing that allows you to monitor individual containers or microservices without having to pay for an entire container cluster or host. This level of flexibility allows you to only pay for what you use, helping to optimize costs and meet the specific needs of your application architecture. Most organizations monitoring cloud-native applications want to extend observability and monitoring information to all application stakeholders. When legacy APM providers employ usage-based pricing models, it creates a quandary for customers, making them choose between providing the tool to everyone that needs it and keeping costs down.</p>



 Easier scalability and growth 



<p>For growing businesses, Instana’s pricing model provides a more scalable and cost-effective path when compared to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/resources/instana-vs-new-relic?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700078151064749&amp;p5=p&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwv-2pBhB-EiwAtsQZFOZP5GCvVVoUA519NA3MUGtjcyPoYC2AIyExbegipo7QWHYl6pdlNxoCOfsQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">New Relic</a>. As new hosts or containers are added to the infrastructure, you only pay for the additional resources being monitored, not the users monitoring it. This scalability aligns with your organization’s growth trajectory, allowing you to avoid unnecessary costs for infrastructure that is not yet deployed. And since Instana does not charge per user, it’s easy to onboard new users as you grow your business.&nbsp;In contrast, many legacy APM vendors, like New Relic, have complicated pricing structures that can become a significant cost burden as your business expands, as each new addition of a host, throughput, or data retention tier comes with additional charges.</p>



<p>Pricing considerations are a critical component when evaluating a monitoring solution.&nbsp;Having the right set of capabilities won’t do much good if the pricing structure inhibits you from using them when needed. Instana’s pricing structure offers organizations a more transparent, predictable, and cost-effective solution. Its per-host pricing, all-inclusive features, granular pricing for microservices, and scalability accommodate businesses of all sizes, so you only pay for what you need. </p>



<p>When considering a monitoring solution, it’s vital to evaluate not only the features but also the financial implications, making Instana a compelling choice for optimizing monitoring costs.&nbsp;If you have a legacy APM tool that produces surprise bills based on usage, it’s time to move to Instana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No matter how a transaction is made – whether digitally, in-person, for one-time use or a recurring payment – the transaction is often linked to a customer’s payment card. As the issuer and the cardholder’s financial institution, you’re responsible for providing secure payment options while navigating the digital transformation of many traditional banking methods to meet the needs and wants of your customer base.</p>
<p>With Mastercard’s recently launched concept, <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/pay-by-account/">Pay by Account</a>, you can revolutionize the payment process for your customers. This latest digital-first feature, supported by the Entrust Digital Card Solution, allows customers to digitize their bank accounts into their mobile apps. You can now elevate the payment experience directly within your mobile banking application, allowing consumers to make secure payments from their bank accounts, Google Wallet, or Apple Pay at any Mastercard point-of-sale (POS) terminal and display a virtual card for online transactions. Consumers can either pay directly from the bank app in the bank’s proprietary wallet (enabled by Entrust with the NFC Issuer Wallet) or push the digitized bank account to wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay. This enables effortless payments at any Mastercard e-commerce merchant without the necessity of card issuance. In addition, customers can use mobile payment options at any Mastercard POS and have the convenience of using a virtual card for online payments.</p>
<p>With the convenience of this additional digital payment solution, you can simplify the complexities of financial card issuance and the need to rely on a payment card as an intermediary. Pay by Account facilitates the payment process for banks and credit unions, offering the opportunity to facilitate real-time transactions. This is particularly advantageous and compelling for those financial institutions not engaged in card issuance or who are lacking compatibility with tokenization for digital card issuance. Pay by Account offers a game-changing alternative, facilitating quick virtual digital card issuance without disrupting existing card issuance infrastructure. It can also add value to the banking app, transforming it into a payment device across online and in-store purchases. Consumers benefit from a very safe and secure tokenized bank account payment experience, delivered within the banking app. Financial institutions add value to their app and keep customer experience at the core of their relationship with the consumer. With more innovations and opportunities comes more revenue opportunities for financial institutions.</p>
<p>Financial institutions can benefit from a simplified integration through an SDK, delivering the highest level of security. Empowering an end customer to choose their preferred form of payment and enabling direct payments from their bank account not only builds trust but also eliminates potential risks associated with third-party data breaches and fraud. The implementation and maintenance are also streamlined and efficient thanks to Entrust’s expert digital card team, which delivers comprehensive project support.</p>

<p>We were delighted to be joined by John from Source Network for our latest edition of Fission Tech Talks! </p><p>​John spoke about the different components of Source Network, including <a href="https://source.network/defra-db">DefraDB</a>, a p2p database, how Source uses IPFS, and some ideas about interop with UCAN.</p> Decentralized Databases <p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> empowers developers to deploy user-centric decentralized databases. </p><p>John realized that there were problems with the way data is handled today:</p>  Fragmentation - Data is unstructured and scattered across apps, devices, and file management system silos, making it time-consuming and laborious to manage.  Imprisonment - Users are stuck behind walled gardens that don't allow data to move easily across services.  Vulnerability - When all our data is stored in one place, it becomes an attractive target for bad actors.   <p>John realized that a viable solution would require decentralized data that was:</p>  Interoperable - Break down the walled gardens and replace them with open data models.  Controllable - User-owned data is key, as users should be able to move their data property around just like they do their physical property.  Secured - Cryptographic protocols can help secure data, putting users at ease.  <p>With these three characteristics in mind, John created DefraDB or Decentralized Infrastructure Database. What makes DefraDB unique? </p><p><a href="https://source.network/defra-db">DefraDB</a> is:</p>  Deployable anywhere  Uses no SQL  Uses P2P protocols  Uses cryptographic state proofs  Employs CRDTs   Authorization <p>In the authorization world, there are two main paths - access control lists and object capabilities. In 2019, Google published <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/">Zanzibar</a>, a paper explaining how they handle authorization across their many services. It uses access control lists but with relationship-based access control rather than role-based access control.</p><p>First, you write a tuple that includes subject, relation, and object. Then, you check if a permission exists and run an expand call that acts as a reverse lookup over a user set. It operates as a Consistent and Partition-Tolerant System.</p><p>The Zanzibar API is centralized, so Source Network created a decentralized implementation of Zanzibar called Zanzi. The Source Hub trust protocol powers it.</p><p>Now, let's turn to the other type of authorization - object capabilities. With object capabilities, revocation can be challenging when you have to get refreshed tokens after the original ones expire. Therefore, Source Network created Zazu, which is Zanzibar Authorization with UCANs</p><p>The Zanzibar service mints the token rather than the individual, eliminating the interactivity problem. Then it goes back to the traditional UCAN spec the rest of the way down the chain. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about Source Network's DefraDB, Zanzi, or Zazu, please visit <a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a>, join the <a href="https://discord.source.network/">Discord</a>, or explore the <a href="https://github.com/sourcenetwork/defradb">DefraDB</a> repo.</p>

				 <p>Darrell O’Donnell was recently invited by the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a> to shed light on the latest developments in the wallet space since the original Wallet Report in 2019. He addressed the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/Identity+Special+Interest+Group">Identity Special Interest Group</a>, and we’re thrilled to spotlight his insightful presentation.</p>
<p>The Hyperledger Foundation is a member-driven, not-for-profit organization dedicated to fostering global collaboration for adopting and advancing enterprise-grade technologies.</p>
<p>In the live webinar, Darrell delved into key updates to the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-digital-wallets/">Wallet Report</a>, focusing on the emerging trust layer, trust registries, and interoperability in digital ecosystems.</p>
<p>Didn’t get a chance to attend live? No worries. The complete presentation is available for replay on YouTube.</p>

<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
 
 The Emerging Trust Layer: The internet lacks a Trust Layer. At the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, we’re addressing this gap by aligning governance with technology to ensure seamless integration. 
 Trust Registries: They are more than just crucial. They serve as the foundational anchor for digital trust ecosystems, and their importance is increasingly being recognized. 
 Interoperability &amp; Conformance: We have not achieved Interoperability. Achieving genuine interoperability demands a conformance suite that backs up the specification and works in synergy. 
 
<p>We’re grateful to the Hyperledger Foundation for providing a platform to share these insights and to everyone who attended the session.&nbsp;</p>

 Whether rightly or wrongly, crypto mixers have become synonymous with money laundering. What can crypto firms do to protect themselves, their customers, and the crypto community from the growing threat of fraud? 



 



<p>The term “<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0138mrz4&amp;date=today%205-y&amp;geo=GB">cryptocurrency tumbler</a>” (also known as crypto mixer) has seen a 5000% increase in Google searches over the past five years. If search queries are anything to go by, it’s easy to see why: there appears to be confusion over how they work, if they are truly private, and whether they’re even legal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interest in crypto mixers has also appeared to have spread from industry insiders to the wider crypto community, including those looking for ways to hide their blockchain transactions.</p>



<p>No longer a niche subsection of an obscure industry, crypto tumblers pose a legitimate concern for the crypto community, because they are now, rightly or wrongly, heavily associated with money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We investigate the dangers associated with crypto tumblers and how crypto firms can reduce the risks of money laundering, meet regulatory challenges, and prevent fraud.</p>



 What are the threats associated with crypto mixers? 



<p>Far from how they’re currently perceived, crypto tumblers were originally created to offer heightened privacy for legitimate blockchain transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>They work by gathering coins from different users, tumbling them all together, and then spitting them out. The recipient receives the same amount of bitcoins they put in, but not the original coins they originally held. The benefit for users is that mixing obscures these transactions, providing anonymity on the blockchain. Naturally, this privacy tool is also exploited by money launderers.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>There are two main types of crypto mixers:</p>



  Centralized mixers – rely on a third party to complete the mixing<br>  Decentralized mixers – rely on protocols like smart contracts&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Without coin mixing, the transparent nature of the blockchain makes it hard for firms to make truly secure investments, or for high-profile individuals to keep their wealth private. However, with coin mixing, users can operate in a completely confidential nature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These features are also the main reasons why crypto mixers have become synonymous with money laundering. Several fraud cases and cyberattacks over the past few years have shown the part that tumbling plays, and the very real threat it poses to the integrity of a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



 The 3 main problems with crypto mixers. 



<p>The most dangerous threats associated with crypto mixers include money laundering, regulatory risks and fraud.</p>



 Money laundering. 



<p>The largest risk associated with crypto mixers is money laundering, and it’s only growing bigger. In fact, data shows that between 2021 and 2022, crypto laundering <a href="https://www.moneylaundering.com/news/cryptocurrency-laundering-soared-last-year-research-shows/">grew by approximately 70%</a>. There are typically two ways that crypto mixers are used to launder money. The first is through “cleaning” coins gained from illegitimate sources, such as pharming or ransomware attacks. The second is by funding criminal activity with clean coins, as the mixer can obscure and anonymise the transaction end point.</p>



<p>The dangers to crypto firms are clear.</p>



<p>“Firms must be able to verify whether their users and coins have been involved in suspicious transactions or sanctioned mixers. Without this information, exchanges could unknowingly be funding criminal activity, such as online cyberattacks or real-world terrorist financing,” said Jason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChipMixer, a type of crypto mixer that exchanged old coins for new coins, was responsible for laundering over <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/chipmixer-shut-down-after-laundering-over-840-million-in-criminal-proceeds/">$850 million</a>, which could be directly linked to illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;International authorities from Europe and the US were concerned over the mixer for flouting regulations and facilitating money laundering. The founder of the platform even wrote, “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybercriminals-crypto-platform-chipmixer-taken-down-says-europol-2023-03-15/">Money laundering’ is a crime made-up by governments that spy on their citizens</a>”. ChipMixer was officially seized and stopped trading in March 2023.</p>



 



 

 



 Regulatory risks. 



<p>One of the major problems of crypto mixers is the blurred lines in which the crypto community operates – exasperated by the relatively infant stage of crypto regulation compared to traditional financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While firms await rules outlined in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime</a> to come into force (expected in 2024), crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK, for example, must register with the Financial Conduct Authority, and therefore comply with Anti-Money Laundering Directives that capture rules to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Only firms with appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forward-thinking risk managers should ensure their organization meets compliance measures if it is serious about preventing money laundering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is particularly important for attracting high-value customers as exchanges that can demonstrate they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/future-crypto-eu-revolution/">follow regulatory guidelines</a>, and are able to plug operational vulnerabilities, provide reassurance to third parties and customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compliance with regulations not only protects firms from sanctions, but can also attract new customers if they feel satisfied that due diligence has been carried out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">sanctioned TornadoCash</a>, a popular coin mixer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crime? Facilitating suspicious transactions, involving stolen funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the real kicker is that some TornadoCash transactions could be traced and linked to groups in North Korea, a country with international sanctions including:&nbsp;</p>



  Freezing of financial assets<br>  Travel bans<br>  Trading restrictions  



<p>As such, users of this mixer put TornadoCash in direct breach of global regulations, and OFAC deemed it the responsibility of the service provider to maintain compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although industry leaders weren’t in agreement (remember that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/coinbase-coin-backed-motion-to-lift-sanctions-on-tornado-cash-denied">Coinbase lawsuit</a>?) regulators have made it clear that persecuting the service providers, rather than the individuals, is preferential.&nbsp;Plus, due to the incredibly private nature of mixers, it’s virtually impossible to go after the users themselves. Still, someone must be held accountable.</p>



 Fraud. 



<p>The opaque nature of crypto tumblers facilitate a perfectly murky breeding ground for fraudsters to operate. And as the industry continues to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">grow at breakneck speed</a>, fraudsters are evolving at a similar rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto mixers lack the common identity verification tools that financial institutions are required to perform, including:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Know Your Customer</a> checks<br>  Ultimate Beneficial Ownership checks<br>  Real-time authentication for transactions&nbsp;  



<p>In fact, many crypto mixers operate without any kind of user monitoring, which means even users who rely on the services for legitimate reasons could be subject to cyberattacks, as there’s no authentication for the user when they make a transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine a crypto mixer user receives a phishing email and clicks on a malicious link. It’s likely they will be redirected to a fake website and be asked to input their credentials. In a matter of seconds, the fraudster has successfully captured the user’s log-in information. From there, all it takes is for the fraudster to re-type the credentials they’ve just gathered into the real site, launder the user’s coins and disappear with the funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although <a href="https://trustpair.com/white-paper/b2b-payment-fraud-us-2023/">60% of business leaders</a> consider fraud awareness training the best approach for minimizing fraud, it should be paired with other tools in order to create a robust shield.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">Crypto fraud prevention</a> requires both initial customer identity verification, and ongoing transaction monitoring. The doubled-down effort approach not only ensures that the account holder is who they claim to be, but that if any bad actors get into the account during the meantime, they will be blocked from making transactions.</p>



 How to manage risks in crypto? 



<p>Risk assessments should be the first point of call for any business operating in a highly-regulated industry. To help combat the threat of money laundering, crypto firms can implement:</p>



 Wallet screening tools. 



<p>Wallet screening tools are an integral part of maintaining wallet hygiene. They allow exchanges to identify the owners of wallets, as well as the source and destination of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, where crypto mixers are involved, transactions can be obscured and it’s harder to trace the entire transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, it’s important to ensure that any wallet screening tool can identify tainted coins, and that this data is used to inform on the risk factors of wallet owners. By leveraging enhanced wallet screening, exchanges can benefit from full transparency over customer wallets, and reduce their risk of enabling money laundering.</p>



 KYC and identity checks. 



<p>By implementing a robust <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">KYC and identity verification process for your crypto firm</a>, you can rest assured that you know who your customers are, while complying with regulations like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">AML</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-provider-criteria/">PVID</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some KYC and identity verification platforms, however, are simply not fit for purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The wrong KYC platform can really affect user experience and therefore conversion rates</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>“When crypto mixers are involved, digital verification becomes more difficult. This is why IDnow’s identity verification services combine video verification with external database checks, risk factor analysis and behavioral analysis. With global ID specialists on-hand for clarification, our clients benefit from AI models and real human verification,” added Jason.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://identityday.se/">Identity Day</a> event brought together experts and thought leaders from across Sweden, to address the evolving challenges in identity management. John Jellema, VP of Product Management at Ubisecure, evoked important themes with his presentation on the complex nature of identity and the need for more robust identity management practices in the ever-changing landscape of work and technology. Watch John’s presentation or read the session highlights below.</p>
<p></p>
 Navigating Identity Challenges in Virtual Working Environments: 
<p>The session kicked off with a focus on the identity challenges posed by virtual working environments. John posed questions about how these challenges can be audited and how to enable trusted business-to-business interactions. He highlighted the importance of ensuring secure and auditable identity management in our increasingly digital world. John posed the question: “Who am I right now, what am I doing, and what am I representing?” He demonstrated how easily one could impersonate others with similar credentials, emphasising that verifying identity becomes a significant challenge, especially in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>This emphasised the limitations of identity verification – particularly poignant in a room full of identity management professionals. He attested that identity is of low value in such settings, while trust remains high. For example, attendees in the session could see his face and match it to the presenter’s name but had no concrete proof of his true identity. And stressed that this ease of trust does not exist in most online transactions or meetings.</p>
 Identity in the Nordics: 
<p>Delving into the strong identity systems in the Nordic region, John discussed the Finnish Trust Network as an example, and its high level of security. However, he warned that even in regions with robust identity management, fraud and theft are on the rise globally, highlighting that there is still a challenge in securely identifying and protecting transactions.</p>
 Challenges in Identity Management: 
<p>Next, John raised critical questions about the trustworthiness of third-party systems and emphasised the need for trust in identity management. Crucially, he underlined the importance of understanding who you’re dealing with in business transactions and the necessity of reliable identity verification to enable this. While this is possible in direct transactions, supply chains and normal business venture often have many sub and sub-sub contractors who are not directly known; raising the question of overall security in B2B environments.</p>
 The Future of Identity: 
<p>The presentation then touched on the future of identity management, noting the potential of animated or dynamic QR codes and the use of passkeys, and stressing the importance of adopting more secure methods. John predicted that even with animated QR codes and Passkeys, that personal adoption of these new methods was low (even in the audience), therefore focus on NIST compliant passwords (longer is better) coupled with easy-to-use MFA was still essential. The value of B2B Identity Management:</p>
<p>A key takeaway from the presentation is how B2B ID management needs to be as secure and robust as individual ID management.</p>
<p>Whilst strong individual IDs are relatively well-known, such as BankID or the upcoming EU Digital Identity Wallet, organisation IDs are either insufficient or underutilised. Therein lies huge opportunity. As John points out, B2B markets significantly outsize B2C markets. John runs through the reasons why the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is the most appropriate choice to realise such opportunities, as a globally recognised, high assured organisational identity.</p>
<p>Off the back of reliable organisation identity,&nbsp; organisational and individual identities can be linked to enable truly trustworthy B2B interactions – as per Ubisecure’s vision for the future of digital identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of digital identity:</p>
<p>The ability to combine highly assured organisational identities with strongly authenticated individual identities to show who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have to represent them.</p>
</blockquote>
 Identity Challenges in a Fluid Workplace: 
<p>With the shift towards virtual and remote work, the challenges of identifying individuals accurately in virtual meetings is becoming increasingly difficult. Especially with the increasing risk of impersonation through deepfake technology. This raises questions about verifying identity when relying solely on virtual interactions.</p>
<p>John’s presentation at Identity Day 2023 sheds some light on the evolving challenges in identity management, emphasising the need for secure, auditable identity practices in an ever-changing digital world. As technology continues to advance, organisations must address these challenges to maintain trust and security in their operations. The future of identity management will require innovative solutions and a collective effort to stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>

<p>Over the first three years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US suffered over twice the deaths per capita as Canada — <a href="https://time.com/6180309/covid-19-us-canada-differences/">over 600,000 potentially avoidable deaths</a>. Experts agree that this was a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60380317">hard-won victory</a> of Canada’s public health response. While political and demographic realities were a major factor, an unsung hero is the data modernization efforts that helped Canada track and contain the sudden rise in infections and meet the demand for public health services.</p>



<p>When it comes to public health emergencies, Canadian authorities have long been committed to learning from crises, applying technology and transforming systems to position both state and federal agencies for success when the next challenge arrives. Even within imperfect political realities, public health organizations around the world can learn and emulate Canada’s response through data modernization, potentially saving millions of lives in the next public health emergency.</p>



 A proactive approach to the threat of a global health crisis 



<p>After the SARS outbreak in 2003, federal and provincial governments in Canada recognized that their existing public health systems and IT were inadequate. Canadian authorities proactively worked with IBM to develop a solution known as IBM <a href="https://eu.video.ibm.com/recorded/124407879">Panorama</a>, an end-to-end public health disease surveillance and immunization system. This solution would later be key to Canadian public health agencies’ response to COVID-19.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, across the US, public health officials continued to use paper-based systems that would later fail to keep up with the explosive spread of COVID-19.</p>



<p>In the years following the SARS outbreak, the business of public health largely returned to steady-state focus. The day-to-day activities of public health agencies consisted primarily of dealing with traditional vaccines, diseases and conditions.</p>



<p>During this period, Panorama helped Canadian authorities deal with a wide range of public health functions, including case investigation and outbreak management, as well as immunization and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/digital-database-infectious-disease-outbreaks-1.5121473">vaccine inventory management</a>.</p>



<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, health agencies were immediately thrown into the spotlight. Suddenly, public health agencies had to deal with:</p>



 
 A novel disease for which no standards (such as case definitions) existed 



 A rapidly evolving disease where variants, signs and symptoms, and interventions changed quickly 



 High case volumes and extensive contact tracing, which necessitated employment of new public health workers to meet demand (with limited training available) 



 New vaccines and evolving protocols, such as mixing and matching doses with different vaccines 



 The need to communicate health risks to the public based on rapidly developing data and uncertain interpretations 
 



<p>Though both the US and Canada faced unprecedented challenges during this time, the Canadian provinces that were equipped with Panorama were better prepared to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike many US counterparts, they had a powerful enterprise-grade solution that was specifically designed for public health. This solution had the capability to manage large scale immunization events and disease surveillance.</p>



<p>Given global travel and climate change, it is reasonable to anticipate that another pandemic (and the problems listed above) could be right around the corner.</p>



<p>This time, the US can learn from the experiences and preparedness of Canada’s public health agencies. A successful public health response to a future pandemic will rely on collecting and managing critical data, investing in smart, capable and flexible data modernization systems, and preparing people with the proper knowledge and skills.</p>



 Lesson 1: Use a data model built for public health. 



<p>Canadian provinces used a disease surveillance solution featuring a person-centered public health data model, which meant it captured the requisite information needed for public health professionals to forecast and identify emerging trends and outbreaks (as well as analyze interventions and report to stakeholders). US public health agencies would benefit from choosing disease surveillance solutions that come with a proven, public health data model that offers relevant terminology, relationships and models.</p>



 Lesson 2: Make key decisions with high-quality data. 



<p>High-quality data is the bedrock of any public health response. US public health agencies should seek solutions that ingest data in multiple formats and have built-in processes for data cleansing to maintain the integrity of data. Data silos often occur when data is not shared or accessible, leading to workarounds and incomplete information. It is crucial to establish data sharing agreements in advance of an emergency.</p>



 Lesson 3: Handle data volumes with system integration. 



<p>Both Canadian and US public health agencies were overwhelmed by huge volumes of data during the COVID-19 pandemic. US agencies invested emergency COVID-19 funding into new case management and contact training solutions. However, these were often stand-alone solutions that didn’t address the underlying issues of siloed, incomplete or duplicative data.</p>



<p>Canada used integrated public health information systems, like Panorama, for seamless data ingestion, cleansing and import processing. Through systems integration via open APIs and other means of integrating data into patient health records, this served as the single source of truth for all exposure, case investigation, contact tracing, outbreak management and case management information for each resident. </p>



 Lesson 4: Adopt a cloud-native architecture to ensure elastic scalability. 



<p>Many of the investments in new technology solutions from the COVID-19 pandemic are now being sunset. For sustainable investments, public health agencies need the ability to scale data and information systems to the data volumes experienced during steady-state operations as well as during emergency responses. Investing in a cloud-native solution offers a flexible architecture and a future-proof solution that allows the public health agency to have elastic scalability. </p>



 Lesson 5: Prioritize agile configurability to adapt to developing disease scenarios. 



<p>Canadian public health agencies benefited from IBM Panorama’s ability to serve all 100+ reportable diseases and conditions. When the novel coronavirus started to emerge from lab tests, signs and symptoms led epidemiologists to code this data in a parking lot within Panorama, until LOINC and SNOWMED officially coded COVID-19. This kind of configurability is necessary to adapt to emerging diseases and conditions, instead of systems that only serve single diseases and conditions.</p>



 Lesson 6: Empower end users to respond rapidly with an easy, customizable system. 



<p>The public health field has experienced a large turnover as people retire or experience burnout. Data modernization initiatives afford public health agencies the opportunity to attract new talent by offering solutions using human-centered design. These solutions use augmented intelligence, guided workflows, machine learning and even consider <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx?schedulerform&amp;utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700078077908955&amp;p5=p&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwp8OpBhAFEiwAG7NaEskNwdonQyv-VbVFeFwtQOl5bcCwT5Zcx4dLUK6YrXXMuIPQeaJZShoCezoQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">generative AI</a> to embed domain expertise within workflows and advance the efficiency and training of new users.</p>



 Lesson 7: Use storytelling to engage stakeholders and the public. 



<p>While epidemiologists are equipped to report and analyze data and communicate it to other scientists, accessible storytelling is crucial to fostering greater trust and impact when translating science into public communications and public policy. In Canada, there are “data storytelling” trainings for public health professionals that empower public health information officers and state health officers to frame data insights to maximize public understanding and action.</p>



 Create a proactive data modernization plan to prepare for the unexpected 



<p>COVID-19 revealed opportunities to change the way public health is managed, as well as the need to invest in technology. With the CDC Data Modernization Initiative and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infrastructure/phig/program-overview.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20CDC%20awarded%20%243.84,protect%20health%20in%20their%20communities.">Public Health Infrastructure Grants</a>, now is the time for US public health agencies to learn from fellow public health agencies, like those in Canada, as they modernize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By taking a proactive data modernization approach, US public health agencies can manage steady-state operations and be better prepared to respond to the unknowns of the next public health emergency.</p>

<p>From traditional enterprises to the most innovative startups, organizations are using the public cloud. In fact, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/services/2021/11/19/customer-choice-always-drives-innovation/">ESG Research</a> found that 91% of all applications will eventually be hosted in the public cloud. That much investment has necessitated the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/finops">FinOps movement</a>, a cloud financial management discipline designed to bring financial accountability to the variable, consumption-based spend model of cloud.</p>



<p>We have seen that experienced FinOps practitioners are pushing the boundaries of “what’s possible” in cloud cost management, lobbying for advanced support and use cases. They’ve mastered cloud adoption and basic cost management but know that the future is about efficiency, optimization and driving value with every dollar spent. What they need now is support from FinOps platforms to help them advance their practice beyond the basics.</p>



 IBM Apptio Cloudability and IBM Turbonomic: advancing your FinOps practice 



<p>IBM recently <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-08-10-IBM-Completes-Acquisition-of-Apptio-Inc">completed its acquisition of Apptio Inc.</a> and today we are announcing the first product integration between IBM Apptio Cloudability, for cloud financial management and, IBM Turbonomic, for hybrid cloud cost optimization.</p>



<p>Through this integration, FinOps practitioners cansurface key optimization metrics from Turbonomic within the Cloudability interface, which can help facilitate deeper cost analysis and partnership between engineering, business and finance teams. Combining Cloudability and Turbonomic can also help FinOps practitioners address their top challenges—empowering engineers to automate actions and improving collaboration between engineers and FinOps teams. This integration delivers a set of FinOps capabilities to optimize value from cloud spend&nbsp;while also providing for elasticity and optimal performance of cloud applications.&nbsp;It’s a first step in bringing these two powerful solutions together.</p>



 How the products work 



<p>Cloudability provides organizations with data, insights and recommendations to help better understand their cloud spend. Turbonomic generates hybrid cloud optimization decisions that can be automated to unlock true elasticity and eliminate the need to overprovision. Together, these solutions help enable clients to achieve an end-to-end <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/finops#How+FinOps+works:+The+three+phases+of+FinOps">FinOps lifecycle</a>: inform, optimize and operate.</p>



<p>At each phase, organizations have access to data that can help them control cloud spend.</p>







<p>Initial integration: Surface Turbonomic optimization metrics on Cloudability interface.</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>As IT investments grow, workloads and applications are often spread across public and private clouds, and multiple service providers. This can increase expenses along with the need for simplified, integrated, and automated solutions to optimize that IT spend.</p>



<p>The FinOps solutions landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. There are point solutions, meaning solutions specialized for only one cloud provider or one area of FinOps, like optimization or container management. Together, Cloudability and Turbonomic, are positioned to offer organizations an end-to-end FinOps solution, no matter how mature their practice is.</p>

<p>With cryptocurrencies entering the global financial scene, people have found themselves empowered with transactional privacy, something that was pretty much non-existent before.</p><p>Crypto mixers, in particular, have played a crucial role here, as they are specifically designed to obscure transaction trails and protect user identities.</p><p>While these mixers champion individual privacy, they’ve also attracted attention due to potential misuse, as evident from the handling of <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-mixer-criminal-volume-2022/#:~:text=On%20April%2019%2C%202022%2C%20the,the%20same%20time%20in%202021.">nearly 8% of all illicit crypto funds in 2022</a> through&nbsp;mixers.</p><p>However, it’s essential to understand that the core issue isn’t the technology itself but its potential misuse.</p><p>Amidst these concerns, the question arises: How do we champion the cause of individual privacy without giving a free pass to nefarious activities? It’s a delicate equilibrium, one that initiatives like privacy pools are striving to&nbsp;achieve.</p> What are Privacy&nbsp;Pools? <p>Privacy Pools, as conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin and four others, including Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364">in their research paper</a>, can be likened to secure digital lockboxes within the cryptocurrency universe.</p><p>Much like a lockbox that safeguards valuable items, Privacy Pools protect transactional details while going a step further by allowing users to demonstrate the legitimacy of their transactions without unveiling the specifics.</p><p>However, these pools aren’t just about maintaining anonymity. They incorporate a robust system that ensures compliance with regulations. This is achieved by categorizing transactions into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sets, allowing the system to flag potentially illicit activities while preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Good Set vs Bad&nbsp;Set <p>The ‘good’ set includes transactions that comply with legal and regulatory standards, ensuring they are legitimate. Conversely, the ‘bad’ set comprises deposits that might have ties to suspicious activities or illegal&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Now, here’s where it gets even more interesting. When users wish to withdraw their funds from the pool, they can provide proof. However, this proof doesn’t disclose their specific transaction details but verifies that their withdrawal is connected to the ‘good’ deposits.</p><p>If you’re wondering how this system operates, in Privacy Pools, users don’t directly reveal their specific transactions. Instead, they provide a hint by sharing a group of possible transactions, known as the association set, indicating that their specific transaction lies somewhere within&nbsp;it.</p><p>This way, users maintain their privacy by not showcasing their exact transactions but still supplying enough data to affirm the legitimacy of their activities.</p><p>Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure this method maintains both transactional privacy and compliance.</p><p>Moreover, third-party entities, known as Association Set Providers (ASPs), will play a pivotal role in this mechanism by curating these ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sets based on various criteria, maintaining transparency and trust in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So, even when the user’s transaction remains obscured, a robust layer of checks and balances will ensure that everything remains straight and&nbsp;narrow.</p><p>This approach will serve as a bridge between the blockchain’s ethos of privacy and the world’s regulatory necessities, intertwining the two in a harmonious blend of technology and compliance.</p> Advantages and Disadvantages of Privacy&nbsp;Pools <p>The benefits of privacy pools are manifold, especially when considering how, by bolstering transactional privacy, they may pave the way for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Once implemented, users previously cautious of the transparent nature of blockchain transactions could have the option to transact with enhanced privacy, in line with certain regulatory standards. This integration of privacy and certain standards presents opportunities for both individual users and the broader ecosystem.</p><p>However, like any technology, privacy pools present challenges, too. For instance, the complexity of achieving widespread regulatory alignment is evident, with different countries having varied views on crypto regulations.</p><p>Additionally, if not monitored effectively, there is a potential for misuse. Just as with any privacy tool, it can be a double-edged sword: while it can protect legitimate users, it could also shield malicious actors if not adequately overseen.</p> The Logic Behind Privacy&nbsp;Pools <p>Privacy Pools operate on fundamental human motivations: the need for transactional discretion and the drive to steer clear from contentious ties.</p><p>When society clearly categorizes transactions as either clean (“good”) or potentially tainted (“bad”), users with reputable transactions naturally align with the “good” set. This ensures their privacy and keeps them away from any association with dubious activities.</p><p>Conversely, those with questionable transactions find little advantage in the system. Their actions can be linked to a set with suspicious undertones, making it easier to trace and identify.</p> A Balanced&nbsp;Approach <p>As the crypto realm grows, the primary challenge is ensuring user privacy while also acknowledging the technological and regulatory landscape. Privacy pools are central to this&nbsp;effort.</p><p>To unlock the full potential of privacy pools, continuous dialogue between the crypto community, regulators, and other key stakeholders is&nbsp;vital.</p><p>By working together, we can prioritize user privacy through privacy pools, all while addressing any potential regulatory concerns. This collective effort is key for the broader acceptance and success of these technologies in the financial world.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Identity management and authentication are evolving rapidly, especially as the era of traditional passwords is slowly becoming outdated. Sebastian Sandell presented at <a href="https://identityday.se/">Identity Day</a> 2023 in Sweden, with a focus on securely authenticating sub-contractor users and the changing landscape of authentication. Watch the video of Sebastian’s presentation or have a look at the presentation highlights in the blog below.</p>
<p></p>
 The Passwordless Revolution 
<p>The traditional method of password authentication is widely accepted to be inconvenient and insecure. Passwordless authentication methods are on the rise and are poised to replace cumbersome password-based systems. In fact, around 99% of modern devices already support these passwordless methods.</p>
 Navigating the Transition 
<p>While passwordless authentication offers a more secure and user-friendly approach, many organisations are still dependent on passwords for authentication. This raises an important question: how can we ensure the security of these accounts, in a transitioning landscape? The answer lies in establishing strong company policies.</p>
 The Role of Company Policies 
<p>Emphasising the critical role that company policies play in securing user accounts, Sebastian covers how these policies dictate password complexity, length, and update frequency. For example, the presence of lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers may be mandatory. For added security, some companies may require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The importance of checking passwords against breach databases is highlighted.</p>
 Enforcing Policies in a Business Environment 
<p>The complexity arises when these policies must be enforced in a business environment, where subcontractors and partners need access to an organisation’s systems. Sebastian provided a scenario illustrating this challenge involving three distinct user groups:</p>
 
 Internal Users: These are employees who have well-defined accounts in the organisation. They access systems using email and passwords, with the option to enable MFA for additional security. 
 Registered Federated Users: These are users from trusted partner organisations. They have some information in the system and can use their organisation’s identity providers (IdPs) for authentication. Their need for MFA depends on their organisation’s policies. 
 Unregistered Federated Users: These users are even further removed from the organisation’s systems and policies. This group includes subcontractors and third-tier connections about whom we have limited information available. 
 
 Customised Authentication for Unregistered Federated Users 
<p>Unregistered federated users present a unique challenge since they lack a detailed profile in the organisation’s system. This emphasises the need for tailored authentication methods for these users. For instance, they might use their Google credentials if they belong to a Google IdP. Depending on the limited data available, they could employ various One-Time Password (OTP) methods, including SMS OTP and SMTP OTP.</p>
 MFA’s Continued Relevance 
<p>Sebastian underlined that, even as passwordless authentication gains traction, there are scenarios where MFA remains essential. As users move further away from trusted internal users towards unregistered federated users, the risk of unauthorised access and security breaches increases. Therefore, MFA can add an extra layer of security to protect the most critical applications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sebastian’s presentation at Identity Day 2023 sheds light on the evolving landscape of authentication. As organisations transition to passwordless authentication, maintaining security for legacy systems still reliant on passwords is crucial. Company policies, emphasising strong password requirements and MFA, are essential for a smooth transition. The challenge of managing authentication in a business environment with subcontractors necessitates tailored solutions. Security remains paramount, and MFA continues to be relevant, especially for safeguarding critical applications. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="Contact Ubisecure">Contact Ubisecure</a> to discuss securely authenticating your unregistered federated users.</p>

<p>It is a new day for James, a new IT administrator. Today, he has to figure out an order for a whole batch of mobile devices for his colleagues, who have chosen both iOS and Android smartphones. He needs to activate the device lifecycle program and do all the deployment and endpoint security tasks afterward. Most probably, in another tool. He also knows that Rich from Sales and Alyssa from Finance will leave the company on Friday, so he needs to wipe the devices. One is under the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/byod">BYOD program</a> and the other is company-owned, and everything needs to be done as soon as possible. Can’t he use only one management tool?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/uem">Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)</a> is a technology that provides one single platform to manage and protect all types of devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops and IoT, running multiple types of operating systems from one single console throughout their lifecycle. UEM solutions include previous technologies such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mobile-device-management">MDM (Mobile Device Management)</a>, EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management), MAM (Mobile Application Management) and laptop management. Using UEM tools, James will manage both personal devices and corporate devices and include content management capabilities and cybersecurity capabilities such as security policies, authentication and identity and access management, data security and data protection, patch management, threat detection and response, and many more.</p>



<p>Device lifecycle is the process of managing end-to-end all the devices in a company, from the moment they leave the provider to the moment they are sunset by the IT teams in an organization. They can be Apple devices, Android devices, IoT devices, macOS, laptops or desktops running Microsoft Windows, purpose-built devices, and many more. James and other IT admins would need to make sure he does the device enrollment, maintains them, service when there is the need, retire them or repurpose them according to his company’s policies and end users’ actions.</p>



 Top 5 commonalities: 



<p>UEM and device lifecycle management share several commonalities, as they both play essential roles in the management and optimization of endpoints within an organization. Here are five of the most common aspects they share:</p>



 
 Device Inventory: UEM tools and device lifecycle management processes include inventories where IT Admins have real-time access to detailed information about each endpoint. For example the device model, the specifications, the owner and more. 



 Security and Compliance: Both UEM technologies and device lifecycle management are in line with security and compliance regulations. With UEM, IT teams make sure that devices are protected, have the patches they need and are in sync with compliance policies. By managing device lifecycle processes, IT departments make sure the endpoints are decommissioned, avoiding the loss of sensitive data and reducing security risks. 



 Configuration Management: IT administrators use UEM to configure endpoints and manage them during their usage. With device lifecycle, James and his colleagues configure endpoints during procurement and provisioning. 



 Integrations and automation: Both UEM and device lifecycle management integrate with other apps and have a lot of automated features that can streamline IT team’s efforts. The modern UEM tools and lifecycle processes offer IT admins a lot of self-service opportunities, due to a high degree of automation of tasks. 



 Reporting and Analytics: Both UEM and device lifecycle management have rich reporting and analytics capabilities. UEM provides real-time data on the endpoints, patches and updates, user security and device security, while device lifecycle management offers data on the device lifecycle and usage, helping decision-makers with take action on budgets. Both generate valuable data used in audits. 
 



<p>UEM and device lifecycle management have a lot in common and when done properly they protect corporate data, ensure a great user experience, enhance mobile security and cybersecurity overall, and create a great digital workspace. They also differ in terms of purposes: UEM focuses on managing devices throughout their life, while device lifecycle management focuses on the entire lifecycle, from the day they are purchased till they are sunset.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maas360/unified-endpoint-management">IBM Security MaaS360</a> is a modern, advanced&nbsp;UEM&nbsp;platform that offers one single console to manage types of endpoints from smartphones to laptops and protects them with built-in threat management capabilities. This way, IT teams can be both efficient and effective and keep the total cost of ownership under control.</p>

<p>How we prove our identity has undergone revolutionary changes in a world of information. At the center of this transformation is Biometric Authentication. In essence, biometric authentication verifies individuals based on their unique physical or behavioral attributes, such as fingerprints, facial patterns, or voice. Its value in bolstering security and simplifying user experiences cannot be understated.</p>
 Understanding Key Concepts 
<p>As we dive into Biometric Authentication, a foundational understanding of its core concepts is essential. It’s not just about recognizing unique physical or behavioral traits; it’s about the broader context in which these traits play a role in authenticating identities.</p>
<p>The distinction between related terms: Biometric authentication shouldn’t be confused with simple biometric data. While both involve unique human characteristics, the former is about verification, while the latter is merely information.</p>
<p>Foundational concepts: It centers on two phases – enrollment, where the user’s biometric data is first captured and stored, and verification, where the presented data is compared against the stored version to authenticate.</p>
 Technological Foundations 
<p>The efficacy of biometric authentication is deeply intertwined with the technological innovations supporting it. From rudimentary hand measurements to sophisticated AI-driven systems, the journey of biometrics is fascinating and transformative.</p>
<p>Key Technologies: Commonly employed biometrics include fingerprints, facial authentication, iris and retina scanning, voice recognition, and behavioral biometrics like keystroke dynamics.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>On October 25th, 2023, AWS <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/10/amazon-web-services-to-launch-aws-european-sovereign-cloud">announced </a>their intention to launch AWS European Sovereign Cloud. This is an important announcement which reflects the impact of EU GDPR regulation and the EU recent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf" title="Schrems II judgement">Schrems II judgement</a>.</p>
 What was Announced 
<p>AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be a new, independent cloud for Europe that is designed to help public sector organizations and those in highly regulated industries meet the regulatory data residency and operational requirements. This cloud service will be located and operated within Europe. It will be physically and logically separate from existing AWS Regions, but AWS claims, will provide the same security, availability, and performance of existing AWS Regions. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will launch with its first AWS Region in Germany and will be available to all European customers. </p>
 The Impact of Globalisation 
<p>Globalisation has provided many benefits allowing nation states and organizations to obtain what they need, when they need it from wherever it is cheapest. This has reduced the costs for citizens and businesses alike but has created an increased dependency on ever more extended supply chains. The COVID epidemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions have called this approach into question. The notion of the sovereign cloud needs to be seen in this context.</p>
<p>Cloud sovereignty involves several areas, these include but are not limited to the protection of personal data. It also includes the protection of intellectual property, commercial secrets, as well as other forms of sensitive information. It concerns the influence that service users have over the legal frameworks that bind the service through a say in government. Also, their confidence in service continuity not only in the event of natural disasters but also of geopolitical conflicts.</p>
 The Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used. This can be achieved in several ways through legal, and technical measures as well as physical location. Within Europe there are already <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80900/european-hosted-hybrid-iaas-cloud/">several cloud services</a> that are locally owned and delivered. However, these services find it hard to compete against the level of functionality provided by the global hyperscale cloud services and the economies of scale that they enjoy. Therefore, using purely local providers often involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state sponsored projects. However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyperscale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close. Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Dossier/gaia-x.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control. Google, together with other hyperscale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
 Four Key areas of Sovereignty 
<p>There are four key areas of sovereignty and the announcement by AWS needs to be considered against all of these.</p>
<p> Data sovereignty – the customer should have control over the access to and the use of their data. This is what the technical measures from the EDPB (European Data Protection Board) are intended to enforce. Since many data processing regulations specify this, the customer should also have control over the physical location of their data and administrative access by cloud service administrators. With the exception of the location of administrators, data sovereignty is already supported by all the major IaaS providers although not all customers make full use of the controls provided.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty – this is control over the jurisdiction where the administration of the service and its infrastructure is conducted. AWS have announced that the AWS European Sovereign Cloud infrastructure will be operated independently from existing AWS Regions. To assure independent operation of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, only personnel who are EU residents, located in the EU, will have control of day-to-day operations, including access to data centers, technical support, and customer service. Access to customers’ data is further controlled through the AWS Nitro System which separates the control plane from the data plane and prevents operational access to customers’ data.</p>
<p>Technical Sovereignty – the customer can develop, deploy, move, and manage their workloads with a minimum of disruption. While there is significant openness in application development environments, the AWS cloud is built on a proprietary technical stack, and this makes it hard to move a workload to another cloud. It also makes it hard to manage the hybrid multi-cloud and on-premises IT environment that is now common in most organizations. There is a need for standard interfaces that customers can use to build, deploy, manage, and optimise their workloads independently of the cloud service used. This is still work in progress with VMware, OpenStack, Anthos, and RedHat OpenShift all offering some level of solution to some of the problems.</p>
<p>Sovereign Ownership – the infrastructure used to provide the cloud service is normally owned by the CSP. This means that even if it is located in a given geography its use could be withdrawn by the CSP in the event of geopolitical conflict. Even if it were to be seized by a government the knowledge and external infrastructure required would make it difficult to make it operational.</p>
<p>Opinion </p>
<p>The AWS announcement today is a major step that will enable public service and regulated organizations in the EU benefit from the capabilities provided by the AWS Cloud Services. It further illustrates the bargaining power that the EU can exert on service providers from outside of the region. However, it does not mitigate the potential for technical lock in or the geopolitical risks associated with services owned outside of the EU Jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">we announced</a> that our onboarding tool YeshID Onboard is now in beta and that we’re providing it free to the first 100 organizations of 25-250 employees working in Google Workspace to sign up. We’ve onboarded more than 20 companies since we put that message out, and we’re thrilled with the success those teams are experiencing with Onboard. But we’ve also noticed there are some questions around why we would give YeshID Onboard away for free, and that’s what I want to talk about today.</p>
 Ship, learn, improve 
<p>YeshID is a startup. Alex and I founded the company, and now we’re a small team with experience from tech heavy hitters like Meta, Microsoft, OpenDNS/Cisco, and RSA. We’re what you call a seed stage startup: we’re in the initial phase of developing our product and are focused on turning an innovative idea into a viable business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seed startups are known for their potential to bring disruptive solutions to the market. They often challenge the status quo and aim to break into existing industries with new and creative approaches — and that’s just what we’re doing. We’re developing <a href="https://yeshid.com/">a tool that will disrupt the identity and access management world</a> for smaller companies, which right now spans too big (like Okta) or too minimal (like spreadsheets).&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that we’re doing a lot of research, a lot of testing and iterating, and a lot of proving out concepts — and here’s the thing: we can’t do any of that without you. So, we’re giving our product away. Simple as that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will that always be the case? Hopefully not! We are starting a business after all, but rest assured that if you join on a free plan, your plan will stay free, even if we start charging new customers for it.&nbsp;</p>
 Join us 
<p>Onboarding and offboarding are so fundamental to companies of all kinds, yet solutions have either lagged behind business needs or leap-frogged over a whole market size. This feels like the perfect entry point for YeshID and for companies looking to take the next step in their identity and access management journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onboard is purpose-built for small businesses using Google Workspace. We help you knock out the operational tasks that need to get done today while laying a solid foundation for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Save time onboarding and offboarding team members with consolidated user controls 
 Manage application requests and keep track of IT licenses and costs all in one place 
 Skip the login screen and move effortlessly between approved applications 
 
<p>Plus, after you sign up, you’ll also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. And you’ll be helping us learn even more about the small business needs that have been overlooked until now. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Head to our website</a> to learn more. </p>

Together, we’re creating something incredible, which makes achieving our goals even more satisfying. I’m fortunate to have supportive colleagues whom I can rely on. We maintain our smiles, even when facing challenges, and I feel very grateful for my exceptional team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I strive to be passionate about life’s small, everyday joys because these are the things that truly bring happiness. Spending time with my friends and family, being in the company of my beloved animals, and, ideally, immersing myself in nature!</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream? Picture a house filled with cats. Just kidding (or am I? 😄). On a more profound note, my dream is to leave a positive impact on our planet, the place we call home. Whether that impact is big or small, I want to contribute to making our world a better place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>The prospect of playing a significant role in making financial assets more accessible to everyone! Tokenization is evolving rapidly, and we’ll be there every step of the way.</p>

<p>A corporate sustainability report is a comprehensive document that outlines a company’s efforts, policies, practices and performance related to social, environmental and economic sustainability. Corporate sustainability reports assess sustainability using three key parameters: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/esg-frameworks">environmental, social and governance</a>, often abbreviated as ESG. This blog focuses on the importance of sustainability reference architecture and how it helps companies meet their sustainability goals, especially meeting the environmental side of the ESG goals.</p>



<p>While many companies utilize siloed software solutions to operationalize their environmental efforts, this introduces additional complexities and cost. Challenges arise when these software solutions need to be integrated in order to expose insights that could maximize their benefits. Moreover, siloed software often doesn’t seamlessly integrate into a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/hybrid-cloud">multi-hybrid cloud</a> corporate architecture. This blog delves into these challenges and explores how siloed software solutions may fall short in innovation, particularly when transitioning from basic analytics to unleashing the full potential of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ai-data-sustainability">AI capabilities</a>.</p>



 Sustainability goal 



<p>As mentioned above, a corporate sustainability report is a comprehensive document that outlines a company’s efforts, policies, practices and performance about social, environmental and economic sustainability. It provides stakeholders, including investors, employees, customers and the public with transparent and accountable insights into the company’s commitment to sustainable business practices and its impact on society and the environment. Companies usually share their sustainability goals and achievements in these reports on an annual basis.</p>







 Sustainability journey 



<p>To achieve sustainable operations, companies need to embark on a journey that starts with a strategy and roadmap, with ESG data reporting being a critical aspect.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sustainability">IBM Consulting</a> and business partners can help customers with defining a strategy and roadmap, while the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/envizi">IBM ESG solution</a> can assist with ESG reporting requirements. The journey will vary depending on the customer’s level of maturity along the journey, priorities and goals.</p>



<p>It starts with developing a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/sustainability/guidebook-build">sustainability strategy and roadmap</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/envizi">ESG data reporting</a>. Once the strategy is defined and ESG data is in place, customers may focus on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/guides/intelligent-asset-management/">assets and facilities infrastructure</a>&nbsp;where most scope one and scope two carbon emissions are generated. If scope three carbon emission is a corporate priority, then the focus will be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/supply-chain">sustainable supply chain and circularity</a>. If the weather plays a major role in business and affects corporate sustainability goals, then the focus will be on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/business-operations/manage-climate-risk">climate risk management</a>. All companies have IT infrastructure that affect the corporate sustainability target and can be managed using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/guides/business-operations/embrace-green-it">responsible computing and green IT</a>. The journey varies by customer business and sustainability priorities. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/culture/tool_mural/">brainstorming garage</a>&nbsp;approach will help to define the use cases and requirements before creating the Sustainability Reference Architecture.&nbsp;</p>







 Sustainability reference architecture 



<p>The IBM sustainability reference architecture diagram below illustrates how various software applications supporting different business segments can work together to assist customers in achieving their ESG goals.&nbsp;The diagram depicts the various data sources that capture sustainability information critical for producing corporate sustainability reports and how these data sources are collected, assembled, analyzed and reported. You can learn about developing and creating your own solution by leveraging the sustainability reference architecture diagram on <a href="https://ibm.github.io/sustainability-reference-architecture/">this GitHub</a> portal page. IBM IT Architect Assistant can help create this type of architecture using a collaborative garage environment.</p>







 IBM IT Architect Assistant 



<p>IBM IT Architect Assistant is a responsive web application to assist an IT Architect in designing an architecture. It allows you to easily create your own architectures or start with an existing pattern like the IBM Sustainability Reference Architecture to customize it for your specific requirements. IBM uses IBM IT Architect Assistant&nbsp;for creating architecture diagrams including the above sustainability reference architecture. If you are an IBM customer or business partner, you can try out&nbsp;IBM IT Architect Assistant&nbsp;to make a copy of the architecture and modify it to support your specific goals. &nbsp;</p>







 Architecting for a sustainable future 



<p>A well-structured sustainability architecture is the cornerstone of an organization’s journey toward meeting its ESG goals, especially within the environmental domain. By breaking down silos and fostering data accessibility and integration, companies can unlock the true potential of their sustainability efforts, paving the way for innovation and progress. As businesses increasingly recognize the critical importance of sustainability, investing in a solid reference architecture becomes not just a choice but a strategic imperative for a brighter, more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Over the past 18 months, SpruceID has been working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to bring mobile driver's licenses to residents of California. Earlier this fall, the State of California expanded the initial pilot program to allow California residents <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">to download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone through the California DMV mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android devices).</p>Images of the California Mobile Driver's License (mDL) in the California DMV mobile app. Source: <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California DMV Website</a><p>The mobile driver’s license is powered by SpruceID’s SpruceKit components and Credible Platform product. SpruceKit is an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity that enables secure wallet construction, and Credible Platform provides entire credential life cycle management–from issuance and presentations, to updates and revocation. Both are modular solutions that are made to integrate into existing high-assurance environments with security and privacy at the core.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">privacy-first mobile driver's license</a> can be used at participating TSA airport security checkpoints and select retail locations. In the future, the mobile driver’s license can help residents prove their identity online, operate motor vehicles, access health care, secure financial assistance, and verify their age–both in-person and online–while selectively disclosing only the necessary information.&nbsp;</p> Open Source <p>There are three main pillars important to us as we worked with the DMV to scope out a mobile driver's license solution. First, we fundamentally believe in the value of open-source technology as a public good to reduce build costs, prevent vendor lock-in, and provide transparency. Our core components are, therefore, open-source to create an accessible ecosystem for digital identity infrastructure, to demonstrate that open protocols are indeed open with usable production-grade libraries free of proprietary licensing, and to allow civil society to review the function of critical workflows. While SpruceID is indeed a private sector business, our mission to let users control their data across the web can only be realized through ecosystems built on privacy, security, and choice.</p><p>While the program is still in the pilot phase, we are actively collecting and implementing early user feedback. As the program matures, we will first release the base libraries as open-source software, to empower other States, jurisdictions, and the private sector to implement privacy-preserving digital credentials.</p> Interoperability <p>We are committed to interoperability and standards compliance by implementing the ISO standard for mobile driver's license applications (ISO/IEC 18013–5) and W3C Verifiable Credentials. This facilitates compatibility across agencies, across different states, and, in the future, online for various websites and digital services. It also creates an even playing field for technology providers so that digital identity infrastructure is not dominated by only a few large firms.</p><p>Today, a registered driver in California can use their DMV-issued mDL to prove their identity to the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) at select airport security checkpoints using ISO/IEC 18013-5. There are currently twenty-five airports across the United States that accept digital IDs at security checkpoints, including the California mobile driver’s license. </p>The TSA currently accepts mDLs issued by several states and wallet/app providers for TSA PreCheck lanes in participating airports. (Source: <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2023/08/30/transportation-security-administration-seeks-comments-proposed-0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tsa.gov</a>, blue highlighting added by SpruceID)<p>In 2022, the TSA <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/transportation_security_administration_0.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">announced a new budget</a> authorizing an R&amp;D initiative focused on integrating digital identity authentication capabilities at airport checkpoints. They specifically outlined the importance of digital identities, including the increase in the efficiency of security checkpoints for passengers. They also stressed the increase in privacy afforded to travelers by only sharing the required information (name, gender, date of birth, and photo) rather than the entire ID card (which also includes weight, height, home address, and other information).</p><p>In the future, a mobile driver’s license holder may use their smartphone-held ID to digitally prove their identity, which is currently challenging to complete in a high-trust manner with a physical ID card. We recently hosted (and participated in) the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/test-of-mdl-interoperability-organized-by-spruceid-aamva?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ISO 18013-7 Interoperability Event</a> along with the California DMV to test how mobile driver’s licenses can be used online with a variety of mDL verifiers. ISO/IEC 18013-7 is the draft standard for how a mobile driver’s license can be verified in an unattended presentation, such as online. </p> User Experience <p>Finally, we want to ensure increased privacy, security, and convenience for users. Smartphones are increasingly a part of our daily lives, and the convenience of having a mobile driver’s license on a smartphone must be accompanied by a high level of security.&nbsp;</p><p>From a user perspective, we knew it would be critical for Californians to feel their information and activity are safe and private while using a mobile driver’s license. Users of the application are offered more privacy in interactions than using their physical ID counterparts since it allows users to selectively disclose only the required information. For example, at a drinking establishment, you can prove that you are over 21, without exposing your full birth date, your weight, your home address, or other personal details.&nbsp;</p><p>The mobile driver’s license also prevents “issuer phone-home,” where issuers may be notified each time someone verifies a mobile driver’s license digitally. This is prevented by allowing offline verifications that do not permit the issuer to track the mDL holder and where they are presenting their mDL.</p><p>At SpruceID, we firmly believe in empowering citizens through user-controlled identity. In our Digital Identity Knowledge Base, we shared more about our ideology related to privacy and equity in a mobile driver's license solution, in alignment with the EFF, ACLU, and EPIC comments to the Department of Homeland Security’s request for comments. You can read more in our Knowledge Base <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">here</a>.</p><p>Digital identity impacts all of us, and we're collaborating with the California DMV to refine and improve based on the initial feedback from the pilot program. We want to ensure that every user finds the system usable and accessible, so we value and appreciate your feedback.</p><p>Today, any licensed driver in California can download and set up a mobile driver's license through the California DMV Wallet app. For more information, visit: <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/</a>.</p><p>For updates on SpruceID’s latest developments, please sign up for our mailing list.</p>

<p>A recent IDC report — <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/7XM93NG9#:~:text=Through%20a%20series%20of%20in-depth%20customer%20interviews%20and,unnecessary%20operational%20costs%2C%20and%20increasing%20overall%20EAM%20eficiency">The Business Value of IBM Maximo</a> — that surveyed 9 companies with an average of 8,500 employees, found that after these companies adopted IBM Maximo, it resulted in: a business benefit of approximately USD 14.6 million, on average, per year per organization; 43% less unplanned downtime per year; and USD 8.6 million in total equipment cost avoidances annually.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo®&nbsp;Application Suite</a> (MAS) is a single, integrated, cloud-based application platform for asset monitoring, management, predictive maintenance and reliability planning.&nbsp;Maximo maintains high-value assets with AI and analytics to optimize performance, extend asset lifecycles and reduce downtime and costs. To reap the best benefits with maximum performance, it’s essential to host the same on a scalable infrastructure, thereby the current trend is to migrate Maximo to cloud. In this journey, we are seeing an increased interest in migrating and deploying MAS on AWS Cloud.</p>



 The growing need for Maximo migration to AWS Cloud 



<p>Migrating to cloud helps organizations to drive the operational resiliency and reliability, at the same time keeping software up to date with minimal upgrade effort and infrastructure constraint.&nbsp;Due to increased demand of data-driven asset management, it is critical to combine data from different areas of an organization, which in turn helps organizations discover trends, make predictions and take better informed asset management decisions.</p>



<p>In line with this trend, last April IBM announced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/end-support-announcement-eos-maximo-761">end of support for all Maximo 7.6</a>&nbsp;and add-ons by September 2025. As a result, the path forward for all Maximo EAM customers is to move to the&nbsp;latest cloud-based <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas-cd/continuous-delivery?topic=upgrading">MAS</a>.&nbsp;Therefore, Maximo migration and modernization has become even more important for clients.</p>



<p>To further support Maximo migration to AWS, IBM has now made available newer containerized versions of Maximo Application Suite as a Service (MAS SaaS) on AWS Marketplace with Bring Your Own License (BYOL) on AWS. MAS SaaS on AWS represents yet another important step in Maximo’s journey to integrate its standalone applications — like Monitor, Health and Visual Inspection — into a cohesive single suite of applications. </p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ibm-maximo-application-suite-as-a-service-on-amazon-web-services/">Read more: IBM announces IBM MAS Saas</a>



 Why MAS SaaS is unique 



<p>MAS SaaS, a subscription-based service offered on the AWS, provides an operational environment deployed on AWS and operated and managed on a continuous basis by IBM Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) specialists using best practices. This collaboration equips customers with an industry-leading asset management system from IBM, supported by the scale, agility and cost-efficiency of AWS.</p>



<p>Moving to MAS 8 is both an upgrade and migration when using MAS SaaS. The upgrade is similar to previous upgrades with regards to the data, but the underlying architecture changes need to be done involving ROSA and other dependencies. The migration is similar to how clients moved from on-premise to our previous Maximo EAM SaaS Flex offering, but taking into account the differences with MAS. In order to migrate to MAS SaaS, perpetual on-premises customers would stop paying Service &amp; Support (S&amp;S) and purchase a SaaS subscription; on premises Subscription License customers would begin a new SaaS subscription; and existing MAS Flex and MAS Managed Service customers would begin a new MAS SaaS subscription.</p>



<p>To jumpstart the migration journey, businesses can design different migration and modernization paths beforehand, laying out potential modernization programs before making the investment using our proprietary <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/cloud-accelerator">IBM Consulting Cloud Accelerator</a> (ICCA) platform.</p>



 A global energy company’s approach to Maximo migration 



<p>Let us look at an example where IBM worked closely with an energy company that was facing the following challenges:</p>



 
 Longer times to procure infrastructure required to support latest version of Maximo 



 WebSphere being the core to Maximo had high availability and high-performance issues&nbsp; 



 Data sharing challenges across multiple applications due to lack of data fabric and integration layer 



 Manual end-to-end deployment leading to complex setup, errors and security 
 



<p>The client chose the latest version — Maximo Application Suite 8 (MAS8) — as it addresses industry challenges such as risk of failure, rising maintenance cost and sustainability and compliance regulations. AWS Cloud was the preferred choice for the client to take advantage of greater deployment flexibility, scalability, high availability and secure architecture. &nbsp;</p>



 Solution approach 



<p>IBM adopted the following approach to accelerate the energy company’s Maximo migration to AWS:</p>



 
 Upgraded existing Maximo application from version 7.6.0.9 to version 7.6.1.2 using Infra as a code (IaC) 



 Deployed using IaC provided the flexibility of spin-up the instance required for auto scaling. This automation helps to reduce the lead time to spin and run the new environment, also addressing latency issues due to multi-AWS availability zone deployment 



 Used AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for data migration and schema conversion 



 To minimize the database replication (DR) infra provision and keep the DR cost lower, IaC was used to spin the DR environment based on demand. DR capabilities used to keep data up to date within availability zone and DR region 



 Addressed data sharing across applications using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">IBM Cloud Pak for Data</a> and uniform integration layer using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-integration">IBM Cloud Pak for Integration</a> 
 



 Solution components  



 
 Maximo Enterprise Application Management (EAM) is based on a 3-tier architecture with the following components:  HTTP/Web Tier and Application Tier using the IBM WebSphere and HIS deployed EC2 instance under private subnet, to keep application secure.  
 
 Database Tier is using the AWS Oracle RDS with replication enable to address the DR situation, running under private subnet. 
 
 



 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was configured based on AWS best practices with public and private subnets 



 Application servers and deployment manager were setup for autoscaling using the Auto Scaling Group&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Maximo web-based UI resolution for external access using the AWS Route 53 service 



 Web application firewall (WAF) was used as a first line of defense against web exploits 



 IaC scripts on Terraform and CFT were integrated to provision autoscaling architecture 
 



 Reference Architecture on AWS &nbsp; 







 How Maximo on RedHat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) is helping clients 



<p>MAS 8.0 has now been containerized and available to run specifically on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform">RedHat OpenShift</a>. To ease this transition for customers unfamiliar with running containers in production, AWS has partnered with IBM and RedHat to develop an IBM MAS on ROSA reference architecture. ROSA is a fully-managed, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/containers/">turnkey application platform</a> that allows companies to focus on deploying applications and accelerate innovation by off-loading the cluster lifecycle management to RedHat and AWS, and has now supported configuration for IBM MAS. This means that customers don’t have to create, manage and maintain their own RedHat OpenShift clusters for IBM MAS.</p>



 Maximo Migration and Operating Model 







 Top 3 ways to accelerate Maximo migration to AWS 



<p>In order to migrate to the cloud, there are three deployment models available to clients for running IBM MAS on AWS Cloud:</p>



 
 MAS SaaS on AWS powered by ROSA 



 MAS dedicated on AWS powered by ROSA 



 Customer-hosted ROSA 
 



 Reasons to adopt customer-hosted ROSA model 



<p>The customer-hosted ROSA option offers a powerful solution for hosting IBM MAS in a customer’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vpc">virtual private cloud (VPC)</a> with ROSA. As a container application platform, ROSA enables seamless deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications, making it an ideal choice for a MAS deployment.</p>



<p>The advantages of this option are significant. Businesses can have full control over the infrastructure while still being subject to the organization’s monitoring, controls and governance policies, allowing for greater customization and flexibility to tailor the environment precisely to their needs. This control extends to implementing additional MAS integrations and the ability to enforce existing cloud security and governance policies. Also, ROSA charges are consolidated into the unified AWS bill and draw down on any AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/enterprise/">enterprise agreement</a>, streamlining financial management.</p>



<p>Clients that have an AWS enterprise agreement or a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/compute-pricing/">Compute Savings Plan</a> can take advantage of savings for the underlying infrastructure supporting the MAS implementation. Likewise, because the ROSA cluster runs in the customer’s AWS account, they have the option of purchasing upfront ROSA contracts and taking advantage of receiving either <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rosa/pricing/">one-year or three-year savings plan</a> on the ROSA service fee.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to share the public preview of delegating Azure role assignment management using conditions. This preview gives you the ability to enable others to assign Azure roles but add restrictions on the roles they can assign and who they can assign roles to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the owner of an Azure subscription, you likely get requests from developers to grant them the ability to assign roles in your subscription. You could assign them the Owner or User Access Administrator role, but those roles grant permission to assign any Azure role (including Owner!), and that’s probably a lot more permission than necessary for that developer’s scenario. You could instead make role assignments for these developers on demand, but that makes you an unnecessary and impractical bottleneck in their workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another common case we hear about is a deployment pipeline that needs to make role assignments as part of the deployment process, for example to grant a virtual machine managed identity access to Azure Storage and other resources. You don’t want to assign the deployment pipeline the Owner or User Access Administrator role because again, it’s a lot more permission than is needed for the scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We created this feature so you can grant permission to create role assignments, but only under specific conditions, such as for specific roles. You can do this in two ways:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Make a role assignment that is constrained using conditions.&nbsp; 
 Use a new built-in role that has built-in conditions.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at each scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to delegate role assignment management using conditions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meet Dara, a developer who needs to enable an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) managed identity to pull images from an Azure Container Registry (ACR). Now, you can assign Dara the Role Based Access Administrator role and add conditions so she can only assign the AcrPull and AcrPush roles and only to service principals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Delegate Azure role assignment management using conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to do this step by step:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: When creating a new role assignment, on the Privileged administrator roles tab select the new Role Based Access Control Administrator role. You could also select any built-in or custom role that includes the Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Select role</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: On the Members tab, select the user you want to delegate the role assignments task to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Select members</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: On the Condition tab, click Add condition to add the condition to the role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Add condition to role assignment&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: On the Add role assignment condition page, specify how you want to constrain the role assignments this user can perform by selecting one of the templates. For example, if you only want to restrict the roles that a user can assign (ex. AcrPull and AcrPush) and the type of principals the user can assign roles to (ex. service principals), select the Constrain roles and principal types template.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Select role template</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5: On the Constrain roles and principal types pane, add the roles you want the user to be able to assign and select to what principal types the user can assign roles to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Select role and principal type&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 6: Save the condition and complete the role assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Review role assignment with conditions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to delegate role assignment management using a new built-in role with built-in conditions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Dara wants to control who can sign into virtual machines using Microsoft Entra ID credentials. To do this, Dara needs to create role assignments for the Virtual Machine User Login or Virtual Machine Administrator Login roles. In the past, you had to grant Dara the Owner or User Access Administrator role so she could make these assignments. Now, you can grant Dara the new Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator role. Then, Dara will only be able to assign the roles needed to manage access to the virtual machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, you can assign Key Vault Data Access Administrator role to trusted users managing key vaults, enabling them to assign only Azure Key Vault-related roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assign the new built-in roles with built-in conditions, start a new role assignment, select the Job function roles tab, and select a role with built-in conditions, such as Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator. Then complete the flow to add a new role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9 Select Key Vault or Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roles with built-in conditions have Data Access Administrator as part of the role name. Also, you can check if a role definition contains a condition. In the Details column, click View, select the JSON tab, and then inspect the condition property. Over time we’ll add more roles with built-in conditions, for the most common scenarios, to make it easy to manage resources and manage access to those resources with simple role assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Next steps 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have several<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/delegate-role-assignments-examples"> examples</a> for you to get started and customize as needed. Delegating Azure role assignments with conditions is supported using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager REST API, PowerShell, and Azure CLI. Try it out and let us know your feedback in the comments or by using the Feedback button on the Access control (IAM) blade in the Azure portal!</p>

<p>We’re betting that your customers are growing increasingly concerned about safeguarding their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> in an increasingly connected digital world. With data breaches and other privacy infringements at an <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/02/another-reason-to-use-mysudo-data-breaches-hit-record-high-in-2021/">all-time high</a>, it’s hard to escape the headlines screaming at consumers to be more proactive about their privacy. What’s more, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer polls</a> all indicate that a growing number of consumers actually want to be proactive about privacy and want brands to step up too.<br><br>Two valuable ways that your customers can guard against <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">scammers</a> are to develop safe browsing habits and use a password manager. For example, you could give your customers this common advice:</p>



 Safe browsing: navigating the digital landscape securely 







<p>a) Keep your software up to date: Regularly updating your operating system, web browser, and security software is an easy way to make sure you have the latest patches and fixes, shielding you from known vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>b) Beware of phishing attempts: Phishing emails and websites are designed to deceive you into revealing sensitive information. Stay vigilant by double-checking email senders, avoiding suspicious links, and refraining from sharing personal data on unverified websites.</p>



<p>c) Use secure connections: Make sure the websites you visit use the HTTPS protocol, particularly when you’re submitting sensitive information such as passwords or payment details. HTTPS encrypts the data transmission, making it significantly more challenging for malicious actors to intercept.</p>



<p>d) Exercise caution with downloads: Only download files or software from trusted sources. Scan files for malware before opening them, since malicious downloads can compromise your data and privacy.</p>



 Password managers: your secure vault for stronger login credentials 







<p>a) Generate strong, unique passwords: Password managers help you create complex passwords that are difficult to crack. You can generate and store unique passwords for each account, eliminating the need to remember them all.</p>



<p>b) Encrypted password storage: Password managers store your login credentials in an encrypted format, so even if the data is compromised, it remains unreadable to unauthorized people.</p>



<p>c) Convenient autofill and synchronization: With a password manager, you can conveniently autofill login forms across devices, eliminating the need to type passwords manually. Synchronization capabilities allow you to access your passwords securely from multiple devices.</p>



<p>d) Two-factor authentication (2FA) integration: Many password managers support 2FA, providing an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step, such as a fingerprint scan or a unique code sent to your mobile device.</p>



<p>Protecting your data privacy requires an active and conscious effort in today’s digital landscape. By embracing safe browsing practices and using a password manager, you take significant steps towards safeguarding your personal information from cyber threats and reclaiming your online privacy.</p>



<p>This is all great advice to give your customers and we highly recommend you do. But what if we told you that you could go the extra mile and easily package a safe browser and VPN into your product mix? You’d make privacy management easier for your customers and build brand loyalty and revenue streams for your bottom line.</p>

<p>For far too many organizations, Identity and Access Management (IAM) has become a study in locking the storm window while leaving the front door wide open. From MGM to Facebook to T-Mobile and beyond, 2023 has found a growing number of security teams forced to chase down data breaches, ransomware attacks, and phishing scams after network access has been granted. Without the architecture to support modern forms of identity verification, we can’t seem to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting compromised logins to infiltrate corporate systems. Here’s why this keeps happening—and how plugging the identity gap in your IAM architecture can stop the insanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 IAM a Mess: Why Your MFA Can’t Keep the MOFOs Out 
<p>Hackproof IAM requires two things: Verifying the identity of a user at enrollment and confirming that it’s this same individual attempting to log into an account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most IAM systems are decades old and lack identity verification. Putting a checkmark to rudimentary identity verification for new users and then issuing weak credentials via email or Post-it note? Good luck with that. Password- and basic multi-factor authentication (MFA)-based IAM can only really ensure the person accessing an account knows the password or OTP. While basic forms of biometric authentication can confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so, it can’t verify that person is who they claim to be. This is especially true for device-based biometrics, hardware tokens, and passkeys that assume but do not verify identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short: That proverbial front door is left wide open to account takeover (ATO)—including growing numbers that lead to <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/resource/ransomware-gangs-take-less-than-a-day-to-breach-microsoft-active-directory-heres-what-to-do">Active Directory (AD)</a> and <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/north-korea-s-kimsuky-doubles-down-on-remote-desktop-control">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</a> breaches. But it doesn’t have to be this way.&nbsp;</p>
 Modernizing IAM: Architecture is Everything 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we long ago recognized what’s needed is a way to verify and authenticate identity online the same way we confirm it in real life—with a valid credential that can’t be vouched for by mere password, OTP, or a static, spoofable biometric. So we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within an architecture that gives IT unmatched identity assurance behind each device used to access systems—while delivering an account registration and authentication experience that is as convenient as its hack proof. This architecture is built on the following five core pillars to fully eliminate the failures of traditional IAMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine-verified Identity</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 1Kosmos architecture employs automated, digitally-verified identity exceeding stringent KYC, KYE, and AML guidelines. Identity verification via government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, certifications, health records, etc.) enables organizations to standardize the onboarding of workers, customers, and citizens to prevent the use of synthetic and stolen identity information at account enrollment—and seamless authentication that’s impervious to account takeover at login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Biometric-based Strong User Authentication</p>
<p>&nbsp;Verified biometrics secured cryptographically with public-private keys vastly outperform passwords in both security and convenience. That’s why we built the first (and only) architecture to support and exceed <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics</a>–, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a> security standards. Passwords are replaced with a secure identity wallet and a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">liveness test</a> to confirm the person attempting to log in is, in fact, the authorized user and not a bot, deep fake, or imposter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity With Privacy by Design</p>
<p>Once biometrics are digitized and stored, they can be stolen. In 1Kosmos BlockID, unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) is prevented through a blockchain-based digital “chain of custody” for identity-related data. Because 1Kosmos is anchored by a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/">Privacy by Design</a> framework, organizations can confidently accelerate user onboarding, protect digital accounts from ATO, combat transaction fraud, and more. Fraudulent access attempts are detected, logged, and blocked automatically. And it’s all done in full compliance with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and other privacy mandates.</p>
<p>A Private, Permissioned Distributed Ledger&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This immutable “chain of custody” provides tamper-evident identity verification and reusable verifiable credentials on demand. This enables the user’s digital identity wallet to securely store a wide range of information—personal details, legal and education credentials, financial accounts, digital health records, etc. With irrefutable proof of identity and an immutable audit log of all updates and access attempts, organizations can focus on building customer loyalty and capture market share from less tech-savvy rivals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reusable Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>High assurance and cryptographically secure storage and sharing establish repeatable, high-trust re-verification across a wide array of use cases. This can range from establishing “inferred” identity based on an email address or device that’s adequate for the intended use, to cross-referencing biometrics with government-issued forms of ID or information from banking, telco, or corporate databases, to the very highest levels of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) mandates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A Foundation for Future-Proof IAM 
<p>This is all just the beginning. In forthcoming posts in this series, we’ll take a closer look at each pillar and its role in enabling and supporting a consistent and secure onboarding and authentication experience into all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In the current digital landscape, the line that differentiates identity management from robust security is fast blurring. Many traditional identity solutions, initially designed to assist small businesses in transitioning identities to the cloud, are now buckling under the challenges posed by advanced enterprise complexities. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, initially conceived to simplify cloud-based identity, serves as a case in point. Its ongoing struggles highlight the pivotal difference between companies constructed mainly for identity management and those forged for identity security from the ground up, like HYPR.</p>  
 Defining an Identity Security Company  
<p>An identity security company goes beyond managing credentials; it embodies the protection of every snippet of information, every user interaction, and every digital echo from mounting threats. Unlike traditional identity companies that prioritize convenience, an identity security company places security as its top priority. Moreover, the focal point isn't solely user authentication, but on safeguarding the entire span of digital actions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Foundational Identity Security Controls  
<p>To genuinely emphasize security in identity management it’s important to embed identity security controls into the very fabric of the organization. These include:</p> 
  
  Phishing-Resistant Authentication Everywhere: It’s paramount to implement authentication methods that are <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">resilient to phishing attacks</a>. Moreover, there should never be a fallback to weaker or more vulnerable authentication techniques.  
  Security Education Across the Entire Business: Ensure a continuous inflow of updates on emerging threats and the latest security best practices. This must apply to everyone across the company, not just people touching the product.&nbsp;  
  Make the Business Allergic to Shared Secrets: When a hacker gets a foothold in an environment, they look for shared secrets such as API keys, tokens, static credentials, and others to try to spread throughout the environment. Eliminate shared secrets wherever possible and when you do have to use them, put tight controls on who has access and how they can be used.&nbsp;  
  Routine Security Audits That Aren’t Routine: Don’t just go for the checklist approach to security audits and compliance. Understand the true intent behind the compliance, regulatory or security obligations so that you are addressing core security needs. This keeps you ahead of the curve and able to implement solutions that mesh with your business objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Make Security Your Company Culture:&nbsp; A security-first mindset starts at the top. Understand that your customers' security needs take priority and reflect this in the choices you make.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Designing a Secure Architecture  
<p>A well-designed secure architecture lays the foundation for a strong and reliable identity security solution. Critical elements include:</p> 
  
  Comprehensive Vulnerability Management: Invest time, effort and money into testing your solution from various angles to eliminate blind spots. Partner with multiple third-parties who are experts in their part of the tech stack. For us at HYPR, that means working with specialized pen testing partners on Mobile, Endpoint, Back-End, and Cloud.  
  Adherence to the Least Privilege Principle: Granting access only to essential resources ensures data integrity.  
  Uninterrupted Monitoring: A 24/7 vigil on all operations is vital to preemptively detect and counteract any potential threats.  
  
 Why Security Cannot Be an Afterthought  
<p>For companies in the identity domain, security must not be just a supplementary feature — it's their bedrock. Even a minor breach can erode trust and have <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">lasting financial implications</a>. As the nature of cyber threats intensifies, a persistent and unwavering focus on security transitions from being an option to an imperative. By prioritizing security from the beginning, identity companies like HYPR ensure robust protection at all points of the digital journey.</p> 
 Guidance for Buyers: Making Informed Choices in Identity Products  
<p>When it comes to choosing an identity product, it's essential to make informed choices. Look for companies with a demonstrated track record in prioritizing security. By taking the time to gather information and ask the right questions, buyers can ensure they make the best choice for their identity security needs.</p> 
  
  Delve Deeper Than Features: The underlying principles, commitments, and practices of a company are often more telling than a mere feature list.  
  Ask for a Threat Model: Your Identity partners should be able to walk you through a comprehensive threat model of their business. If your security and technical folks aren’t happy with it, there’s a major issue.&nbsp;  
  Demand Transparency: Reputable companies will be forthright about their security protocols and will not shy away from sharing audit outcomes.  
  Verify Compliance Credentials: It's vital to ensure the solution aligns with global benchmarks like GDPR, CCPA, and the like. Be sure to check out HYPR’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/trust-center/security-compliance">Compliance and Certifications</a>.  
  Seek Genuine Feedback: Interactions with current clients offer a transparent window into the product’s real-world performance.  
  
<p>To wrap up, as our digital footprints grow and identities become more intertwined with our real-world selves, the distinction between simply managing and truly securing these identities becomes paramount. HYPR, with its foundational emphasis on security, ensures that the complexities of identity management are met with unwavering security measures. While no one can be perfectly secure,&nbsp; our security first approach gives even the largest and most complex businesses in the world the confidence to work with HYPR.</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Whether private or public sector, B2B or B2C, our customers are excited by the power&nbsp; and value of verifiable credential technology. It’s a game-changing way to share and verify data and build seamless processes that deliver a multitude of benefits. From passwordless access to seamless account verification, mobile driver’s licenses to digital travel credentials, device monitoring to data sharing networks, verifiable credentials are driving digital transformation through the ability to trust the source and integrity of any kind of data, deter fraud, and deliver the kind of data protection demanded by regulators.</p>
<p>Healthcare companies are using verifiable credentials to develop more accurate and simple ways for patients to share health records between providers. Financial service companies are using verifiable credentials to power real-time account access verification. And governments are using verifiable credentials to deliver better access to business and public services for millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>None of this requires starting afresh or committing to months or years of complex implementation. Verifiable credential technology can be layered on top of what you already have in a matter of weeks or a few months (making it fast and cost effective to implement and use. It’s also easy and cost effective to scale up to whatever scale you need to achieve.</p>
<p>Benefits of verifiable credentials&nbsp;</p>
<p>In simple terms, verifiable credentials are powered by cryptographic trust and digital signatures. You can prove the source of any data presented from a verifiable credential and that the data hasn’t been tampered with. It’s a brilliant, simple, and (energy) efficient use of distributed ledger technology and new protocols and standards.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means you don’t need to directly integrate different data sources or rely on third parties to manage identity verification. Data issued by a bank can be instantly verified by a retailer with the absolute assurance that it came from the named bank and hasn’t been altered. Instantly actionable data allows you to create new ways of doing business or radically simplify any kind of business interaction or service where high-value information has to be shared and verified (think KYC or mortgage applications or drone flight paths).</p>
<p>The ability to authenticate anyone (and they you) in a secure digital interaction deters fraud and phishing and makes the continuous verification needed for zero-trust security implementations a breeze.</p>
<p>So how do you get started? Indicio Proven™ is our complete product for building what we call a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. It’s based on our award-winning solutions for global enterprises and has everything you need to issue, hold, present, and share verifiable credentials — including a simple way to manage governance!</p>
<p>Instead of developer teams spending months installing new IAM systems, here’s how easy it is to go from an idea to implementation in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Deployment in 3 easy steps</p>
<p>Whether you are a large enterprise with expansive resources or a small team with just a few developers, Indicio Proven™ is designed to be easy to adopt and integrate into your existing systems.</p>
<p>1. Install the Proven™ Issuer software agent on your&nbsp; server and connect it to the data source or service of their choice via standard APIs.</p>
<p>2. Use the&nbsp; Proven™ Issuer agent software to send&nbsp; an invitation URL (often in a QR code) to the person or organization you want to send a verifiable credential to (a “holder”). The verifiable credential contains the holder’s&nbsp; data, in an encrypted format, which is stored in a secure digital wallet app under the holder’s control, usually on their mobile device.</p>
<p>3. The holder can now present the data in their credential to anyone who has the Indicio Proven™ Verifier agent software, which can also be used on a mobile device. The Verifier application can also be connected via APIs to other services or systems to transmit the verified data.</p>
<p>Indicio helps a broad range of companies and organizations — <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">including SITA</a> —to&nbsp; build verifiable credential solutions using the latest open standards and open-source protocols.</p>

  <p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Graph Activity Logs. Have you wondered what applications are doing with the access you've granted them? Have you discovered a compromised user and hoped to find out what operations they have performed? If so, you can now gain full visibility into all HTTP requests accessing your tenant’s resources through the Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Note: We're enabling&nbsp;the feature starting today. Public preview will be available in all public cloud regions within two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>You’re currently able to collect SignIn logs to analyze authentication activity and Audit logs to see changes to important resources. With Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, you can now investigate the complete picture of activity in your tenant – from token request in SignIn logs, to API request activity (reads, writes, and deletes) in Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, to ultimate resource changes in Audit logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Graph Activity Logs include information about the request and client application. Some common use cases include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identifying the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant. 
 Building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs – such as an application enumerating all users; or making probing requests with many 403 errors.  
 Investigating unexpected or unnecessarily privileged assignments of application permissions. 
 Identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications – such as extreme call volumes that exhaust rate-limits for the tenant. 
 
<p><br>To illustrate working with these logs, we can look at some basic LogAnalytics queries:<br><br>Summarize applications and principals that have made requests to change or delete groups in the past day:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)</p>
<p>| where RequestUri contains '/group'</p>

<p>It seems you can’t go anywhere today without <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-ai">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> creeping into the conversation. Billed by some as being as, or potentially more disruptive than the internet, AI and machine learning (ML) are laying the foundation for the next digital age, whether we’re ready or not.</p>
<p>Bankers are taking note. According to a survey from <a href="https://impact.economist.com/perspectives/financial-services/forging-new-frontiers-advanced-technologies-will-revolutionise-banking">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, 77% of bankers believe that the ability to unlock the value of AI will be the difference between winning and losing banks. And there are many obvious use cases for bankers to up their game with AI including:</p>
 
 Account inquiries – employing chatbots to provide updates on account balances, transaction history, and other account-related information 
 Credit score monitoring – AI-enabled assistance for customers to check their credit ratings and advice on how to improve them 
 Fraud prevention – training AI models to detect fraudulent patterns and behaviors 
 Customer service – deploying chatbots to provide real-time customer care by answering common questions and addressing simple issues 
 Investment guidance – real-time, personalized investment advice leveraging AI to provide targeted assistance based on consumers’ specific preferences and risk tolerance 
 
<p>But it’s not all sunshine and unicorns as they say. AI is also being adopted by cybercriminals of all shapes and sizes at an alarming rate, straining traditional cybersecurity paradigms. AI’s automation prowess is a double threat – increasing the scale of attacks, while also lowering the required skill level and resources to be able to execute attacks. And banks are seeing the impact firsthand. U.S. banks reported a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2023/banks-and-payment-firms-tap-ai-to-combat-fraud-amid-surge-in-sophisticated-financial-crime/">43% increase in fraud attacks</a> year over year, with the average cost of fraud for large financial institutions jumping by 65%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/colum-lyons-expert-comment-the-rise-of-ai-deepfakes-and-how-to-take-back-control/">Deepfakes</a> and <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/three-questions-to-ask-about-synthetic-identities">synthetic identities</a> represent two of the most nefarious challenges to banks and credit unions who are seeking to prevent fraudulent account openings and takeovers while also complying with eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) regulations. An added challenge is to apply an extra layer of security AND improve the customer experience. For account opening this starts with AI-enabled document validation and biometric identity verification using the customer’s mobile phone. This ensures the document is a valid form and instance of the credential, and that the person presenting the identity credential is the owner of that credential. Once verified, the customer provides a digital signature to accept the terms and conditions and presto! – a digital payment credential is issued securely, all in a matter of minutes!</p>
<p>Once the account is opened, AI and ML also play a critical role in helping the financial institution model and detect fraud, plus enhanced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/iam-adaptive-authentication-ds.pdf">risk-based authentication</a> with behavioral biometrics helps identify fraudulent patterns and unauthorized users early.</p>

<p>You come into a gathering, and everyone is talking about verifiable credentials. What’s the first thing that comes to mind? You’ll most likely think of certifications, degrees, or anything that belongs to you that can be used to attest that you are who you say you&nbsp;are.</p><p>In the physical world, a credential can be a physical asset one can carry around in their wallet to prove their identity. Credentials can be verified by examining them or by making a call to the issuers of such credentials. For&nbsp;example</p>  A birth certificate issued by a hospital proves when and where you were born and who your parents&nbsp;are  A passport can be issued by the government of a country to prove that you’re a citizen of that&nbsp;country  A certificate issued by the university proves that you have an educational degree  <p>All of these are physical examples of credentials with a human subject, but how does this play out in the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>In the first article in this series, we looked at decentralized identity and why it matters. In this piece, we’ll be delving deeper into verifiable credentials and how they work. First, let’s take a look at some of the problems VCs are trying to&nbsp;solve.</p>  Identity fraud: Verifiable credentials provide a secure and tamper-proof way of sharing personal information, reducing the risk of identity&nbsp;fraud.  Information leakage: Sharing of user data is often done in bulk, leading to leakage of more information than necessary and loss of privacy. Through selective disclosure, verifiable credentials can be used to limit the amount of personal information that is shared while still enabling organizations to verify the information they&nbsp;need.  Data silos: Centralized systems often require individuals to share sensitive information with every organization that needs it, leading to the creation of large honeypots of user data with many organizations, increasing the risk of data breaches.  Walled gardens: Issuers of credentials can impose barriers to verification if they are involved in the verification process. Verifiable credentials are self-certifying and don’t require the involvement of the issuer when being verified.   How VCs&nbsp;work <p>There are three entities you’ll come across quite often while studying verifiable credentials:</p>  The issuer  The holder  The verifier  <p>The entity that issues the credential is known as the issuer; the holder is the subject of the credential; and the verifier is the organization that determines if the credential satisfies the requirements for a VC. Let’s take a look at each of these entities in&nbsp;detail:</p> The Issuer <p>An issuer in a verifiable credentials ecosystem is an entity that creates and issues digital credentials to holders. These issuers can be academic institutions, banks, the government, or corporate bodies.</p><p>For example, a university might be an issuer of a digital diploma to a student named John. The university would be responsible for creating the digital diploma, which would include information such as the student’s name, degree earned, and graduation date.</p><p>The university would then issue the digital diploma to the student, who would be the credential holder. The issuer must prove that they are authorized and competent to issue digital credentials by providing a form of identification and proof of identity, which can be done by providing a digital certificate or signature.</p> The Holder <p>A holder is an individual or entity that holds or possesses a digital credential, such as a diploma, a driver’s license, or a professional certification. The holder can present the credential to a verifier, such as an employer or a government agency, to prove their identity or qualifications.</p><p>John, from our previous example, is a recent graduate from a university. The university is the issuer of John’s diploma. John is the holder of his diploma, meaning he possesses it in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>The holder can also compile the data sent by one or more issuers and create a verifiable presentation.</p> The Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that checks the authenticity of a credential issued to a holder by an issuer. It also checks for other things, like validity and competency.</p><p>In this example, when John applies for a job, the employer, who is the verifier, will ask John to present his diploma to prove that he has completed his degree. The employer uses a set of verifiable credentials protocols to check the authenticity of the credentials. This includes verifying the issuer’s signature, checking that the credential has not been tampered with, and confirming that the information in the credential matches the information that the employer has on file for&nbsp;John.</p><p>Once the employer has verified the credential, they can trust that the information in the credential is accurate and that it was issued by a trusted issuer, which allows the employer to make informed decisions about John’s qualifications for the&nbsp;job.</p> Let’s graphically look at the workflow for verifiable credentials: <p>The issuer signs an identity and sends it to the holder. The holder creates a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier. The verifier checks to know if the data is competent, viable, and authentic. Another possible workflow is that the verifier requests data from the holder, who reaches out to the issuer to send the&nbsp;data.</p><p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, the issuer and holder are required to use decentralized identifiers or DIDs. A decentralized identifier (DID) is a technique to identify something or oneself online without depending on a centralized entity, such as a large corporation or the government. Imagine it as the digital equivalent of your passport or license that you may use to verify your identity&nbsp;online.</p> Deconstructing a Verifiable Credential <p>A subject is typically a person, but it could also be a thing, such as hardware device type, expiration, and issuer, which are properties of the credential proof used to verify the integrity of a credential. A proof is typically expressed as a digital signature, made with the private key of the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Main problems currently experienced in the VC&nbsp;world. <p>According to Cheqd’s deep-dive survey on technical trends in decentralized identity, the top 5 blockers to the adoption of decentralized identity by enterprises</p><p>The fundamental element of SSI is receiving a set of claims and verifiable credentials in your identity wallet and then presenting them to a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>The mechanism that delivers one verifiable credential to a holder’s wallet must be able to connect with a totally separate piece of software that is receiving a verifiable credential or presentation on the end of the verifier in order for SSI to become an interoperable ecosystem.</p><p>Different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials should be compatible, making it easy for credentials to be recognized and accepted across different platforms and organizations.</p><p>However, the various systems currently do not allow for credential interoperability.</p><p>Verifiable credentials are also not as user-friendly as they should be and are difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use, as they require a certain level of technical knowledge and may involve multiple different software and hardware components.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), the W3C Credentials Community Group, and the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) are working to promote the development of open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials. They aim to make SSI systems more user-friendly and to promote interoperability between different SSI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While these organizations are working to solve these problems, they still persist. The complexity of verifiable credentials and the infrastructure required to support them still make them difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use. Additionally, interoperability issues between different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials remain a problem, as do the privacy and security issues that verifiable credentials can&nbsp;pose.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veramo/how-verifiable-credentials-work-2648733abd59">How Verifiable Credentials Work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veramo">Veramo</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our world is evolving faster than ever. Technology has woven itself into our daily lives, bringing unprecedented convenience and posing new challenges. As we step into the 20th Annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we are at a crossroads: a world where much of the way we interact and conduct business and commerce is digital-first, and one where data, privacy, and identity are under rising threats.</p>
<p>Our ability to add trust and security into this digital-first world is the key to unlocking its many benefits to business, government, and our everyday lives.</p>
<p>A Digital World in Flux</p>
<p>This is where Cybersecurity Awareness Month takes center stage. Founded in 2004, this annual initiative has become a global call to action, illuminating the path toward a safer digital future. It’s a collaborative endeavor, uniting businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individuals in a shared mission to educate and empower.</p>
<p>This year, Cybersecurity Awareness Month introduces a new theme, “Secure Our World,” focusing on four pivotal best practices:</p>
 
 Password Manager Advocacy: Debunking myths surrounding password managers and emphasizing their benefits. 
 Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): Encouraging the adoption of multi-factor authentication for enhanced security. 
 Phishing Awareness: Equipping individuals to recognize and thwart phishing attempts, a prominent tactic of cybercriminals. 
 Update Hygiene: Promoting the importance of regular software updates and automated updates. 
 
<p>These best practices are just the start, of course, and critical for individuals seeking to improve their own security posture. We provide many of these services to customers, including <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/zero-trust-foundations-sb.pdf">multi-factor authentication and phishing-resistant identities</a>.</p>
<p>Commitment to Cybersecurity That Enables a Digital World</p>
<p>At Entrust, securing the digital world isn’t just a mission; it’s wound into the very fibers of our DNA. We take this mission seriously because our customers take this mission seriously. We know that when we provide solutions that protect data, enable strong identities, and secure payments, we are enabling everyday moments that require a high degree of trust. They are astonishingly easy for end-users yet highly complex to implement.</p>
<p>As digital life accelerates, we‘re helping our customers solve bigger challenges, like Zero Trust frameworks and multi-cloud network security. We are enabling seamless and secure travel, and readying enterprises for post-quantum encryption. We’re also supporting banks and governments to secure and enable digital-first journeys for account opening and government services.</p>
<p>As we celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Entrust stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community, embracing the challenge of securing an ever-evolving digital world. While our experts contribute their insights and guidance, security and business leaders need to protect their organizations and enable their growth and scale.</p>

 Change announcements: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning January 2024, Microsoft Entra ID will support <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpasskeys.dev%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fterms%2F%23device-bound-passkey&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BLpGtZFtGXHPKMbnR5ifT8fFFrl0nOCa3L4K87QgoQk%3D&amp;reserved=0">device-bound passkeys</a> stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy and end user experiences to support this preview release. For your organization to opt-in to this preview, you will need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhowto-authentication-passwordless-security-key&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ac9DQ7dxszepy0kftYRCNrGS4hqqwUq46SMrAPagpgc%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys will be renamed to “Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, computers, and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Updates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a three-year deprecation period, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced in June 2023</a> that we are entering the retirement, or shut down, cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs, which are now out of support (other than security-related fixes). This aligns with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support">Breaking Change Policy</a> that promises a minimum two (2) year deprecation period before API retirement. In June, we also described that this retirement would happen in stages and with advanced notice between each stage. The first stage will involve newly created Applications being unable to use Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While there are limited substantial updates to share at this point, we do want to provide an interim update. Our goal is to be transparent and establish a regular cadence of communication as we work with and support our customers through this service retirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>September 2023 updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Some customers have told us that it is hard to identify or find which applications are using the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs, and at what scale. We are now working to deliver an analytics experience through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Identity Recommendations</a> that will provide the information that you need to identify and prioritize applications that require update or modification to avoid further disruption. We will provide an estimated release date for this experience soon. 
 As described in our prior communication, the first stage of retirement for Azure AD Graph APIs will involve a change that prevents newly-created <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0">Applications</a> from using Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). We will provide a minimum of three (3) months advance notice before this date. At this first stage, only newly created Applications, and not existing Applications, will be impacted.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a near-future update, we will provide more detail on the timeline and actions needed to avoid disruption for (new) Applications that are not yet migrated to Microsoft Graph. We have not yet set the date at which newly created Applications will be prevented from using Azure AD Graph APIs, but we are working diligently towards providing that clarity and to deliver experiences that will help support customer efforts in migrating applications away from this retiring API service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Action:</p>
<p>Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migrate Sign-in risk policy and User risk policy and from Entra ID Protection to Conditional Access</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have User risk policy or Sign-in risk policy enabled in Entra ID Protection (formerly Identity Protection) today, we invite you to migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a>. The UX in Entra ID Protection for these two risk policies will be retired on October 1, 2026</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuring Sign-in risk and User risk policies in Conditional Access provides these benefits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Manage all access policies in one place. 
 Report-only mode and Graph API support.&nbsp; 
 Greater flexibility by combining risk conditions with other conditions like location for granular access control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced security with multiple risk-based policies targeting different user groups or risk levels.&nbsp; 
 Improved diagnostics experience by viewing which risk-based policy applied in Sign-in Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Registration campaign improvements</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow. Note: admins can decide if they want to opt out of the “limited” 3 snooze configuration or give their end users the ability to snooze indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Entra ID tenants that are Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning&nbsp;September 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change for Entra ID premium tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support for Authenticator Lite in the per-user MFA policy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Authenticator Lite is only available to organizations who manage Microsoft Authenticator in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fconcept-authentication-methods-manage%23authentication-methods-policy&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=xRuXa6iKsZ92fRhu2QzLGrM6vrQf1Rk2mxs%2B6J22vyI%3D&amp;reserved=0">modern authentication methods policy</a>.

<p>Optimized MFA OTP delivery via WhatsApp</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;Entra ID&nbsp;(Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options#sms-message-verification">text message</a>. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-September 2023, users&nbsp;in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method 
 Already use WhatsApp 
 Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries

<p>Changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra admin center which states, “Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access,” will be retired. This means disabling My Groups will no longer be possible. In June, a new setting that enables admins to restrict end users from viewing and managing security groups in My Groups will take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the existing setting for Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Panel is configured as Yes, the new setting will restrict users' ability to see and edit security groups in My Groups. 
 &nbsp;If the existing setting is configured as No, the new setting will expose security groups in My Groups. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, please see this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#make-a-group-available-for-user-self-service">documentation</a>. Note: Admins can still manage end users' ability to create Microsoft 365 and security groups using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#group-settings">group settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable HTTP/2 on the Graph service endpoint</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454">previously announced</a> in September of 2022, the Microsoft Graph engineering team plans to begin rollout of HTTP/2 support on the Microsoft Graph service endpoint on September 15, 2023. HTTP/2 support will be in addition to existing HTTP/1.1 version support. Once HTTP/2 is enabled on the Microsoft Graph endpoints, clients that support HTTP/2 will negotiate this version when making requests to Microsoft Graph. Focus for improvements in the HTTP/2 specification concern performance, including perceived latency, and network and service resource usage (reference <a href="https://http2.github.io">https://http2.github.io</a>), including multiplexing, parallelism, and efficiency through binary encoding and header compression. These benefits may offer substantial value to Microsoft Graph clients and customers. HTTP/2 is expected to be entirely backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and to require no code changes in client applications. It's possible, in rare cases, that negative impact may occur with some client applications, if the application does not adhere to HTTP specifications concerning case-insensitive comparisons for Header keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In a recent survey conducted by Entrust across 10+ countries, banks, payment companies, and credit unions overwhelmingly reported that flat card technology has accelerated and shifted into overdrive. What may have been originally considered as an “unimpressive” change to the look of traditional embossing, flat cards have evolved into a financial issuance mainstay with astonishing designs and an elegant chic finish. Here we will explore the magnitude of this shift, input drivers, outputs, and future indicators.</p>
<p>Flat Card Adopters</p>
<p>Most interestingly, the survey highlights an astonishing 77% of surveyed financial institutions are actively issuing flat cards today. North America and Europe lead the way as they are typically the first global adopters of innovative technology with large banking headquarters on both continents.</p>
<p>Assuming similar technology adoption rates in this industry, we can expect a proportional upward trend and transition to flat card in the coming years. Even though embossed cards maintain some geographic and niche market presence – for example in Africa and the Middle East – the paradigm shift to flat technology has been further strengthened by significant gains in options for customization and efficiency.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Adoption Drivers</p>
<p>Equally compelling, when asked about the reason organizations choose to move to flat card, 73% of survey respondents identified two key components: enhanced branding opportunities and the modernization of traditional designs. Additionally, 60% cited either reduced cost and/or increased efficiency as the secondary driver, followed by maintaining a competitive advantage, staying relevant in the marketplace, and consumer demand.</p>
<p>When evaluating the factors influencing their decision to adopt flat card technology, respondents were almost evenly split between competitors driving the technology and marketing-driven requests in their go-to-market strategy, with competitors holding a slight edge in this regard. More specifically:</p>
 
 Among project management respondents, 36% attributed adoption to the need to stay competitive, while 26% attributed it to marketing directives. 
 Among those in payment roles, 43% indicated that adoption resulted from marketing department requests, with 30% attributing it to competitive pressure. 
 
<p>An alternative interpretation of the data reveals that internal requests, originating from marketing and operations, drove slightly over half of the adoptions, accounting for 51%, surpassing the influence of external factors such as competition (36%) and customer requests (9%). It is worth mentioning that adoption rates in this context are comparative within the nature of the survey itself and migration to innovative technologies typically includes elevated levels of consumer demand early in the product roadmap process.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Features</p>
<p>As financial institutions and fintechs migrate to flat card, the value proposition continues to become clearer. Customers demand fresh designs, a customizable platform, and the ability to connect with loyalty programs or niche movements like eco-friendly formats. Flat cards are delivering. Period.</p>
<p>When asked about the customizable features and benefits offered by flat cards, respondents cited the following as the most frequently utilized within their issuance arsenal:</p>
 
 Personalization on the card’s back, allowing the entire card front for financial institutions to highlight their brand 
 Vertical card orientation 
 Metallic personalization 
 Enhanced personal account number (PAN) features 
 
<p>Flat Card Technology Outputs</p>
<p>Simply, flat card drives business. Upon adoption of flat cards, 77% of respondents saw an increase in transaction volumes, including 61% of those who experienced a 1%-25% increase, and 15% realizing greater than 25% growth by volume. This is the most compelling evidence for any issuer considering the value proposition of switching to flat cards, making it nearly impossible not to draw significant conclusions about ROI and the decision to switch without delay.</p>
<p>The secondary responses in this same category paint a beautiful picture – flat cards save money. 64% saw machine efficiencies and additional cost savings, while another 40% cited third-party issuance efficiencies.</p>
<p>For anyone needing a reason to immediately evaluate the impact of flat cards on their business and, in turn, customer satisfaction, this is where the undeniable evidence is crystal clear. Banks that have adopted flat card are experiencing higher transaction volumes and lower costs. The icing on the cake? 92% highlight their enhanced capacity for personalized customization. Can it get any better than this?</p>
<p>Flat Card Future Predictors</p>
<p>Can we predict the future of flat card? Not quite. However, our survey respondents are certainly leading us down a favorable path. For those financial institutions who are not currently issuing flat cards, 56% plan to in the next two years, while 35% are exploring options to consider this newer technology.</p>
<p>A final thought on future predictors: 61% of those who have not adopted flat card have invested recently in new issuance systems. Although we do not know exactly what type of equipment or systems, this highlights the simple fact that options exist and machine lifecycles are long. We also know that certain geographies or regions continue to demonstrate some demand for traditional embossed cards – they play a significant role in perceived value and probably will continue to do so for the near future.</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support the flat card movement, bridging the gap between personalization equipment, secure customer interactions, and the latest technology and innovations in high-volume central and instant financial issuance for this technology. Our portfolio of solutions including Entrust Durable Graphics, Drop on Demand, Artista Desktop, Artista VHD, and Sigma DS4 Light Curing Module continue to offer product and platform flexibility built around flat card opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> provides open-source toolings powering the next-generation of decentralized applications, using a mix of IP management infrastructure, fine-grained access controls and privacy-preserving technology.</p><p>Until now, users building on the Ocean stack were required to store their data on any of their preferred storage methods, and consequently use Ocean components to publish &amp; encrypt the information pointing to their data, into a<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/contracts/data-nfts"> Data&nbsp;NFT</a>.</p><p>With the launch of <a href="https://uploader.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Uploader</a>, users gain a tool for storing files. Afterwards, they can easily connect them within the Ocean Protocol ecosystem using either the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-cli">ocean.cli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">ocean.js</a> or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a>.</p> Seamless file uploads with Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://uploader.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Uploader</a> streamlines the data upload process for users, facilitating direct transfers to decentralized storage platforms such as <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>. Traditionally, uploading to Arweave requires the AR token; however, Ocean Uploader leverages <a href="https://irys.xyz/">Irys</a> to enable users to pay for storage in MATIC, instead of AR tokens. The uploader efficiently manages all required conversions behind the scenes, leveraging the robust capabilities of the Ocean Protocol&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Furthermore, Uploader offers a range of powerful features tailored to meet the needs of decentralized storage management:</p>  User Content Uploads: Users can seamlessly upload their content through the user-friendly frontend interface.  Payment Handling: Uploader integrates with payment systems to manage the financial aspects of storage services.  Decentralized Storage: Content is pushed to decentralized storage networks like Arweave for enhanced security and redundancy.  API Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation on each repo to allow users to understand and interact with the system effortlessly.  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader.js">Uploader.js</a>: a TypeScript library designed to simplify interaction with the Uploader API. This library provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for calling API endpoints within the Ocean Uploader&nbsp;system.  <p>Ocean Uploader is built on multiple layers. At the core, there is <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader_backend">the backend layer</a>, which exposes both public and private APIs for interactions with the frontend and microservices. Additionally, there’s the microservice layer, serving each decentralized storage (currently Arweave) and future&nbsp;options.</p><p>Moving up the layers, there is the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader.js">open-source library</a> that provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for making API calls within the Ocean Uploader system. Building on this, we’ve also created a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib">UI component</a> that can be seamlessly integrated into your dApp, offering a range of functionalities right out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>And, to complete this puzzle, there’s the <a href="https://uploader.oceanprotocol.com/">UI</a> deployed by Ocean that you can readily&nbsp;use.</p> Connecting Data Storage with Data Monetization <p>Ocean Uploader is an evolutionary leap for all users of decentralized storage solutions as it connects data storage directly with data monetization solutions provided by Ocean Protocol. By streamlining the data storage, Ocean Uploader encourages greater adoption of decentralized storage options, as well as new business models built on top — eventually benefiting both data providers and data consumers.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> has pioneered the fusion of privacy-preserving technology with decentralized application development. The Ocean Protocol toolkit has empowered numerous developers and innovators to reimagine data’s potential, ensuring that it’s both a tool for progress and a valuable asset for its contributors.</p> About Arweave <p><a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> is a permanent and decentralized web inside an open ledger. Just like Bitcoin, but for data. Permanent storage has many applications: from the preservation of humanity’s most important data, to the hosting of truly decentralized and provably neutral web&nbsp;apps.</p><p>The Arweave protocol is stable, mature and widely&nbsp;adopted.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-ocean-uploader-seamless-file-uploads-70d563bc8167">Introducing Ocean Uploader: Seamless File Uploads</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p></p> Principal VIRA Features <p>Enhanced Privacy:&nbsp;<br>VIRA was created with the user's privacy in mind. It enables individuals to exercise control over their digital identity, ensuring that personal information is protected and shared only when and with whom the user deems appropriate.</p><p><br>Blockchain-Agnostic Technology:<br>VIRA's blockchain-agnostic approach is one of its most significant advantages. This technology is compatible with a variety of blockchain networks, ensuring that users are not restricted to a single platform. This adaptability is essential in a time when multiple blockchains and networks coexist, each with their own distinct advantages.</p><p><br>Interoperability:<br>Tangle Labs has constructed VIRA using open standards to maximize interoperability. This means that VIRA can be easily integrated into diverse digital ecosystems, allowing for seamless interactions across different platforms, industries, and services.</p><p><br>Self-sovereign Identity:<br>Using self-sovereign identity technology, VIRA enables individuals to own, control, and manage their identity without the need for intermediaries. This feature not only increases privacy, but also decreases the likelihood of identity theft and data breaches.</p><p><br>Decentralization:<br>With decentralization as its foundation, VIRA eliminates the need for centralized authorities to manage and verify identity. Rather, it employs blockchain technology to enable decentralized identity management, granting users absolute control over their personal data.</p><p><br><br></p> Impact of VIRA on Digital Identity <p>VIRA emerges as an important milestone in the realm of self-sovereign identity and decentralized identity management as digital identity continues to play a crucial role in our daily lives. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Empowering Users:<br>VIRA gives users the ability to manage their identities as they see fit. It returns control to the individual, allowing them to decide what and with whom they share information. This shift towards user-centric identity management is crucial for the protection of personal information and privacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Flexibility and Interoperability: <br>VIRA's blockchain-agnostic approach guarantees that it is not dependent on a particular network or technology. This adaptability is essential in the rapidly evolving digital world, where new blockchain platforms and technologies emerge on a regular basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Security and Trust: <br>Self-sovereign identity and decentralized identity management are essential for enhancing digital security and trust. VIRA mitigates the risks associated with data breaches and identity theft by decreasing reliance on centralized authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Universal Applicability:<br>VIRA's open standards and interoperability make it applicable to a vast array of industries, such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and more. This adaptability enables users to utilize their verifiable identity wallet in a variety of situations, thereby enhancing their online security and convenience.<br><br><br><br></p> What the Future Holds&nbsp; <p>The Beta release of VIRA positions Tangle Labs at the forefront of the upcoming eIDAS 2.0 and European Digital Identity Wallet space. Built to conform to these global standards and EU frameworks, VIRA will be able to support the upcoming regulatory updates that are expected in 2025. The EU mandate on cross-border interoperability for identity and verifiable credentials and documents will become <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281#:~:text=IDENTIFICATION%20MEANS%E2%80%99%3B-,(16),-the%20following%20Articles">a compulsory technology for businesses operating in education, transport, energy and water utilities, banking and finances, social services, healthcare, digital technologies and telecommunications, and more.</a></p>

Tangle Labs' presence in Berlin, Germany also provides VIRA with a solid foundation in the epicenter of Europe's technology and innovation. This global perspective, coupled with VIRA's features, makes it a valuable asset for individuals seeking to secure their digital identities across the globe.<br></p> And, last but not least… <p>VIRA by Tangle Labs is more than just an app; it is a significant step toward redefining how we manage and secure our digital identities. Individuals, businesses, and institutions are recognizing the need for enhanced privacy, control, and security as the digital landscape continues to evolve. VIRA addresses these concerns through its user-centric design, blockchain agnosticism, and dedication to self-sovereign and decentralized identity technology practices.</p><p>Tangle Labs has positioned itself as a key player in the digital identity space with the introduction of VIRA, a solution that empowers individuals, improves security, and fosters trust in a world that is increasingly digital. VIRA represents a beacon of hope for those seeking to regain control of their online identities as the digital identity landscape continues to evolve.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.tanglelabs.vira&amp;pli=1">Download VIRA beta for Android</a></p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/vira-wallet/id6466040524">Download VIRA beta for iOS</a></p><p><a href="https://demo.tanglelabs.io">Try out the demo</a></p><p></p><p>New to the 0.2.0-BETA</p>  <p>Updated UX/UI</p>  <p>Credential &amp; Connection tagging and search</p>  <p>Backup and restore functionality</p>  <p>Connections history </p>  <p>Auto-Lock functionality</p>  <p>Upgraded User Account &amp; Profiles</p>  <p>Multi-Lingual Support (if you want to help with translations, let us know)</p>  <p>Optimised QR interactions - near instant scan</p>  <p>Optimised codebase - just a 7MB Install!!!</p>  <p>Full support for iPad &amp; Android Tablet</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Did you know that in the United States, 38% of students enter a university with transfers from other universities? This highlights how crucial credit mobility is. However, there exists significant friction in credit mobility today, as I’m sure some readers have experienced in their own lives. Credit mobility is a challenge in itself within the United States, so we can imagine the challenges when considering students transferring from different countries.</p>
<p>What’s notable about the <a href="https://tech.asu.edu/initiatives/trusted-learner-network">Trusted Learner Network (TLN)</a> is that they’ve brought together key stakeholders from higher education institutions. These institutions recognize the business case for issuing user-controlled, portable, interoperable digital credentials, such as diplomas, to facilitate credit mobility and reduce associated costs and friction. They also understand the importance of making learner data more accessible and dynamic, as opposed to the current static nature of such data.</p>
<p>To give you a feel for the discussion, here are a couple of quote from the episode that I thought to be interested and very related one to another.</p>
<p>The first,</p>
<blockquote><p>So I feel like a diploma is extremely valuable, right? It represents the sort of culmination or termination of a set program of study towards a specific subject that is designed to empower the learner with like a both broad and deep understanding of what it is that they study it. It continues to be valuable and also the strongest trust signal that we have going for us in communicating that value. When we take a step back, though, we recognize that that diploma or degree is composed of a series of other credentials that might have individual that likely do have a very high individual value. So the average undergraduate student, when they graduate, they’re going to have taken about 40 courses or about 120 credits, and each of those 40 courses represents the achievement of a set of knowledge, skills, capabilities, and we can dig down perhaps even further to that to embrace things like skills and competencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>And second,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the diploma still have meaning? In the vision and the implementation that we’re working on, it actually is way more meaningful because it says so much more in a way that can actually be, you know, understood both&nbsp;by machines and people than, you know, what just a printed out diploma framed on my wall used to be able to communicate. </p></blockquote>
<p>By collaborating with a broader ecosystem, which includes learners and institutions beyond just higher education, such as employers, the Trusted Learner Network seeks to harness advancements in digital trust, enabling technologies, and ecosystem governance frameworks to transform the learner economy. The potential value unlocked by streamlining credit mobility and enhancing the significance of credentials like diplomas is immense. This leads us to consider other types of learner credentials that individuals might accumulate throughout their learning journey. Personally, I’ve gathered numerous ‘credentials’ post-University. How can we digitize these and present them to the rightful owner alongside more traditional credentials like diplomas?</p>
<p>Listen to this episode to learn more, and hopefully it will spark some great thoughts for you on the possible.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Kate, Andrew and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Impact of freely available online information on higher education – How has the trend of easily accessible online information, such as courses and certificates, influenced the strategies of universities and higher education institutions? 
 Value of diplomas and other credentials in the modern age – With the rise of various credentials and certificates, is the traditional university diploma still as valuable? What other credentials might a learner want to accumulate? 
 Modernizing systems of records and the role of issuers – How are systems of records being modernized to make credentials more mobile and trusted? Who are the potential issuers beyond traditional universities? 
 Value of personal references and incentives for issuers – Is there value in making it easier for individuals, like professors, to provide references or credentials? How do incentives differ for various types of issuers? 
 Importance of governance in the context of digital credentials – With the growing focus on governance over technology, how is the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital credentials being ensured? 
 User experience (UX) and wallet infrastructure for digital credentials – How is the user experience being optimized for digital credential wallets? Where will learner credentials be stored, and how will they be accessed? 
 Role of verifiers in the TLN digital credential ecosystem – How are verifiers being integrated into the network, and how does their role tie into the prioritization of use cases? How will the adoption of digital credentials be spurred among verifiers?

 We sit down with our Vice President of Global Gaming to discuss the upcoming changes to the UK’s gambling sector, the need for continued industry collaboration, and how to safeguard against the undeniable growth of the unlicensed market. 



 



<p>On the surface, there appears to be little in common between the tiny Caribbean island of Curaçao, and the densely populated island of the United Kingdom, but both will be important case studies in the evolution of the online gambling market, according to Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the established <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK gambling market is undergoing a series of changes to its regulatory framework</a> to reflect the digital age, Curacao, a market known for its low barrier to entry and <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/curacao-to-overhaul-regime-with-new-regulator-higher-bar-to-entry/">little to no scrutiny from operators</a>, is also reforming its licensing regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Important endeavors that Roger believes need to be undertaken carefully or run the risk of an exodus of licensed operators and increase in the use of the illegal market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This conundrum is shared across many international jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Ontario, and very soon, France,” explains Roger. “An open and fair environment is no guarantee of success. If we look at Norway, for example, many of the world’s most experienced and trusted operators have pulled out, leaving players with the binary choice of using a monopolized industry, or unlicensed operators.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although a delicate task to complete, offering a regulated gambling environment is key to the sustainable growth of a jurisdiction’s gambling market, and the pivotal third pillar in propping up a safe, secure and protected player environment. A burden of responsibility that any regulator must share with the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my opinion, it is first and foremost the operator’s responsibility to provide a safe and responsible gambling experience, because this is good for the operator’s business model. However, this must be facilitated by a reliable regulatory environment that is proactive in its fight against fraud and the illegal market. So, the regulator needs to be an ally to those licensed operators. This is how the player will become better protected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Roger shares his insights on the likely impact of the now <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/arguments-against-affordability-checks-gambling/">mandatory financial risk checks in the UK</a>, the real reason UK operators are subjected to such high and regular fines, why most operators are looking at <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> completely wrong, and much more.</p>



 The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) has started its first round of consultations. Do you agree with UKGC’s four areas of priority? Do you think there are other more pressing areas that it should have started with?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It was 2018 when the UKGC started to discuss issues around affordability, but back then it was under the umbrella topic of customer interactions, and markers of harm were not the center of focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Financial risk and financial vulnerability is the right topic to prioritize and the most important consultation to undertake, because affordability is the comfort zone for the player and the operator’s business. A gambling platform should be running its business with a business plan that is in line with its risk appetite, and ability to invest and be exposed to financial impact. In online casinos, there can be big losses and big payouts, so it’s important to balance the comfort zone of the operator with the comfort zone of the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, affordability is the customer playing and spending money in a way that is going to be sustainable in the long term for the business and the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the control of marketing and advertising consultation, however, I don’t think it’s detailed enough in terms of what they are trying to achieve. For example, what ‘good’ actually looks like has not been defined. It’s still quite vague, particularly in terms of the coordination and cooperation between the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) </a>from the UKGC, Competition and Markets Authority regulations, Advertising Standards Authority, and The UK Code of Broadcast Advertising requirements. As there are many contradictions between the various rules, I think the first consultation should be around organizing and encouraging those different regulatory bodies to have one set of objectives, ambitions, and rules.&nbsp;</p>



 What effect do you foresee the now mandatory financial risk checks to have on the UK gambling market?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>If the mandatory financial risk checks really end up being as ‘frictionless’ as the UKGC promises, then this is an opportunity to improve the relationship between the player and the operator, because the financial risk check will allow the operator to better know his customer and better tailor their offering; the pace and velocity of the game, and amounts that are going to be offered, either through marketing or the games themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m unaware of any operator that asks players what kind of games they prefer, or whether they’re playing for the thrill or something else. Usually, they will assess this based on the choice of games made by the players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, used correctly, affordability markers of harm and behavioral analysis will enable the operator to increase and improve the granularity of the relationship, or even initiate that relationship between the operator and the players. The other effect is that if it is not as frictionless as is promised, for example, credit checks are not granted to licensed operators, then the immediate effect is going to be a tremendous increase in the illegal market – what is called the black markets – and operators not licensed in the UK and not abiding by the UKGC and LCCP rules are simply going to offer their services illegally to players in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about IDnow’s financial risk check, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">industry’s most comprehensive, holistic affordability check</a>.</p>



 Responsible gambling has been a recurring theme for many years and features quite heavily in the UK gambling white paper. What does responsible gambling mean to you, and where should the burden of responsibility lie with regards to providing a safe and responsible gambling experience: with the regulator, the operator, or both?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the history of responsible gambling, the burden to play responsibly has always been on the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original approach was that if the player engages in problem gambling, it is because he decided to not use the tools as provided by the operator. The operator only had the responsibility to inform the players of the tools that were available to limit his activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then the industry started to evolve toward safer gambling, meaning the operator accepted its responsibility to create a proactively safe environment, where they conduct behavioral analysis to identify the variations and deviations of player behavior in activity, and proactively interact with players. This led the UKGC to devise its three-pillar strategy of Identify, Act, and Evaluate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there has been a shift from blaming players for problem gambling to accepting that not all players are necessarily aware of the amount of activity that they are engaging in, or the variations of activity they’ve displayed, and that the operator plays a very important part toward empowering player control through transparency, information sharing, interaction and action, alongside the actions of the player, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this shift really reflects this balancing of the two comfort zones: Who is my player? What is he capable of in terms of the games we are offering? It might be a very rich person that has an extremely high-risk appetite and high affordability, but does that mean he is impervious to harm? Not necessarily. You’ll have some players that have a very low level of affordability, but occasionally they’ll want that thrill. Should we prevent them from having that thrill just because they are not rich? Those are the questions around responsible gambling, affordability and the adequation between the comfort zones. And this is where KYC becomes the compass and blueprint for an operator’s business model: to understand their players, asses the appetite of their players, where you can create fair and transparent promotions that reflect the comfort zone between the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 With most gambling and gaming now taking place online, how important will technology, and in particular KYC and onboarding platforms, be in ensuring a safe and secure gaming experience?&nbsp; 



<p>Operators and regulators need to move away from viewing KYC as a process, or “tick box” exercise, and instead focus on the original purpose of KYC as a founding principle of running a sustainable business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that many operators are either not currently capable or are not effectively using the data they have access to build a single image of who the player is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you ask any operator if they had a single view and a single understanding of who their customer is, very few have a reliable, accurate, single view across their whole estate. So having this information on an industry level is pointless until operators themselves can aggregate this information, which will enable them to switch from the mindset that KYC is a process, to KYC is a business driver.</p>

 In information released since the publication of both the government and UKGC’s plans, Gambling Commission CEO, Andrew Rhodes, has said that the UKGC’s plans set out changes to ensure the UK is the safest and fairest place to gamble in the world. How feasible do you think this will be in a country that received a record-breaking £44.6 million fine in 2022; a 76% increase on 2021? Why do you think UK operators consistently receive such hefty fines?&nbsp; 



<p>There may be a link between the first and second question. If the UK is handing out so many fines, it could indicate that the UK is not a place where licensed operators are operating in a safe and fair way and are therefore heavily penalized for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing many operators in the UK, however, I do not think this is the reason they receive such hefty fines, so there’s a question around what the fines say about the UK’s regulated landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do know, and what we have seen recently, is many operators withdrawing from licensed activity in the UK, which will ultimately leave just the bigger operators offering services. Will it be fair in terms of pricing and the services that players will receive? I’m far from convinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second impact of the large and consistent fines is going to be operators applying for UK licenses with no intention of operating in the UK. Their market and customer base, whether in Asia, in Latin America, or Africa will be attracted by the prestige of the UK license. So, I think the UK gambling market will end up as an oligopoly, or filled with brands that have no intention of operating in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The illegal market will take great pleasure in catering to customers seeking a frictionless gaming experience, and I think this is extremely worrying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC should have regular discussions with the gambling industry to ensure the UK remains an attractive place for operators and investors. If most small and midsize investors in gambling companies are fleeing the UK, this is extremely worrying.</p>



 From established gambling markets like the UK to the tiny Caribbean Island of Curaçao, regulatory authorities are balancing offering competitive and flexible approaches to licensing and taxation with a safe and secure environment that discourages fraud and illegal gambling. What effect do you think Curacao’s stricter requirements have on the online gambling industry, and what lessons can be learned?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the specific case of Curaçao and the redesign of their regulations and implementation of stricter requirements, this will lead to increased blame of players in problem gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of its news licensing structure, Curaçao will request operators to offer better complaints management, meaning they will be responsible for effectively handling complaints by offering more ways for the player to express their discontent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, under the guise of stricter requirements and stricter responsibility, Curaçao regulations are not actually going to empower the player much more by requiring stronger action from operators, but this is a way to grant more direct responsibility for the operators, which today they do not have, so this is certainly progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the player will remain hostage to the goodwill of the operators. I think these stricter requirements have been put in place to adapt to a world where local regulators from each country are more aware of the capabilities of operators in providing a safe playing environment, and how to fulfil their role as offering better interactions with customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something we see in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ontario because they know that players need to be protected, and they know that players are best protected when the whole environment Is cooperating, when the regulator provides a reliable framework, and when the operator is interacting in a way that balances the comfort zone of the player with the comfort zone of the business. In this way, the player is protected via regulations, in terms of requirements of fairness, of marketing, transparency, help that they can receive and obligations from the operators.</p>

<p>Dear community,</p><p>After successfully implementing the Bokbunja Hard Fork in the Metadium testnet on September 26th, the Metadium Development Team spent weeks monitoring and confirming its stability and will move forward with its implementation in Metadium’s mainnet. The Bokbunja Hard Fork will be carried out by releasing version&nbsp;m0.10.0.</p> Details   Schedule: scheduled for October 31, 2023, 12:00 PM KST (2023–10–310 3:00:00&nbsp;+UTC)  Fixed mainnet block number for this transition: #73225410   Key commits <p>-The Bokbunja hard fork will be implemented at block #73225410 on the Metadium&nbsp;Mainnet.</p>  Introducing a fee delegation function and related RPC API allows users to delegate transaction fees to another&nbsp;account.  The verification nodes use the miner’s public key registered in the governance contract to verify the block miner’s signature.  To decentralize mining, the miner selection strategy has been changed to use etcd lockable&nbsp;tokens.  <p>-New features added to&nbsp;Gmet.</p>  Implementing Verifiable Random Function (VRF) verification functionalities through pre-compiled contracts offers a more secure and transparent method of generating random numbers on the blockchain.  Added ‘eth_getReceiptsByHash’ JSON-RPC API. Returns all the transaction receipts for the given block&nbsp;hash.  Added to Gmet CLI flags to allow changing the value of ‘triesInMemory’  Changed to create blocks by sorting transactions in descending order of gas&nbsp;price  Increased the default value of ‘TxLookupLimit’ flag from 2350000 to&nbsp;31536000  Ethereum Ploitari release(v1.10.17) was&nbsp;applied  Ethereum Sharblu release(v1.10.18) was&nbsp;applied  The Block interval is fixed to 2&nbsp;seconds.  Network members can make more types of decisions through improved governance contracts.  <p>-Other bugfix and&nbsp;upgrades</p>  Improved gmet.sh&nbsp;script  Improved performance using go&nbsp;routines  Upgraded etcd library version&nbsp;(v3.5.2)  Changed websocket default&nbsp;port  Changed the OS version used for ‘docker-build’ to Ubuntu&nbsp;20.04  Upgraded golangci-lint library version&nbsp;(v1.49)  Changed the ‘Fee’ data type of `ExecutionResult,` which receives EVM execution results, to BigInt to prevent overflow.  To avoid overflow integers, some variables have been changed to&nbsp;BigInt.  Fixed issue related to ‘make&nbsp;test’  Fixed issue with coinbase&nbsp;setup  <p>-The file ‘metadium-0.10.0-linux-rocksdb.tar.gz’ in the Gmet Github release note is optimized for Ubuntu 20.04&nbsp;version.</p><p>-IPC file is named ‘geth’ through m0.10.0 version upgrade.

  <p>Cloud computing delivers the benefits of accelerated development without the hardware costs. But the dynamic nature of cloud services and the proprietary security features offered by different cloud service providers make it challenging for customers to manage the risks and to be sure they are meeting security and compliance obligations. Most organizations need some&nbsp;form of guardrails and ways to respond to suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>Join cloud security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Uptycs as they discuss the challenges of the shared responsibility model for cloud security and compliance, examine the range of ways available for dealing with the problem, and consider the benefits of cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud-native application protection platform.</p>
<p>Mike Small, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole will describe the major risks in the way organizations use cloud services. He will also explain why cloud services need dynamic rather than static controls, list the tools that aim to manage these risks, and outline what to expect from a CSPM solution.</p>
<p>Andre Rall, Director of Cloud Security at Uptycs will describe the benefits of integrating security insights, of standardizing controls and policies, of taking charge of third-party code and resources, and of removing silos by using a single platform, data model, and user interface.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cloud-security-cspm"></a>

<p>Financial institutions want secure and frictionless onboarding and authentication processes and they’re finally seeing it from <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">decentralized identity</a> (DI) and verifiable credentials (VCs) technology.</p>



<p>While VCs have been a promise of identification and authentication technologies for decades, decentralization being the fabric through which VCs are established and communicated now makes the whole proposition more viable for FIs.</p>



<p>The decentralized nature of DI eliminates the need for a centralized authority to manage and control the identity certification process underlying current onboarding and authentication systems that are complex and costly for FIs, frustrating for consumers, and open to abuse.</p>



<p>In the DI ecosystem, issuing organizations conveniently and securely issue fraud-proof credentials, and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity and validity of those credentials to grant access to services. The customer accepts, stores, and selectively shares their credentials with unprecedented privacy, security and trust.</p>



<p>Early adopters in the financial services industry are using VCs as customer-controlled, open, standardized, portable, and cryptographically protected digital credentials to enable:</p>



 
 Continuous strong authentication of banking customers, whether they are accessing via web, telephone, or mobile 



 More streamlined banking functions, such as real-time loan approval because the applicant carries credentials such as KYC, credit history, employment history in their identity wallet. 
 



<p>The result is drastically reduced KYC and AML costs, vastly enhanced retail and corporate customer experience, and streamlined regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Read <a>Verifiable </a><a>Credentials</a><a> – the Killer Feature of Decentralized Identity</a></p>



<p></p>



 7 more use cases for VCs in banking 



<p>In addition to an FI issuing its own customers with a VC to prove they’re a customer and speed up onboarding and authentication (which some FIs are already achieving in <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">seconds</a> with the technology), DI pioneer <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">Evernym</a> (now Avast) lists 7 other potential use cases:</p>



 
 Enable the customer to use their credential across internal silos of the institution to reduce data lakes and allow them to provide the single view of their information. 



 Maintain a persistent, secure, and unique connection with each customer for all types of sensitive data communications (e.g. sending loan documents). 



 Leverage the credential exchange protocol to prove minimal customer data collection and maintain a verified data trail for regulatory compliance. 



 Leverage the interoperability of VCs to make the FI’s credential useful for consumers anywhere in the world (the “top of wallet” competitive advantage). 



 Leverage the open standards of DI to issue customers with an identity wallet for storing and managing their VCs, or build a wallet into an existing banking app. 



 Support customers’ need to back up and recover their VCs in a “digital safety deposit box” concept. 



 Act as “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Glossary-V2.pdf">guardian</a>” of a customer’s credentials in a similar manner to guarding paper documents or effects in real life. 
 



 <br>Build your VCs solution quickly with Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> offers the key building blocks for a VCs solution with four licensable products and more in development:</p>



 
 White Label Mobile DI Wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating and storing cryptographic keys, and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers. 



 Mobile DI Wallet SDK: For customers that want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage, creating cryptographic keys, and establishing connections and for receiving, holding and presenting VCs. 



 Verifiable Credentials Service/SDK: This service provides the ability to establish connections with DI wallets and to issue VCs. It also provides the ability to request and verify presentation proofs from DI wallets. 



 Relay Service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI Wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the Relay Service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



<p><br>As an API-first developer platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;includes everything necessary to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments. 
 



<p>You can see in these images how a credit union has used the Sudo Platform sample app and SDK to build a VCs solution within its banking app:</p>



In 4 steps, go from installation of your mobile application to having an encrypted connection with your potential new member. With this channel established you can commence your KYC process.



<p></p>



With an authenticated end-to-end connection established members can complete their KYC proofing with a verified credential issued at completion that can be used for future proofing exercises needs either in branch or online.



<p><br><br>In this example, a customer wants a car loan and the car dealership verifies their account quickly and securely, avoiding additional applications and legacy forms:</p>







<p>In addition to DI solutions, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;has modular, turnkey solutions for:</p>



 
 Safe and private browsing 



 Password management 



 Virtual private network 



 Compartmentalization 



 Virtual cards 



 Open and encrypted telephony and email communications.

<p>Identity Governance is a beacon for organizations aiming to maintain regulatory compliance, safeguard operations and boost efficiency. Let’s demystify this term: Identity Governance, tailored for organizations, refers to the systematic management of digital identities, ensuring that users have the correct access rights to resources. The impact on business security and operations is profound, offering protection against potential breaches and enhancing operational workflows.</p>
 Why Do Organizations Need Identity Governance Today? 
<p>With expanding business ventures, collaborations, and a diversified workforce, organizations are navigating an increasingly complex digital ecosystem. This complexity demands a structured approach to managing sensitive data and systems that control user access.</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies worldwide emphasize the importance of data protection, with compliance standards like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)</a> making it mandatory for businesses to protect user data. Being compliant not only safeguards user credentials and shields companies from potential penalties but also elevates their reputation.</p>
<p>Cost efficiency and operational excellence are tightly knit with effective identity governance. Organizations that master this see reduced IT costs, witness streamlined operations and operating costs, and save time and resources.</p>
 Why is Regulatory Compliance Important? 
<p>Regulatory compliance ensures companies adhere to relevant laws, policies, and regulations often designed to protect consumer rights and sensitive data. It’s not just about avoiding penalties or legal consequences; it’s also about establishing trust with your customers.</p>
<p>When an organization is compliant, it demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a high standard of operations and building confidence among stakeholders and customers. Moreover, compliance often brings about best practices that can benefit the company in the long run, from enhancing data security to ensuring organizational integrity.</p>
 Key Components of Identity Governance Suited for Organizations 
<p>While “Identity Governance” might seem vast and intricate, its effectiveness refers to core components tailored for organizations. These components serve as the pillars that uphold a robust identity governance structure.</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management: Tailored to businesses’ hierarchical and functional structures, it ensures that user accounts, access, and privileges are aligned with their roles and updated as these roles change. 
 Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Rooted deeply in the essence of an organization, RBAC ensures that access to digital resources aligns with job roles. It simplifies the process of privileged access by categorizing authorized users based on their responsibilities. 
 Access Review: Regular business audits by security teams should focus on digital identities and access controls. Periodic access reviews ensure that only the necessary personnel have access to particular resources, minimizing potential security risks. 
 Policy and Risk Management: Organizations are no strangers to risks. However, with a structured approach and risk management, potential threats are identified, evaluated, and mitigated before they escalate. 
 
<p>Understanding the integral components of Identity Governance makes it equally vital to discern its advantages. When implemented correctly, these components fuse to deliver profound benefits for any organization.</p>
 How Is IGA Different from IAM? 
<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) are terms often used interchangeably, but crucial differences exist. While IAM focuses on ensuring that the right individuals have access to the appropriate resources at the correct times and for the right reasons, IGA goes further.</p>
<p>IGA deals with the provisioning, managing access, and de-provisioning of identities. It provides a structured framework for policies and processes related to user identity lifecycle management and management, ensuring compliance with business objectives and regulations. In essence, IAM is a subset of IGA, with IGA providing the overarching governance framework.</p>
 Direct Benefits to Organizations Implementing Identity Governance 
<p>As the famous saying in the business world: “What gets measured gets managed.” And when you measure the tangible benefits reaped from implementing identity governance, the picture becomes abundantly clear. Organizations not only safeguard themselves but also position themselves strategically for growth. Implementing Identity Governance isn’t just about ticking off a checklist; it’s about accruing tangible benefits:</p>
 
 Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to standards like GDPR becomes a smoother journey with structured identity governance, which is especially crucial for organizations operating in regions like the EU. 
 Enhanced Data Security: The numbers don’t lie. Organizations that invest in identity governance are less likely to face data breaches, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential. 
 Streamlined Onboarding and Offboarding: Gone are the days when IT teams spent hours setting up profiles for new hires or removing access for those who’ve left. Identity governance can cut down these times significantly. 
 Facilitated Audits: Compliance checks and internal audits become less hassle, thanks to clear documentation and structured access protocols. 
 
<p>While the merits of Identity Governance are undeniable, the path to its flawless execution can be paved with challenges. However, with a systematic approach, organizations can traverse this path seamlessly. Let’s delve into a systematic step-by-step guide for instituting a successful identity governance model.</p>
 Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for Organizations 
<p>Embarking on implementing Identity Governance in an organization’s security posture is akin to building a fortress brick by brick.

 Best Practices Tailored for Organizations 
 
 Engaging Leadership and Stakeholders Early: A top-down approach to implementing identity governance and administration ensures that the importance of identity administration and governance is recognized at all levels. 
 Regular Training and Awareness Sessions for Employees: A system is only as strong as its weakest link. Equip employees with the knowledge to use and appreciate the identity governance structures. 
 Periodic Review of Access Roles and Permissions: Revisit and revise. As organizations evolve, so do roles and requirements. 
 Establishing a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement: Encourage feedback. It highlights potential gaps and fosters a culture of collective responsibility. 
 
 Common Misconceptions about Identity Governance 
<p>As we delve deeper into the digital realm, Identity Governance has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring security and efficiency within organizations. Yet, like many emerging disciplines, it’s shrouded in a mix of misunderstandings and half-truths. It’s essential to address these misconceptions to harness their potential truly.</p>
 
 Access Requests are Fundamental to Identity Verification: Contrary to the belief that access requests are mere formalities, they are pivotal in ensuring that only verified identities gain access to specific resources, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential breaches. 
 Identity Authentication Surpasses Password Management: While password management is vital, the emphasis should be on advanced identity authentication mechanisms that ensure secure and appropriate access, such as multi-factor authentication and biometric verification, which provide a more robust security posture. 
 All Access Control is Equal: It’s essential to understand that various access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control, access certifications, and access lifecycle management, serve distinct purposes and are crucial in managing different aspects of identity authentication and authorization. 
 Entitlement Management is Just ‘Jargon’: Far from being mere jargon, entitlement management is crucial in defining and controlling the rights and privileges of authenticated identities, ensuring that users have the appropriate access levels in accordance with their roles and responsibilities. 
 IGA Solutions are a ‘One Size Fits All’: It is a misconception that all identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions are universally applicable. Selecting and customizing IGA solutions that align with an organization’s specific needs and identity authentication requirements is imperative for effective identity management. 
 Managing User Accounts is an IT-only Responsibility: Managing user accounts and identities should not be siloed within IT departments. Effective identity governance and authentication management require collaborative efforts across various departments, ensuring that identity verifications, access controls, and user privileges are consistently aligned with organizational roles and policies. 
 
<p>Having highlighted the overarching significance of Identity Governance, it’s time to address some widespread myths. Believing these misconceptions could set organizations off course. By clearing the fog around them, we can ensure a more informed and practical approach to managing digital identities.</p>
 Potential Challenges for Organizations and Solutions 
<p>Every transformative initiative confronts its fair share of roadblocks, and Identity Governance is no exception. However, being forewarned is forearmed. By anticipating potential setbacks, organizations can develop strategies to overcome them, ensuring a smoother path to successful implementation.</p>
 
 Navigating the Complexity of Role Definitions: While initially challenging, collaborating with department heads on-premises can simplify role management and definitions. 
 Ensuring User Compliance Without Sacrificing Efficiency: Invest in user-friendly access management solutions to verify user and access privileges and provide ample training to ensure employees are comfortable with the new systems. 
 Adapting to Evolving Regulations: Stay informed. Review global compliance requirements and standards regularly and adjust policies and manual processes accordingly. 
 Addressing Resistance and Ensuring Organizational Buy-In: Highlight the benefits and provide channels for addressing concerns.<br>
Successfully implementing and navigating the challenges of Identity Governance is still ongoing. The digital sphere is continuously evolving, and to stay ahead of the curve, organizations need to remain informed and adapt accordingly. Let’s explore how to stay updated in this ever-changing world of Identity Governance. 
 
 Is Identity Governance Necessary Regardless of Regulatory Compliance Obligations? 
<p>While every company is subject to some form of regulatory compliance, the level of scrutiny and the specific standards applicable can vary significantly depending on the industry, region, and other factors. Regardless of the perceived level of regulatory obligation, the inherent risks within the digital landscape and the advantages of streamlined operations underscore the importance of identity governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a robust identity governance framework serves to proactively mitigate internal and external threats, simplify IT operations, enhance audit readiness, and ensure that employees have precise access to the resources necessary for their roles, thereby reducing the potential for human error. As companies evolve and expand, having a structured identity governance framework in place facilitates smoother transitions and integrations, maintaining a strong security posture in an ever-changing regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Stay Updated: The Evolving World of Identity Governance 
<p>The pace of technological advancement today is unparalleled. A static approach to Identity Governance can leave organizations vulnerable in such a dynamic environment. Staying updated is not just about keeping threats at bay but also about harnessing new opportunities and innovations.</p>
 
 Staying Abreast of Regulatory Changes: Subscribe to updates from regulatory bodies and consider periodic consultations with legal teams. 
 Leveraging Industry Forums and Communities: Discuss, attend seminars, and participate in webinars.

<p></p> 
<p>Earlier this month, HYPR announced our unified Identity Assurance solution, developed to secure the entire modern identity lifecycle. HYPR Identity Assurance brings together the strongest passwordless authentication, comprehensive risk assessment and enhanced identity verification to continuously detect, prevent, and eliminate identity-related risks. That’s a lot of words to describe a simple concept — organizations can now ensure that an individual is who they claim to be at all times.</p> 
 Identity Assurance In the Spotlight  
<p>What does this mean in practice? We had the opportunity to demonstrate at this week’s FIDO Authenticate conference. As one of the pioneers of FIDO authentication and a long time Alliance board member, the annual Authenticate conference was a natural venue to publicly show the power of Identity Assurance.</p> 
 Modern Passkey-Based Authentication  
<p>Given the setting, most folks there were well-acquainted with our leading FIDO <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless multi-factor authentication</a> solution HYPR Authenticate, the backbone of our Identity Assurance platform. Industry experts, security pundits and regulatory agencies all agree that phishing-resistant authentication is no longer optional and must underlie any comprehensive identity security strategy. HYPR Authenticate provides regulatory compliant, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">device-bound passkeys</a> and also works with synced passkeys.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance Platform</p> 
 Real-time Risk Assessment and Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Newer on the block, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> analyzes risk signals and telemetry from numerous sources, including user behavior, mobile, endpoint and browser signals, as well as changes in the overall threat landscape, and automatically takes action to prevent a breach. This includes enforcing step-up authentication or re-verification, as well as sharing risk data with SIEM, SOAR and other enterprise systems for additional protective actions.</p> 
 The Big Reveal: Enhanced Identity Verification  
<p>The undoubted star of the show, however, was our revolutionary new identity verification system, HYPR Affirm. Purpose-built to meet the unique needs of workforce employee identity verification, HYPR Affirm addresses the major identity security issues, such as help desk fraud, that have dominated <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">recent cybersecurity headlines</a>. HYPR Affirm leverages AI-powered chat, video, face recognition, liveness detection and other cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and secure method of confirming employee identities without ever using a password. It goes beyond traditional point-in-time verification by utilizing AI-driven analysis to proactively and automatically prompt reverification at critical moments defined by high-impact events or times of elevated risk from new threat vectors or detection of suspicious behavior.</p> 
 More Than the Sum of Its Parts  
<p>While each HYPR solution provides critical capabilities to build a robust identity security strategy, the real magic lies in how they work together. The integrated Identity Assurance platform closes persistent identity security gaps and automates previously manual processes. It does away with disconnected, point-in-time approaches and provides dynamic and continuous identity and authentication security. It’s the industry’s only offering where risky behavior can trigger step-up authentication not only to authentication but also to enforcing automatic identity reverification.</p> 
 Why Identity Assurance, Why Now?  
<p>In this era of everywhere, always-on connectivity and generative-AI attacks, identity trust is an imperative. Yet organizations often rely on a patchwork of siloed identity systems, outdated authentication methods, manual and disjointed identity verification techniques and incomplete, reactive identity risk response.</p> 
<p>The fallout from these fragmented and insecure practices is all too evident. Deepfake imposters are driving a new style of fraud and identity-based cyber attacks are paralyzing businesses for weeks if not longer. Recent <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">HYPR research</a> shows that authentication-attributed breaches alone cost organizations an average of $2.95M per year. The issue goes beyond breaches however, affecting employee and customer satisfaction, productivity and a business’s ability to scale and evolve.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance takes a proactive approach that addresses all stages of the user journey or identity lifecycle, starting at day zero. It unites disparate identity and security systems, integrating with and scaling across them. With HYPR, organizations ensure identities can be trusted at all times, while eliminating friction points and improving user experience.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance delivers the lowest friction user experience with strongest authentication, automated identity verification and behavior-based risk assessment</p> 
 A New Look to Match Our Expanded Purpose  
<p>Those of you that pay attention to such things may have noticed that HYPR unveiled a new logo along with our Identity Assurance solution. HYPR has moved from “The Passwordless Company” to “The Identity Assurance Company” and we wanted our brand to reflect this strategic shift. We feel our new bold yet approachable logo embodies strength, trust and confidence with a modern sensibility. As such, it aptly represents our comprehensive, unified and dynamic approach to identity security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here’s a few thoughts I recorded earlier on our expanded Identity Assurance mission:</p>

<p>It appears that Australia has killed off “digital identity”. Australia’s <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">proposed Digital ID legislation</a> is actually not about digital identity — it’s about proving you have been identified.</p>
<p>What’s the big deal? <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-goal-is-identification-not-an-identity/">Identity and identification are different things</a>. Identification is about establishing enough facts about someone in a specific context that you can deal with them; identity is bigger, more amorphous, and <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/on-sovereignty/">usually more personal</a>.</p>
<p>So I am delighted that the term “digital identity” is no longer used in the draft <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-09/Exposure%20draft%20of%20the%20Digital%20ID%20Bill%202023_0.pdf">Digital ID Bill 2023</a> (PDF) or explanatory materials. This is a significant shift in framing, and it will <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/lets-forget-about-identity/">simplify what has been a very tricky problem space</a>.</p>
<p>We can reform identification without disrupting identity. We can make identification <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-if-we-could-make-data-useless-to-thieves/">resilient against fraud</a> in the wake of data breaches, without introducing any novel new “digital identity”. The concept of digital ID is closer to mundane functional identifiers and does not affect the cherished sense of personal identity we have in the analog world.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill heralds a uniform approach in Australia to digital and data governance across open banking, open data, and digital ID.</p>
<p>We are seeing a transition from plaintext identification to device-assisted identification. Instead of presenting weak plaintext copies of ID numbers or whole ID documents, the proposed Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will enable individuals to use digital ID as a proxy for their existing verified analog IDs.</p>
<p>The previous government’s legislation was going to be called “Trusted Digital Identity”. The new draft bill drops that flowery wording. But we wonder where this leaves the existing <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif">Trusted Digital Identity Framework</a> (TDIF)?</p>
<p>TDIF was based on a centralised identity exchange architecture. This is fine for the government single sign-on systems, myGov and myGovID, but this architecture is <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/collected-submissions-on-au-digital-identity-system/">a poor fit for decentralised verifiable credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Now the AGDIS anticipates a raft of Digital ID Data Standards to be developed, providing an opportunity to rethink the centralised exchange. The new Digital ID Regulator can also reconsider the state of the art in authentication and authorisation technologies.</p>
<p>We look forward to the Australian digital ID system making good use of verifiable credentials, phishing resistant mobile technology, and data signing.</p>

  <p>Hello friends,  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have received feedback from you—our customers—about the need to have user level language localization. We understand that users would like to receive notifications that have their text adapted to their local language, customs, and standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have added logic to check multiple places for language information to make the best possible choice for what language we should send an email in, and these changes are now generally available for Privileged Identity Management, Access Reviews and Entitlement Management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new approach is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Diagram showing how the logic works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
 The system checks the Entra user settings:&nbsp;
 
 An Entra ID user updates their language settings via myprofile.microsoft.com or via myaccount.microsoft.com. If they don't have the permissions to update, an admin updates their preferred language.&nbsp; 
 The system will then check if the Entra ID user object has a preferred language set to determine the locale to be used.&nbsp; 
 
 
 If there are no user settings, we will check whether the user has a mailbox and has a set preferred language on that mailbox. If both checks are true, the system uses the preferred language set in their mailbox settings. This will only work for users with a mailbox.&nbsp; 
 If none of the above are set, the system will fall back to the tenant's preferred language concatenated with the tenant's country letter code (fr-FR or en-US).&nbsp;
 
 If a tenant has a preferred language set and no country code, the system will use the tenant's preferred language to find the closest available locale to the one passed, from the localized templates. if fr-CA is missing, the fallback locale is fr-FR. &nbsp; 
 
 
 If they don’t have all the above, the system will default to en-us.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Figure 2: Screenshot of email in English
Figure 3: Screenshot of email in Spanish



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, when a new guest requests an access package in MyAccess, their preferred language will be stamped based on the MyAccess browser language at request time. This will enable new guests to receive email communication in a language they understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is currently only available for the features mentioned above, we will be announcing more features are enrolling to have this logic in the upcoming quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Door brondata in te zetten realiseerden de adviseurs een tijdsbesparing van 30% tijdens de oriëntatiefase."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bij hypotheekadvies worden vaak veel privé documenten gebruikt van een klant. Voor De Hypotheker is het van essentieel belang dat de data van klanten goed beveiligd is, én dat de klantdata actueel is. Het originele proces bevat vaak veel papierwerk. </p> 
<p>Om marktleider te blijven en hun klanten goed te kunnen bedienen wilde ze hun proces optimaliseren: de service verbeteren, versnellen en digitaliseren. Vanuit Ockto mochten we De Hypotheker assisteren in deze digitale transformatie. Pieter Dijckmeester (Manager Proposities) en Erik Coehorst &amp; Niki de Boer (beiden Propositiemanager Digital Customer Journey) vertellen over de uitdagingen die ze hadden, waarom ze voor Ockto kozen én wat de samenwerking ze tot nu toe heeft opgeleverd. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I can imagine that some of the readers might look at the title and wonder: what do these three terms even have in common? Well, I must confess that the last one I’ve made up (or should I say “invented”?) recently – and I will explain it later. But the former two are, in fact, connected in more than one way.</p>
<p>Although Generative AI has been with us for quite some time in various forms (remember deepfakes, for example?), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), the new-generation large language models, have literally taken the world by storm. After people saw what ChatGPT can do, they immediately decided they wanted these capabilities in every application, for every industry, and on every occasion. Unfortunately, after a period of initial uncontrolled hype, it became clear that most organizations simply cannot afford to let their employees post sensitive information, like intellectual property, financial records, or customer data into every online chatbot – you don’t need to be a compliance expert to understand the consequences.</p>
<p>So, while governments are working on future legislation to regulate AI usage in general, organizations are scrambling to define security and compliance policies to prevent uncontrolled leakage of their business data into generative AI systems. But how to reconcile the two completely opposite trends and make GenAI usage safe and controlled? Well, there are multiple potential approaches…</p>
<p>The most obvious one is “building your own ChatGPT” – creating, training, and operating a new isolated instance of a large language model (LLM) with all its training and operational data strongly protected. However, only large enterprises with enough skills and budgets can afford such an endeavor. Also, training a general-purpose AI model requires years of hard work and enormous amounts of data from a multitude of sources. Some of those sources, having experienced ChatGPT’s effect on their future job security, are no longer interested in collaborating with AI researchers…</p>
<p>An alternative, more savvy approach is fine-tuning an existing AI model – instead of starting from scratch, you only need to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific domain with your own, much smaller set of data. This is a much more resource-efficient way to get your own LLM, but it still requires a lot of work and skills and is much less flexible in terms of supported use cases. Of course, an even more efficient approach is to use a much leaner specialized model instead of a general-purpose one: for example, a model only trained to perform a specific subset of generative tasks.</p>
<p>What does it all have to do with databases though, and why is everyone suddenly talking about vectors? Well, it turns out that there is an innovative technique for adapting existing LLMs to your specific tasks or even your private, highly sensitive information called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of teaching (sorry, fine-tuning) a model with your custom data and essentially forcing it to memorize it entirely, you just augment each request with a set of additional information that can help its reasoning. It could be a set of documents containing fresh information about recent events or simply some organization’s sensitive data.</p>
<p>RAG not only provides responses much better tailored to the user’s prompts and thus dramatically improves the efficiency of the conversation, but also ensures that the augmenting content remains private and is not shared with other parties. And here comes the twist: to implement RAG you need to be able to quickly produce a set of documents relevant for a certain prompt and to accomplish that, you need a vector database!</p>
<p>Vectors themselves are simply sequences of numbers. While we’re more used to two- or three-dimensional vectors that encode points in space, vectors used for AI applications are usually much longer – with hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Various machine learning algorithms use vectors to store mathematical representations of their inputs. Documents, images, audio files, or any other things processed by an AI model can be stored as vectors called embeddings and by calculating a distance between vectors it is possible to determine similarity between their original objects.</p>
<p>If your model is working with text documents, for example, its embeddings can be used to find the most semantically similar documents just by sorting them by distance. And this is precisely what we need to quickly determine which relevant documents to feed to an LLM when we are crafting a RAG request! And thus, vector databases – solutions that can store data in vector format and perform efficient indexing and searching on it – became a critical part of every AI strategy almost overnight…</p>
<p>Recently I attended <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloudworld/">Oracle CloudWorld</a>, the company’s flagship yearly event where it makes its most important announcements and presents the latest innovations in its products. Do I need to tell you what was the hottest topic this year? From Larry Ellison proclaiming Generative AI the most important technology ever to announcing a strategic partnership with Cohere, an enterprise AI platform vendor, to promising to integrate AI assistants into every business application – “GenAI” dominated the entire event.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, were the announcements that not just Oracle Database but MySQL Heatwave are getting native support for vectors. Of course, it is possible to use a separate specialized database for performing vector operations, but keeping all kinds of data in the same database enables not just faster performance with fewer transformations needed but ensures that sensitive data never leaves your secure perimeter.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-integrated-vector-database-augments-generative-ai-2023-09-19/">AI Vector Search</a>, it is now possible to combine multiple data models including vectors in a single SQL query without any additional effort for developers. MySQL Heatwave’s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-mysql-heatwave-vector-store-generative-ai-2023-09-20/">Vector Store</a> goes even further by providing a complete Generative AI and machine learning stack with embeddings created, stored, and processed directly within the database.&nbsp; On top of this foundation, Oracle provides high-level developer features like generating SQL statements or even entire applications with the APEX platform using natural language prompts. But more importantly for our topic at hand, you can now have an entire stack for implementing RAG-powered business applications, while ensuring that your sensitive data is always protected with multiple layers of database security controls.</p>
<p>OK, and finally, we can talk a bit about AI agility. Again, I just basically made this term up to illustrate the problem developers of AI-powered applications are already facing, even if not many realize it yet. You might be familiar with the notion of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">cryptographic agility</a>, which concerns an organization’s ability to quickly replace outdated cryptographic primitives throughout its entire IT infrastructure, should a particular encryption or hashing method be deemed not strong enough, for example, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">against quantum algorithms</a>. This should be possible without significant downtime, application refactoring, or other business continuity issues.</p>
<p>Working with AI models and with vector data poses the same challenge. Embeddings produced by a certain ML model are completely proprietary and not compatible with any other model. When an organization wants, say, to upgrade its e-commerce recommendation engine with a more modern and sophisticated model that can produce better recommendations, it has to consider the effort of updating this vector data for its entire catalog, potentially across multiple data stores, cloud services, and third-party integrations. Exchanging data with suppliers will be challenging as well, since they can be using other even more incompatible embedding solutions.</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to address this problem? Perhaps by implementing industry-specific standards? Or by introducing additional layers of abstraction into data and application architectures? To be honest, I have no idea! But perhaps other experts have, and you have an opportunity to meet them at our upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution conference</a>, which takes place in less than a month in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

  <p>On October 3, we published a blog entitled <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/harness-power-your-identity-data">Harness the Power of Your Identity Data</a>. In that post, we outlined the role that identity and access management (IAM) plays in delivering the kind of digital experiences that are key to meeting customer acquisition, engagement, and retention targets.</p>

<p>We also covered the challenge of creating the right experience with the right security to various identities with differing needs — business partners, suppliers, employees, contractors, devices, and diverse populations of customers — often engaging with separate brands or lines of business under the same corporate umbrella. And we introduced the secret to providing tailored experiences to these identities by tapping into your identity data.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll outline two specific steps you can take to reach your business goals using your identity data. There is a third step, which we will detail in the next post in this series.</p>

 Step 1: Connect and centrally manage your identity data sources 

<p>So much of the identity data needed to fuel your business growth already exists. It's out there, and you might even know where to find most of it. But the trick is to be able to pull together just the right pieces from a variety of what we call authoritative sources, at just the right time. That's why the first step to harnessing the power of your identity data is to connect to your data sources in a way that gives you a single view of all identity data. In the ForgeRock Identity Cloud, we call this Lifecycle Management, or LCM.</p>

<p>LCM gives you the power to connect to all different kinds of siloed data. This data usually resides in identity directory servers and an array of databases associated with specific applications throughout your organization. Once connected, you can create a composite, single view of your customers and all of your other managed identities. This single view can give you new insights into the same customers with different account names across brands or lines of business — and give you a new level of situational awareness that can provide critical inputs to enhance security.</p>

<p>In addition to connecting to all of your data sources, LCM empowers you to centrally manage all of your identities, which gives you the ability to pull identity data in from multiple sources and combine the data in any way you need. Then, you can provision and manage the ongoing lifecycle of your identity information with the source systems and any other downstream systems or applications.</p>

 Step 2: Enable a business-centric model 

<p>Now that you're centrally managing all of your identity data, you can start to mold it into the shape of your business. This is where things get really exciting, because you can organize your identity data around your business use cases, not the other way around.</p>

<p>With ForgeRock's relationship model, you can design how your identities are organized. Instead of trying to force-fit disparate identity data into a single, rigid hierarchy, you can now create different identity objects that are purpose-built for each identity type.</p>

<p>Think of the different types of identity attributes you'd need to manage for your employees vs. your customers vs. a set of IoT devices.</p>

<p>Like tabs in a spreadsheet, or tables in a database, you can arrange your identities in a way that makes sense for you. Let's continue with the spreadsheet analogy for a moment. Why do you create different tabs? Why not just put everything into a single sheet? Probably because it makes more sense to manage some related data in the columns of Tab A, and others in Tabs B, C, and so on. Think of each new tab as a way to distinctly manage different identity types more efficiently. And there's just one more piece of this spreadsheet analogy to bring this point home: the pivot table! But first, let's set the context by looking at an access management scenario.</p>

<p>Let's say you're a large retail enterprise with multiple brands, and at least one brand is from a recent acquisition. As the user begins the login process, your access manager makes a request to your identity manager. Based on the context, your identity manager looks at the relationships between the user and the associated brand, and returns a set of data parameters that empower you to give that user a tailored experience in accordance with the guidelines of that specific brand. Wow. That was great. But what made it possible lies in our pivot table analogy, so let's get back to it.</p>

<p>Why do you create a pivot table in a spreadsheet? Because you need a view that combines data from different tabs to serve a specific purpose. This is what happened with our brand login experience. The access manager made a request to the identity manager. And the identity manager was able to use the relationship between the user's main identity "tab" and the related brand "tab" to return the data points that the access management system needed to orchestrate a specific brand experience for that user.</p>

<p>Here's another example: maybe one of your business partners or suppliers has access to one of your systems. You require that partners use MFA as part of the authentication, but your partners cannot require their employees to use a personal mobile device as an MFA second factor, therefore they have opted to receive one-time passcodes in their email as the second factor. When your partner's user initiates a login to your system, your identity manager follows the relationship from that user's identity record to their affiliated organization (a different tab in the spreadsheet) and provides that data to the access manager, which selects a login journey that sends and validated a one-time passcode after the password has been correctly entered.</p>

<p>These are just two examples of may. Once you've enabled your business-centric identity model, you can ensure each customer of each brand, or each partner, or contractor, and so on, gets the tailored experience and security required.</p>

				  Before purchasing a decentralized identity solution you will need to decide if you want to buy a platform or component-based system. But what is the difference, what are the benefits of each approach, and what will provide the best way forward for your organization?&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the descriptions alone, you may have an inkling of what sets these two ways of purchasing solutions apart. But to make sure we’re all on the same page, here’s what we mean when we describe a system as a platform or component-based:</p>
<p>A platform solution is wholly created, packaged, and hosted by someone else. They have decided which features are important and are offering you a full solution.</p>
<p>A component-based solution can be put together either by you or a third party and is made up of several different pieces, potentially from several different sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to decentralized identity solutions, both of these approaches have benefits and drawbacks depending on your goal.</p>
<p>Platform solutions</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of a platform-based approach is that the software is ready to go: It requires little or no work on your team’s part in order to get started. A good example is email. Most organizations do not have to build their own messaging systems because email exists and is already widespread and interoperable. Other benefits of a platform include letting someone else host the data and run the software, thereby reducing the amount you need to be responsible for.</p>
<p>The main drawback of platform solutions is lack of control and flexibility. Going back to the email example, if there is a feature you would like to add, your team is unlikely to be able to edit the features available through Gmail. Another thing to keep in mind is that as someone else is running the software, you may have recurring payments to keep the software running. Also something to consider is that the data you collect will be stored by the platform. If you are an organization with security concerns — such as a government — this option may not be for you.</p>
<p>TLDR; platform solutions offer a more plug and play and less customizable experience that is maintained and owned by a third party. They can be an excellent option for smaller organizations that don’t want to create and maintain their own solutions.</p>
<p>Component-based solutions</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of a component-based solution is flexibility. These solutions let you build exactly what you need, and also allow you to switch out pieces as your needs change or newer features become available. A good example is a car. You fully own your car, you can customize it to your wants and needs, and if something stops working you are responsible for repairing it. In addition to fully owning a component-based solution, you also operate the software yourself, and control where your data goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main drawback to component-based systems is that it requires expertise and time to implement, all of which increases with each additional feature. Going back to our car analogy, there is a reason that many people opt to go to mechanics rather than fix their cars themselves — they want the mechanic’s years of experience. Other things to keep in mind with this kind of system is that you will need to host it somewhere and maintain it, which can require more computers or cloud server cost and more internal team skill.</p>
<p>TLDR; component-based solutions offer a highly customizable system that may take some time to put together, but is owned and operated by your organization. This is an excellent option for larger organizations that have specific features they need or regulations to follow when it comes to their data.</p>
<p>Indicio’s approach</p>
<p>Indicio offers component-based solutions to our customers. We believe that this is the best way to build decentralized ecosystems because it provides flexibility. As the technology advances, the ability to rapidly adopt newer components and features can be critical to success. — You do not want to be left waiting for your platform to integrate these features into its software.</p>
<p>Our number one goal at Indicio is customer success. Which means that while we sell components, we rarely ever end the interaction there. Our engineers have extensive experience in developing and implementing solutions and can help your team put the components you want&nbsp; together in the way that you need — should you need that kind of help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering, “Isn’t Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> a complete platform?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is similar, but only in the sense that it provides all the components needed to build a complete ecosystem for issuing, holding, presenting, and verifying credentials, including hosting if needed. However, it’s not a platform because you fully own it, you control the data, and you run the software. Indicio never collects or even sees your data. To revisit our car analogy one last time, our team is happy to act as the manufacturer and put it together, or the mechanic and provide IT support, but at the end of the day it is your car.</p>

             October 2023   
	 
		 
			 A Journey Through the Evolution of Blockchain for FIs 
 
<p>October is a memorable month for us as we commemorate Tokeny’s 6th anniversary in 2023.</p>
<p>Reflecting on our journey, the transformative strides in blockchain and its emerging prominence in the financial sector stand out.</p>
<p>🚀 The Early Days (2017-2020):&nbsp;The Need for a Suitable Blockchain</p>
<p>In the fledgling stages of our journey and the evolution of security tokens, many early adopters in the financial system believed that the best solution was to craft their own blockchains. This mindset stemmed from a desire for control instead of utilizing a public blockchain. Given the uncertainty about ensuring compliance on permissionless networks, many chose to develop their own blockchains, adopt private ones, or work within siloed ecosystems.</p>
<p>As time progressed, public networks significantly improved in speed, cost, interoperability, as well as compliance enforcement via smart contracts. The realization grew that the answer wasn’t necessarily about creating a new blockchain. Instead, it became evident that the future would hinge on bridging the sense of compliance on a public ledger.</p>
<p>🔥 The Buzz Period (2020-2022):&nbsp;The Age of Wallet Solutions</p>
<p>The next phase in this evolution was characterized by a realization that blockchain could be a suitable infrastructure for global finance, but then came the next hurdle in solving the custodianship problem. As a reminder, securities are bound by numerous regulatory guidelines for various asset servicers. Implementing these on-chain necessitates creative solutions that comply with the law.</p>
<p>This period witnessed a growing understanding that cryptocurrencies and security tokens don’t function identically. With regulations becoming stronger for custodial wallets, a pressing demand for non-custodial wallets became evident. This shift was indeed a welcome one, aligning with the core essence of blockchain, where end-users should inherently control their assets, manage their accounts, and identities. Moreover, protocols like ERC6343 guarantee the possible recovery of tokens via smart contracts.</p>
<p>🌆 The Scaling Phase (2023-∞):&nbsp;Tokenization in Action</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, after years of exploration and discovery, the time has come to fully harness the power of this technology. Business is now reclaiming the reins from tech departments with a new mantra –&nbsp;“We need tokenization capabilities.”&nbsp;Financial Institutions (FIs) are increasingly eager to design new blockchain-based services for their clientele for a variety of use-cases including but not limited to: treasury management, collateral management, cap table management, alternative liquidity options, and many more.</p>
<p>As time to market becomes increasingly important, to ensure unity and to accelerate adoption we encourage the use of open-source standards like ERC3643, so everyone can interact on the same nomenclature and functioning principles. From investors to issuers, to custodians, to exchanges, to asset servicers, leveraging the same framework is massively beneficial.</p>
<p>In alignment with this vision, Tokeny and 35+ distinguished members across industries have established the non-profit ERC3643 association. Our primary aim is to globalize this standard and expedite its adoption.</p>
<p>We cordially invite FIs aiming to pioneer this transformation to join our collective efforts.</p>
<p>Cheers to Tokeny’s upcoming years and the continued positive trajectory of blockchain!</p>
<p>We appreciate your time, here’s to the next 6 years! 🥂</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 3rd October to 17th&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we shed light on the G20’s move around crypto guidelines and how India is reacting to it, touch upon California’s new rules for crypto businesses, and see how Cyprus is aligning with Europe when it comes to crypto regulations. So, let’s dive right&nbsp;in.</p> Digital Asset Developments Dominate Global Regulatory Landscape <p>Global: The recent assembly in Marrakesh, Morocco, saw G20 nations embracing the “IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper: Policies for Crypto-Assets” as a foundational roadmap for crypto oversight.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1711765709909291041?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The paper underscores increased data sharing and collaboration among G20&nbsp;nations.</p><p>Following this guideline, India, a significant member and current president of the G20, is adjusting its stance on crypto, as indicated by the Secretary Of Economic&nbsp;Affairs.</p><p>The paper outlines guidelines on crypto oversight, with a focus on cross-border collaboration and risk management frameworks. Within these frameworks, an emphasized component is alignment with the Financial Action Task Force’s standards, specifically aiming to curtail the misuse of crypto assets for illicit activities.</p><p>In parallel, the International Monetary Fund’s recent working paper sets forth a risk assessment matrix for countries. This tool aims to spotlight potential sector vulnerabilities, streamlining the understanding of emerging macro-financial risks associated with digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Cyprus: Shifting the lens to Europe, Cyprus, celebrated for its crypto-friendly posture, is contemplating a tighter grip on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>The nation is eyeing stringent penalties for non-compliant crypto service providers and aligning its measures with globally recognized AML/CFT standards.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1712183498465837533?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These moves echo the broader European intent, as the EU is set to unveil the comprehensive “Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation” in 2024, fortifying consumer safeguards in the evolving web3 environment.</p><p>The United States: On American soil, California emerges as the latest state to formulate a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>The recently signed Digital Financial Assets Law mandates licensing protocols and stringent record-keeping standards, laying the groundwork for transparent crypto operations in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>In the backdrop of these regulatory dynamics, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is contemplating the extension of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to the realm of digital currencies.</p><p>This move, reportedly, intends to offer an additional layer of protection against potential mishaps like unauthorized transfers or cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Now, let’s look into two of these major developments in detail and analyze their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem in&nbsp;detail.</p> California’s New Crypto Framework: Implications and&nbsp;Impact <p>California has officially delved into crypto regulation by enacting the Digital Financial Assets Law. This decision follows Governor Gavin Newsom’s approval of Assembly Bill&nbsp;39.</p><p>Modeled after New York’s BitLicense, California’s law mandates cryptocurrency entities to acquire a license from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).</p><p>This is reportedly to align with the state’s regulatory expectations. Additionally, maintaining accurate financial records and being available for regulatory audits are also part of the compliance requisites.</p><p>Although the law seeks to shape the crypto landscape, prioritizing user privacy and interest and enhancing consumer protection, potentially minimizing fraud, its real-world implications remain to be&nbsp;seen.</p><p>Will it enhance transparency and reliability or could it stifle innovation, leading to an exodus of crypto businesses from the state? The slated 2025 commencement provides time to observe and, if necessary, recalibrate the approach.</p> G20’s Green Light to Crypto Guide: A Two-Edged Sword? <p>The G20’s recent recognition of the “IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper” could reshape the crypto landscape as we know it&nbsp;today.</p><p>The directive, leaning towards comprehensive oversight rather than prohibition, suggests cross-border regulatory synergy and robust risk frameworks.</p><p>Its call for increased data transparency and adherence to FATF’s anti-money laundering benchmarks places a spotlight on preserving the integrity of digital asset transactions.</p><p>On the brighter side, a globally coordinated regulatory stance might boost investor confidence and enhance crypto’s legitimacy in traditional financial spheres. It could bridge the knowledge gap for countries still grappling with crypto’s dynamism, fostering a more harmonized global approach.</p><p>Yet, there’s potential friction. Overzealous data requisition might challenge privacy norms, and stringent compliance could weigh down startups, possibly curbing innovation.</p><p>As 2025 nears, when the first review is due, the crypto realm will keenly watch how this roadmap steers the balance between governance and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>A Distributed Ledger stands at the forefront of modern database technology, a shared database spread across many sites, countries, or institutions. This innovative approach to data management records transactions while ensuring every participant within its network has access to a shared, uniform version of this information. As industries evolve and the need for transparent yet secure transaction methods surges, the relevance and significance of this technology amplify.</p>
 Historical Context 
<p>Origins and evolution of ledgers in accounting and finance: The concept of ledgers is not new. Historically, they’ve served as repositories for financial information, recording and keeping track of transactions in a physical, centralized manner. This method, while foundational, had limitations regarding accessibility, transparency, and real-time updates.</p>
<p>The shift to digital ledgers: The digital age revolutionized data management. Digital ledgers introduced speed and immediate access. However, they also confronted us with challenges concerning security, transparency, potential data manipulation, and reliance on central intermediaries.</p>
<p>The emergence of blockchain and DLT: Recognizing the pitfalls of digital ledgers, the concept of blockchain was birthed, later leading to the broader realm of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This decentralized approach promised to address previous challenges, adding layers of security, transparency, and peer verification without relying on a central authority.</p>
 What is Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)? 
<p>Detailed definition: DLT is a decentralized system that facilitates recording transactions across many computers. It differs from traditional databases because it lacks centralization, ensuring consistent data across its network without relying on a singular control point.</p>
<p>Difference from traditional ledgers: While traditional ledgers hinge on a single entity (like banks or regulatory authorities) for validation, DLT operates using consensus algorithms. These algorithms ensure that all network participants agree on the recorded data’s validity, thus removing intermediaries and providing a democratized system.</p>
<p>Key components and features: Key features making DLT particularly attractive include decentralized control, data immutability, cryptographic data security, and consensus-driven validation mechanisms.</p>
 Types of Distributed Ledgers 
<p>Blockchain vs. other types: Though often used synonymously with DLT, blockchain is a subset. It sequentially links data, with blocks chained chronologically. However, other DLT structures, such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), diverge from this chained data model.</p>
<p>Public vs. Private Ledgers: The difference lies in accessibility. Public ledgers, like the one used by Bitcoin, are accessible to all, allowing anyone to participate. Conversely, private ledgers limit participation and are often used within a single organization.</p>
<p>Consortium Ledgers: This is a middle ground between public and private, controlled by a pre-selected group of nodes or participants, usually multiple organizations collaborating for common objectives.</p>
 Benefits of Using Distributed Ledger 
<p>Enhanced security and immutability: DLT employs sophisticated cryptographic techniques. With its decentralized nature, altering recorded data becomes arduous, ensuring data integrity.</p>
<p>Transparency and traceability: Every transaction is visible to participants, guaranteeing unparalleled transparency, which aids in trust-building and ensures a clear audit trail for every entry.</p>
<p>Reduction in transaction costs and intermediaries: The consensus-driven model of DLT removes the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and potential bottlenecks and creating a more streamlined transaction process.</p>
<p>Increased efficiency and speed: Without intermediaries and with real-time ledger updates, transaction times are drastically reduced, enhancing efficiency.</p>
 Real-World Applications 
 
 Identity Verification: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) fortifies identity verification processes against theft and fraud. By decentralizing personal information and employing robust cryptographic techniques, DLT enhances security, reduces vulnerabilities, and puts individuals in greater control of their data, thereby diminishing the risks of unauthorized access and manipulation. 
 Supply Chain: With a need for authentic, traceable product histories, DLT provides a solution, ensuring real-time tracking and verification of goods at every stage, from origin to end-user. 
 Smart Contracts: These self-executing contracts embed the terms of the agreement within lines of code, making them automatic, transparent, and irreversible 
 Voting Systems and Governance: DLT can overhaul traditional voting systems, introducing enhanced transparency while reducing fraud potential and increasing citizen trust. 
 
 Challenges and Limitations 
 
 Scalability Concerns: As transactions accumulate, the size of the ledger grows. Processing and validating these transactions can become slower over time. 
 Integration with Existing Systems: Organizations with established infrastructures may find transitioning to a DLT-based system daunting, given integration complexities and potential resistance to change. 
 Regulatory and Governance Issues: DLT’s decentralized nature might clash with centralized regulatory frameworks, making universal adoption challenging. 
 Potential Risks and Vulnerabilities: Though secure, as a relatively young technology, undiscovered vulnerabilities could be present, which might be exploited by malicious actors. 
 
 The Future of Distributed Ledgers 
 
 Integration with IoT and AI: As devices become more innovative and connected, merging DLT with IoT and AI can create interconnected systems where transactions are secure and intelligent. 
 Industry Disruption: The applications are vast, from healthcare patient record management to real estate property registries. DLT stands to revolutionize various sectors, enhancing transparency and efficiency. 
 Societal Implications: As decentralized systems become more prevalent, power dynamics might shift, paving the way for more community-driven, democratized structures. 
 
<p>Distributed Ledger Technology is revolutionizing the organizational fabric, presenting opportunities and challenges equally. Its potential is vast, reshaping industries and societal structures alike. Staying informed, adaptable, and proactive is crucial as we move forward in this digital age. Organizations must seize the moment, delving deeper into DLT’s world, collaborating with experts, and considering its implementation for a brighter, more efficient future.</p>

<p>The critical infrastructure is commonly defined as the systems and networks that provide basic services necessary to preserve a standard of living. In today’s interconnected high-technology world, protecting the critical infrastructure has gained growing attention. Increasing threats and a changing geopolitical environment are giving us reasons to reconsider how we define and protect these vital systems. In this blog post we look at how the scope of what is critical infrastructure is being transformed, and how expanded coverage is changing what organizations must do to protect their growing assets and capabilities. We’ll examine how interconnectivity and increasing dependence on digital technologies has resulted in this expanded definition, and how new regulations in the European Union (EU) are affecting the way public and private entities must protect their operations.</p>
<p>A look back</p>
<p>Critical infrastructure traditionally included essential services such as electricity, water and sewer, roads, and the banking system that sustains the economy. As digital technologies have made their way into so many facets of our daily lives, so too has our dependence on these technologies for their continued reliable operation. It’s surprising that the critical infrastructure in the context of national security was not formally defined in many countries until the 1990s in preparation for the year 2000 (Y2K) event that was expected to wreak havoc across systems of the time. Fast forward to 2023 and increasing threats and a changing geopolitical environment have given us good reasons to reassess how we define and how we protect critical infrastructure to mitigate risks and ensure its uninterrupted operation.</p>
<p>Today’s environment</p>
<p>Expanding the scope of what is considered critical infrastructure, the list of services now goes well beyond electricity, water and sewer, roads, and banking. Services today extend to a wide spectrum of financial services, industrial technologies, communications, healthcare, and education. With digital technologies such as cloud-based data storage and processing now forming part of many vital services, the need to ensure their security and resiliency has become paramount. According to the 2023 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report, 82% of breaches involved data stored in public or private cloud environments. On average these breaches amount to USD 4.45 million cost per incident. With critical infrastructures being primary targets, the cost of breaches across the sector exceeds USD 5 million and has been growing year on year.</p>
<p>Geopolitical events and increasing malware attacks on utilities and public services are also causing concern at national security levels. The use of new technologies in warfare is raising alarms for the urgent need to strengthen the reliability and robustness of the expanded set of services that now comprise the critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>The need for resilience</p>
<p>To address these threats, new and updated regulations in the EU will come into effect in the next few years. The new Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the updated Network and Information Systems (NIS2) component of the Directive on Measures for a High Common Level of Cybersecurity across the Union establish procedures for identifying and designating critical infrastructures, and a common approach for assessing the need to improve their protection. As EU-wide initiatives, DORA and NIS2 are aimed to become part of each member state’s domestic legislation process and law.</p>
<p>The focus of DORA is to enhance the operational resilience of the financial sector within member states. Its primary objective is to ensure that financial institutions and the infrastructure they use and depend on can withstand and recover from cybersecurity incidents and disruptions. Covering a wide range of aspects including cybersecurity, IT systems, outsourcing, and incident reporting, DORA emphasizes robust oversight of third-party service providers.</p>
<p>NIS2 expands earlier EU-wide cybersecurity legislation aiming to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure areas. The regulation establishes response teams to coordinate incidents across member states. Most notably, NIS2 expands the scope of critical infrastructure, effectively bringing more organizations under the regulatory umbrella. Among industries now covered under the expanded definition, mobile network operators now play a vital role in the critical infrastructure. Focused on fifth-generation (5G) networks that are being deployed to modernize telecommunications for the next decade, mobile network operators are required to only use components from trusted sources.</p>
<p>Both DORA and NIS2 call for the establishment and maintenance of a skilled cybersecurity workforce that can continuously identify and assess system weaknesses and implement solutions to mitigate risks. The regulations also set auditing requirements and severe fines for non-compliance that can amount up to 2% of a company’s worldwide sales. The combination of DORA’s focus on the financial sector and NIS2’s broader coverage will ensure that critical sectors collaborate and learn from each other’s best practices, enhancing overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
<p>The way forward</p>
<p>While DORA and NIS2 are crucial steps toward a safer and more resilient digital landscape in the EU, compliance with these regulations can pose challenges for organizations. DORA and NIS2 promulgate the use of innovative technology including state-of-the-art encryption and key management to protect sensitive and private data end-to-end. Compliance with these directives is not just a legal obligation but also a vital step toward building a safer and more prosperous digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>With the right security strategy and solutions, organizations can enhance their security posture and facilitate the process to ensure compliance. End-to-end data protection requires effective management of the keys and secrets that encrypt and control access to critical data assets. Entrust offers a complete suite of innovative cryptographic solutions that provide a unique centralized/decentralized security approach to facilitate regulatory compliance. Paired with support for post-quantum-ready algorithms, along with a world-class Cryptographic Center of Excellence (CryptoCoE) and professional services, customers using Entrust solutions can not only protect their deployments today but also future-proof them, to facilitate ongoing compliance as threats and requirements change.</p>

 The anonymity of online casinos makes them a fertile ground for money laundering, and a significant threat to the stability and integrity of the global gambling industry. But there are things that operators can do to protect their business and customers. 



 



<p>There was a reason why Marty Byrde from Ozark chose casinos as the perfect front for his money laundering activities. Criminals can convert dirty money into physical or digital chips relatively easily with little to no checks, gamble for a short time, and then cash out, with fresh, laundered money. The same is true for online casinos. In fact, the anonymity afforded by online casinos rivals that of even the darkest, dingiest, most back door brick and mortar casino.</p>



<p>The global revenue of the online casino market is projected to reach <a href="https://es.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/online-casinos/worldwide">$32.69 billion by the end of this year</a>, with an estimated 124 million active users by 2027. No longer considered a niche offshoot, online casinos are a sector in their own right, and welcome increasing numbers of players every single day. However, where there are online users, there are weaknesses in online platforms that criminals can exploit.</p>



 Global relationship between casinos and money laundering. 



<p>The impact of money laundering on the gambling industry can be felt around the world, offline and online. In July 2023, Australian-headquartered Crown Resorts found itself at the center of a major legal battle. In a landmark decision, the Federal Court ordered Crown Resorts to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/30/crown-to-pay-450m-penalty-after-failing-to-comply-with-anti-money-laundering-laws">pay a staggering $450 million</a> (the country’s third largest corporate fine ever) for breaches to money laundering laws.</p>



<p>During the trial, Crown Resorts openly acknowledged that its casinos had failed to implement adequate systems for monitoring “high-risk” gamblers and the operations of junket tours. The investigation uncovered a total of 546 violations of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, spanning 2016 and 2022.</p>



<p>Despite having a population of just over half a million, money laundering in Malta’s iGaming industry is also a significant issue. The island country is home to over<a href="https://igamingnext.com/news/mga-2021-in-numbers/"> 500 iGaming operators</a>, employs more than 10,000 people and generates over $1.5 billion in revenue each year. As a major industry and significant contributor to the economy, it is important that Malta is able to offer a gambling environment that is safe and secure.</p>



<p>In 2022, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/the-mga-publishes-its-2022-annual-report-and-financial-statements/">carried out</a> 28 compliance audits, 228 desktop reviews, and additional AML/CFT compliance examinations, which resulted in the cancellation of licenses and the imposition of <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/the-mga-publishes-its-2022-annual-report-and-financial-statements/">administrative penalties totaling €179,150.</a> The MGA also took remediation measures against 25 license holders, amounting to over €738,000. The Fit &amp; Proper Committee found six individuals and companies to have fallen short of its probity standards due to various factors, including the potential risks associated with money laundering.</p>



<p>Operators failing to comply with AML practices can face serious legal and financial consequences. AML failures include not properly assessing the risk factors associated with players, not having appropriate policies in place, failing to comply with regulatory guidance, and not implementing policies effectively.</p>



<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/petfre-gibraltar-ltd-trading-as-betfred-and-oddsking-fined-gbp2-9m">UKGC imposed a £2.87 million fine on operator Petfre Ltd.</a> for failing to comply with AML and social responsibility regulations. At the time, Leanne Oxley, Director of Enforcement and Intelligence at the UKGC, stated that other licensees should take note of the case and assess it to improve their compliance measures.</p>



 One click away: Why money launderers target online casinos. 



<p>There are numerous reasons why money launderers will target online casinos, and online gambling platforms, in general, including:</p>



 Anonymity and privacy. 



<p>Online casinos offer unrivalled anonymity and privacy for customers, which unfortunately makes for very attractive conditions for money laundering and other types of fraud. Since online casinos do not require in-person interaction, criminals can create fake identities or steal others’, making it extremely challenging for authorities to trace the source of funds.&nbsp;</p>



 High transaction volumes. 



<p>As many online gambling platforms process thousands of transactions every day, this makes it harder for payment providers and operators to monitor for fraud, and for law enforcement agencies to detect suspicious activities. Criminals will also often use multiple accounts to transfer money between different platforms, making the tracking of funds even more challenging.</p>



 International reach.&nbsp; 



<p>As gambling platforms often operate in multiple jurisdictions, money launderers often transfer money across different countries to further obfuscate funds and avoid detection.</p>



 Cryptocurrency in online casinos. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">Crypto money launderers</a> on online gambling platforms use a combination of anonymous and identifiable accounts to deposit funds, which are then withdrawn or transferred to other players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As cryptocurrencies are decentralized, this offers a further level of anonymity, making it even more challenging to trace transaction source and destination, particularly on platforms with subpar KYC and AML measures.</p>



 What methods do criminals use to launder money in online casinos? 



<p>As online gambling platforms provide so many opportunities to launder money, fraudsters have various options to obscure the origin of dirty money and channel it through their gambling platforms of choice. For example, criminals may look to use <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">stolen identities</a> to open accounts and carry out money laundering schemes, and use stolen credit cards for deposits and withdrawals.</p>



<p>Another common method for money laundering in online casinos involves the fraudster depositing money into their account through either prepaid cards, cheques, credit and debit cards, or cryptocurrencies. The money deposited to the gambling account is then withdrawn and ultimately achieves legal status. With this method, the player does not tend to use the funds for actual betting.</p>



<p>If a particularly large amount of money needs to be made clean, the fraudster is likely to be concerned about amy red flags they might set off. Structuring, smurfing, or layering involves fragmenting large sums of illegally sourced funds into smaller transactions to escape detection. Money launderers do this by depositing small amounts at a time, thus eluding possible detection from regulatory authorities.</p>



<p>Another scenario involves the player using deposited funds to bet. The player will place their funds in games, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/collusion-in-betting/">collude</a> with other players, and place coordinated bets. Although this method involves losing some money, fraudsters are willing to make such an investment to launder money. Chip dumping, a technique in which a player intentionally loses chips to another player at an online poker table, is one of the greatest examples of collusion in online gambling. The individual receives chips and then cashes out, effectively laundering money.</p>



<p>The third most common way to launder money through online casinos involves using the gambling account as a makeshift bank account to make illegal transactions. Both parties (buyer and seller) would utilize a gambling account to transfer funds through P2P (player-to-player) transfers. The seller can then cash out illicit funds stored on their gambling account to their payment account. If asked about the source of funds, sellers often claim the money is generated from gambling profits.</p>



<p>Those who use gambling platforms for the purpose of money laundering often use multiple accounts to transact money between different platforms. Gnoming refers to the act of using multiple accounts to help one player win. The other accounts are created to deliberately lose in head-to-head games like poker.</p>



<p>The final method involves using a gambling account to store and conceal illicit funds from authorities. This approach differs from previous methods as funds are not withdrawn but concealed and retrieved from the gambling account using the same (anonymous) banking method.</p>

 Red flags: How to detect money laundering in online casinos. 



<p>Below are the most common money laundering-related red flags operators should watch out for:</p>



  Unusual betting patterns with players placing large bets on low-risk games or frequently changing betting patterns.<br>  Frequent large transactions.<br>  Rapid deposit and withdrawal cycles with criminals depositing large sums to their accounts and withdrawing them quickly.<br>  Multiple accounts and IP addresses for conducting transactions.  



 How are regulatory bodies addressing money laundering in online casinos? 



<p>Regulatory bodies worldwide have taken several initiatives to address money laundering in online casinos. These include the requirement to adhere to strict measures as part of AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a> regulations.</p>



<p>For instance, the UK has one of the most regulated gambling industries in the world. The UK Gambling Commission, which is currently running a series of consultations to bring the gambling environment into the digital age, has recently made customer onboarding and verification processes much stricter. Without complete verification, operators can neither let customers deposit funds nor give them <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/print/changes-to-the-licence-conditions-and-codes-of-practice-on-age-and-identity#:~:text=summarised%20as%20follows%3A-,Age%20verification,-We%20will%20require">access</a> to bonuses, free bets, or even free-to-play games.</p>



<p>Most regulatory bodies also require online casinos to conduct <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">Customer Due Diligence</a> checks, also known as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> requirements. This process involves gathering and verifying basic information about the customer via a reliable source. Discover more about the dangers of online casinos, and the importance of KYC in ensuring a safe and secure gambling experience in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/importance-of-kyc-in-online-casinos">‘The importance of KYC in online casinos.’</a></p>



 How can online casinos prevent money laundering? 



<p>Online casinos must embrace the benefits of technology to combat money laundering. Technology can help detect money laundering by analyzing large amounts of data and identifying suspicious transactions and gambling patterns. This is done by utilizing automated systems that flag transactions that meet specific criteria, e.g., large or unusual transactions.</p>



<p>Below are some ways operators can prevent money laundering with the help of technological advances:</p>



 Machine learning and AI solutions. 



<p>AI-enabled identity verification solutions can identify player identities and behavior patterns indicative of money laundering. Such systems learn from past transactions to identify unusual patterns. These solutions are also able to verify huge amounts of information by comparing customer data with identity documents, biometric data, or external databases.</p>



 Blockchain technology. 



<p>Blockchain technology can be utilized to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. All transactions on the blockchain create a permanent trail of unalterable records. Consequently, authorities can more conveniently trace the source of money.</p>



 Reporting suspicious activities. 



<p>Operators must report any suspicious activities or transactions to the relevant authorities. This includes any unusual transaction that does not meet specific financial thresholds or other standards set by local regulations. Here, automated systems that flag suspicious transactions can be used.</p>



 Risk assessments. 



<p>Risk assessments include closely examining transaction patterns, geographic locations, and user profiles to ascertain the likelihood and potential risk of money laundering activities. After risks are detected, operators can take the appropriate measures to mitigate them, e.g., the implementation of advanced due diligence protocols on high-risk users. Adopting an effective risk-based <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204350/amlctf_supervision_report_201011.pdf">approach</a> by identifying high-risk users and transactions can also lighten the overall burden of regulation on operators.</p>



 Transaction monitoring. 



<p>Lastly, operators can use technology to monitor transactions via SoF (Source of Funds) and SoW (Source of Wealth) checks. This helps ensure transactions are legitimate and funds are not the proceeds of criminal activity.</p>



 How does money laundering impact online casino users? 



<p>The impact of online casinos falling victim to money laundering can be disastrous. Firstly, there is the obvious reputational damage, as existing and future customers will ask questions about the legitimacy and security of the platform, resulting in a loss of player trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players who do stay on the platform and are concerned about money laundering will potentially change their deposit habits. Another likely impact could be players no longer trusting KYC processes for fear their information may be misused.</p>



<p>Operators can allay player fears by remaining proactive and vigilant in their efforts to prevent money laundering, which could involve implementing more advanced anti-fraud technologies and joining forces with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with relevant laws.</p>

 No topic has been more polarizing to the gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks. Now that the UKGC’s consultation on the checks has been conducted, we explore the arguments against affordability checks. 



 



<p>Financial risk checks, formerly known as affordability checks in the UK, were essentially designed to protect players from gambling online with money they cannot afford to lose.&nbsp;Operators conduct them to ensure they are not encouraging problem gambling, and that their products and services are being used responsibly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in concept to the ability-to-pay checks conducted by financial service providers of credit cards and loans, financial risk checks run in the background, ultimately satisfying the operator that the gambler has sufficient funds to continue placing bets safely. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The release of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK Gambling White Paper</a> in April 2023, which aimed to bring the regulatory environment into the digital age, caused uproar among gambling operators and players alike. Its proposal on affordability checks, in particular, led to collective apprehension that they would be intrusive and impact the enjoyment of gamblers who were not experiencing gambling-related issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), which is currently running a series of consultations on proposed changes, has identified three key risks it wishes to address via financial risk checks: binge gambling, financially vulnerable customers, and sustained significant losses over time (from gambling). To assuage operator and player fear, the UKGC has stated that “frictionless” player protection checks will only ever be conducted, starting with background checks at a £125 net loss per month or £500 within a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UKGC’s plans to execute the UK government’s gambling strategy here</a>.</p>



 Privacy concerns and data protection objections. 



<p>The topic of responsible gambling and safer gambling has been on the UKGC’s agenda since as far back as 2018, when it launched a proposal for operators to establish limits on online consumer expenditures until affordability checks were carried out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2020, a month before the government announced it would be carrying out a gambling review, the UKGC launched a consultation that included a call for evidence on the thresholds for affordability checks. During that period, a net monthly loss of £100 was proposed as the lowest possible threshold to prompt an affordability check, after which a gambler would be required to prove they had sufficient funds and could afford to continue gambling on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation caused alarm throughout various gambling sectors, especially the racing administration. The fear is that thousands of gamblers would be uncomfortable divulging such private information and choose to bet via black-market routes or give up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debate surrounding affordability checks highlighted the tension between safeguarding vulnerable gamblers and preserving individual freedom and privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2022, reports suggested that the government favored “non-intrustive” procedures similar to a credit check in financial services, although the matter was likely to be subject to further consultation.</p>



 Ready, set, stop: Impact of affordability checks. 



<p>The proposal of affordability checks was and is still by far the most controversial of gambling reforms under discussion. Critics argue that affordability checks come with notable drawbacks. For instance, the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/gambling-review/bha-warns-mps-affordability-checks-could-be-financially-devastating-for-british-racing-ajWoc9B6UgCZ/">British Horseracing Authority warned</a> Members of Parliament that introducing affordability checks at low levels of spending may prove financially devastating for the British horse racing industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing appropriate spending limits has long been considered a challenging aspect when it comes to conducting affordability checks. Many factors need to be considered, including customer income, expenses, and overall financial situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In early 2021, Several high-profile names working within the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/features/series/a-sword-of-damocles-but-how-did-affordability-checks-become-such-a-big-issue-a8n1Q3Q3DO9Q/">racing industry</a> sent letters to Members of Parliament, underscoring that racecourse revenues had suffered a £250 million loss due to the pandemic. Their argument was that if affordability checks as low as £100 were established, it would result in a potential further impact of £60 million per year on profits from lost levy, as well as media rights payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other evaluations proposed that the potential damage would be as high as £100 million per year, with roughly 60% of gamblers likely to reject such requests for information.</p>



 Most recent criticisms of financial risk checks. 



<p>Although the UK gambling white paper appears more balanced than many in the industry feared, there are criticisms from the industry based on allegations of intrusiveness and paternalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The invasion of privacy is staggering,” opined Regulus Partners regulatory analyst Dan Waugh in 2020 regarding the concept of financial risks and would just lead to individuals looking for ways to avoid the level of intrusion needed to enforce the rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With financial risk checks, the UK’s government proposes “frictionless” and “unintrusive” checks when a player passes a net loss of £125 per month or £500 in a year. As per the proposal, such affordability checks would become more detailed yet “still frictionless” at more substantial loss levels, i.e., £1000 in a day or £2000 within 90 days. Such levels would be halved for gamblers under 25.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the UKGC’s consultations on four initial topics (financial risk checks; remote game design; in-person age verification; customer control over marketing), numerous operators have completed compliance assessments on how the proposed standards on affordability and financial risk checks has been met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/20668/olbg-survey-65-of-bettors-would-refuse-to-face-affordability-checks-if-asked">survey</a> conducted by YouGov on behalf of the Online Betting Guide, 65% of players showed a lack of willingness to comply with affordability checks. Another <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/ey-report-22">study</a> led by the EY for the Betting and Gaming Council towards the end of 2022 showed that nearly 70% of people who gamble would resist allowing regulated companies to conduct affordability checks to determine whether they could afford to bet.</p>



 An industry “simply unprepared.” 



<p>A 2020 blog from <a href="https://www.wiggin.co.uk/insight/the-affordability-consultation-a-fundamental-shift-in-gambling-regulation/">Wiggin</a>, a law firm based in London, also noted how unprepared the industry and consumers were to adapt to the requirements of financial risk checks. The main crux of the issue for the Wiggin team was proportionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A question posed in the blog was: “How far does the Commission expect operators and regular customers, which constitute the vast majority of British gamblers, to change their behavior to mitigate the risk that only a small yet vulnerable proportion of customers face?”</p>



 What consequences do critics most fear? 



<p>According to Waugh, the likely outcome of extending “official oversight,” via financial risk checks, would be “threefold.”&nbsp;</p>



  Rather than use one operator, players would just allocate funds throughout multiple accounts, until the UKGC’s aspirations toward a <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/an-update-on-the-single-customer-view-industry-challenge">single customer view</a> are fully realized<br>  Gamblers may use proxy accounts owned by family and friends<br>  Players may resort to offshore gambling or black-market gambling platforms&nbsp;  



<p>As mentioned earlier, the final outcome would be players to simply reduce expenditures or stopping gambling altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/ey-report-22">study</a> led by EY for the Betting and Gaming Council highlighted the decline of online gross gambling yield since mid-2021, owing to several possible factors, including the introduction of affordability checks.</p>



 6 financial risk check indicators, 1 frictionless check. 



<p>IDnow combines a robust, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/affordability-financial-risk-checks/">holistic affordability check</a> with multi-dimensional ID verification and fraud prevention, facilitating seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere, all from one platform, all in real-time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We offer the industry’s most comprehensive affordability check (read more: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">Why 6 financial risk check indicators are better than 2.’</a>) to enable seamless gameplay by offering a fully automated journey and enhanced speed and accuracy at the affordability checkpoint. Checks can be added at any point in the journey. For example, while the more cautious operators may wish to implement the full suite of checks at the point of onboarding, some may wish to implement them at the point of withdrawal or deposit or once thresholds are met. Checks from our suite of financial risk indicators can also be done at different points – e.g. Geo, mortality and property at account sign up and application, and vulnerability and derogatory checks once the whitepaper limits have been reached for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow values the importance of non-intrusive affordability checks as they indicate that operators take player protection, privacy, and responsible gambling seriously.</p>

<p>To evolve from an economy of extraction to an economy of care we need to evolve from Communication Design to Conversation Design. While Communication Design builds one-directional relationships between corporations and consumers, Conversational Design builds frameworks and pathways for communities.</p><p>I have not talked about it much, but today is a good day to tell you that I joined a not-for-profit organization at the beginning of 2023 and it is challenging my way of thinking about&nbsp;design.</p><p>The job title they gave me is Visual Conversation Design Lead at Dark Matter Laboratories. DML is an international not-for-profit collaborating with communities to reshape and rebuild their institutions, instruments, and infrastructures.</p><p>I have felt the urge to use my design skills and knowledge to improve the world we live in, on and from, for many years, but did not know how. I was frustrated about seeing human systems destroying us and our planet and not being able to do anything about it. Designing a poster and posting it to social media felt useless. I mean, I get it and I don’t criticize designers doing so. It is what comes to the designer’s mind first. Paraphrasing the saying “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”: When all you have is the creative cloud, everything looks like a poster on Instagram.</p><p>We do not have no power as designers, we just use our skills for the wrong things, in the wrong context, and for the wrong purposes. When we design a post on social media we try to teach individuals that have no power either and probably are in our network, because they already think like&nbsp;us.</p><p>This year I realized that we DO have power as designers. We have the power to say NO to certain clients, tools, and trends and we have the power to say YES to work with innovative experts and decision-makers in leverage positions that need our help. We can’t do it alone. We need to join communities of practice.</p><p>From Communication Design to Conversation Design</p><p>To evolve from an economy of extraction to an economy of care we need to change complex systems with multipolar problems. This is only possible if we form trans-disciplinary, trans-institutional, and trans-everything networks. To bridge these gaps we need to evolve from Communication Design to Conversation Design. While Communication Design builds one-directional relationships between corporations and consumers, Conversational Design builds frameworks and pathways for communities.</p><p>Communication Design has been strongly influenced by the system it has been used for. In most cases, the attempted kind of communication has been one-directional with the sole purpose of convincing a person to become a customer. As the Visual Conversation Design Lead, I am trying to unlearn the strategies of consumer building and learn the strategies of community building.</p><p>In the following 10 points, I tried to outline the key qualities Conversational Design should&nbsp;have:</p> Simplicity <p>While we need to understand the world in its complexity, we need to strive for simplicity in design. The simplest solution is the solution that wastes the littlest time, energy, and material. Simplicity in Conversational Design does not mean reducing the complexity of information. It means creating flows of knowledge, allowing to join the conversation from different points of view and levels of understanding.</p> Readability <p>We make our texts as comprehensible as possible, in terminology, structure, and typography. We have clearly identifiable hierarchies to allow fast navigation. Longer texts are always left-aligned, not too small, not too big, not too narrow, not too wide, and sufficiently darker than their background. All of the settings are responsively adapted to their&nbsp;display.</p> Transparency <p>We always credit and reference. Our work is the materialization of flows. It emerges through relationships. Making these relationships visible allows our ideas to be questioned and evolve. While staying readable through simple hierarchies, like titles, sub-titles, introductions, and subheadings, we offer opportunities to deepen the knowledge through side-, foot- or endnotes. Transparency also means avoiding layers of concealment that distance us from the matter, like decorative visual or verbal language.</p> Uncertainty <p>Without considering the possibility of being wrong or ignorant, and the wish to listen and learn, there can’t be conversation. Conversational Design has to express a certain degree of uncertainty. Techniques to make the design look unquestionable should be&nbsp;avoided.</p> Friction <p>Frictionless design is the enemy of constructive conversation. The frictionless design confirms one’s beliefs, even if wrong. We need to welcome different perspectives and positions if we want to evolve. Design should create and not hide friction to stimulate conversation.</p> Respect <p>Communication Design seduces consumers. Conversational Design treats its partners as equals. Design should not dumb down, but be challenging. Design can be a chance to evolve visual literacy and stimulate compound learning.</p> Emergent <p>Leave space for the design to evolve and emerge. Think about the constants and variables of your system. What are the variables and how can they be used to show the emergence and evolution of the design? In a world of constant change, everything planned is likely to break. A flexible system able to adapt is more likely to&nbsp;survive.</p> Contextuality <p>If it is our aim to enter into conversation with humans we need to become aware of the conditions under which they are confronted with us. To communicate adequately we need to adapt in size, form, and tone according to the context in which the conversation should take place. Contextual design is about using the right tools for the right people in the right&nbsp;context.</p> Eloquence <p>Visual eloquence means moving away from simplistic visual messages like logos and embracing the diversity and complexity of visual languages. Everything that makes us visible is an identification element. From the people of our organization to the output we create. Whatever is seen most, matters most to the Visual Identity.</p> Kindness <p>Above all rules, we follow the principle of humanity, which states that when interpreting our conversational partner we consider his or her perspective as true to their reality, although it may appear untrue from our perspective. In Conversation Design, we need to be hard on the matter, but soft on the people, to reach a common understanding of a shared&nbsp;faith.</p><p>This blog is authored by Martin Lorenz, Visual Conversation Design Lead at Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>References:</p><p>The ten points mentioned above are influenced by experiences and talks I had with my colleagues at Dark Matter Laboratories, like Indy Johar, Arianna Smaron, Gurden Batra, Leon Seefeld, Jayne Engle, Ivana Stancic, JP King, and many more, which aren’t documented and can’t be referenced here, but there are a couple of readable references that helped me with my thinking and I would like to collect them&nbsp;here.</p><p>This is an ongoing thought process and I would appreciate every hint from you to more relevant sources regarding the creation, application, and implementation of Conversational Design in communities.</p><p>I do not fully agree with all of what is written here, but these sources were definitely relevant to form an&nbsp;opinion:</p><p><a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/against-branding-part-1--design-and-conflict/39433">https://designobserver.com/feature/against-branding-part-1–design-and-conflict/39433</a></p><p><a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK">http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK</a></p><p><a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/first-things-first-manifesto-2000">https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/first-things-first-manifesto-2000</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/from-communication-design-to-conversation-design-b943f8ea0872">From Communication Design to Conversation Design</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I closed <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/video-trust-in-the-post-identity-world-identiverse-closing-keynote/">my Identiverse 2022 speech</a> with a discomfiting call to action: “If zero trust is a thing, then so is Zero Identity”. This speech from Identiverse 2023 in June extends that concept.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Let’s go as far as we can without identity. Let’s see if we can design systems without putting identity first. We’ve become obsessed with identity. We seem to begin the design process for each new system with identity. When a transaction is risky, we habitually pile on more identification, leading to too much identity data leaking, and too many opportunities for identity abuse.</p>
<p>It is sheer madness that <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-if-we-could-make-data-useless-to-thieves/">so much crime is enabled by simply assuming another person’s identity</a>.</p>
<p>To turn around this race-to-the-bottom, let’s try something different. Let’s try to secure peoples’ transactions with less reliance on their identity.</p>
<p>“Zero Trust” has achieved quasi standard status in cybersecurity but let’s remember it does not literally mean there is no trust. Rather, Zero Trust is an appeal for more discipline in security design. Much-vaunted trustless systems make their security promises with less reliance on people and process.</p>
<p>Similarly, “Zero Identity” is my call to do more with less identification.</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything) is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in Web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Research around WebAuthn around creating a consistent signing identity using WebAuthn, creating and signing capability objects using WebAuthn, and using WebAuthn signers with EIP-4337.   Kepler <p></p><p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  Kepler is currently being updated to adopt the latest versions of the UCAN spec (v0.10) and the CACAO spec (v3) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/155?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#155</a>). This will keep Kepler up to date with the latest work in cryptographic object capabilities, and help to streamline code while improving performance and safety.  <p></p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  ssi-ucan is being updated to support the latest iteration of the UCAN spec: version 0.10 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/510?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#510</a>). This will enable SSI users to take advantage of cryptographic object capabilities for delegating, invoking, and revoking permissions.  Last month, we upgraded our cryptographic libraries to address a vulnerability with ed25519 keys (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/532?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#532</a>).  A major refactor of ssi continues to be underway. This refactor will help us to better handle Linked Data and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe both the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  Working on a formal specification of TreeLDR’s layout ontology. RDF is the intermediate representation used by the TreeLDR compiler. Having a formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts in RDF will allow us to:  derive a formal definition of the TreeLDR language itself, based on this ontology, leading to the stabilization of TreeLDR;  enable developers to write extensions for TreeLDR through RDF.     Rebase&nbsp;   Support for ReCaps (and Delegated Attestation flows, as a result) is now available. This opens the door to allowing Kepler and Rebase to share a delegation and only requires one signing operation before the user can create and store credentials without re-signing.  A new, more flexible WASM compilation build chain that enables easy importation of the WASM library into the browser, Node, and other WASM-targeting Rust libraries.  Automated testing of all the flows that were missing tests (e-mail, NFT, POAP, Attestation, and Delegated Attestation).  Full support of did:key for ed25519 keys as both issuer and subject. Key additions broaden what applications can be built on top of it and open the door for user-defined credentials which are required for content authenticity projects.   <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>Say goodbye to the network perimeter you know and love. Its days are numbered, and an expansive attack surface is taking its place.</p>
<p>You see, long gone are the days when classic network security policies could safely protect your sensitive data. With a swarm of new users, personal devices, cloud applications, and machine identities floating around your environment, the time has come to take implicit trust out of the equation.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re talking about adopting a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy. But, before you can do that, your organization will have to revisit its approach to identity governance.</p>
<p>Why? Think about it: Post-perimeter cybersecurity is all about knowing who and what has access to your corporate assets. More importantly, it’s about how they’re using them.</p>
<p>That’s where Identity and Access Management (IAM) comes into play. In this blog, we’ll discuss why IAM is key to implementing Zero Trust and what your organization can do to lay a solid foundation.</p>
 The importance of identity to Zero Trust security 
<p>There’s been a significant change in the way most organizations architect their IT infrastructure over the past several years. Given recent advancements in cloud computing, many enterprises have chosen to transition away from legacy, on-premise systems in favor of agile cloud deployments.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-cloud-in-2021-adoption-continues/">over 90% of organizations</a> now operate in the cloud. Gartner estimates that global cloud spending will continue to soar, totaling <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023#:~:text=Worldwide%20end%2Duser%20spending%20on,latest%20forecast%20from%20Gartner%2C%20Inc.">over $720 billion</a> in 2024. It begs the question: How did we get here?</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is unquestionably a driving force. When offices closed their doors, a sudden and massive demand for remote access paved the way for rapid digital transformation — and with that, cloud computing. However, because more users, applications, devices, and other assets are connected to the network, the attack surface has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>Worse yet, these connections exist far beyond the bounds of the traditional network perimeter, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation. Now that castle-and-moat cybersecurity is insufficient, identity is the only factor standing between hackers and your sensitive data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that’s where a Zero Trust architecture comes into play.</p>
 The Zero Trust framework 
<p>The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-maturity-model/">Zero Trust maturity model</a> accounts for the fact that the cybersecurity landscape has fundamentally shifted. In turn, it advocates for an identity-driven security framework, which allows a properly authenticated and verified user, device, or other entity to access network resources from any location.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that cloud services and remote access have effectively nullified the classic perimeter. After all, how do you build a fence around a house if the size of the property is constantly changing? The short answer is you forget about the fence and focus on the people coming and going from the property. In a nutshell, that’s what the Zero Trust strategy is all about.</p>
<p>Adopting an identity-driven approach is best supported in tandem with the three core Zero Trust principles:</p>
 
 Least privileged access: The term “<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege">least privilege access</a>” refers to a policy in which entities are granted the minimum level of authorization needed to perform a given function. For instance, employees may only have user access to network resources essential to doing their job. This is key to limiting the attack surface and containing cyber threats. 
 Assume breach: The Zero Trust model eliminates implicit trust and considers all connections as potential threats. Moreover, it advocates safeguarding against the inevitability of a data breach by taking steps to minimize damage. For example, your security team may segment the network, thereby preventing lateral movement. 
 Explicit verification: Strict identity governance is paramount. A solid Zero Trust architecture will continuously monitor activity even after network access is granted, mandating repeated authentication whenever an entity requests access to an additional resource. 
 
<p>One of the most efficient ways of supporting these principles is to introduce a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.</p>
 What is Identity and Access Management? 
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/identity-and-access-management-iam">is defined as</a> a “security and business discipline that includes multiple technologies and business processes to help the right people or machines to access the right assets at the right time for the right reasons, while keeping unauthorized access and fraud at bay.”</p>
<p>In simpler terms, IAM policies, tools, and technologies are how your organization can provide secure access to its users, third-party partners, and other entities.</p>
 Traditional IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM strategies stem from the classic network security model, which assumes all entities within a certain perimeter are trustworthy and secure (i.e., implicit trust). However, this approach is easily exploited by hackers, insider threats, phishing scams, malware, and more.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s incapable of meeting the scalability and complexity requirements of today’s dynamic IT landscape, which includes cloud services, mobile devices, remote workers, third-party vendors, etc. It lacks visibility over this expanding surface, allowing anomalous behavior to go undetected.</p>
 Zero Trust IAM 
<p>Zero Trust IAM deploys a more robust and advanced security framework. By applying Zero Trust principles to identity governance and access rights, organizations can implement and enforce access control policies on a much more granular level.</p>
<p>Instead of basing authentication decisions purely on location, a Zero Trust IAM system verifies every request using multiple attributes. These include (but aren’t limited to):</p>
 
 User identity 
 Context 
 Device reputation 
 Location 
 User activity or entity behavior 
 Resource sensitivity 
 
<p>Zero Trust identity management has numerous advantages. Taking this approach can help you:</p>
 
 Improve business continuity and resilience by reducing the attack surface 
 Streamline login, access, and authentication procedures 
 Enhance visibility and analytics over user behavior, which supports early threat detection 
 Minimize impact on the user experience, thus maximizing productivity 
 Reduce costs by automating, orchestrating, and consolidating IAM functions, thereby eliminating the need for redundant solutions 
 Simplify compliance for heavily regulated industries 
 Enable secure access for your <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">hybrid workforce</a> 
 
 Implementing Zero Trust IAM: Challenges and solutions 
<p>Many organizations begin their Zero Trust journey with a mixed bag of on- and off-premise technologies, cloud applications, and unmanaged devices. Often, they’re not integrated through an enterprise identity service that catalogs all assets and connections.</p>
<p>Consequently, IT teams are forced to manage disparate identities across a vast number of systems and applications. At an individual level, that means each user has numerous — and oftentimes weak — login credentials. Without visibility over these fragmented identities, organizations are vulnerable to internal and external threats.</p>
 The road to Zero Trust maturity 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/how-to-implement-zero-trust-a-comprehensive-guide/">Adopting Zero Trust</a> is no easy feat. It may take several years to fully implement and will certainly require all hands on deck. But, given the cybersecurity landscape, few organizations can afford to put it off any further.</p>
<p>The time to lay the foundation for your Zero Trust architecture is now. Luckily, there are several steps you can take to ease the process and get the ball rolling in the right direction:</p>
 
 The first step in addressing this challenge and advancing the Zero Trust journey is to reign in these many assets, users, and data sources. Organizations must systematically identify and classify all of their resources, assigning each one a risk rating depending on how critical it is to operations and how damaging it would be if leaked in the open. 
 Next, after assets are categorized, the enterprise can establish comprehensive security and access control policies. 
 You can fortify security and introduce layered defenses by consolidating identities under a unified IAM solution. With a comprehensive portfolio of advanced capabilities, IT teams can centralize all processes within a single source of truth for all users. This makes it easier to establish and enforce granular policies across on-premise and cloud environments. 
 With a unified solution in place, enterprises may then begin continuously monitoring user behavior, session patterns, and system-wide activity to rapidly detect anomalies and potential threats. 
 
 Essential IAM capabilities 
<p>You might be wondering what a comprehensive <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management">IAM portfolio</a> actually looks like. In truth, any IAM system worth its weight in gold will support Zero Trust security with a few must-have components.</p>
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
<p>Account takeovers are a growing threat to corporate credentials. In fact, a recent report suggests there’s been a <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/criminals-solved-bot-defense-leading-to-an-uptick-in-stolen-accounts/">230% jump</a> in such attacks year over year. Many organizations have implemented MFA to mitigate this risk, but hackers have learned to bypass traditional strategies with ease.</p>
<p>That’s why phishing-resistant MFA is crucial to your identity management strategy. FIDO2 keys, passkeys, and other mechanisms are helping security teams overcome this challenge and authenticate their users with ease.</p>
<p>Essential MFA solutions include:</p>
 
 Single sign-on (SSO): Users can access all applications after only one authentication rather than repeating the process for every unique cloud or on-premise system. SSO protects against password fatigue and reuse while also streamlining provisioning, onboarding, and offboarding. 
 Passwordless security: As mentioned, people tend to recycle passwords for multiple accounts. Worse yet, weak passwords are easily cracked. You can mitigate this risk by leveraging passwordless MFA — a process that instead relies on high-assurance cryptographic tools like FIDO2 or digital passkeys. 
 Certificate-based authentication (CBA): CBA offers a passwordless user experience by allowing you to provision a digital certificate to the user. You can also issue certificates to the user’s device, ensuring that both entities are verified and authorized to access network resources. 
 Certificate lifecycle management (CLM): CLM is a must-have addition to any certificate-based authentication process. It offers a full line of sight into your certificate estate, centralizing control for all environments. Issue, renew, and revoke certificates from one pane of glass. 
 Risk-based adaptive authentication (RBA): RBA provides configurable policies that empower you to factor contextual data into the authentication decision. It only escalates the process when required, ensuring you maintain a seamless user experience. If a request is deemed suspicious, you can issue another challenge to authenticate via other mechanisms. 
 
 Lay your Zero Trust foundation with Entrust 
<p>The access management and authentication tools highlighted above are crucial to supporting your Zero Trust journey. Not only will they enable you to secure your environments against unauthorized access, but they’ll empower your people to leverage essential resources with total confidence.</p>

It concludes on Oct 19. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF59   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF59 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Bluesky is currently in beta. Why should I join?</p>
<p>In September, Bluesky reached 1M users, and less than a month later, we reached 1.5M users. The size of our user base is rapidly growing, and our users include people who follow political news, sports, entertainment, and more. Join us in our early days as we grow from 1M to 10M users!</p>
<p>How do I get verified as a journalist?</p>
<p>On Bluesky, journalists and news organizations can self-verify by setting their website directly as their username. For example, some newspapers’ handles that already exist on Bluesky include @nytimes.com, @washingtonpost.com, and @npr.org.</p>
<p>As a result, each organization now manages verifications for their own journalists too. For example, a newsroom can verify an affiliated journalist through a subdomain like @name.newsroom.com.</p>
<p>Freelance journalists and writers that aren't affiliated with a specific organization can set their username to be their website.</p>
<p>Read more about domain verification in our guide <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">here</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for establishing a presence on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Post and engage often! We have a very active user base, and creating posts and replies is the best way to show up on other people’s feeds.</p>
<p>You can also create and subscribe to custom feeds.</p>
<p>What are custom feeds and how can journalists use them?</p>
<p>Custom feeds are a feature on Bluesky that allow you to pick the algorithm that powers your social media experience. Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports — you can simply pick your chosen feed from an open marketplace of feeds developed by our team and third-party developers.</p>
<p>For users, the ability to customize their feed gives them back control over how they spend their attention. For developers, an open marketplace of feeds provides the freedom to experiment and publish algorithms that anyone can use.</p>
<p>This means that Bluesky does not control a single algorithmic timeline for all users. Instead, users have created feeds of their own, including feeds specifically for news.</p>
<p>We encourage journalists to experiment with custom feeds too. For example, a local journalist in Portland could create a feed specifically for Portland. Similarly, a finance journalism organization could create a feed specifically for financial news.</p>
<p>How can I get an invite?</p>
<p>Fill out our waitlist for journalists <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOzi1Ty2Xs74E71G_2gHdiCk16yi4kJPQ9VIa-VYx2cmFaiA/viewform">here</a> with your work email address.</p>
<p>If you're a freelance journalist or use a personal email for work, please use the above form as well. We just ask that you provide an author link in the form.</p>
<p>I’m part of a news organization and I’d like to distribute invites to my team. How can I do that?</p>
<p>If you’re an audience editor, you can send us a note at <a href="mailto:press+teaminvites@blueskyweb.xyz">press+teaminvites@blueskyweb.xyz</a> with your Bluesky username and your requested number of invites.</p>
<p>Due to the volume of requests that we receive, if you’re seeking a single or a small number of invites, please use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOzi1Ty2Xs74E71G_2gHdiCk16yi4kJPQ9VIa-VYx2cmFaiA/viewform">waitlist form</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have any tools for scheduled posting or cross-posting?</p>
<p>We don’t currently have any official tools, but since Bluesky is an open social network, third-party developers can create their own. Here is a <a href="https://atproto.com/community/projects#bridges">list</a> of some of the existing third-party projects.</p>

<p>Although it can seem overwhelming — especially for those of us at small companies where identity and access management is just one of the many hats we wear — employee onboarding in Google Workspace can be a breeze, even if you’re not a tech guru. The key is knowing where to start.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the step-by-step process of setting up new employee accounts, configuring email, and granting access to essential apps within Google Workspace. We’ll also cover common challenges and provide tips for simplifying the process, including how to <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">leverage tools like YeshID to make things even smoother</a>.</p>
 Step 1: Set Up a New Employee Account 
<p>The first step in onboarding a new employee is to set up a new employee account in Google Workspace. It’s worth noting here that we are assuming you have Google Super Admin access, which is a prerequisite for completing the tasks below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s a good idea to do this a couple of days before the employee’s start date to ensure that other applications can be provisioned smoothly. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
 
 Email address: By creating a Google Workspace account, you’re giving the employee an identity within your company, which is centered around their email address. 
 Password management: You’ll need to create a password for them, which you should send them and save so they can access their account on the first day. 
 Security: To enhance security, force the new employee to change their password upon the first login and strongly consider <a href="https://youtu.be/uVStgdfyJx0">enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)</a>. This will grant them access to Google systems like Calendar, Mail, and more. 
 
 Step 2: Grant Access to Google Groups and Organizations 
<p>Next, ensure that the new employee has access to the right email groups and is placed in the appropriate organizational units, or orgs, within Google Workspace. While this process may be manual, you can often use the profile of another user with a similar role as a reference to determine which groups and orgs to assign.</p>
<p></p>
 Step 3: Provide Access to Birthright Apps 
<p>Birthright apps are the applications that every employee should have access to, such as Slack, documentation systems (e.g., Notion or Confluence), and HR applications. To grant access to these apps:</p>
 
 Go into each application and provide access to the new email address you created for the employee. 
 Sometimes, you may need to coordinate with other departments to ensure access is granted appropriately. 
 
 Step 4: Track Access and Compliance 
<p>Whether you handle app provisioning yourself or someone else does it, it’s crucial to keep track of the apps you’ve granted access to for three key reasons:</p>
 
 Offboarding: When an employee leaves the company, you can easily revoke their access to applications.&nbsp; 
 Cost control: Tracking app access helps you manage licenses efficiently, saving your company money. 
 Compliance: Compliance requirements often demand proof of access, so having a record is essential. 
 
<p>Many companies without a full HR or IT department might track this information in a spreadsheet or company wiki that needs to be manually updated and kept private. It’s a lot to manage, but by implementing these best practices today, you set yourself up for success tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
 Simplify Onboarding with YeshID 
<p>There are options that don’t involve doing all of this manually: GAM, Bettercloud, Okta, and Ping are a few. The problem though is that for most small businesses, these products are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to streamline onboarding today while setting up the foundational best practices we outlined in this guide. Benefits include:</p>
 
 Schedule onboarding: YeshID allows you to schedule onboarding tasks. An email is automatically sent to the user on their start date, and their account is provisioned immediately to kickstart the application license process. 
 Create templates for departments: Create templates for different departments to automate the assignment of groups and orgs, reducing manual work. 
 Implement passwordless security: Enhance security by utilizing YeshID’s passwordless authentication method. 
 Manage application provisioning: Manage the application provisioning process through YeshID’s task management system. Assign administrators for each application, and they’ll receive notifications for when to provision access. 
 Compliance management: YeshID serves as a central source of truth for access management, making it easy to demonstrate compliance when needed. 
 
<p>Streamlining employee onboarding in Google Workspace doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With the right approach and tools like YeshID Onboard, you can efficiently manage the process and ensure that new employees have the access they need from day one.</p>
<p>Try <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Onboard</a>. The first 100 people to join will get access to better onboarding and offboarding for free today and early access to future product updates.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>October 10, 2023 Update: By request of our customers, we're now sharing a sample PowerShell script that we've been using at Microsoft to replace Azure AD naming in documentation or content. Get the <a title="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad">Azure AD rename code sample on Microsoft Learn</a> and edit it according to your needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rename of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to Microsoft Entra ID is now rolling across content and product experiences from Microsoft, as per the implementation timeline outlined in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/azure-ad-is-becoming-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/2520436">Azure AD rename announcement on July 11th</a>. We expect the majority of text updates to be completed by mid-November of this year, and updates for on-premises software to be completed in 2024. Partners, analysts, and influencers have also started using the Microsoft Entra ID name in place of Azure AD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the new product name and the icon appearing in Microsoft Azure, Azure Marketplace, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Security admin centers, you’ll also see the service plan (SKU) display names update to Microsoft Entra ID Free, Microsoft Entra ID P1, and Microsoft Entra ID P2 on October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As previously announced, this is just a new name, with no impact on deployments or daily work, and no changes to capabilities, licensing, terms of service, or support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the feedback that we’ve received from many of you – our customers and partners throughout this transition. If you are considering an update to your own documentation or experiences to reflect the Microsoft Entra naming, we now have created resources to assist you. I’ll also clarify more details about the rename based on questions from this community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Resources for updating the Azure AD name in your content 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the name change is rolling out widely, your organization may be interested in updating the Azure AD name accurately in documentation or content. We’re now sharing our internal best practices, tools, and tips in the docs article <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad">“How to rename Azure AD” on Microsoft Learn</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This "how-to” playbook is designed to help you change the name as needed across your organization’s content. It includes best practices for finding and updating Azure AD text strings and graphic icons. Another important reference is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name">"New name for Azure Active Directory" on Microsoft Learn</a>, which includes a style guide, a comprehensive glossary of updated product and feature naming, the short list of exceptions to the rename, downloads of the new product icons, and a timeline for key milestones for Microsoft implementation of the name change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope it helps you scope and plan your updates in accordance with your own processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s address some questions from the community:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, admins can use the Azure portal to manage Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support the ability to manage Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal for customers who prefer Azure portal or only need a subset of Microsoft Entra capabilities, similar to identity experiences available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The navigation changes in the Azure portal are minimal, and we’ll continue the messages that Microsoft Entra ID is formerly known as Azure AD for an extended time to ensure discoverability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all customers to explore the comprehensive <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> but will maintain the ability to manage relevant identity experiences within the existing portals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, on-premises identities are still supported with Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support and enhance <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/identity-and-access">Windows Server Active Directory</a> for on-premises identity and access management and the connection to Azure and other clouds, as many organizations continue to rely on this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name for Active Directory remains unchanged. Based on extensive feedback we've received about Microsoft Entra ID as the new name for Azure Active Directory, for many customers, the rename will help to better differentiate between the on-premises (Active Directory) and multicloud identity (Microsoft Entra ID) solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, identity developer and devops experiences aren't being renamed 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the transition seamless, all existing login URLs, APIs, PowerShell cmdlets, and Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) stay the same, as do developer experiences and tooling. See details at: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name#whats-changing-for-identity-developer-and-devops-experience">What's changing for identity developer and devops experience? - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many technical components either have low visibility to customers (for example, sign-in URLs), or usually aren't branded, like APIs. For example, here’s how the API for Microsoft Entra Conditional Access (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access) shows up in Microsoft Graph:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "conditions": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessConditionSet"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "createdDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "displayName": "String",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "grantControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessGrantControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "id": "String (identifier)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "modifiedDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "sessionControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessSessionControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "state": "string"&nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0">conditionalAccessPolicy resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets are not being renamed. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we offer two PowerShell modules for administering identity tasks: the Azure AD PowerShell module, which is planned for deprecation in March 2024, and the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Azure AD PowerShell for Graph module, “AzureAD” is in the name of almost all <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0">Azure AD cmdlets</a>. These won’t be changing, and you can continue to use these same cmdlets now that the official product name is Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, my colleague Kristopher Bash from the Microsoft Graph team published an <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">update on the Azure AD Graph retirement and Azure AD PowerShell module deprecation</a>. Both are on multi-year retirement cycles to allow for customer migration to Microsoft Graph technologies, and Kristopher’s article clarifies the timing and customer resources, plus our commitment to work with you during the migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deprecation date for Azure AD PowerShell is planned for March 30, 2024. It will continue to work after that date, but support will be limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to start trying Microsoft Graph PowerShell as the recommended module for interacting with Microsoft Entra ID in the future. Based on your feedback, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/migration-faq?view=azureadps-2.0#what-is-microsoft-doing-about-the-gaps-in-functionality-between-azure-ad-and-microsoft-graph-powershell-modules">we’re continuing to add functionality for managing Microsoft Entra ID with Microsoft Graph PowerShell</a> to ensure a seamless transition when you decide to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/migration-steps?view=graph-powershell-1.0">migrate</a> from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, Microsoft continues to support Azure AD B2C 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As announced previously, the name Azure AD B2C is not changing, nor is our commitment to the service and our customers. The service level agreement for Azure AD B2C remains unchanged, and we’ll continue investments to ensure security, availability, and reliability in both <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a>, as well as our next-generation solution for external identities, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/overview-customers-ciam">Microsoft Entra External ID</a>, now in public preview. You can learn more about getting started with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/quickstart-trial-setup">External ID</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a> in our documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Focusing on secure access for everyone, everywhere 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renaming of Azure AD represents a shift in how the identity and access management landscape has changed over time. You’ve gone from managing identities behind a firewall to fully enabling a complex fabric of trusted interactions so people can securely collaborate and be productive, while being increasingly under threat from attackers. Traditional identity and access management services aren’t enough anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe the Microsoft Entra ID name more accurately represents the multicloud and multiplatform functionality of the product, alleviates any confusion with the on-premises identity solution Active Directory, and creates a path to deliver a simpler way to protect every identity and secure every access point as we expand the Microsoft Entra identity and network access portfolio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of where the family name of Microsoft Entra helps clarify functionality is Microsoft Entra <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview">Conditional Access</a> (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access). Conditional Access policies can now be consistently enforced and shared across identity and new security service edge (SSE) products:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/concept-universal-conditional-access">controls expanding to network traffic</a> — not just cloud applications — and policies based on traffic profiles — not just applications or actions — this cross-product feature now uses the unified identity and network access name: Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to innovate and expand our portfolio as digital environments expand, and access points become more diverse, so our customers can protect any access point with a holistic solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, all you need to remember is that the most comprehensive approach for securing access is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>“Organisation identity is a parallel and just as valuable identity type as individual identity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>At IDM Europe 2023 in October Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, presented the facet of identity management that’s often overlooked – Organisational Identity. In this session overview, we delve into the importance of organisation identity, its impact, and how it’s poised to transform the digital landscape. Alternatively, watch the full 15-minute presentation in the video below.</p>
<p></p>
 The Significance of Organisational Identity 
<p>Individual identity has thus far taken the forefront in discussions about digital security. However, organisation identity is an equally valuable aspect of the broader identity landscape. To grasp this concept, it’s crucial to understand what organisational identity encompasses.</p>
 Defining Organisational Identity 
<p>Organisations come in various forms and structures, from social groups and families to contractual entities and legal corporations. Just as there are assurance levels associated with individual identities, the same holds true for organisation identities, ranging from low to high assurance levels. This is where the distinction between low assurance organisation identities, such as social groups, and high assurance ones, like legal entities, becomes evident.</p>
<p></p>
 Case Studies: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly 
<p>The significance of organisation identity is illustrated through a series of case studies.</p>
 The Good: 
<p>In an example from Ubisecure’s <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="Finnish government case study">Finnish government case study</a>, the combination of individual and organisational identities resulted in remarkable cost savings. By allowing organisation identities to be represented by highly assured individuals, the Tax Office achieved cost savings of 99%. This real-world case shows how organisation identity can lead to substantial financial benefits.</p>
 The Bad: 
<p>The vulnerability of organisation identity became apparent when Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter (or X as it’s known this week) led to the removal of verified organisation accounts. Fake accounts naturally emerged. Due to a tweet from a fake Eli Lilly account claiming false information, Eli Lilly saw a &gt;4% drop in the stock price.</p>
 The Ugly: 
<p>The 2008 financial crisis was partly driven by the complex world of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The interconnection of organisations within this financial web led to a catastrophic market collapse when triggered, serving as a stark reminder of the importance of transparent and accountable organisation identity in complex financial ecosystems.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) – A Key to Organisation Identity? 
<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) plays a central role in organisation identity. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by the Financial Stability Board, the LEI identifies legal entities and their ownership structures. As a globally recognised, highly assured organisation identity, the G20 and World Trade Organisation (WTO) support the LEI as a solution to the complexities of modern financial markets.</p>
 The Road to Widespread LEI Adoption 
<p>The adoption of the LEI is steadily growing, with a target of 20 million LEIs by 2027 set by the G20. This critical mass will promote its use across various industries and use cases. Several driving forces are pushing for the broader adoption of organisation identities, including the WTO’s focus on cross-border digital payments, changing regulations for electronic trade documents, and the integration of LEIs into financial transactions.</p>
 The Future of Digital Identity: Context Matters 
<p>Ubisecure’s vision for the future of digital identity management involves connecting highly assured organisation identities with strongly authenticated individual identities. This synergy allows us to understand who an individual is, whom they represent, and the rights and responsibilities associated with different contexts. The context in which identity operates is paramount, as it determines what an individual or organisation can do within a specific setting.</p>
<p>This session sheds light on the growing trend towards effective organisation identity and the critical role it plays in financial markets, security, and digital transactions. As we look to the future of digital identity management, the synergy between individual and organisation identities becomes increasingly vital.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>There are rare individuals who carve out spaces of brilliance wherever they tread. Vittorio Bertocci was one of those souls; a luminary whose impact resonated not only in the corridors of professional seminars but in the hearts of those fortunate to know him personally. Today, we mourn the loss of Vittorio, who, after a fierce battle with cancer, left a void that words alone cannot fill.</p>
<p>The European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference (EIC) was one of the many platforms where Vittorio shone brightly. With every keynote he delivered, his fervor for the Digital ID realm was palpable. He was not just a speaker who would deliver a rehearsed lecture. No, Vittorio was an artist, painting vivid tapestries of innovation, possibilities, and a future filled with secure digital identities.</p>
<p>Our whole team at KuppingerCole was privy to his genius, but more importantly, to his spirit. Every collaboration was a fusion of knowledge, passion, and a genuine desire to make a difference. That's who Vittorio was—a catalyst for change, a beacon for progress.</p>
<p>On a personal note, my friendship with Vittorio was one of those blessings. His laughter was infectious, his counsel invaluable, and his presence reassuring. In a world that often felt like an echo chamber of repetitive ideas, Vittorio’s voice was distinct—an Italian melody of originality and deep insight. Our conversations, be it on the latest trends in digital identity or simply recounting anecdotes from his home in Genova, were treasures.</p>
<p>But what truly made Vittorio stand out was his ability to connect on a human level. He wasn't just a technical maestro. He was compassionate, understanding, and had this uncanny knack to make anyone feel seen and heard. In the midst of conferences bustling with professionals, it was not uncommon to see Vittorio in deep conversation with a newcomer, instilling confidence and sharing wisdom.</p>
<p>The sorrow we feel is deep, not just as friends who will miss those enlightening chats over coffee but as a member of the Digital ID community. We've lost a guiding star. Vittorio's innovations weren't just about the next best product or solution; they were about creating a world where our digital selves were protected, honored, and seamlessly integrated into our real lives. His visions for the future were grand, yet grounded in an intimate understanding of the present.</p>
<p>Cancer may have taken Vittorio from us, but his legacy remains indelible. Every keynote, every workshop, every casual chat at the conference coffee stand is a testament to the man who believed in a digitally secure future and poured his soul into making it a reality.</p>
<p>It's often said that the brightest stars burn half as long, and perhaps that's true. Vittorio's light shone intensely, illuminating paths, sparking ideas, and warming hearts. In his absence, it's up to us to ensure that the trails he blazed are not left in darkness. Let's honor him by being torchbearers of his vision, and by embodying the same passion, dedication, and warmth that Vittorio exuded every day.</p>
<p>For now, as we grapple with this profound loss, let's remember Vittorio for the force of nature he was. Let's recount stories that made us laugh, lessons that spurred us forward, and moments when his sheer presence made everything seem right.</p>
<p>To Vittorio - the maestro, the mentor, the friend. Your journey may have ended, but your symphony plays on in the hearts and minds of everyone you touched.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, dear friend. You are deeply missed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let`s keep on celebrating the enduring impact of Vittorio Bertocci's work. Therefore, we are making all of Vittorio’s talks at the European Identity and Cloud Conference publicly available. Watch them, they are worth every single minute.</p>

<p>How do you create a community around a protocol?</p><p>That was the challenge Daniel Norman, developer advocate for <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, faced. Daniel was not new to the field. Before working for Protocol Labs, he was a developer advocate at Prisma and a Web3 engineer at Aragon. Prior to entering the P2P and distributed systems space, Daniel worked in SaSS and, therefore, was aware of the questions and challenges Web2 developers would face transitioning into Web3. </p><p>He needed to provide resources to developers so they could be successful. These resources had to be engaging and scalable, where developers could learn key concepts and achieve something. Maybe they spin up an app or install IPFS on their computer - whatever it is, they must walk away with a sense of accomplishment.</p> Building a Demo App <p>With this in mind, Daniel created a <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/universal-connectivity">demo chat app</a> that utilized <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>. Libp2p provides the foundational networking infrastructure and protocols that enable IPFS nodes to communicate, discover each other, and form a decentralized and resilient network for sharing and distributing content. A chat demo is the perfect project for explaining how IPFS works when sending information to other nodes in the network.</p><p>The demo was beginner-friendly and implemented the most <a href="https://connectivity.libp2p.io/">novel transport protocols</a> at the time compared to other example apps. Libp2p is used in many ecosystems beyond IPFS, including Ethereum, Filecoin, Cosmos, and Polkadot, so developers who might have been familiar with another ecosystem were able to transition nicely into IPFS through this exercise. As a result, the demo was a successful tool for both Web2 and Web3 devs alike. </p> Awesome IPFS <p>Today's IPFS ecosystem is vast, with hundreds of projects building on the protocol. And like any good ecosystem, it needs cultivating. Daniel views himself as a gardener in the IPFS ecosystem - there to keep it healthy and thriving. He does this through demos, as previously mentioned, and through shooting videos, hosting events, building relationships, and developing written resources. </p><p>One of those written resources is <a href="https://awesome.ipfs.tech/?utm_content=265643364&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-3030006159">Awesome IPFS</a>. Awesome IPFS is a community-generated collection of projects, tools, implementations, services, platforms, and more, all built on the IPFS protocol. Daniel is one of the key maintainers (another is Fission's CEO and Founder, Boris Mann!) and helps ensure that the repo is up-to-date. </p>   Challenges in Cultivating a Community <p>While these resources are great for introducing developers to IPFS, they take time and energy to maintain. For example, inactive projects must be removed from the list and dependencies monitored so that the IPFS Awesome resource remains useful. </p><p>There need to be fair guidelines for platforming and showcasing projects so that both existing and new projects get fair and equal access to marketing opportunities. </p><p>Working with multiple companies, organizations, and people is also key, as diversity only strengthens the ecosystem. It's important that everyone feels heard and empowered to contribute.</p> Key Takeaways <p>If you're interested in building a community around your tech product, here are some key tips that Daniel has learned over the years:</p>  Be honest and transparent. Don't over-promise or mislead interested parties.  Avoid too much technical jargon. People don't have the time or energy to sort through all of that when first being introduced to your project.  Don't create a closed community. Ensure everyone feels welcome and make contributing and asking questions easy and enjoyable.  Clearly communicate, especially in your writing. Most people are not native English speakers, so keep your writing concise and accessible.  <p>Learn more about IPFS by joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/ipfs">IPFS Discord</a> community.

<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts recently found itself in the midst of a major cybersecurity incident that not only crippled its operations but also exposed sensitive customer data. The sophisticated attack orchestrated by a group known as Scattered Spider employed social engineering to the IT department to reset credentials. The attackers then gained access to the SSO, raised their identity credentials to super user level and then systematically got into other systems.</p> 
<p>The cyberattack cost MGM over $100 million according to its <a href="http://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000119312523251667/d461062d8k.htm">FORM 8-K filing</a> with the SEC.</p> 
<p>While the attack chain involved multiple steps, exploiting several points of failure, the initial attack vector was low tech and all too common. We look at what happened and how organizations can protect themselves from these increasingly prevalent attacks.</p> 
 Anatomy of the Attack: Unraveling Scattered Spider's Web  
<p>On September 11, MGM Resorts announced a "cybersecurity issue" affecting its systems, prompting a shutdown to protect data integrity. Reports surfaced that essential services, from hotel room access to slot machines, were offline, leading to resort staff shifting to manual processes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It wasn't until October 5 that the true extent of the breach came to light. Personally identifiable&nbsp; information (PII), had been compromised. This same information was encrypted and a ransomware demand was made.</p> 
<p>Scattered Spider, the group claiming responsibility (the same group involved in breaching Clorox), demonstrated a proficiency in social engineering, specializing in voice phishing, or "vishing" — exploiting human vulnerability through convincing phone calls. The hackers allegedly gained access to MGM's systems by impersonating an employee. Utilizing publicly available information found on LinkedIn and other social platforms, they targeted the IT help desk, manipulating their way into obtaining credentials. The attackers utilized ransomware-as-a-service to encrypt MGM's data.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Key Lessons  
<p>This incident underscores the vulnerability of even well-established organizations to social engineering and identity-related attacks. Most IT services desks/help desks are short-staffed, and dealing with large volumes of calls, many of which are related to password or MFA issues. In the case of MGM Resorts, the attackers exploited human nature and publicly available information to trick IT service desk personnel and gain the credentials necessary to simply login as a legitimate employee. From there they were able to breach multiple systems and gain command and control of the entire organization.</p> 
 Identity Assurance for the Entire Identity Lifecycle  
<p>Human nature will always be the weakest point in any system — the 2023 Verizon DBIR found the human element to be a factor in 74% of all breaches. The MGM attack underscores the need for a comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> approach that secures the modern user lifecycle and addresses the Achilles heel of current authentication and identity verification processes. Organizations need to ensure they can trust that somebody is who they claim to be at all times — when that call to the service desk comes through, the staff responding must be absolutely certain that the person they are speaking to is the legitimate holder of that identity. If, for example, they request access through a new device or credential reset, there must be a secure, efficient way to do so.</p> 
<p>A complete Identity Assurance approach unites strong passkey-based authentication, continuous risk monitoring and intelligent identity verification into a comprehensive solution.&nbsp;</p> 
 Passwordless Authentication  
<p>Deploying passwordless, phishing resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds a crucial layer of security. Eliminating traditional passwords and adopting <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwordless authentication methods</a>, such as biometrics, security tokens, or mobile-based authentication, could have thwarted the MGM attackers. Passwords are often the weakest link, and removing them from the equation reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p> 
 Continuous Risk Monitoring  
<p>Threat vectors and risk levels change constantly. Risk signals and telemetry from a broad variety of sources must be continuously monitored and used to trigger appropriate authentication and verification actions. These should include various device and browser signals, user behavior anomalies and information from the broader security ecosystem.</p> 
 Identity Verification  
<p>Simply put, identity verification helps ensure that someone is who they say they are at all times. It can eliminate many of the social engineering tactics currently being used. It should meet the unique needs of the population in question whether workforce or consumer. This requires a multi-verification approach that includes but is not limited to AI, chat, video, face recognition and other cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and secure method of confirming the individuals’ identities — and re-verifying them at critical moments in time. This would eliminate the vishing attack vector which is based on implied and unreliable trust without a specific and comprehensive verification methodology.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here’s an example of intelligent identity verification in action:</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
 Protecting Against Helpdesk Social Engineering and Other Identity Attacks  
<p>The MGM Resorts cyber incident serves as a stark reminder that no organization is immune to cyber threats, regardless of its size or industry. As cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, it is imperative for businesses to stay ahead by implementing advanced security measures. Identity verification and passwordless authentication can stand as formidable defense against social engineering and other identity-related attacks, providing a robust protection for organizations, their systems, and their data. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform">HYPR Identity Assurance</a> protects the entire lifecycle and includes HYPR Affirm, the only <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification solution</a> designed specifically for the workforce.

				  Verifiable credentials allow you to cryptographically verify who issued information, and they allow you to know if that information has been tampered with. But what does this mean in a practical sense?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Recently our team was asked a question that we encounter, in different forms, all the time: “Well, what can we do with verifiable credentials?” Or, “Why would we want them?” The answer is so broad that we, typically, narrow it down by industry and offer some examples that make sense for that particular customer.</p>
<p>But really the answer is quite simple:</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to cryptographically verify who issued data, and they allow you to know if that data has been changed or tampered with.</p>
<p>In practical terms this means that, assuming the data has not been changed, you can trust the data as much as you trust the source. Once you have data that you know has not been altered, from a source you trust, the possibilities are close to endless, and our team had some fun contributing a — by no means exhaustive — list of examples of how you can use this technology across industries.</p>
 In the Public Sector 
<p>Replace your passwords with credentials<br>Unlike passwords, credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied, and don’t require your employees to remember them.</p>
<p>Access management<br>Both physical and digital access management can be done through credentials for enhanced security — and unlike access cards, credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied.</p>
<p>Manage social and welfare programs<br>By issuing each citizen a credential you can reduce fraud in aid / benefits applications.</p>
<p>Employment authorization<br>Ensure that applicants are eligible to work.</p>
<p>Manage travel<br>Verifiable credentials can replace passports and offer a faster, more secure way to cross borders.</p>
<p>Replace driver’s licenses<br>These licenses would be impossible to fake and offer a fast way to provide only the identity information necessary when needed.</p>
<p>Replace important personal documents<br>Marriage licenses, death certificates, social security information could all be digitized and more secure than a paper document that can be lost or damaged.</p>
<p>Proof of residency<br>By using credentials you could automate parts of the residency process and quickly verify status.</p>
<p>First responder credentials<br>Quickly ensure only authorized personnel are allowed access to emergency areas.</p>
<p>Replacement permits<br>Digitizing permits would speed up the process for checking that they are up to date and could notify holders when they are about to expire and need to be renewed.</p>
<p>Professional licenses<br>Know for certain that your doctor or lawyer is licensed, and allow the end customer to verify their credentials for themselves.</p>
<p>Certifications<br>Keep your certifications up to date and easily share them, as opposed to keeping them safe in a box somewhere.</p>
<p>Manage age restricted substances<br>By sharing identification through a credential you can be more confident that only people that are old enough are buying restricted products.</p>
 Healthcare 
<p>Access management<br>Better track who has access to what areas / controlled substances.</p>
<p>Patient health data<br>Remove the need for contacting a third party for medical history, have patients hold it themselves securely on a credential or be able to provide consent for other providers to access it.</p>
<p>Store insurance information<br>No more paper cards that can be lost or forgotten; instead, hold quickly transferable information in a credential.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>No more storing private patient information at the hospital, making it a target for bad actors. All personal identifying data should be stored with the patient, removing the need for storing or deleting data in a regulatory compliant way.</p>
<p>Enhance security<br>Verifiable credentials will let you know if their information has been copied, meaning even if they are obtained by bad actors they cannot use them without the system knowing and denying access.</p>
<p>Data sharing<br>The patient can choose to securely share only the data they deem necessary with the healthcare provider.</p>
 Travel and hospitality 
<p>Use a Digital Travel Credential<br>Scan and transform your passport into a verifiable credential (with liveness and biometric assurance) for check in and border crossing.</p>
<p>Manage check-in<br>Customers can pre fill out any information needed for their stay, recurring only a quick scan at the front desk to check in at a hotel or potentially just issuing digital room keys without a check in.</p>
<p>Digital room keys<br>Securely issue and revoke room keys directly to customers, reducing time spent at the front desk.</p>
<p>Store tickets on a credential<br>You can manage your airport experience through a credential, storing boarding pass info, passport info, and visa details in a way that is easily shareable.</p>
<p>Manage loyalty programs<br>Verified loyalty program holders can be offered special deals, quick and easy lounge access and more.</p>
<p>Reduce fraud<br>Credentials will immediately alert you if any information presented is fraudulent.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>Remove the need to store any customer information locally, which also removes the need to delete it in a regulatory compliant way.</p>
<p>Reduce the stress of travel<br>When traveling is easy and everything a traveler needs is accessible through one place on their phone they are more likely to do it more.</p>
<p>Reduce lines<br>A quick scan keeps the line moving much faster than a person checking every ID and document.</p>
 Financial services 
<p>Reduce fraud<br>Use verifiable credentials for frictionless, mutual authentication before any data is shared. A bank is able to cryptographically authenticate that it is interacting with a real account holder, and the account holder is able to authenticate that he or she is interacting with their bank.</p>
<p>Reuse KYC information<br>Credentials can be configured to store the information required for more complex financial transactions and a KYC credential is a way for a bank or its partners to reuse and share this information. If a third party trusts the original bank’s KYC process, they can trust the veracity of the KYC credential.</p>
<p>Provide more secure customer access<br>The customer can securely access their account without a username or password.</p>
<p>Use as a credit card<br>Credit card information can be put into a verifiable credential; virtual CC numbers can be used; temporary cards for one-time use can be issued as a credential.</p>
<p>Reduce the time necessary for larger transactions<br>Credentials remove the need to contact third parties to verify funds.</p>
<p>Data sharing<br>Know that any data shared with or between your team can be trusted.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>The customer can choose to disclose only the information necessary for a transaction, removing the need to securely store or delete customer information.</p>
 Retail 
<p>Track the origins of products<br>A verifiable credential can track a product back to who created it and let you know if something is a knock-off.</p>
<p>Provide better customer retention programs<br>Customer credentials allow you to better know who is shopping with you or visiting your store.</p>
<p>Employee management<br>Easily set which employees can access certain areas, manage payroll, or time clocks.</p>
<p>Mitigate chargeback fraud<br>Require pre-authorization of payments through verifiable credentials</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>No need to store customer personal data in a regulatory compliant way, they will store it locally on their credential.</p>
 Education 
<p>Student awards and certificates<br>Quickly issue and securely store any awards a student receives from the school.</p>
<p>Student access management<br>Easily issue or revoke access to buildings or digital assets.</p>
<p>Diplomas<br>Issue verifiable certificates of completion that can be quickly shared with prospective employers, removing the need to contact the school.</p>
<p>School issued permits<br>Quickly issue and check parking permits, bike permits, and residential permits etc.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>Unlike passwords or keys these credentials can’t be misplaced, stolen, or copied, so you can be more confident that only students have access to school areas.</p>
<p>Reduce student stress<br>You can store all the classes a student has completed on a credential, streamlining the process for knowing which classes they are eligible to take next.</p>
<p>Faster data sharing<br>All the data a student accumulates through the education process can be stored on one credential, removing the need to look back through paper records.</p>
<p>As you can see this list very quickly stretches on — and we only briefly covered 6 industries! To oversimplify, if you would like to be able to immediately act on your data, reduce the liability of storing customer information, and have more confidence in your security, it may be time to look into verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>If you’re on the fence, or have questions about the technology our team would be happy to talk you through some options applicable to your organization. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch here.</a></p>

<p>In the latest episode of the State of Identity podcast, host Cameron D’Ambrosi is joined by Gadalia&nbsp; Montoya Weinberg O’Brian, an ex-NSA crypto mathematician and the Founder/CEO of Dapple Security. Learn about Gadalia’s remarkable journey from the National Security Agency to the forefront of identity-focused cybersecurity. Learn about the limitations of current passwordless approaches, particularly in scenarios involving lost or stolen devices, and delve into the crucial distinction between authenticating the user behind the device rather than the device itself. Gadalia introduces Dapple Security’s unique solution, which involves generating an on-demand passkey using a user’s fingerprint—emphasizing the company’s commitment to user privacy by avoiding the storage of biometrics on the device or in the cloud—and how this approach is a key element in enhancing overall security posture.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>What is generative AI? This week Russ Cohn, from IDVerse has joined us to discuss generative AI and deepfakes and the threat this imposes on businesses and consumers for their digital identities. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, Generative Artificial Intelligence is a topic that has been, I believe on most of our radars in the last 12 months, particularly. And there are amazing things going on. But also, we know that the bad guys are also using those tools. And one of those is related to deepfakes that are being used to cheat the identity verification system having existing until now.</p>
<p>So, to see how we are going to solve those problems in identity verification, these newer problems, we have a special guest today who is Russ Cohn. He is the go-to market for IDVerse, a company which provides online identification technology for businesses in the digital economy.</p>
<p>Russ has spent more than 20 years scaling businesses of all sizes by delivering successful growth strategies across the UK, EMEA, and US markets, within fast-paced and high-growth online media, fraud, identity, SaaS, e-commerce, and data-driven technology solutions. His strong tech knowledge is coupled with deep operational and commercial experience building things with SaaS, advertising and marketing technology driven revenue models.</p>
<p>Hello, Russ.</p>
<p>Russ Cohn: Hello, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Happy to have you here.</p>
<p>Russ: Thank you. Very glad to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. It’s great to have you here. And we’ll talk about the deepfakes and how the newest practices in identity verification are solving these problems. So, let’s start, let’s talk about digital identity, Russ.</p>
<p>So first of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, your story. Tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Russ: Absolutely. I am fairly new to identity. I’ve only really started in the industry probably just over three years ago. I was the first international employee of OCR Labs, which is we recently rebranded to IDVerse, but I joined about three years ago. We’ve since then built the international team to over half the company, and we continue to grow in EMEA and the US.</p>
<p>As a background, I’m a marketer, a commercial leader, investor. I’ve spent probably over 20 years in technology-driven companies of all sizes. And I was lucky enough to join Google very early on, and there were 20 people in the UK, and 600 people around the world. And I grew up with them a little bit, and I left there with 65,000 people. So, I’ve got a fairly good experience at scanning companies and have invested and advised companies since then.</p>
<p>I’m now, as I said at IDVerse. And I’m focused on the go-to market. So, helping them globally, to take our products and execute them in the best possible areas and help our customers with the most cutting-edge technology to drive identity verification, make it effortless. Obviously, through the use of our sophisticated technologies and techniques, including Generative AI.</p>
<p>I’m excited about the opportunity for identity verification, as the need for verified trusted identities has grown exponentially, globally, really, since the pandemic. And with digital growing at such a phenomenal rate as well, we’re now living in a mobile-first world, and we need the right kind of identity verification to support that growth.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, let’s go to some basics. For someone who has heard about that term, Generative AI and still is not so clear what it is, particularly. Could you tell us what is that? What is Generative AI?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, sure, I think, you know, everybody is talking about ChatGPT and Bard and it’s brought these techniques, the AI techniques to the public, and we can’t get enough of them. But everyone is using ChatGPT and Bard, etc to learn more, do their jobs better, find new facts. It’s pretty addictive and very, very useful but still at the at the fairly early stage.</p>
<p>So Generative AI, short for Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems and techniques that focus on generating new content or data rather than simply recognising patterns or making decisions based on existing data. Now these systems are designed to create original content that resembles human created data such as images, music, texts, videos, and more.</p>
<p>I use Spotify extensively. I’m sure most people do. And I’ve got an AI system on there now a couple months ago that’s going through my music catalogue in my background and choosing the right music based on my tastes. Generative AI models are generally trained on large datasets, and they learn to understand the underlying patterns and structures within the data.</p>
<p>So once trained, they can produce new examples that are similar to the data they were exposed to during their training. These models are capable of generating content that didn’t exist in the original dataset, making them a very powerful tool for creative tasks in content creation. Now at IDVerse, we’ve been doing Generative AI for a long time, probably since the start, seven or eight years ago.</p>
<p>And we use a technique, a very familiar technique called Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, I’m sure a lot of your audience will be familiar with. Now GANs, just to go back to basics, consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. These are trained together in a competitive manner. The generator creates the synthetic data, and the discriminative task is to differentiate between the real and the generated data.</p>
<p>So, the competition between the two networks leads to the generation of increasingly realistic content, which we see everywhere in videos, photos, documents, et cetera. Now, we’ve trained millions of synthetic and real documents and millions and millions of synthetic faces using these techniques. For us, just to be clear, we only use ethically sourced or fair source data for face biometric, particularly in the training. This refers to the facial recognition datasets collected and used in a manner that upholds strict ethical standards and respects individual’s privacy, consent and fairness.</p>
<p>Such data is obtained transparently with informed consent, minimal intrusion and efforts to mitigate bias. So, these measures ensure the responsible and equitable use of biometric technology. In the context of facial identity verification, training data refers to the specialised datasets of facial images used to train the machine learning algorithm, or deep neural networks that are responsible for recognising and verifying individual’s identities based on their facial features.</p>
<p>So that’s quite a mouthful. Hopefully, that gives you some context. But this is how we look at Generative AI in identity verification.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you for that introduction. Of course, in one of the products of this type of Generative AI, in related tools are deepfakes that we are seeing more often, sometimes we saw that only for, like, say celebrities or famous people. But now, they can be used to attack me or to attack you, actually anybody right?</p>
<p>So, tell us how the use of deepfakes is a threat, a real threat for both consumers and businesses?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, absolutely. I think they are a massive threat as the rise of Gen AI, and you touched on it, &nbsp;fraudsters use the same if not better techniques than we do, or many companies do. And they are very, very good at surging ahead of these technologies and finding ways to create very realistic synthetic identities to both impersonate real people, as well as to create brand new identities of people who actually don’t even exist in real life.</p>
<p>And so, while that’s exciting as we talk about Web3 and avatars and these opportunities and possibilities, I think both consumers and businesses will continue to fall victim to many of the risks out there, unless measures are taken to prevent this.</p>
<p>Now, I just want to highlight a couple of examples of these like disinformation and fake news, right? So, creating videos of public figures, you can grab off Facebook or YouTube, and replicate those and make them do things that they never did. That can be exploited to spread false information.</p>
<p>This can incite conflicts and it can really manipulate public opinion. For us, we see and obviously, we’re very close to and care a lot about frauds and scams, so businesses and consumers of course, can – in the UK particularly we have a huge fraud problem. And we see a lot of deepfake base scams that can impersonate company executives, trusted individuals, they can deceive employees or the customers who can make them reveal sensitive information for financial transactions.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some of that just recently with MGM in the US in this recent breach. We don’t know it exactly, but we do know, I think somebody, an employee was actually targeted. This can cause you know I think like reputation damage of people, you know, politicians, businesses and people, fake videos and audio can be created. To endorse a product or not support it and that can create problems. And of course, the things we care about a lot of, identity theft, right?</p>
<p>And deepfakes can be used to impersonate individuals leading to identity theft. This may result in unauthorised access to personal data or systems. And of course, manipulation in financial markets, personal bank accounts, breaches of banks. So, this can cause big issues like privacy concerns, security threats and erosion of trust, through the wide use of this, and internal security problems for businesses, and privacy for people when they violated, and their identities are stolen.</p>
<p>So, it’s very, very important that we understand these threats and start to mitigate and create ways of helping to support and stop these practices.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you already explained some cases in which these criminals are already targeting the identification system that has been existing in the last years. If we focus on these services that are today and have been protecting us or helping us in identifying people in the last years. So, what are these – the biggest pain points or the weaknesses that they are being attacked by these criminals?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, I mean, there’s a lot of weakness in existing systems, which can come across in the fact that vendors don’t disclose, for example, that they don’t use their own technology, and they can’t always deliver on their promises. So, I think a lack of global document coverage, old style techniques like templating exclusion, like racial bias, gender and age in these poorly designed systems can cause huge problems. And systems that don’t have the ability to understand where these attacks are coming from with these synthetic IDs.</p>
<p>We create all of our own tech in-house. So, we don’t use external vendors to drive our fully automated solutions. So, we feel pretty confident. But they are, as you mentioned, these legacy systems that we’ve relied on, that aren’t necessarily up to speed. We’ve seen, from a pain point of view, is badly trained human spotters in remote locations, for example. So, some people in the industry and vendors use those, this can cause slow response times, and they can’t keep up with the standards and the technology that’s being used to identify fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>And also, the biometrics of people that are not real. So, it’s very difficult for them to keep up. And then, we’ve seen an issue around a lot of bias or differentials in the natural bias that’s in previous ID systems designed by, traditionally older white male engineers. And that’s a problem because these biases are built into these systems. And the humans who are evaluating physical documents, depending on where and how and what can inflict their own biases on age, gender, and race as well.</p>
<p>Now, this can slow down experiences for customers, as they take a lot longer. And of course, they aren’t as accurate, you know, humans can’t scale. And so, technology can do a lot of that heavy lifting, and can solve a lot of that. And you can still have humans for critical tasks, but it’s important that you use technology to identify these gaps.</p>
<p>In fact, we ran a study a few months ago with an external testing company called BixeLabs of 1500 subjects, male, female and transgender, across eight regions in the world for our facial biometrics. And we came back with zero bias on either race or gender on the facial biometrics. So, it’s pretty important that businesses start to use, and people start to get comfortable with one of the strongest, probably the strongest biometric there is for lots of actions that we do take in our everyday lives, whether it’s on a personal or work basis.</p>
<p>And I think that the other things that are challenging for us in the identity space is we see a lot of unethically sourced based biometrics, right? And that can refer to the acquisition usage or distribution of these, that can violate privacy, I mentioned earlier consent or ethics.</p>
<p>And these practices really can result in privacy infringements, discrimination, social harm and legal issues. And some examples of that are data scraping and profiling, lack of informed consent, data breaches, of course, we’ve seen that recently and frequently, deepfakes as we talked about and manipulation of people, government surveillance, employment discrimination. These are big issues.</p>
<p>And I think the lack of unified government standards around these things is also difficult. And it’s important that people use the latest technologies like computer vision and Generative AI to start, to be able to scale and address some of these issues and keep users and businesses safe going forward. But those are definitely some of the issues that we’ve seen accumulate over the last few years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, I can see there are quite a few. And how these more recent generation of identity verification system that are working together with Generative AI. So, if you can tell us a bit of the how, how they are different to the previous products, and how they are tackling these problems?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, as I expressed in some of the technologies that we use, I mean, training data for Gen AI, for example, if you think of it, if I can frame it in like nutritional labels like food, right? So, you’re feeding a machine, essentially. And so that training data should come with some sort of nutritional label, and to know what the macro nutrients will affect performance. So, you know, it’s important that when using Gen AI, you understand that the nutritional makeup of their training data, supply chain transparency, where do you get their data from, for example.</p>
<p>But it’s important, these techniques are able to detect the proliferation of these fake documents. I think digital identity is becoming more and more, of course, prolific and governments are starting to bring onboard connectivity into these digital identity databases that are able to verify customers in a much more robust way than potentially documents were.</p>
<p>So, I think we’ll see that constant trend of digitisation of technology, mobile-first, wallets, and of course, documentation that will become digital will make life a little bit easier. But, in order to protect themselves, consumers and businesses really need to think about what they can do to stop and be vigilant, right?</p>
<p>So, I think consumers need to educate themselves. They need to use things like password protection and protect their devices and be aware of things like phishing tactics in social media and email. So, we can do as much as we can for businesses, but I think businesses need to invest in these systems because they are stronger, the security measures are stronger, and will help protect them and their customers ultimately.</p>
<p>I think the differences that we see, we believe facial biometrics is a very, very strong and has been proven externally through, you know, NIST iBeta certification, for example, we have a 99.998 certification of liveness biometrics, I mentioned the inclusion and lack of racial bias. If you want to capture and work with people of all races, all genders, all colours across the world, it’s important to use systems that are inclusive, otherwise, you’ll end up discriminating and losing customers.</p>
<p>So, it is important to make these investments into these systems to help protect your business and help protect the consumers behind that. But ultimately, consumers have to also be educated themselves. They have to think about what they’re doing and be aware of things that are out of the ordinary or suspicious, unsolicited requests, for example. And then lastly, I think, you know, government needs to engage in some sort of public dialogue as well to help consumers about understanding what they’re doing in these initiatives.</p>
<p>And government needs to work with business as well to inform the public about things like biometric technology, ethical implications, and why they should be using these. But ultimately, there should be some ethical guidelines and review boards to be able to support the usage of this new technology that’s coming at us at such a pace. It’s really strong, really powerful and really useful.</p>
<p>But there have to be some guardrails around that, and I think it’s going to take a collective effort from consumers, businesses and government to get us there.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned, for instance, a liveness detection that is one of the ways that this identity verification tools are checking that the person is a real person moving in front of the camera. In terms of the end user, so when the end user is in front of this identity verification system that are based on Generative AI, so let’s say user experience is similar, is so how transparent or is different?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, I think, look, with facial recognition, for example, and the techniques we use in identifying people when they’re going through the process of verifying themselves or for account access or re-authentication, no personal data is stored. So, the use of those biometrics is the ability to give people a robust way to prove themselves and their proof of life, if you will, when doing a particular action.</p>
<p>And I think what’s been missing in the past is people have accepted a document which could or could not belong to that person to be the valid form of identity. The reason why identity documents around the world had been the standard is there was always a picture of your face on that document.</p>
<p>So, you had a passport or driver’s license, you could see it was you in a sense. So, with liveness, people are protected the same way as using phones to open up access to your phone and to those systems. But these systems are tested and there is no personal data. People should feel very comfortable that the data that they’re using to generate that action is protected and their own in terms of doing that.</p>
<p>We’re just using technology to be able to verify that that person is live and present, and is not a deepfake, was not a synthetic ID. Because what we see a lot is these presentation attacks when people are using video footage that are grabbed from external sources, for example, to try and fake systems or try and trick systems that they are actually live and present.</p>
<p>But we are able to detect these digital footprints and be able to detect using multiple sources of multiple techniques on the mobile phone that we build software for that that person is live and present and is presenting the document that they say they are in order to verify themselves.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you, for explaining better how it worked for users. So, it’s simple for users. It’s not more complicated.</p>
<p>Russ: Simple and seamless and quick as well. It’s not more complicated. It’s less complicated, in fact, right? So, when you presented with it – there has to be a trust of course in the environment that you’re doing, and then providing your face to do that.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it’s safer and quicker, and ultimately more secure than any sort of biometric that they might have used previously.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s true. You mentioned also faster sometimes I think, being in front of these systems and yeah you are, waiting a little bit in front of the camera, right until it processes.</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, it depends on the speed and the connectivity in the region you’re in, and it might be the phone and your mobile network, for example. But we account for all of that in the software that we design in helping people to process that. So, we shoot like a live stream video, and we take the best shots out of about 100, 120 frames that we shoot out of that video. It’s a very quick two or three second capture, and we’re able to compare the best quality face to the document that’s presented in this process.</p>
<p>Now, we can account for age, facial degradation, loss of hair, glasses, et cetera because we are looking at the underlying structure of someone’s face when doing that. So, we’re 3D mapping essentially that person’s face, and are able to then tell against the original document that’s presented if that person is the same person.</p>
<p>And that you can’t do, it’s very hard to do with humans, for example. And that’s why technology can do a lot of this lifting very, very quickly. We can do it in seconds and verify the person against very old very age documents or changes to their facial structures. And so, we’re very excited about how these techniques can verify people to the grade that I mentioned before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, it sounds like there’s a lot of innovation hearing what you’re talking, you are describing. So, what we say looking at the future, so what is the future of Generative AI in identity verification?</p>
<p>Russ: We were excited about Gen AI’s ability to create these huge datasets of synthetic personas, because it’s going to help prevent fraudsters trying to use this synthetically created people and documents that they create to trick and penetrate low grade systems.</p>
<p>And the more people we can support, the more businesses we can get our technology into, the more we can stop this the synthetic IDs and penetration attacks that are happening. And we’ve seen the velocity of these increase as we see better and better tools and faster processing time to be able to do this.</p>
<p>So, the ability to cover the identities of the world’s population through technology and creating inclusivity for all ethnicities, all genders, means that people can be granted access regardless of where they live, what device they’re using, what colour they are, what gender they are.</p>
<p>So, we’re very excited about how Gen AI can train and help people. And again, this is all ethically sourced data, right? So, we didn’t go and grab it elsewhere. It’s very hard to get in front of tens of millions of faces of variations of age and, again, colour, ethnicity, gender, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, Gen AI really helps us to do that, I think detection tools. So, developing and using advanced technology like Gen AI to detect this deepfake content can be crucial to mitigate the potential harmful effects that might come from that. Authentication mechanisms. So, implementing strong authentication, like facial can help, again, verify the identity of individuals and reduce that risk of impersonation.</p>
<p>So, trust has to be ensured that it’s in place there. And of course, eliminating frauds and scams, so businesses and consumers fall victim to deepfake base scams and others every day.&nbsp; For instance, a scammer can impersonate a company executive, as I said, and deceive employees into revealing sensitive information or maybe making financial transactions.</p>
<p>So, we want to stop fraud at the door. We want to stop fraud internally, externally. And we want to help protect businesses and their customers, whether their business or consumers from the rising threat of what’s coming on synthetic identities and the scale of using Generative AI at the fraudster level.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds good. Final question, for all business leaders that are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, there are a lot to choose from. I think the one action from my opinion, maybe is – you’ve got to think like we’re living in a mobile-first world, right? And Gen AI solutions, as we’ve talked about are surging.</p>
<p>So, the action I would take is take the time to speak to your fellow executives and to the teams and to the people inside your business and understand how identity is currently viewed in your approach to your people, your processes, your security, your products and your customers. Where I sit and where we sit, is we are seeing the velocity increase of identity usage across the world.</p>
<p>Governments are enforcing and implementing more and more identity standards in order to control obviously, governmental services. And so, it’s important that people think about identity for their own businesses. It’s going to become critical to protect them and their customers. They need to think about everything from employee onboarding, how well you know your employee and your customers.</p>
<p>And of course, ultimately, what we’re all achieving, or trying to achieve in digital is improving user experiences, anything from onboarding to account management, to customer services interaction. So, it’s everything that your customer, your employee might touch within your business, potentially has something to do with identity. And the better you know the people in your business and your customers, I think, the better positioned you’re going to be to be able to not only stop these threats but take advantage of beating your competition by staying ahead and knowing your customer much better.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, thank you very much, Russ, for all this very interesting conversation about how Generative AI is going to help us for the identity verification now and in the future.</p>
<p>So, for the ones listening to us who would like to know more about you or get in touch with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Russ: Yes, thank you again, for the time letting me talk about something we, you know, and I’m very passionate about and obviously we’re very passionate about fraud and particularly technology.</p>
<p>If they want to get a hold of me, I’m on LinkedIn, you know, Russ Cohn, C-O-H-N. IDVerse.com has a repository of amazing content and information and thought leadership around a lot of these areas, so please take your time to look across the site. And if you want to get in touch with us, there’s lots of ways to do that on the site.</p>
<p>So, look forward to seeing and speaking with anybody who’s interested in learning more about IDVerse and about – chatting about fraud and identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, thank you very much, Russ. And all the best.</p>
<p>Russ: Thank you, Oscar. Appreciate the time.</p>

  <p>A Zero Trust breach prevention strategy based on user risk is critical for organizations in today's digital landscape. However, managing user risks in hybrid environments has posed several challenges. Today, we’re making it easier to manage user risk in hybrid environments in Microsoft Entra ID Protection (formerly Azure AD Identity Protection) – on-premises password change can now automatically remediate user risk! This feature is now in public preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we recommend mastering password changes in Entra ID to take advantage of Password Protection, hybrid customers who do password changes on-premises found it challenging to enable user risk policies. Users would get blocked when becoming risky and could not self-remediate by resetting passwords on-premises because the password change wasn’t visible to Entra ID, and so couldn’t dismiss the risk. This has resulted in a build-up of users marked at risk who may or may not have changed their passwords on-prem, making it challenging for some customers to take advantage of Entra ID Protection signals, and to leverage risk-based policies to protect their hybrid tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, we’re introducing the new setting called "Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk" in Entra ID Protection. Customers that have Password Hash Synchronization enabled on their tenants can now enable this setting. When enabled, users’ risks will be automatically remediated when their passwords are changed on-premises, and customers can confidently deploy user risk policy to effectively protect their hybrid users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enhancement empowers our customers with two main advantages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Efficient Remediation: With this capability, risky hybrid users can efficiently self-remediate without manual interventions from administrators, reducing the administrative burden. When a password is changed on-premises, user risk will be automatically remediated within Entra ID Protection, bringing the user to a safe state. 
 Proactive Security: Organizations can now proactively deploy user risk policies that require password changes to confidently protect their hybrid users and environments. This proactive approach strengthens your organization's security posture, simplifies security management with access control policies while ensuring that user risks are promptly addressed, even in complex hybrid environments. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable the “Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk” setting today in <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/IdentityProtectionMenuBlade/~/OverviewNew">Identity Protection - Microsoft Entra admin center</a> and visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock">Remediate risks and unblock users in Azure AD Identity Protection</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>A new method for controlling and confirming digital identities is emerging: distributed digital identity (DDI). By removing the need for a single authoritative source, DDI empowers users to take charge of their digital identities and reduces their dependence on centralized structures.</p>
 The Evolution of Identity Verification 
<p>In the tapestry of human history, identity verification methods have constantly evolved, with each era bringing forth innovations to validate one’s credentials. From clay tablets to holographic passports, the quest for foolproof identification is an age-old journey.</p>
<p>Historically, physical documents, such as birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and passports, were the gold standards for verifying identity. These paper-based systems, although practical, were cumbersome, often leading to administrative bottlenecks and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>With technological advancements, the shift was evident. Digital platforms started introducing usernames, passwords, and biometric verifications. This transition streamlined many processes, enabling real-time verifications and instant service access.</p>
<p>Centralized identity systems, while efficient, are susceptible to various vulnerabilities. They create a concentrated data storehouse, becoming a prime target for cyber-attacks. Moreover, these systems often grapple with privacy and data misuse concerns, leading to a growing user mistrust.</p>
<p>As we journeyed from paper-based identifications to more digital counterparts, we encountered both leaps in efficiency and new challenges. Let’s explore the metamorphosis of these systems and the nuances of the digital identity realm.</p>
 Understanding Distributed Systems 
<p>The traditional centralized structures are giving way to more collaborative and decentralized mechanisms. Enter the realm of distributed systems, a paradigm shift revolutionizing the tech landscape.</p>
<p>Distributed systems encompass networked computers, each functioning autonomously. These individual entities communicate and coordinate actions via message-passing mechanisms without relying on a central authority.</p>
<p>On the upside, distributed systems offer inherent fault tolerance, resilience, and decentralization, making them robust against system-wide failures. On the flip side, their decentralized nature can lead to complexities in data reconciliation, and latency might occasionally be an issue due to multiple verification points.</p>
<p>Distributed systems offer a fresh lens through which we can view and process data. With this backdrop, the concept of distributed digital identity starts to take shape, offering a new approach to online identification.</p>
 The Concept of Distributed Digital Identity 
<p>Amid the complex web of digital interactions, there’s a pressing need to ensure the authenticity of identity and its protection. Distributed Digital Identity (DDI) emerges as the answer, combining the strengths of various technological principles.</p>
 How it Works: A Technical Overview: 
<p>Encryption: The bedrock of DDI, encryption ensures that data remains confidential, tamper-proof, and accessible only by the intended recipients. Robust cryptographic methods convert information into codes, decipherable only with the correct keys.</p>
<p>Decentralized Ledgers (Blockchain): As the backbone, blockchains are transparent, immutable data records. Every entry is time-stamped and linked, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized alterations.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer Networks: This structure eradicates the middleman. By enabling direct interactions between parties, it enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and heightens security.</p>
<p>To truly grasp the impact of DDI, one must delve into its core components and how they interweave to create a fortified and user-centric identity system.</p>
<p>Behind the facade of any complex system lie intricate gears and mechanisms. DDI is no different. With its unique jargon and foundational elements, it becomes essential to demystify its terms for a comprehensive understanding.</p>
 
 DID (Decentralized Identifier): This is the digital equivalent of a unique fingerprint in the DDI landscape. Every DID is distinct, assuring pinpoint identity recognition. 
 Verifiable Credentials: These are the digital attestations provided by issuers about a holder. Think of them as digital testimonials attesting to the authenticity of the presented data. 
 Issuer, Holder, and Verifier: A triad that forms the DDI ecosystem, Issuers grant digital credentials; holders, typically users, store and present these credentials, and verifiers authenticate them. 
 
<p>With knowledge about the cornerstone terms of DDI, it becomes imperative to explore the tangible benefits this system offers users and organizations alike.</p>
 Benefits of Distributed Digital Identity 
<p>Pursuing any new technology is driven by the promise of betterment – in efficiency, security, or user experience. This promise manifests in many ways with DDI, benefiting end-users and businesses.</p>
 
 Data Privacy: DDI platforms ensure users have sole control over their data. Data resides in user-controlled digital wallets, which means third parties can’t compromise, even during a data breach. 
 Data Security: Following standards like the W3C DID specifications, DDI ensures that data is decentralized, encrypted, and secure. 
 Secure Sharing: End-to-end encryption is inherent in DDI, ensuring that all data shared is secure and private. 
 Edge/Cloud Agents: This allows users to manage their identities effortlessly, ensuring they don’t need to be continuously online. 
 Verifiable Credentials: Using cryptographic tools like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), DDI systems can verify claims about a person’s identity without revealing the data. 
 
<p>While the advantages of DDI are aplenty, like any pioneering technology, it is full of challenges. As we stride forward, it’s crucial to acknowledge and address the obstacles.</p>
 BlockID’s Digital Identity Compilation: 
<p>The beauty of BlockID’s digital identity system lies in its ability to compile attributes from a diverse range of verifiable sources. This streamlines and accelerates new account registration and ensures that vital information is instantly available, wherever and whenever needed, contingent upon user consent.&nbsp;</p>
 Beyond Traditional Verification: 
<p>Additionally, BlockID recognizes the multifaceted nature of identity. Hence, it’s possible to bolster the authentication process by including other pertinent information. To cite a few examples, educational certificates, and vaccination records can be incorporated into the distributed identifier. This enriches the ID proofing process, rendering it virtually indisputable.</p>
 DDI Implementation with BlockID: 
<p>To provide a more concrete understanding, let’s delve into some real-world applications of the BlockID system:</p>
 
 Employee Onboarding: Firms can seamlessly perform new employee identity verification, ensuring that only legitimate hires access corporate resources. 
 Corporate Systems: Existing staff members can authenticate their access credentials, significantly bolstering cybersecurity defenses. 
 Data Management: Companies can update corporate records, significantly reducing the risk of manual errors that can compromise integrity.

  <p>Within an organization, inactive user accounts can persist for various reasons, including former employees, service providers, and service accounts associated with products or services. These accounts may remain inactive temporarily or for extended periods. If an account remains inactive for 90 days or more, it is more likely to remain inactive. It’s crucial to periodically review these inactive accounts and eliminate any that are unnecessary. Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews now offers the capability to detect inactive accounts effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Entra ID Governance Access Review feature, it’s possible to identify accounts that have not been actively used to sign into Entra ID, either interactively or non-interactively, for up to 720 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts that are left inactive are susceptible to being targeted by cybercriminals for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inactive accounts may still use well-known passwords or credentials that have been compromised.&nbsp; 
 Inactive accounts are less likely to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.&nbsp; 
 Due to their inactivity, these accounts may go unnoticed by advanced security controls in place.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While organizations with a formal JML (Joiners, Movers, and Leavers) process in place can mitigate some of these risks, regular reviews are still essential to ensure that security measures are effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding the standards for monitoring accounts&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator">CIS Control V8 Safe guard 5.3</a> it’s recommended to delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported. This is also aligned with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access#pa-4-review-and-reconcile-user-access-regularly">Azure Security Benchmark v3 PA-4 Control</a> - Review and reconcile user access regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>Indicio launches <a href="https://info.indicio.tech/indicio-sandbox-free-trial">free trial of Indicio Proven™</a>,&nbsp; its award-winning verifiable credential solution </p>
<p>SEATTLE, Oct 10, 2023/ <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the market leader in delivering enterprise-class verifiable data solutions, today announced the launch of a<a href="https://info.indicio.tech/indicio-sandbox-free-trial"> new, free, trial version of Indicio Proven™</a>, its award-winning system for using verifiable digital credentials. With this free 30-day trial, teams can access Proven’s key features to develop seamless, privacy-preserving solutions for sharing and verifying data and identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proven is being used by global enterprises to drive digital transformation in agriculture, financial services, health, hospitality, tourism, and travel, where the ability to instantly verify data lowers costs and reduces the risk of fraud, creates efficiencies and better customer experiences, and enables new products and services through the ability to protect privacy and deliver digital trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested developers should sign-up to be among the first to access this industry-leading technology built from open source components and open standards for trusted communications including W3C Decentralized Identifiers, DIDComm, verifiable credentials, and machine-readable governance.</p>
<p>“With the launch of this one month free trial service, we are giving people the opportunity to experience just how powerful and transformative decentralized identity technology is when it comes to being able to trust data,” said Heather Dahl, CEO and co-founder of Indicio. “It’s an entirely new tool for creating seamless digital interaction that can be used wherever and whenever data needs to be trusted. While there have been many promises made for digital identity, we’ve shown how to make it work — and how to deploy it using open source protocols with the least friction, the most flexibility, and the lowest cost. This is why, with expanding global partnerships, we are transforming entire sectors, laying the foundation for a better web, and seeding a new generation of digital innovation.”</p>
<p>“Proven solves a longstanding problem with decentralized identity technology —&nbsp;how to put it all in a box that customers can use to build complete solutions to meet their data needs,” said Ken Ebert, CTO and co-founder of Indicio. “It does nobody any good just to use another proprietary SaaS platform that spits out credentials written in some format that nobody can actually use, much less scale. Proven focuses on interoperability with other solutions that follow the open standards. We built Proven with every component you will need to issue, hold, verify, govern, and integrate the entire system directly into your own hosted environment. Our customers don’t have to worry about the underlying technology and can stay focused on implementing solutions that deliver real business value, reduce the costs of fraud and inefficiency, and on what matters most — driving innovation and growth.”</p>
<p>Indicio’s free trial provides:</p>
<p>10X faster deployment, which means faster time to value: Uses simple APIs to fit directly into currently deployed systems and tech stacks, boosting use of existing infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>Implementation of governance frameworks in hours —not weeks or months: Quickly and easily adhere to regulatory standards like SOC 2, eIDAS, HIPAA, and GDPR by customizing your own machine-readable governance file.</p>
<p>Minimal subject matter expertise needed to deploy: Indicio’s low-code, deployment-automated provisioning allows teams to move fast and begin realizing the value of actionable, verifiable data.</p>
<p>Investment into a fully deployable solution: Build using Indicio’s free trial,then quickly deploy into production with minimal modifications or enhancements.</p>
<p>Team of experts supporting you and the system: Claim 3 free hours of 1:1 support and access to our monitored communication channels to get your questions answered by our expert staff.</p>

However, the dynamic nature of cloud services creates new security challenges that need a dynamic approach to governance and security controls.

<p>Organizations are exploiting cloud services to accelerate business changes without the need for capital expenditure or lengthy procurement delays to obtain hardware. However, the dynamic nature of cloud services creates new security challenges that need a dynamic approach to governance and security controls.</p>
 
<p>In addition, the responsibilities for security and compliance are shared between the CSP (Cloud Service Providers) and the cloud customer and it is up to the customer to ensure that they use the cloud in a secure and compliant manner. On top of that, each cloud service provides its own proprietary tools for security.</p>
<p>How can an organization be sure that it is using cloud services securely and in a way that meets its compliance obligations and its appetite for risk?</p>
 Shared Responsibility 
<p>While major CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) go to great lengths to secure the services that they provide, it is up to the cloud service customers to secure how they use these services. The responsibility for security and compliance is shared between the cloud customer and the CSP.&nbsp; The customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but is responsible for managing everything above the service provided.&nbsp; The customer also remains responsible for compliance with laws and regulations governing the processing of their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The basics of security hygiene are the same for both cloud and non-cloud. However, cloud and virtualized environments are very dynamic with resources being created and destroyed in milliseconds. Static detective controls are not appropriate in this dynamic environment. A policy-based approach is needed to prevent misconfigurations and vulnerabilities before they can be deployed rather than to detect them afterward. These policies are sometimes referred to as guardrails that stop mistakes before they create a risk.</p>
 Ad Hoc Approach 
<p>Cyber hygiene is a set of routines that implement best practices intended to keep systems, data, and users secure against cyber-attacks, data breaches, and data loss. These are the same for cloud services as for other forms of IT delivery. These are documented in numerous security frameworks and best practices and cover areas such as:</p>
 
 Asset management – which needs an inventory – hard to maintain for the transient virtual resources. 
 Identity management – which must also include the entitlements of the virtual resources. 
 Vulnerability management – which must ensure that known vulnerabilities must be removed from virtual resources before they become live. 
 Network security management – of the virtual in-cloud network as well as the connection to the cloud. 
 Data protection – controlling what data is held in which locations and how this data is protected against theft and unauthorized access. 
 Monitoring to ensure that the risks are managed and that obligations under laws and regulations are met. 
 
<p>However, each cloud has its own tools that support these processes, and these are all different. This has led to an ad hoc approach to security and compliance on the multi-cloud environment now found in most organizations.</p>
 Alphabet Soup 
<p>In response to these challenges, there is now a wide range of solutions on the market intended to help secure the way in which cloud services are used. While these tools are aligned with the security threats and risks that are relevant to the cloud they are often not integrated. To add to the confusion they are now referred to using yet another set of acronyms including:</p>
 
 CAASM (Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management) - is&nbsp;an emerging technology focused on presenting a unified view of cyber assets to help prevent and manage attacks. 
 CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) – provides controls over the entitlements possessed by virtual resources.&nbsp; 
 CNAPP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platform) – provides capabilities to view and manage security controls for cloud accounts and workloads integrated into the cloud DevOps workflow. 
 CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) - providing visibility of security and compliance posture. 
 CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform) – provides controls at the microservices instance/container level. 
 CXDR (Cloud Extended Threat Detection and Response) – covering cloud threat detection and response. 
 DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) – provides visibility into sensitive data, where it is located, and who has access. 
 KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management) – discover and fix security and compliance issues within the various Kubernetes components. 
 SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) – provides network-based access controls to cloud services.&nbsp; 
 
 Cloud Security Platform 
<p>What is needed is a consistent cloud security platform that covers all the required capabilities for the customer to secure their use of cloud services. Some CNAPP solutions currently offered provide a platform that integrates several of the above capabilities for IaaS that were previously offered as standalone products. A key success factor for a cloud security platform is the ability of the tools to work in unison across environments, architectural layers, and, ideally, 3rd party integrations providing the additional context needed to achieve robust cloud security.</p>

Operating power grids in nine European countries including Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic, EON is “constantly” under attack by cybercriminals, some of which are suspected state-backed actors.</p>
<p>Unlike most cybercriminals, the aim of state-backed actors is increasingly not about making money but using data encryption malware attacks to create fear for political purposes. This is what Alexander Klimburg, Senior Fellow at the Hague Center for Strategic Studies calls “ransomwar”. In his opinion, WannaCry and NotPetya were the first major ransomwar attacks launched by governments.</p>
<p>At cyberevolution, Alexander will give a keynote about “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5660">Surviving between the Cyber Frontlines</a>” in which he will address information and cyber warfare and what organizations can do to protect themselves. Take a glimpse into is keynote in today’s cyberfile and learn which good habits need to be instilled through training to minimize the chances of being hit. &nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>On October 4, 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) jointly released new guidance titled <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF">Identity and Access Management: Developer and Vendor Challenges</a>, which addresses technology gaps that limit adoption of more secure identity and access management (IAM) practices. This guidance is a follow on to their <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Mar/21/2003183448/-1/-1/0/ESF%20IDENTITY%20AND%20ACCESS%20MANAGEMENT%20RECOMMENDED%20BEST%20PRACTICES%20FOR%20ADMINISTRATORS%20PP-23-0248_508C.PDF">comprehensive guidance report on IAM</a> published earlier this year. Together, these documents describe key principles and best practices to fortify organizations against the rising tide of cyberthreats.</p> 
<p>The NSA / CISA IAM guidelines covers deterrence, prevention, detection, damage limitation, and response. Here, we'll explore key takeaways from the reports as well as how HYPR, with its Identity Assurance approach, helps you overcome challenges to successfully align with the recommended NSA / CISA IAM security strategies.</p> 
 IAM Threat Landscape  
<p>One of the most significant threats trends in the past few years is the specific targeting of IAM systems and processes. According to <a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/white-paper/2023-trends-in-securing-digital-identities/">one recent study</a>, 90% of organizations experienced an identity-related incident, ranging from phishing and credential theft to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks.</p> 
<p>The NSA / CISA IAM guidance points out that attacks on SSO technology, in particular, have become more prevalent. By compromising SSO systems, cybercriminals can gain access to numerous protected applications and resources throughout an organization. The agencies state that defense against such a broad range of attacks requires a comprehensive solution “with operational awareness of the environment to detect anomalies and attribute anomalous activity to adversary exploits.”</p> 
 Key Takeaways From the NSA / CISA IAM Guidelines  
 1. Enterprises Must Look at the Entire Identity Lifecycle  
<p>The guidance stresses the importance of managing the entire identity and access lifecycle, emphasizing "Join, Move, and Leave" (JML) events. The report notably calls out the inadequacy of MFA enrollment processes that make it difficult to be certain that a user’s credentials are tied to an established, verified employee identity. Such processes often rely on user self-enrollment that utilize inconsistent and insecure methods such as a “one time enrollment code” flow.</p> 
<p>The directives recommend that organizations develop secure enrollment processes which can support the complex provisioning needs of large organizations, with tools that operate across systems and JML lifecycle events. These processes should also address unexpected events, such as detecting and responding to abnormal user behavior or other potential risks, and lost or stolen authenticators or devices.</p> 
<p>In addition, the NSA / CISA IAM report strongly recommends organizations maintain an audit trail or a “chain of evidence” by requiring the manager or designated individual to “attest” to the fact that all required checks passed to the manager’s satisfaction.</p> 
 2. Hardening the Enterprise Environment  
<p>The guidance emphasizes the need to harden the enterprise environment, including “making sure the foundations and implementations of IAM are sufficiently secured, assured, and trusted."</p> 
<p>Environmental hardening makes it tougher to exploit IAM components and software. While some of the recommendations center around physical hardening and general cyber hygiene, like regular patching and vulnerability testing, a key component of enterprise hardening is the use of strong, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to IAM systems. Moreover, cryptographic keys used for authentication and other IAM functions should be protected at appropriate assurance levels, preferably using hardware-based methods.</p> 
 3. Authentication Best Practices: Strong, Phishing-Resistant MFA&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<p>Unsurprisingly, the NSA / CISA IAM recommendations unequivocally state the need for organizations to deploy MFA to mitigate common attacks. The agencies distinguish between weak and strong, phishing-resistant forms of MFA, noting that critical implementation details impact the security and usability of an MFA deployment. Some forms of MFA are susceptible to phishing, replay, MitM and other attacks. The guidance specifically warns against push notification-based authenticator apps that prompt the user to approve login attempts as these are susceptible to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a> (MFA bombing). It advocates for local biometric matching on mobile devices and emphasizes FIDO-certified device requirements.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;Weakest to Strongest Types of MFA<br>Source:The National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</p> 
 4. Coverage Is Key  
<p>Before deploying MFA and monitoring solutions, understanding the full scope of use cases is crucial. The NSA / CISA IAM guidance warns against an ad-hoc approach that may lead to incomplete coverage and a complex environment. Multiple IAM systems and the use of different authenticators creates adoption challenges and confusion for users, as well as management and security monitoring difficulties.</p> 
<p>This is currently a tremendous challenge for organizations. According to the 2023 IDSA report, the biggest obstacle to implementing more secure identity practices stems from complicated identity frameworks with multiple vendors and different architectures. Organizations should choose a comprehensive solution that can unify siloed systems and supports all of their business and operational use cases.</p> 
 5. Respond to Elevated Risk  
<p>Because security and threat vectors are dynamic, the guidance advises organizations to implement automated risk analysis. Of course, quantifying risk is based on the policies that are in place. As such, the guidance highlights the requirements for policies that can trigger the need to re-authenticate or perform step-up authentication (i.e., requiring higher-assurance authentication than was used to initially establish a user’s session) when users access sensitive applications or perform high-risk activities. This provides the flexibility to require high assurance when needed without frustrating users engaged in routine, low-risk tasks with repeated MFA prompts. It also provides an integration point for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) policies such as requiring re-authentication or step-up based on risk signals from threat defense systems.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Organizations Can Meet the NSA and CISA IAM Provisions  
<p>The release of CISA and NSA's new guidance on Identity and Access Management underscores the critical role IAM plays in fortifying cybersecurity defenses. As organizations navigate the complexities of an ever-changing threat landscape, adhering to recommended best practices is essential.</p> 
<p>HYPR's Identity Assurance solution, consisting of HYPR Authenticate, HYPR Adapt and HYPR Affirm, ensures IAM security aligns with the CISA/NSA guidance. Designed to create trust in the entire identity lifecycle, it combines modern passkey-based authentication with adaptive risk mitigation, automated identity verification and a simple, intuitive user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  HYPR Authenticate provides the most secure FIDO-based, phishing-resistant MFA. It ensures that biometric templates are bound to a single device, mitigating privacy and security concerns and adhering to the best practices recommended by CISA and NSA. It provides complete coverage across all populations and use cases, from desktop to cloud.  
  HYPR Adapt stands out by providing a flexible policy framework based on the Open Policy Agent (OPA) standard. This empowers organizations to create policies aligned with their risk criteria. HYPR's policies can dynamically trigger re-authentication or step-up authentication based on risk signals, in accordance with Zero Trust Architecture policies.  
  HYPR Affirm integrates intelligent identity verification into an organization's identity and authentication practice, covering all JML events as well as high-risk and high-impact moments. This includes “new device” capabilities, where users can effortlessly but securely disable a device and move to a new one, verifying identity through a multi-faceted check that ensures the integrity of the device and the identity of the user. Moreover, it maintains an auditable attestation trail in alignment with NSA and CISA best practices.

  <p>Digital organizations face unprecedented challenges. There's incredible pressure to innovate ahead of the competition and deliver digital experiences that help to acquire, retain, and build loyalty with customers — all while fending off ever-present and increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. A robust identity and access management (IAM) platform plays a pivotal role in transforming these challenges into achievable goals.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to introduce the latest evolution in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> with the release of software version 7.4.</p>

<p>This update includes innovative features that will help our self-managed software customers elevate user experiences, expedite solution development, and enhance security. The <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.4/platform-guide/about.html">ForgeRock Identity Platform 7.4</a> release includes:</p>

  ForgeRock Access Management 7.4 
	 ForgeRock Identity Management 7.4 
	 ForgeRock Directory Services 7.4 
	 ForgeRock Identity Gateway 2023.9 
	 ForgeRock SDKs 4.2 
  Elevate user experiences 

<p>Latency is the enemy of the frictionless user experiences that keep employees productive and keep customers coming back. Delivering great experiences is central to the ForgeRock platform, and the latest release offers several features that reduce latency, perceived or actual, and ensure customer and workforce users have a seamless and enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>No one wants to wait in a long line, especially when it comes to using an application. Unfortunately, some legacy and protected applications can be slow to respond to requests for an available HTTP connection. This creates a queue of requests from all applications and inhibits the user experience even for those accessing other, unrelated applications.</p>

<p>That's why we've added the capability to control and limit the number of outbound HTTP requests waiting for an available HTTP connection to a protected application or API. This control limits the cascading effect of wait times created by slow responses, so it&nbsp; reduces user frustration due to unresponsive applications, ultimately delivering a better customer experience.</p>

<p>We've established that latency is an obstacle to a favorable user experience. Client-side (stateless) sessions simplify infrastructure and reduce client-perceived latency, thus enhancing user experience. However, client-side sessions are constrained by a 4kb cookie size limit that hampers an organization's ability to implement session-based client-side use cases. In the latest <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/latest/release-notes/whats-new.html">Identity Gateway release</a>, organizations can now automatically split the client-side sessions over multiple cookies. This improves flexibility and ease of design by eliminating cookie size limitations, enabling use cases such as Post Data Preservation, so that developers can engineer better user experiences.</p>

 Expedite solution development 

<p>Expediting project delivery can be a key competitive advantage. However, projects often require customizations that slow delivery and make new features difficult to integrate, deliver, debug, and maintain.</p>

<p>For this reason, the 7.4 release incorporates significant enhancements to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">identity orchestration</a> engine that seamlessly integrate access management with identity management and enable developers to share code across journeys with a library of scripts.</p>

<p>For developers, the enhancements offer a number of benefits, including reduced duplication, less development work thanks to more out-of-the-box nodes, simplified code integration, lower maintenance overheads, easier debugging, and an overall increase in code stability. These features boost developer productivity, accelerate delivery of innovation, and expedite time to value for the business.</p>

 Enhance security 

<p>With data breaches and cyberthreats more prevalent than ever, security remains a top priority. Organizations need to ensure transactions are secured using strong cryptography. To this end, the 7.4 release provides the option to sign and verify data.</p>

<p>Signing generates a unique digital signature that is linked to the transaction data and serves as proof of identity. It can help to keep the data intact during transmission and execution, which ensures the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of online transactions.</p>

<p>In addition to signing and verifying data, the 7.4 release offers the ability to store and retrieve privileged account credentials from vaults and rotate them without the need for a restart. This, coupled with ensuring nothing is stored in the clear (no plain-text credentials), enables fast and automatic rotation of privileged account credentials to deliver additional protection against security vulnerabilities associated with compromised passwords — without disruption to the business.</p>

<p>Another security feature of the 7.4 offers OAuth IP allowlisting. Organizations need to be able to control which clients are able to connect and receive access tokens. An allowlist approach enables a number of use cases, such as restricting the issuance of access tokens to clients that match a specific IP or list of IPs via custom scripting.</p>

<p>ForgeRock is fully committed to supporting all identities in any environment — whether the deployment is self-managed on-prem, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid cloud</a>, or as-a-service. The ForgeRock Identity Platform 7.4 release empowers organizations to provide an unparalleled user experience, expedite project delivery, and strengthen security.</p>

<p>Many of the features in the 7.4 release are also currently available in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a>. These capabilities support our existing cloud and hybrid customers, while offering organizations seeking a turnkey SaaS solution the same benefits available to our self-managed customers.</p>

<p>In addition to the features highlighted above, you can read about the many new 7.4 release capabilities in our <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.4/release-notes/preface.html">release notes</a>.

  <p>In 2021, temporary and contract staffing made up <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/220682/us-total-annual-temporary-employment/">more than 14 million members of the workforce</a>. While the numbers have fluctuated, the preceding decade never saw that number dip below 10 million, and in some years exceeded 14 million. Contract workers remain essential to business, often filling strategic roles and those that call for specialized skills. However, in the digital age, these workers pose some challenges, particularly around cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity breaches in the United States in 2022 cost an average of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">$9.44 million</a>, and attack techniques are only increasing in sophistication. Traditional security methods like employee identity and access management (IAM) <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/customer-targeted-cybercrime-rises-traditional-digital-identity-fails">protocols may no longer be sufficient</a> for a company's protection against growing cybersecurity threats.</p>

 How do contract workers increase cybersecurity risks? 

<p>Companies that employ contract workers may face some specific cybersecurity risks as a result of qualities specific to these types of employees. Since contractors have the potential to frequently move from company to company, they may have access to private data from numerous sources, with little accountability.</p>

<p>Contractors may also be under less scrutiny than other workers, especially if they are working on a limited or temporary basis. They can pose threats to cybersecurity through human error, data mismanagement, or malicious activity, particularly the use of a device infected with malware.</p>

 Types of cybersecurity risks associated with contract workers 

<p>To do their jobs, contractors may have access to networks, internal drives, and sensitive data. Here's why that can pose risks.</p>

  Limited control and oversight: Contractors may not be subject to the same level of scrutiny or oversight as regular employees, which could potentially allow negligent or malicious activity to go unnoticed. 
	 Insufficient training: It can be difficult for companies to offer contract employees the same level of training that regular employees receive. For example, some companies may provide more general company-wide training on an annual schedule. As a result, a planned cybersecurity training program may not coincide with the duration of a contract. 
	 Device security: Contract workers often use their own devices or work remotely. This increases the potential for security breaches from insecure networks or compromised devices. 
	 Access privileges: To effectively perform their jobs, contractors may need access to specific networks or systems. A company without a robust <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity</a> strategy may have vulnerabilities related to this relatively unmonitored access. 
 <p>The U.S. government has been making <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/us-national-cybersecurity-strategy-what-it-means-digital-identity">policy changes and initiatives in order to address cybersecurity threats</a>. Some of these factors, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, may help to reduce some of the vulnerabilities associated with contract workers.</p>

 How to reduce cybersecurity risks associated with contract workers 

<p>When working with contractors, it may be necessary to consider additional cybersecurity measures. Reducing or eliminating the unique security risks and vulnerabilities posed by contract workers can involve a mix of new technologies and procedural changes.</p>

  Cloud technology: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Cloud identity solutions</a> can help to ensure the identity of those accessing privileged company information. It can also reduce the vulnerabilities of device-stored data by offering protected interactions on the cloud. 
	 Identity governance: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> enables organizations to prevent inappropriate access and comply with regulations. 
 <p>As with any potential cyberthreat, keeping an ongoing watch for suspicious activity is one of the most important ways to reduce the risk of an attack, and minimize the damage if it occurs.</p>

 How to recover from a cybersecurity breach 

<p>The first thing to recognize is that it's important to act quickly. Depending on how the breach occurred, if the problem is unaddressed, malicious actors could further exploit the vulnerability that led to the breach and perpetuate the damage.</p>

  Identify and contain the breach: Identifying and addressing a breach should be the first priority following detection. Try to isolate affected systems or networks in order to prevent an attacker from causing further damage. Preserving evidence can also help during investigation. 
	 Notify affected parties: Nobody wants to hear their private data has been compromised, especially if it comes as the result of a seemingly preventable cyberattack. In some jurisdictions, a company may be <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/cybersecurity-legislation-2021">legally required to report cybersecurity breaches</a>. 
	 Restore systems and data: Restoring a network to normal operation may involve using data backups, reinstalling software, and replacing compromised hardware. 
	 Implement measures to prevent future attacks: After recovering from a breach, it's important to take steps to ensure that a similar breach won't happen again. Try to close any security gaps, and provide additional employee training if necessary. 
 <p>Recovering from a cybersecurity breach can be a long and expensive process. However, knowing how to react and what a restoration entails can help to plan for this type of disaster.</p>

 Choosing contract workers 

<p>To reduce potential security concerns when hiring contract workers, try to take these activities into consideration:</p>

  Background checks: Before hiring a contractor, perform a background check to ensure their identity, history, and qualifications. 
	 Regular security audits: Monitoring and performing regular security audits on contractor activities can help to ensure they are acting responsibly and with cybersecurity in mind. This can also be a good way to ensure all workers are on the same page when it comes to taking adequate security measures. 
	 Provide secure equipment: A good way to avoid issues with device security is to provide workers with secure, company-managed equipment. 
	 Communication: Establishing easy and open communication with contractors helps ensure they feel comfortable and compelled to report potential security issues they encounter. 
 <p>Ultimately, hiring contract workers should, whenever possible, involve the same rigorous vetting that other employees require.</p>

 Additional risk factors 

<p>There are many potential sources of cybersecurity risk for a business. Some of these could potentially stem from contractors, but could come from other sources as well.</p>

  Phishing: Malicious actors can pose as authority figures in order to steal information, such as login credentials. Phishing can stem from social engineering attacks, as well as malicious links made to look legitimate. 
	 Ransomware: Malware attacks such as ransomware hold access to information, computer systems, or networks hostage until a ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks accounted for <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/494947/ransomware-attacks-per-year-worldwide/">over a billion cyber attacks since 2020</a>. 
	 AI-powered cyberattacks: While AI has powerful uses in cybersecurity, it is also helping malicious actors to execute more authentic-looking attacks and it makes it far easier to impersonate others to carry out fraud, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a>. 
 <p>Cyberattacks are only becoming more sophisticated and more targeted, which means companies need to take a proactive and sustained approach to cybersecurity.</p>

 Options for legal recourse 

<p>If your business experiences a data breach due to the actions of a contractor, it may be prudent to look into legal actions. Depending on the nature of the breach, or the location it occurred, the contractor may be legally liable. Consult with legal counsel, who can inform you of the relevant state and federal violations that may have occurred.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Joining forces to compete against Microsoft and Okta 
<p>A couple of months ago, the series of acquisitions of SailPoint, ForgeRock, and Ping Identity by Thoma Bravo triggered discussions and rumors about the impact on the broader Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) market. Recently, Thoma Bravo <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-of-forgerock-combines-forgerock-into-ping-identity-301908059.html">announced</a> that ForgeRock would be combined into Ping Identity. Such merger &amp; acquisition (M&amp;A) developments prompt the spate of usual questions:</p>
 
 What does this mean to customers of the two companies? 
 What to expect strategically from the combined companies? 
 Where are the risks of such a combination? 
 How could this potentially impact the market? 
 
<p>As always, responding to these questions is a mixture of known facts, experience from other mergers and acquisitions, knowledge of the companies and markets as well as the competitive landscape, and last but not least, some educated guessing.</p>
 The impact on customers 
<p>As with every transaction of this type, this raises questions about the impact on the mutual product roadmaps. Will the combined companies increase or slow down product development? Will products be discontinued? Will there arise a need for major migration projects?</p>
<p>For understanding the potential impact, there are a couple of aspects to look at, such as:</p>
 
 The functional and technological differences and similarities 
 The target customers 
 The impact on corporate strategies 
 
<p>The functional differences and similarities can be well-analyzed by utilizing reference architectures such as the KuppingerCole Analysts <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an81216/2022-iam-reference-architecture">IAM Reference Architecture</a>. Both companies offer Access Management solutions, including Adaptive Authentication / Passwordless Authentication, Web Access Management, and Identity Federation. Also, both companies provide their Directory Services and a certain level of API Management.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are unique product areas. In particular, ForgeRock supports Identity Governance &amp; Administration (IGA) capabilities, while Ping Identity supports identity verification and acquired a specialist in the decentralized identity space a while ago. Additionally, some services, such as multi-factor authentication, have different deployment options across the two vendors.</p>
<p>When examining the types of identities served by the respective platforms Ping Identity is concentrated primarily on business identities (such as workforce, customer, and partner identities), while ForgeRock, in addition to consumer and customer use cases and support for partner and workforce use cases, adds specific support for IoT and Edge computing use cases, supporting both consumer IoT devices and industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios. Ping Identity also has limited support for consumer IoT device management, CIAM-related user self service capabilities, and also provides Data Governance features.</p>
<p>From a technology perspective, there are significant differences between the Ping and the ForgeRock product portfolio. ForgeRock, rooted in open source, provides a solution that is very flexible for customization. However, such customization comes at the expense of complexity. Ping, on the other hand, provides more a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution. Ping has also already developed a robust multi-tenant cloud solution.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, the DaVinci orchestration capabilities of Ping Identity are also a relevant differentiator. There is no doubt that convergence of the product portfolios will be a daunting task, even though modern architectures with microservices and API-based integration allow for easier integration of different technology stacks than it had been the case in the past. The DaVinci orchestration capabilities can become an important factor for such integration, though.</p>
<p>We expect, due to the structure of the transaction and with Andre Durand, CEO of Ping Identity, becoming the CEO of the combined entity, Ping Identity being in the lead, but with joint teams from both companies. Thus, Ping Identity will have more influence on the joint strategy. From a strategic perspective, with both companies being (in different stages) on their journey to the cloud, there is no strategy disruption to be expected.</p>
<p>If you are a customer of Ping Identity or ForgeRock or in the procurement process, feel free to reach out to the KuppingerCole Analysts team for further insights and advice.</p>
 The strategic potential 
<p>With the mutual portfolios, and the individual strengths of both vendors, there is a potential of Ping and ForgeRock building a powerful platform for Digital Identity Management that covers all types of identities, from humans (consumers, customers, partners, and workforce) to silicon identities, including the IoT and IIoT space.</p>
<p>The previous investments of Ping Identity into orchestration technology, identity verification and support for decentralized identity provide a foundation for a fundamental modernization of approaches in this area, beyond today’s established IAM solutions.</p>
<p>Potentially, Ping/ForgeRock can provide a modern, integrated, feature-rich cloud-based Identity Fabric as a strategic solution approach to their customers, beyond serving isolated use cases. Moving towards this target will take some time and is best done by evolving a modern, cloud-based solution stack with a high degree of integration that allows smooth migration at least for customers that already are relying on cloud-based solutions.</p>
 The risks 
<p>Other than the common risks of mergers and acquisitions such as building a joint organization, there are several challenges to face.</p>
<p>One is that many ForgeRock customers are still using legacy on-premises solutions, and many also have customized the solution significantly, baking it, for instance, into their digital services. Evolving from there will become more challenging than it is for other COTS solutions. This requires offerings involving well-thought-out migration paths with both technical and consulting support.</p>
<p>As always, communicating a strong strategy, a well-thought-out roadmap, and a migration path that simplifies migration for existing customers and allows them to migrate at their own pace (within boundaries) is key to success.</p>
<p>Another specific risk is the pace of the competition. In each market Ping Identity and ForgeRock are playing, there is fierce competition. Thus, the combined entity will need to move fast with strategy and roadmap and execute on these plans, to not give room to their competitors.</p>
 The market impacts 
<p>While Ping Identity and ForgeRock are well-known players in the broader IAM space, they are facing strong competition.&nbsp; In addition to established vendors such as Broadcom (which acquired identity products from CA Technologies), Oracle, IBM, SAP, RSA, and others that are strong in large enterprises, there are many specialist vendors across all market segments Ping Identity and ForgeRock play in.</p>
<p>Specific competitors to watch are Okta and Microsoft, with Microsoft 365 present in a majority of organizations, involving also Entra ID. Both have strong offerings competing directly with the Ping Identity and ForgeRock portfolios, and both are significantly larger than the new, combined entity.&nbsp; In addition, privileged access management leader CyberArk has recently expanded into access management, and the space is also seeing a major influx of new entries, including a fast-growing customer identity company Transmit Security.</p>
<p>Thus, it will be essential for Ping Identity to demonstrate innovativeness beyond merging portfolios but also delivering some breakthrough innovation. Ping Identity has built the foundation with their previous acquisitions. Even then, the combined entity will face fierce competition.</p>
 Conclusion &amp; recommendations 
<p>The combination of Ping Identity and ForgeRock shows potential. Ping Identity is well-advised to focus on breakthrough innovation and thinking beyond the established state of IAM, also to differentiate from their competitors.</p>
<p>End users, as common at such stages, are best advised to keep calm until further information about strategy, roadmaps, and the future product portfolio are released.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Today’s evolving and expanding threat landscape has rendered traditional security measures inadequate for safeguarding sensitive data and systems. Organizations grapple with elevated risks as malicious actors continuously devise new ways to circumvent standard security protocols and exploit vulnerabilities. Additionally, the shift towards remote and hybrid work models has brought new avenues of attack. Recent breaches show just how easy it is for hackers to use social engineering tactics to call an IT service desk, impersonate an end user to gain access, and then elevate privileges, install malware, or even shut down entire systems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In response to these challenges, government agencies, cybersecurity experts and industry bodies unanimously advocate for the adoption of a Zero Trust security approach. Zero Trust challenges the outdated notion that traditional network security perimeters are sufficient for defense, instead taking a "Never trust, always verify" stance. This involves the constant authentication and validation of users' identities, their devices, and their security configurations before granting or maintaining access to applications and data. Risk-based authentication is a pivotal component of a Zero Trust strategy, and is essential for mitigating these threats and attacks.</p> 
 What Is Zero Trust?  
<p>Zero Trust is a comprehensive security framework designed to counteract modern cyberthreats. It operates on the foundational premise that secure perimeters and network edges are obsolete. With resources dispersed across various locations, encompassing on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments, and with personnel accessing them from anywhere, conventional security models no longer suffice.</p> 
<p>Zero Trust endeavors to eradicate trust assumptions at every layer of the network architecture. All users, whether internal or external to the organization's network, are treated as potential threats until they conclusively prove otherwise through rigorous authentication and authorization processes. The principal components of Zero Trust encompass perpetual monitoring, stringent access controls, and continuous validation that the user is who they say they are at all times.</p> 
 What Is Risk-Based Authentication?  
<p>Risk-based authentication, also referred to as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a>, constitutes an essential&nbsp; element of a Zero Trust strategy. It assesses the probability of an account being compromised and adjusts authentication requirements and actions based on risk level. A risk-based authentication system continuously evaluates various factors, including:</p> 
  
  Trust Level: Is the user logging in from a recognized and trusted device, or is it an unfamiliar device?  
  Location: Is the user accessing resources from an expected location or a remote, potentially suspicious location?  
  Network: Is the user connecting from a known and secure network, or is the network connection unverified?  
  Other user behavior and device and browser risk signals: For example, what is device health status (is it rooted or jailbroken, is the OS up to date), time of day the user is logging in, does the user behavior match behavior history?  
  Sensitivity: Is the requested resource highly sensitive, necessitating additional security measures?  
  Threat Landscape Risks: Are there emerging security threats that create an additional level of risk?  
  
<p>Based on analysis of these factors, the risk-based authentication system determines a risk score. The user may either proceed with a standard login method or be prompted to provide additional proof of identity and authorization. Some more sophisticated systems may even prompt users to re-verify their identity altogether according to defined policies.</p> 
 Why Is Risk-Based Authentication Imperative for Zero Trust?  
<p>Zero Trust hinges on context-driven security policies and rigorous user authentication, eschewing reliance on trust assumptions. Risk-based authentication plays a central role by continuously monitoring risk indicators and adapting authentication criteria accordingly.</p> 
<p>Risk-based authentication empowers organizations to:</p> 
  
  Identify High-Risk Scenarios: By assessing real-time risk factors, organizations can promptly discern potentially high-risk activities or access attempts. Subsequently, they can prompt users for additional authentication or re-authentication.  
  Safeguard Sensitive Resources: Zero Trust authentication grants organizations the ability to restrict access to sensitive resources based on risk assessments. For instance, they can block access to critical data when unusual or risky behavior, such as an attempt to access from an unmanaged device, is detected.  
  Enhance User Experience: While elevating security, risk-based authentication also streamlines the user experience. Users are prompted for additional authentication only when deemed necessary, thus reducing friction during routine access attempts.  
  
 Continuous Risk-Based Authentication vs. Point-in-Time  
<p>In the contemporary threat landscape, point-in-time authentication, limited to initial login or upon access of specific resources, is no longer adequate. To attain genuine <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a>, organizations must continually validate a user's identity and authorization constantly and consistently. This ongoing verification is indispensable for preempting unauthorized access and promptly identifying suspicious activities.</p> 
<p>In a Zero Trust environment, access to diverse resources is subject to control and monitoring through enforcement points aligned with policies. For instance, instead of solely relying on users “claimed” identity, a risk-based policy takes into account the user's complete behavior and risk profile, empowering organizations to take immediate action upon detecting abnormal or high-risk behavior or situations.</p> 
 HYPR Risk-Based Authentication Accelerates Your Zero Trust Strategy  
<p>Risk-based authentication serves as a cornerstone of a Zero Trust approach, allowing organizations to outpace cyber adversaries and offer a more secure and user-friendly authentication experience.</p> 
<p>HYPR provides continuous, rigorous Zero Trust authentication while removing user friction. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt </a>continuously assesses risk signals and telemetry from a broad and diverse set of sources. Results can be used to dynamically enforce step-up authentication or re-verification, as well as shared with SIEM, SOAR and other enterprise systems for additional enforcement or reporting actions.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">HYPR Authenticate</a> replaces passwords and traditional MFA with phishing-resistant passkeys that remain in the most secured areas of the user device at all times.

  <p>On July 11, 2023, we introduced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-expands-into-security-service-edge-with-two-new/ba-p/3847829">Microsoft’s identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution</a> and two new services: Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access, which are now in public preview. In this blog, we take a deeper look into Microsoft&nbsp;Entra Private Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Traditional network security stacks and legacy VPNs are no longer sufficient</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional network security approaches that use legacy VPNs simply cannot scale to modern demands. Once your remote users connect to your corporate network through VPN, they are granted excessive access to your entire network, all it takes is a single compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to gain entry, move laterally, and access your most critical assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access, an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), reduces the operational complexity and cost of legacy VPNs, while eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. It modernizes access to private applications and resources, helping users quickly and easily connect to private applications from any device and any network, whether they’re at home, remote, or in their corporate office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What makes Private Access unique&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of Microsoft’s SSE solution, Private Access is built on Zero Trust principles. It verifies every user and enforces least privilege, giving users access only to the private applications and resources they need. Private Access significantly expands Entra ID Application Proxy capabilities in Microsoft Entra to a complete ZTNA solution that shares the same connectors but offers so much more, it helps you simplify and secure access to any private resource on any port, and protocol. You can apply policies that enable secure, segmented, and granular access to all your private applications in your corporate network, on-premises, or in the cloud. For customers already using Application Proxy, they can seamlessly transition to Private Access – all existing use-cases and access to existing private web applications would continue to work with no disruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create and enforce per-app, least privilege access controls based on the granular Conditional Access policies that are enriched with context about users, devices, and their locations. You can also terminate ongoing sessions in response to anomalies or changes in user context or device health. For example, if a user connects from one part of the world and then immediately connects from another part of the world (what we call “impossible travel"), you can enforce re-authorization or step up to a stronger authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access enables secure access to any application, on-premises or cloud-based, and it works across any port or protocol, including RDP, SSH, SMB, FTP, and anything else that uses TCP or UDP. In addition, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using SAML or http headers or even legacy Kerberos authentication for both web and non-web applications, without making any changes to those applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>, your private applications are not only more secure, but your employees can also access them faster compared to legacy VPNs. The unmatched scale and vast global network edge presence enables you to optimally connect your users and devices to private resources, especially those who work in a hybrid or remote work environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Secure access to all private applications, for users anywhere, with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Private Access key capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access can help you enable secure access to all your private applications and resources. Key capabilities include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access. Replacing legacy VPNs with an identity-centric ZTNA minimizes the risk of implicit trust and lateral movement. Using Quick Access, you can easily configure broad private IP ranges and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to quickly enable identity-centric, Zero-Trust-based access to all private resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications. With Private Access, you can create Conditional Access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that require modern authentication for accessing any private application, even those using legacy protocols such as Kerberos and NT LAN Manager (NTLM). This brings policies based on the sensitivity of the application, level of user risk, network compliance, and so forth to legacy applications. For example, you can easily require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device compliance checks for users trying to access remote desktop (RDP), secure shell (SSH) or SMB applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic private application discovery and onboarding. You can discover private applications, including existing App Proxy private web applications, whether the applications are hosted locally in a private network, in an on-premises data center, or in the cloud.&nbsp; You can then onboard them to Microsoft Entra ID, group them, and define granular access policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Automatic private application discovery and onboarding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granular segmented application access. Instead of granting remote users access to your entire network, as traditional VPNs do, you can define granular segmented access policies for each application or group of applications based on user, device, or processes running on the endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Granular segmented application access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intelligent local access. Employees need a consistent security posture whether they’re accessing private applications remotely or on-premises. The intelligent local access capability enables fast and seamless ZTNA for users, whether they’re within the corporate network or connecting remotely from anywhere outside corporate network boundaries. For example, a user while on the corporate network can connect to on-premises private applications such as RDP or SMB while CA policies such as MFA are still enforced, and application traffic remains local on the corporate network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Intelligent local access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">Global Secure Access</a> (preview) is the centralized location in the Microsoft Entra admin center where you can configure and manage Microsoft Entra Private Access. Remote workers don't need to use a VPN to access these resources if they have the Global Secure Access Client installed. The client quietly and seamlessly connects them with the resources they need. The most current version of the client can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can install the client interactively, silently with the /quiet switch, or use mobile device management platforms like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management">Microsoft Intune to deploy</a> it to their devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickAccess makes it very easy to get started with a minimum configuration for Private Access, especially when you are planning to move from legacy VPN to ZTNA. After completing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access">initial configurations</a>, and once you deploy a connector agent on-premises, to enable quick access all you need to do is specify the IP address, IP address range, or FQDN and port number. You can then assign specific conditional access policies, which QuickAccess applies to ALL app segments you configured. For example, you can create a “myRDP app” and assign it an IP address-based app segment. You only need to provide a name for the private app, then select the connector you wish to use with the app, and then specify the IP address/range and port number. You can then access your destination by simply launching an RDP session from your remote client machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s no secret that the arrival of 5G technology will usher in a new wave of powerful business advantages. However, it’s also opening the door for an influx of threat vectors your enterprise will have to navigate along the way.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll help you learn the ins and outs of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/the-data-protection-puzzle-piece-for-telecoms/">5G security</a>. From what it is and why it’s at risk to how you can protect it, we’ll discuss everything there is to know about strengthening your 5G security architecture.</p>
 Understanding 5G 
<p>Building a solid 5G security posture requires a stable foundation. Let’s review the basics of 5G, how it compares to past generations, and why it’s so important for the future of enterprise networking.</p>
 What is 5G? 
<p>In short, 5G is the fifth generation of wireless telecommunication networks. As the latest in a line of innovations, each iteration has introduced its own set of new and impactful capabilities.</p>
<p>According to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA), each generation of mobile network technology is released roughly <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/5g-security-and-resilience">every 10 years</a> — and with it, a host of benefits. For example, here’s how networking has evolved over the past few decades:</p>
 
 1980s: First generation (1G) wireless networks brought the very first cell phones. 
 1990s: 2G brought improved coverage and texting. 
 2000s: 3G introduced voice with data and internet access. 
 2010s: 4G long-term evolution (LTE) delivered faster speeds to keep up with increasing mobile data demand and rising network traffic. 
 Now: 5G technology will transform the digital landscape and serve as a catalyst for innovation, new markets, and economic growth. As tens of billions of devices are connected to the internet through 5G, these connections will empower a vast array of new services in healthcare, manufacturing, finance, artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructure. Likewise, 5G connectivity is stepping up to handle enormous bandwidth demands and enable seamless live streaming at scale. 
 
<p>As of 2023, 5G wireless networks are available in most major American cities and towns. Globally, Italy ranks the highest on the <a href="https://5gobservatory.eu/observatory-overview/eu-scoreboard/">European 5G scoreboard</a>, with 99.7% of households having access to 5G connectivity. Looking ahead, telecom operators are continuing to invest heavily in the infrastructure necessary to expand their 5G reach and will do exactly that in the coming years.</p>
 How does 5G work? 
<p>As <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/5g_basics_infographic_508.pdf">CISA explains</a>, the 5G infrastructure enables billions of additional connected devices, sensors, and systems to intelligently access the network based on time sensitivity and computational needs.</p>
<p>Like 4G LTE, it’s based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), a process that encodes digital signals in a particular way to reduce interference. Alongside OFDM, 5G wireless networks leverage low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, which requires the deployment of small cells and macro towers.</p>
<p>In simple terms, small cells act as signal repeaters that enhance speed, network capacity, and reliability in high-density areas. Macro towers are small transmitters installed on buildings and other structures, allowing telecom operators to support even more devices at faster speeds.</p>
 What’s the difference between 4G and 5G? 
<p>For all intents and purposes, 5G represents a marked improvement over previous networking technologies. According to CISA, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/5g-security-and-resilience">5G offers</a>:</p>
 
 100x faster download speeds: A 3GB movie would take 40 minutes to download on 4G LTE, but only 35 seconds on a 5G network. 
 10x decrease in latency: 5G rapidly accelerates data response times, which can be as low as one millisecond. In other words, you can find what you’re looking for at a moment’s notice. 
 100x network capacity: 5G can handle a much greater volume of network traffic, allowing millions of connected devices to access the same network from the same area without failure. 
 
<p>From telemedicine to industry 4.0, these benefits translate into substantial productivity gains for use cases of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Notably, 5G also represents a significant improvement in terms of cybersecurity. Compared to past generations, it’s been designed from the outset with threat protection as one of its most foundational elements.</p>
<p>The fifth generation also introduces the concept of the Subscriber Concealed Identity (SUCI). In essence, 5G devices don’t send their true identity over the air; instead, they send an encrypted version — the SUCI. This concealment relies on public key cryptography, which encrypts the member’s ID to safeguard against vulnerabilities.</p>
 What is 5G security? 
<p>5G security can be defined as the convergence of cyber and physical security controls for the purpose of protecting an underlying 5G infrastructure. This includes securing hardware, software, network traffic, users, and data that access or flow through any 5G network.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because It’s only a matter of time before security threats challenge your 5G deployment. Although the technology is relatively new, many bad actors are already attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. Given how many critical infrastructures rely on 5G networking, the stakes are growing larger by the day.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are several considerations to keep in mind:</p>
 
 Increased attack surface: With millions and even billions more connected devices, 5G is potentially vulnerable to larger and more sophisticated security threats. 
 IoT device vulnerabilities: IoT devices — especially personal, unmanaged assets — are inherently risky because security isn’t normally built-in by design. Each IoT device on a network represents another potential gap a hacker can expose. Worse yet, whether purposefully or not, organizations are adding new devices in troves. In fact, IDC predicts there will be <a href="https://blogs.idc.com/2021/01/06/future-of-industry-ecosystems-shared-data-and-insights/">55.7 billion</a> connected devices in the world by 2025. 
 Decreased network visibility: With 5G, our networks will only expand and become more usable by mobile users and devices. This means organizations have much more network traffic to manage. But, without a robust security solution, companies may not be able to gain the network visibility required to identify abnormalities or a potential attack. 
 Legacy infrastructure and untrusted components with known vulnerabilities: 5G builds upon previous generations and is currently being integrated with 4G LTE networks that contain legacy vulnerabilities. Some of these may affect 5G equipment and networks despite the integration of additional security features. 
 
 Strategies for a secure 5G network 
<p>Knowing your security gaps is half the battle when it comes to hardening 5G defenses. Let’s explore the possible threat vectors you may face and the various mitigation strategies at your disposal.</p>
 5G security vulnerabilities 
<p>Network slicing, equipment, and virtualized cloud-first configurations are all essential components of 5G infrastructure. However, they also represent important threats with the potential to compromise network security. Here’s a closer look at each one individually:</p>
 
 Network slicing is a configuration strategy that allows multiple networks to stack on top of a common physical infrastructure. Each “slice” of the network can be allocated based on specific needs or use cases. On the downside, this <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3697269/5g-network-slices-could-be-vulnerable-to-attack-researchers-say.html">increases complexity</a> and requires each slice to implement its own security requirements commensurate with its use case. A misconfigured network could allow denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, and other attacks to slip through the cracks. Worse yet, the sheer scale of network slicing introduces billions of potential attack vectors, as a successful breach could infiltrate many slices or domains simultaneously. 
 User equipment (UE) refers to hardware intended for consumer use, such as a mobile phone or IoT device. In a 2022 study, researchers <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10024587">tested the impact</a> that UE-based Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks could have on 5G infrastructure. Not only did their results indicate that 5G networks are vulnerable to DDoS attacks, but a successful strike would prove devastating to network performance. 
 Virtualization and cloud services play a big role in 5G deployment. According to CISA, <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jul/17/2003260829/-1/-1/0/ESF%205G%20NETWORK%20SLICING-SECURITY%20CONSIDERATIONS%20FOR%20DESIGN,%20DEPLOYMENT,%20AND%20MAINTENANCE_FINAL.PDF">most networks</a> are instantiated on virtualized compute, network, and storage resources and leverage both private and public cloud platforms. This means they exist outside the walled perimeter of dedicated servers and protocols. Network functions are now performed by software, and software is hackable — therefore, 5G infrastructure built atop software code is susceptible to attack. 
 
 How to strengthen 5G security 
<p>As <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/tmt/5g/pwc-securing-5gs-future.pdf">PwC argues</a>, all participants in the 5G ecosystem — including mobile operators, network vendors, system integrators and end businesses — should agree to assess the health of every component before it’s permitted to connect to the network. Moreover, they should agree to limit or deny access based on this assessment.</p>
<p>In other words, a robust 5G security architecture must be built upon strict authentication. Accordingly, there are several best practice solutions for doing exactly that:</p>
 1. Zero Trust 
<p>A vital first step towards protecting any network is to <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/how-to-implement-zero-trust-a-comprehensive-guide/">implement a Zero Trust framework</a>. Eliminating implicit trust for all entities will reduce risk exposure across the board, as all components must first undergo a process of risk-based authentication. Only if they meet all access control requirements will they be allowed a network connection, thereby mitigating the threat of unauthorized access.</p>
 2. Public key infrastructure (PKI) 
<p>With an advanced PKI solution, organizations can use cryptographic keys to provide a secure foundation for 5G networking. PKI enables strong authentication procedures, as each entity is issued its own <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates">digital certificate</a> proving its identity.</p>
<p>Take the Entrust PKI portfolio, for example. Our <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/certificate-authority">Certificate Authority</a> solution simplifies certificate lifecycle management, allowing you to issue, revoke, or renew at scale. Reduce the risk of expired certificates poking holes in your security posture by automating the workflow in one transparent interface. Administrators can be automatically notified by email about certificates approaching expiration and can view certificates approaching key lifecycle events via the system dashboard.</p>
 3. Hardware security modules 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/hsm">Hardware security modules</a> (HSMs) should be used to generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys. This critical protection layer keeps keys out of plain sight where a threat actor could intercept them. More importantly, HSMs store high-value cryptographic assets in hardened, tamper-resistant devices, which is widely considered to be best practice. The use of HSMs such as Entrust nShield HSMs are recommended in national and regional standards such as the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Security in 5G Specifications.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>In this episode, Drummond Reed, Director, Trust Services at <a href="https://www.gendigital.com/us/en/">Gen Digital</a>, gives a great overview of the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP), through its 7 Key Pillars.</p>
<p>For listeners of the SSI Orbit Podcast, you may recall Drummond talking about the TSP on some previous episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/converging-towards-a-common-trust-spanning-protocol-with-drummond-reed/">#41</a> &amp; <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/one-trust-spanning-protocol-and-many-trust-tasks-drummond-reed/">#45</a>). These initial episodes still remain great primers on the topic. But since those last episodes, lots of work has been done within the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> to start shaping what this ‘missing trust layer of the internet’ should look like. This podcast episode aims to use the recent <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">Mid-year Progress Report on the TSP</a> as a basis for the conversation.</p>
<p>Once again, Drummond is able to breakdown these somewhat technical concepts into easy to digest content, and does so as eloquently as usual.</p>
<p>As a side note, here is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/">Part 1</a> of the blog post series: Net of Insecurity that is referred to during the podcast discussion.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Drummond and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 Internet’s Broken State: Is the internet considered broken due to issues with security, privacy, authenticity, and confidentiality (SPAC)? How does this relate to the work in the digital trust space, especially with Trust over IP? 
 Trust over IP’s Role: How does the Trust over IP technology architecture address the internet’s shortcomings? Is the SPAC acronym a good framework for understanding the Trust over IP’s approach? 
 Design Principles of Trust Finding Protocol: During the design phase of the trust spanning protocol, were there any trade-offs or concessions made, especially in terms of security, privacy, authenticity, or confidentiality? 
 Pillar 1: Verifiable Identifiers: Explaining the importance of verifiable identifiers as the first key pillar in the design of the trust spanning protocol. 
 Interoperability and Identifiers: Will endpoints need to support the same types of identifiers for interoperability? How does one endpoint evaluate another’s capability to support a particular identifier? 
 Pillar 2: End-to-End Authenticity &amp; Confidentiality: How does the trust spanning protocol ensure both authenticity and confidentiality in communications? 
 Pillar 3: Direct Connections: How does the trust spanning protocol handle direct connections between endpoints using different types of channels? 
 Pillar 4: Routing via Intermediaries: How does the protocol handle routing through intermediaries to ensure privacy and security? What might a practical implementation of this look like in the future? 
 Pillar 5: Relationship Context Channels: How does the trust spanning protocol handle changes in the context of interactions between endpoints? 
 Pillar 6: Text and Binary Encoding: How does the trust spanning protocol standardize the way endpoints communicate using text and binary encoding? 
 Pillar 7: Trust Task Protocol Framework: What is the trust task protocol framework, and how does it relate to specific protocols for different types of trust tasks? 
 Conclusion and Future: What’s next for the trust spanning protocol? Are there any regulatory movements, like the Digital Markets Act, that might influence its development and adoption?

<p>I use the word “own” here figuratively, in the sense of taking responsibility for the consequences of biometric face matching.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kashmirhill.com/bio">Kashmir Hill</a>’s forceful new book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Face-Belongs-Us-Secretive/dp/0593448561">Your face belongs to us</a>” sets out the challenges posed by facial recognition technology for privacy, personal safety, law and order, even national security.&nbsp; She expertly stakes out the territory, for which there is no clear way to best respond.</p>
<p>There have been isolated regulatory initiatives to rein in facial recognition such as Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act 2008.</p>
<p>At the same time, biometric authentication has become normalised through smart phones. Here the technology is well managed and in my view benign, thanks to strict standards set by handset manufacturers and the FIDO Alliance that restrain biometric storage and matching to the secure elements inside personal devices.</p>
<p>Facial recognition for authentication is a hot topic in Australia. Here the federal government’s IDMatch facility includes a <a href="https://www.idmatch.gov.au/our-services#section-1">Face Verification Service.</a> And the recently released draft <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say">Digital ID Bill</a> incorporates various biometric safeguards, in anticipation of facially verified identification.</p>
<p>New laws to regulate new technologies is a familiar battleground. It seems that the same sort of public debates have come and gone for years, and reappeared. When a given technology has legitimate uses, the arguments are especially fraught.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but I have been close to law reform since the late 1990s when electronic signature regulations emerged, and then through several waves of privacy reviews. I have learned the practical strength of technology neutrality and now laud the <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-regulatory-superpower-of-technology-neutrality/">superpower</a> of principles-based data protection. This regulatory philosophy leads to controls that are relatively resilient in the face of technologicl progress.</p>
<p>Given how difficult it is to write new laws, it’s important to make use of existing jurisprudence wherever we can. I call myself a regulatory conservationist – if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>In this regard, existing privacy law may contain a way to restrain facial recognition, at least in the predominant technology-neutral <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4426146">jurisdictions</a>.</p>
<p>Australia’s data protection authority, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has led the way in extending the principle of collection limitation from direct to indirect collection. In looking at the way data analytics can generate personal information, the OAIC has issued this <a>guidance</a>:</p>
<p>“The concept of ‘collects’ applies broadly, and includes gathering, acquiring or obtaining personal information from any source and by any means. This includes collection by ‘creation’ which may occur when information is created with reference to, or generated from, other information” (italics added by me).</p>
<p>So this suggests to me that the generation of facial matches constitutes personal information collection and as such, needs to comply with data protection laws.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when a facial recognition service such as Clearview AI is used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These services hold databases of reference images and names (exactly how these databases are put together is another story). A query is sent to the service with an image of the target person, known in biometrics as a probe, which is run against the reference set.&nbsp; If a match is found, then a response is generated with the effect of adding a name or other identification to the probe image.</p>
<p>So here’s the thing. A record that associates an image of a natural person with their name is new personal data.</p>
<p>That record did not exist before the biometric match was made. And under technology neutral laws as we have seen, such a record can be deemed to have been collected by both the facial recognition service and the party making the query. How the record is then used is another matter. Even if the record is not used, the Collection Limitation principle may apply (and anyway, the facial recognition services probably do retain and continue to use the new match as part of their ongoing training efforts).</p>
[Note also that it is irrelevant if reference material is sourced from the “public domain” (by trawling web sites and social media as Clearview AI has done). The publicness of the reference material is not relevant to the case I am trying to make here. I know there are separate arguments that repurposing “public” images (for training biometric algorithms for instance) represents another sort of privacy breach.]
<p>This sort of remote identification is therefore subject to existing data privacy principles and laws where applicable. &nbsp;Such laws might mandate that the naming of a facial image be done only with the consent of the named individual. And the fact that sort of creation and collection is being offered would also have to be declared and explained in a privacy notice.</p>

You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF58 is live today, Oct 5. It concludes on Oct 12. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF58   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF58 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>The second half of September was jam-packed with exciting events for local-first, programming language theory, and distributed systems aficionados. First, <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> partnered with <a href="https://www.gradientretreat.com/">Gradient Retreat</a> to host <a href="https://lu.ma/trainjam2023">TrainJam</a>, a rail adventure to St. Louis, to attend the last 😭 Strange Loop conference. Then, at <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a>, Brooklyn gave a talk on IPVM and Fission's edge computing stack, and we attended the PWLConf co-located with Strange Loop (and co-organized by Fission Staff Researcher Zeeshan). Finally, we capped it all off with the <a href="https://lu.ma/localfirstswunconf-stlouis">LoFi Unconference</a>. Organized by ourselves, <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a>, and <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink &amp; Switch</a>, this sold-out event explored how we can bring local-first software into the hands of more users. </p> TrainJam <p>Departing from Seattle, fourteen engineers set out for St. Louis via the Empire Builder Line, sharing ideas, code, and coffee along the way. Here's a dispatch from Fission Protocol Engineer Brian, who rode the rails:</p><p>The TrainJam experience was a bit like being at a conference but with just the hallway track. We didn’t have structured sessions and instead spent time in ad hoc discussions about local first, offline, and many other topics.</p><p>One train jammer brought a 5G hotspot and distributed little mesh nodes to a few roomettes. In places where cell service was available, we had reasonably good Internet!</p>TrainJam sticker designed by Bruno Monteiro<p>The highlights for me were getting to know people and their stories. What have they worked on in tech? What do they work on now? One unexpected bonus was that sometimes you would take a meal with random other train riders. I heard great stories from folks riding the rails for travel and pleasure.</p><p>Also, I made a lot of coffee for folks. Amtrak coffee is pretty terrible, and I brought two pounds of coffee in preparation. My little barista setup ended up being quite popular. 😄</p> Strange Loop <p>Kicking off Strange Loop was the <a href="https://pwlconf.org/">PWLConf track</a>, co-organized and run by Staff Research Engineer Zeeshan Lakhani. </p><p>Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, presented on IPVM. Below is the abstract for her talk and the recording:</p><p>The advent of TCP/IP and the web produced an explosion of innovation by radically lowering the barrier to entry to networking. Thanks to recent technical and social innovation, we now have the building blocks for the next generation of open services: location-free verifiable data and computation. This talk presents UCAN Invocation and the Interplanetary VM (IPVM). IPVM code runs anywhere (even offline), respects data privacy, and services interoperate seamlessly without pre-negotiation. Verifiable computation opens the door to content-addressed invocations, results, and workflows. This greatly lowers the complexity over traditional architectures (e.g. LAMP). Not only is this easier to reason about, but it also (paradoxically) has better than linear scaling: the more it's used, the faster it is! As anyone can participate, it doesn't depend on the handful of data centres provided by large orgs: anyone can provide capacity (including in underserved regions like Africa and South America).</p><p>Fission Staff Research Engineer Zeeshan Lakhani had a unique role during Strange Loop as co-organizer of the <a href="https://pwlconf.org/">PWLConf</a>; an official speaker track this year. Here are his thoughts about PWLConf and StrangeLoop:</p><p>In all its grandeur, Strange Loop has been a special conference for me over the years. I’ve been attending since 2012 almost regularly; we started running PWLConf in 2016. </p><p>For me, Strange Loop is a time to see old friends, commiserate about the state of our world and technology, and try to find a few bits and pieces of inspiration for the future. Our track and the conference as a whole were amazing, and Alex Miller really put on one hell of a run. I can’t weigh in on any PWL talks (I’m an organizer, after all). But, I will give a big shout-out to Valeria de Paiva’s <a href="https://pwlconf.org/2023/valeria-de-paiva/">War Time Proofs and Futuristic Programs</a>, which beautifully wove lots of context, history, and theory.</p><p>Additionally, we had a lot of people wondering about Papers We Love’s plans for 2024. All I can say right now is, please fill out our <a href="https://zfrmz.com/dbTykoGvhN4dbthJskaP">survey</a>; more is to come!</p><p>From Brian:</p><p>At the conference, I volunteered with Zeeshan and the Papers We Love crew on the PWLConf track. </p><p>The opening talk by Andrew Black <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/why-programming-languages-matter.html">Why Programming Languages Matter</a> had great reflections on the languages he has worked on over the years, and he discussed some interesting aspects of usability and the design of new languages. His talk and the three after were absolutely packed. We had to track down additional chairs to seat the audience despite it being the largest room at the conference!</p><p>Mae Milano’s <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/programming-distributed-systems.html">Programming Distributed Systems</a> talk that followed immediately afterward was also excellent and felt like an overview of many of the topics we have covered in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey_Adz2pUZFQdw7sp2mSiSbV">Distributed Systems reading group</a>. </p><p>I stepped out of volunteer duty to watch Evan Czaplicki’s <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/the-economics-of-programming-languages.html">The Economics of Programming Languages</a>. Evan invented the Elm programming language, which inspired me while I was learning to program. Evan has struggled over the years to find the best way to support work on Elm. Patronage worked well for many years, but corporate (mis)incentives have not always worked out. He compared Elm with other programming languages and how they are funded. It’s not great; corporate and patronage models seem the most successful, and mostly community and open source approaches have only succeeded in a few cases. (Python is one example.)</p> Lo-Fi Unconference <p>Nearly 100 attendees came to the TechArtista Downtown for a day filled with small-group discussions, demos, and lightning talks. The event brought together folks building frameworks or tools, developing local-first apps, or researching the area. Some attendees were new to local-first software development and wanted to learn more. Here are some insights about that day from Brian:</p><p>What a great gathering of interesting folks and projects! I presented a version of our <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/local-first-unconf-workshop-2023">ODD SDK workshop</a> that focused on local-only data with the option to make a Fission account to sync and persist data. We teamed up with <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a> to demonstrate frameworks that focus on local-first apps. </p><p>One takeaway was that lots of folks are interested in local first! The event was sold out, with folks waiting to enter. A few folks listed themselves and their projects in a <a href="https://github.com/LoFiUnconf/stlouis2023">GitHub repo</a>. In addition, <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/%201">a community has formed</a> around LoFi with an active Discord server.</p>Todd explaining the LoFi Unconf logo design and conceptual background.Intro by Brooklyn of the LoFi Unconf frontiers. Privacy, trust, accounts, disorderly programming - some of the stuff to work on.Kicking off LoFi Unconf with Martin Kleppman presenting remotely.<p>All in all, our visit to St. Louis was invigorating. We connected with many talented builders with novel ideas that will undoubtedly push the field forward. Even though the curtain has fallen on Strange Loop, the community that has grown out of it is strong and will continue to thrive.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who joined us at our various events!

				  Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens (SD-JWTs) provide a key mechanism for selectively disclosing individual elements of a JSON object. Thanks to recent work by Indicio, this credential format has been added to Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py). Here’s what it means for you.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Char Howland</p>
<p>Indicio has added support for the SD-JWT credential format to Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py). This recent contribution includes API endpoints that sign and verify SD-JWT payloads. This investment in updating protocols demonstrates the Aries community’s commitment to and progress towards providing compatibility with the standards selected by the EU. Further work will enable the exchange of SD-JWT credentials both within the existing DIDComm based Verifiable Credential (VC) protocols as well as the OpenID4VC protocols, for which Aries support is already in progress. Adding the EU standards to the AnonCreds and DIDComm VC Protocols provides the best of both worlds: regulatory compliance when needed, demonstrable privacy, power, and additional capability when required by the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aries is committed to being a premium codebase for the support of all standards that facilitate Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) and decentralized identity. The Aries community prides itself on flexibility: this was not the first external standard chosen by the Aries community for interoperability, and it won’t be the last.</p>
<p>Selective Disclosure Json Web Tokens (SD-JWTs) provide a mechanism for selectively disclosing individual elements of a JSON object used as the payload of a JWS structure. SD-JWTs add an important privacy-preserving feature for the use of JWTs as verifiable credentials. SD-JWTs do not have all the features of AnonCreds, but their development is a step forward for technologies that require the use of JWTs.</p>
<p>SD-JWTs provide a variety of selective disclosure options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recipient of a JWT can view all claims within the JWT. As described in the SD-JWT specification, if the holder wants to reveal only a subset of the claims in their SD-JWT during a presentation, the claims in the payload of the SD-JWT are hashed and therefore not viewable to the verifier. For the claims that the holder would like to reveal, the holder includes disclosures, which are the plaintext claims corresponding to the hashed claims in the payload. When the verifier receives the SD-JWT with the disclosures, it hashes each disclosure to ensure that the result matches one of the hashed claims in the payload. If it matches, then the verifier has proof that that claim is in the original signed SD-JWT, but they can’t view any claims in the SD-JWT that do not have a corresponding disclosure provided by the holder.</p>
<p>To provide an analogy for this mechanism, consider receiving an SD-JWT as if you were receiving a large locked box. You have the key for it, and when you open it, you discover that inside the large box there are several small locked boxes inside, as well as keys to a subset of those lockboxes. You unlock these boxes for which you have been given keys and discover their contents; however,you can’t open the boxes for which you didn’t receive corresponding keys. By contrast, a JWT would be the same as receiving a large box, unlocking it, and being able to view all of its contents. If I don’t need to view every item within the box but the items cannot be taken out of the box, the SD-JWT is the more privacy-preserving option.</p>
<p>A feature of SD-JWTs is that the issuer decides which claims can be selectively disclosable. The holder can only selectively disclose the claims that the issuer has designated as selectively disclosable. For the claims that the issuer has not designated as selectively disclosable, the holder has no choice but to reveal those claims when they present the SD-JWT. In this implementation, by default, all claims at all levels of the payload can be selectively disclosable, unless indicated otherwise by the issuer (with the exception of essential verification data such as iss, iat, cnf, etc., which are always visible). If the issuer does not want a claim to be able to be selectively disclosable, they must provide a JSON path, which specifies the claim’s location within the JSON structure.</p>
<p>This implementation supports various options for the selective disclosability of nested structures within the payload. Consider the nested structure of the “address” claim, which has subclaims of “street address,” “city,” and “zip code.” The issuer can determine the ways in which the holder can selectively disclose this claim and its subclaims.</p>
<p>One option is that the issuer can decide to treat the address claim as a block that can either be disclosed completely or not at all. In this case, neither “address” nor its subclaims are visible in the payload, giving the holder the option to choose whether or not to reveal this information in a presentation. The plaintext disclosure corresponding to the “address” claim will contain each subclaim, which means that if the holder includes this disclosure, they will reveal every subclaim. In this implementation, the issuer provides JSON paths to the subclaims to indicate that they are not selectively disclosable.</p>
<p>If the issuer wants to handle the object in a more structured manner, it may instead decide to make the “address” claim contents selectively disclosable individually. In this case, “address” is visible in the payload and is not able to be selectively disclosable, but its subclaims are hashed. The holder will receive disclosures for each subclaim, so that they can decide which specific subclaims to reveal by including their corresponding disclosures in the presentation. In this implementation, the issuer provides JSON paths only to the “address” claim, leaving the subclaims at their default selective disclosability.</p>
<p>A final option is that the issuer may decide to make the “address” claim selectively disclosable as a block and its individual subclaims recursively selectively disclosable. In this case, the “address” claim is hashed in the payload as in the first option, but its corresponding disclosure contains hashes of the individual subclaims. The hashes of these individual subclaims each have corresponding disclosures. In this implementation, the issuer provides no JSON paths related to “address” or its subclaims, leaving each at their default selective disclosability.</p>
<p>In addition, this implementation supports the selective disclosure of array items, which can be indicated by the issuer using list indexing or splicing, as well as an optional mechanism for key binding, which is the concept of binding an SD-JWT to a holder’s public key and requiring that the holder prove possession of the corresponding private key when presenting the SD-JWT.</p>
<p>This addition provides the foundation for further support, both for use with the OpenID4VC protocols as well as the DIDComm Verifiable Credential protocols. This work allows Indicio to better support those that have requirements to adopt the standards being endorsed by the European Union. These technologies work alongside our existing technologies within Aries and those available as part of our Proven product, allowing Indicio to better support those who need to adopt the standards endorsed by the European Union.</p>

 CNP fraud is projected to account for 73% of all payment fraud in 2023; a whopping 57% increase on 2019. But, what’s the reason for the increase, and what can businesses do about it? 



 



<p>In recent years, card not present (CNP) fraud has become one of the most common types of payment fraud, especially in the online gambling sector. In fact, <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/card-not-present-fraud-payment">overall losses are expected to reach $9.49 billion</a> by the end of the year, marking an 8.5% increase on 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why CNP fraud is so common is because CNP transactions don’t require a physical card, just the details from it. Fraudsters can therefore steal and use the cardholder’s name, billing address, account number, CVV security code, and expiration date without needing to obtain the actual card. But online casinos are fighting back.&nbsp;</p>



 What is CNP fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Put simply, CNP fraud occurs when a fraudster steals someone’s credit card information for transactions that do not involve a physical card, such as over the phone or on the internet. It usually constitutes a criminal using someone else’s credit card information and is also seen as a form of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>.&nbsp;Discover about the darkest form of identity theft, ghosting fraud, in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ghosting-fraud-dead/">blog ‘Ghosting fraud: Are you doing business with the dead?’.</a></p>



 Understanding CNP fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can be detrimental to businesses and users in numerous ways. The most obvious is that the victim of CNP fraud may be unable to reclaim their lost money. If a cardholder is unable to file a chargeback successfully, then the responsibility for the fraudulent transaction passes to the gambling platform. What can make this scenario even worse is that if a gambling platform receives excessive chargebacks within a specific timeframe, its payment service provider may impose penalties on the operator or even terminate their contract.&nbsp;</p>



 How does CNP fraud occur?&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud occurs when a criminal acquires payment information from a cardholder without their permission and uses it to buy products or services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nowadays, criminals can easily buy ‘fullz’ (packages of individuals’ identifying information) through the dark web or obtain via phishing attacks or data breaches.&nbsp;</p>



 Online casinos and CNP fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>Online casinos rely solely on digital payments, so are considered prime targets for CNP fraud. As cardholders are not present during CNP transactions, it makes it all the more convenient for criminals to use stolen card details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online casinos often deal with high transaction volumes, making identifying fraudulent transactions difficult. That alone gives rise to payment fraud in online gambling. A few signs that an online casino may be vulnerable to CNP fraud include a lack of proper security measures like SSL encryption and 2FA and a considerable number of chargebacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that not all casino platforms are equally vulnerable to CNP fraud since some have better payment fraud prevention measures in place than others.&nbsp;</p>



 What are CNP red flags to look out for?&nbsp; 



<p>Red flags for potential CNP fraud in online casinos include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Frequent chargebacks: Many chargebacks can be considered a clear sign of CNP fraud since players may be using stolen cards and later reporting unauthorized transactions.<br>  Large numbers of small transactions: Fraudsters may make several small transactions to test the validity of stolen card information.<br>  Failed transactions: Repeated failed attempts to verify payment information usually indicates fraudulent activity.<br>  Multiple accounts from a single IP address: Multiple accounts originating from the same IP address usually implies fraudulent activities, e.g., one individual using multiple stolen cards.<br>  Rapid deposits and withdrawals: Fraudsters often try to deposit funds, play a few rounds, and quickly withdraw their funds before their activity is detected.&nbsp;  



 How does CNP fraud impact online casinos?&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can have a significant impact on online casinos in numerous ways:&nbsp;</p>



 Financial losses.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can result in significant financial losses for casino platforms. Chargebacks are a common phenomenon in this type of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/fraud/">fraud</a>. If a platform receives significant chargebacks within a specific period, its payment provider may impose penalties or even end its contract.&nbsp;</p>



 Reputational damage.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud, once discovered, can severely damage the reputation of online casinos. Negative reviews and publicity discourage new users from joining, resulting in a decrease in revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Legal and regulatory consequences.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can lead to severe legal and regulatory consequences for online casinos. Operators may face hefty fines or even criminal charges if they are found to be negligent in preventing CNP fraud. The costs related to legal proceedings can be considerable, which further adds to the financial impact of CNP fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Can online casinos recover from the damage caused by CNP fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>While online casinos can recover from the reputational and financial damage caused by CNP fraud, it requires time and effort. For financial recovery, casino platforms need to implement strict CNP fraud prevention measures, such as anti-fraud software and multi-factor authentication. Operators can also work with payment service providers to reduce charges and potentially recover lost funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of dealing with reputational damage, casino operators can be transparent with their users regarding the steps they need to take to prevent fraud and offer compensation to those affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Preventing CNP fraud in online casinos.&nbsp; 



<p>Operators can implement various CNP fraud prevention strategies:&nbsp;</p>



 Robust identity verification. 



<p>Implementing robust identity verification processes like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC),</a> is effective in fraud prevention and can combat crimes like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>. KYC processes typically include document verification, which involves submitting government-issued identification documents that the online casino verifies. Biometric authentication, such as fingerprint scanning and facial recognition, is also effective in verifying the identity of users.&nbsp;Read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/importance-of-kyc-in-online-casinos/">importance of KYC in online casinos in our blog</a>.</p>



 Multi-factor authentication.&nbsp; 



<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires users to provide multiple forms of authentication, such as a one-time password sent to their mobile phone, before accessing their account. MFA enhances security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication. There are three main categories. Something you know, such as a password; Something you have, like a phone with an authentication app or one time passcode; and Something you are, such as a biometric feature like a fingerprint, face, voice, or other biometric piece of information. With MFA, users must present more than one of these factors, before gaining access to their account. This adds an extra layer of security to the conventional login process.&nbsp;</p>



 AI and machine learning solutions.&nbsp; 



<p>Emerging technologies like AI and ML can help operators combat CNP fraud. For example, AI-powered identity verification services can validate player identities by comparing submitted information with external databases, identity documents, and biometric data. This helps ensure players are who they claim to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Regular security updates. 



<p>Online casinos should regularly update their security measures for protection against CNP fraud. How often they should update their online casino security measures depends on factors including the size of the casino, the existing security measures, and the risk associated with fraud. However, operators must review their security protocols at least once a year. It is also important to note that operators must comply with anti-fraud laws like KYC and AML.&nbsp;</p>



 How can players protect themselves against CNP fraud in online casinos?&nbsp; 



<p>Players can protect themselves and prevent CNP fraud by the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Only signing up with licensed casinos<br>  Verifying their identity through the online casino’s KYC process<br>  Keeping their login information secure<br>  Following the casino’s fraud prevention policies and procedures<br>  Using security features such as multiple-factor authentication<br>  Frequently checking their accounts for suspicious activity or transactions<br>  Informing the online casino of any suspicious transactions or activity on their account&nbsp;  



 How online casinos can prevent CNP fraud while ensuring seamless gaming experiences.&nbsp; 



<p>As CNP fraud remains a serious threat to online casinos, operators must implement robust safety measures to prevent it. Online casinos can achieve this through the use of MFA processes, state-of-the-art fraud detection technologies such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">anti-spoofing facial recognition</a>, and secure payment gateways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, it is equally crucial to maintain a healthy balance between security and a seamless gaming experience for users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preventing CNP fraud should be a top priority for operators to maintain their integrity and protect their bottom line.&nbsp;</p>



 Card not present? Well, identity verification should be.&nbsp;

			<p>Blockchain technology, though in the mainstream for less than a decade, has already seen a meteoric rise. The boom&nbsp;has been reminiscent of previous groundbreaking innovations like the printing press, the lightbulb, and the telephone. What the internet was for information, blockchain is for value.&nbsp;While price fluctuations of crypto and NFTs dominate headlines, the true potential of blockchain lies in its application to RWA (real-world assets) and securities. ERC3643</p>
<p>However, when dealing with RWA and securities, regulatory bodies worldwide have many requirements that must be abided by. But how do we enforce these guidelines while operating on a public blockchain infrastructure?&nbsp;The implementation of ERC3643 solves this&nbsp;problem.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 How RWAs are the next stage in the blockchain evolution 
<p>In the fledgling years of blockchain, many were led to believe that crypto and NFTs are the most transformational innovations to come out of decentralized technologies.</p>
<p>In fact, that couldn’t be further from reality. The reality is it doesn’t even come close to the global market cap of RWAs. According to&nbsp;<a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, as of September 1st, 2023, the overall crypto market cap is&nbsp;$1.09T.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/for-digital-assets-private-markets-offer-the-greatest-opportunities/">report</a>&nbsp;titled: “For Digital Assets, Private Markets Offer the Greatest Opportunities” published by Bain and Co, the global real estate market alone&nbsp;exceeds ˜$330T.&nbsp;The overall crypto market size is about 0.3% of this market alone, not to mention the entire capital market.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>When combined with all private and public assets worldwide, RWA vastly surpasses the market cap of crypto, NFTs, and other blockchain subsets put together.</p>
<p>Blockchain is a transformative technology with numerous applications. Its potential is immense when tailored to RWA. The primary reason we haven’t unlocked the vast value and potential of these assets yet is their&nbsp;predominantly private nature. The private markets are notably fragmented and opaque. This results in operational inefficiencies, which blockchain aims to eliminate.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 The complexities and inefficiencies that exist in the private markets today 
<p>Traditionally, for investors in the private sector, addressing liquidity and finding a market for private investments is a critical challenge globally. Despite the potential for higher returns in the private sector, an illiquid investment can be a problem without an active market or willing buyers.</p>
<p>The main reason for this pitfall is the outdated and fragmented infrastructure of the current framework.&nbsp;Due to this limited infrastructure, the buying and selling process of private assets becomes inefficient.&nbsp;This leads to a significant liquidity discount and sometimes even the avoidance of transactions.</p>
<p>Whether you own a real estate property, a limited partner (LP) interest in a fund, or a stake in a private company, the seller has to take some arduous steps in order to find a willing buyer.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 The process includes: 
 
 Sourcing a buyer 
 Negotiating the terms of the sale 
 Conducting due diligence 
 Transfer of ownership 
 

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>The duration of the process involved in private market transactions can be prolonged. Often, it can span from several weeks to several months and, in some cases, even years. It is a high-cost and time-consuming process that would be improved if conducted on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The good news is in every fragmented market, there is room for innovation and disruption, which is where blockchain comes into play. A suitable blockchain standard must be specifically designed with&nbsp;smart contracts&nbsp;to meet regulatory needs and unlock the vast value of these assets.</p>
<p>When conducting the same activities on a blockchain-based system, many of these processes previously mentioned steps are achieved in a vastly faster and more efficient manner.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p>Here is what is different in the four steps mentioned above in the traditional private market, versus when using ERC3643:</p>

		 
	 
     <a>Traditional Private Market</a>  <a>Private Market with ERC3643</a>      <a>  Traditional Private Market   </a>  
	 
		 
			 
 Sourcing a buyer:&nbsp;Personal networks, word of mouth, or by working with an intermediary, such as a broker-dealer or investment bank. 
 
 
 Negotiating the terms of the sale:&nbsp;This can involve several rounds of discussions and revisions before both parties agree on the terms of the sale. 
 
 
 Conducting due diligence: This can involve reviewing financial statements, legal documents, contracts, and other company records, as well as the buyer’s eligibility.&nbsp;The entire process requires document sharing via mail, emails, and sometimes even through a fax. 
 
 
 Transfer of ownership:&nbsp;This is the end of the lifecycle and where the ownership of the asset or&nbsp;security&nbsp;actually changes hands. In many cases, the ownership is contained in Excel sheets. In other cases, there is a clearing process; custodians of buyers and sellers have to ensure payment has arrived before transferring the ownership. 
 

		 
	 
    <a>  Private Market with ERC3643   </a>  
	 
		 
			 
 Sourcing a buyer:&nbsp;Once assets are published on the blockchain network, it is made available to interact with any applications on the same network, allowing asset holders to have direct access to a vastly larger amount of potential counterparties. It could be on a multitude of marketplaces, including centralized exchanges,&nbsp;decentralized exchanges, even using your security as a means for&nbsp;staking&nbsp;or collateralized loans, and more. 
 Negotiating terms of the sale:&nbsp;On the trading platforms, the negotiation is up to the market and supply and demand. On the platform, the investor is seeking a counterparty, not so much negotiating with one individual, making it a more streamlined process. For peer-to-peer trading, on-chain or off-chain negotiations can take place to reach an agreement. 
 Conducting due diligence:&nbsp;A verifiable due diligence certificate can be made available and embedded into the tokens. Moreover, counterparts’ eligibility can also be verified by smart contracts directly through verifiable credentials. The entire process is streamlined to improve efficiency while ensuring compliance. 
 Transfer of ownership:&nbsp;If the payment method is a token (stablecoins, tokenized cash, or crypto), the transfer/swap of tokens is instant without counterparty risk. The ERC3643 smart contract ensures transfers only occur when investor and offering rules are met, enabling peer-to-peer transfers, which was impossible before in the traditional world. 
 

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 How does RWA tokenization work? 
<p>We must ensure compliance since tokenized RWA are&nbsp;securities. In most jurisdictions, RWA must be owned by an investment vehicle, and investors will invest in the financial products that this vehicle structures, such as shares or debt. These financial products are securities that require enforced compliance based on existing regulations. This means that only certain investors can become asset owners (e.g., KYC’d European citizens). In Europe, the MiCA regulation clearly defines&nbsp;<a href="https://securities.cib.bnpparibas/markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation/">security tokens as securities</a>, necessitating adherence to MiFID, the existing securities regulations.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Comparing and contrasting the major token standards 
<p>When one uses the term “standard,” it refers to a&nbsp;predefined set of rules or guidelines tailored for a specific purpose. Such standards ensure consistency and uniformity, allowing diverse applications and assets to interact smoothly through the <a href="https://tokeny.com/how-we-are-building-an-interoperable-ecosystem-for-private-markets/">interoperability</a> offered by a blockchain network.</p>
<p>However, standards can bring certain limitations and when trying to utilize them for a specific purpose or use case. Take RWA, for example. A standard is needed that can potentially deal with hundreds of different jurisdictional securities laws for a multitude of parties, all automatically executable on-chain. That is no easy job to do.</p>
<p>Now that one has a good understanding of what a standard is, let’s break down some of the more commonly utilized standards like ERC20 and ERC721.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>ERC20</a>  <a>ERC721</a>  <a>ERC3643</a>      <a>  ERC20   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ERC20 is a permissionless token standard. It is the most commonly known and used standard today and defines a set of simple rules that developers can follow to create their own tokens on the Ethereum blockchain or any EVM-compatible blockchain.&nbsp;This standard relates to fungible tokens, meaning they are identical in both type and value. This feature enables their easy exchange on platforms like trading exchanges and for various similar functions. Any token and platform compatible with ERC20 are interoperable.</p>
 Common examples:&nbsp; 
 
 Tokens:&nbsp;WETH, BAT, USDC 
 Exchanges:&nbsp;Decentralized exchanges&nbsp;like&nbsp;Uniswap&nbsp;or&nbsp;Sushiswap&nbsp;are compatible with all ERC20 tokens 
 Other&nbsp;DeFi&nbsp;governance tokens:&nbsp;Aave, Compound 
 

		 
	 
    <a>  ERC721   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ERC721 is a popular standard employed in the non-fungible&nbsp;token (NFT) domain. Unlike ERC20 tokens, which are interchangeable with one another, ERC721 tokens are innately unique.&nbsp;Each token issued from the smart contract represents ownership over a specific digital asset. Their unique nature makes them ideal for applications like collectibles or any item that demands distinct representation.</p>
 Common examples&nbsp; 
 
 NFTs: Bored Apes, Cryptopunks, etc 
 Marketplaces:&nbsp;Opensea, LooksRare 
 

		 
	 
  <p>Important to understand: ERC721 is the specific standard utilized for innately unique assets on any EVM-compatible blockchain.</p>      <a>  ERC3643   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ERC3643 is a standard tailored for <a href="https://tokeny.com/permissioned-tokens-the-key-to-interoperable-distribution/">permissioned tokens</a>, allowing issuers and users to track the ownership of tokens and to program lifecycle management rules. It makes this standard perfectly suitable for securities tokenization,&nbsp;web3&nbsp;loyalty programs, or digital payment systems.&nbsp;Given the intricate regulations around securities, this standard is crucial for those aiming to tokenize RWA.</p>
<p>The primary distinction between RWA and ERC20/ERC721 tokens is that they are&nbsp;permissionless&nbsp;tokens and can be transferred to anyone. Moreover, it’s difficult to differentiate the identities of their users. In the securities realm, this is problematic because they can not be transferred to unidentified investors. Users must undergo KYC/AML checks and get qualified by issuers or their compliance agent before making an investment as required by law. Moreover, if RWA were freely traded by anyone on the blockchain, it would permit unrestricted buying and selling globally, which is not allowed in the world of securities.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p>ERC3643 tokens ensure that transfers can only happen when both investor rules and offering rules are met.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			<p>Notably, the ERC3643 token is not solely used for compliance. Instead, guarantees the rights and duties of different stakeholders via digital identities. This enables investors to prove their ownership and enforce rights even for offchain assets.</p>
<p>Moreover, securities have an extensive lifecycle, requiring many more functions than what the ERC20 standard provides. In order to accommodate the complexities, the ERC3643 standard provides more than 120 functions — 10 times more than ERC20 tokens — to bring control and automation for post-issuance operations, such as the ability to block or recover tokens. These functions empower issuers to carry out necessary operations and fulfill their regulatory obligations.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>So, the question is: “How do we combine the best of both worlds of an open blockchain network and compliance integrated, while protecting the privacy of the users?”</p>
<p>The answer to that is by embedding verifiable digital identities on-chain into the token via&nbsp;ONCHAINID.</p>
 Verifiable on-chain digital identities coupled with ERC3643 
<p>ONCHAINID is an open-source self-sovereign identity smart contract that enables tokens and applications to identify individuals and organizations, allowing them to enforce automated compliance and access digital assets all on-chain without intermediary intervention.</p>
<p>ERC3643 uses ONCHAINID to verify if users meet eligibility rules token issuers preset. ERC3643 tokens also link token ownership with users’ ONCHAINID instead of&nbsp;wallet&nbsp;addresses.</p>
<p>The eligibility rules are verified through credentials issued by an identifier. Token issuers are the one who decide which identifier they trust. For example, they can appoint a KYC provider ABC to be the identifier to check users’ eligibility A.</p>
<p>Once investors’ documents and information are verified off-chain by KYC provider ABC, a hashed/anonymous credential will be issued as proof of this user fulfilling eligibility A.&nbsp;The ERC3643 token this user invests in and acquires is directly checking their on-chain proof (credentials), determining their permissions.</p>
<p>This on-chain evidence directly correlates with the purchased security. Since everything operates on-chain, the smart contract has embedded rules that are automatically executed or denied.</p>
 Consider three investors: 
 
 Investor A:&nbsp;Completed KYC/AML and other onboarding requirements and invested in security X 
 Investor B:&nbsp;Same as Investor A 
 Investor C:&nbsp;Hasn’t completed onboarding but possesses a self-custody wallet 
 
 Now consider these scenarios: 
 
 Scenario 1:&nbsp;Investor A seeks a counterparty on a public blockchain to sell to Investor C. Due to the smart contract’s configuration, since Investor C isn’t verified, the transaction is declined 
 Scenario 2:&nbsp;Investor A looks for a counterparty on a public blockchain to sell security X to Investor B. The transaction is authorized and executed by the blockchain, as both Investor A and B comply with the smart contract’s guidelines 
 
<p>Thanks to embedding compliance rules on-chain into the token itself, investors are free to do as they wish with their assets as long as they abide by the rules.</p>
 Interoperable securities unlock liquidity 
<p>Imagine when RWA tokens can be used just like any other ERC20 while complying with regulations. It can open the door for global distribution to be connected and make peer-to-peer transfers as long as counterparts are verified users. It can also be used in&nbsp;DeFi&nbsp;to earn extra yields or borrow funds.&nbsp;Ultimately, the liquidity of RWA will be unlocked and facilitate financial inclusions.</p>
 The future of blockchain 
<p>Blockchain is entering a new era where regulation reigns supreme, and if issuers aren’t following any regulatory guidelines, the clock is ticking.</p>
<p>The forthcoming blockchain trend won’t be characterized by dramatic peaks and valleys but by enduring sustainability. Public blockchain networks are poised to revolutionize global capital markets. This transformation will democratize participation and investment while ensuring individuals maintain control over their data and assets.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 FAQ 

		 
	 
    <a>What are Real-World Assets (RWA) in the context of blockchain?</a>  <a>How does ERC3643 differ from other Ethereum standards like ERC20 or ERC721?</a>  <a>Why is regulatory compliance so important in the context of tokenizing RWA?</a>  <a>What is ONCHAINID and how does it fit into the ERC3643 standard?</a>  <a>How do digital identities protect user privacy while ensuring compliance?</a>      <a>  What are Real-World Assets (RWA) in the context of blockchain?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>RWA refers to tangible and intangible assets like real estate, securities, or commodities. When tokenized using blockchain, these assets can be represented, traded, or managed on decentralized platforms, combining the benefits of traditional assets with the flexibility and efficiency of blockchain technology.</p>

    <a>  How does ERC3643 differ from other Ethereum standards like ERC20 or ERC721?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>While ERC20 and ERC721 standards cater to fungible and non-fungible tokens respectively, ERC3643 is tailored for permissioned tokens. This means it’s designed to integrate with real-world regulations and compliance requirements, making it ideal for RWA. It provides over 120 functions to offer control and automation, which are crucial for post-issuance operations of security tokens.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>  Why is regulatory compliance so important in the context of tokenizing RWA?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>Regulatory compliance ensures the legitimacy and security of tokenized assets, and it is a regulatory obligation of token issuers. Without adhering to regulations, there’s a risk of legal repercussions, loss of trust, and potential misuse or fraud. Especially with RWA, where assets have real-world implications and values, compliance ensures smooth operation and acceptance by traditional financial institutions.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>  What is ONCHAINID and how does it fit into the ERC3643 standard?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ONCHAINID is a blockchain-based identity system. It provides a method to verify and embed digital identities directly on-chain without disclosing any private information, ensuring that investors and participants meet required regulatory checks without compromising their privacy. When coupled with ERC3643, it offers a comprehensive solution where RWA can be tokenized, traded, and managed on public blockchains while adhering to global securities regulations.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>  How do digital identities protect user privacy while ensuring compliance?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>Digital identities, when embedded on-chain, can anonymize user details while retaining necessary compliance attributes. So, while the specific identity of a user might be protected, their eligibility or permission to transact, based on regulatory requirements, is still verifiable on the blockchain. This ensures both user privacy and regulatory compliance.</p>
