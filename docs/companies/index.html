  Aviation sector sees 600% year-on-year increase in cyberattacks
prezly

Fri, 06/13/2025 - 09:00


             
 600% increase in ransomware attacks in the aviation sector in one year.  
 27 major attacks by 22 ransomware groups between January 2024 and April 2025.  
 71% of incidents involve credential theft or unauthorised access to critical systems.  
 In 2025, the size of the global aviation cybersecurity market is estimated at $5.32&nbsp;billion.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind any physical turbulence in the skies, a silent cyber war is being waged on the aviation sector. Ahead of the Paris Air Show (16 to 22 June 2025), Thales’s latest report on cyberthreats in the aviation sector warns of a spectacular rise in cyberattacks, which have increased by 600% in the space of a year. From airlines and airports to navigation systems and suppliers, every link in the chain is vulnerable to attack. The report also includes an analysis of the growing convergence between geopolitical confrontations and cyberthreats in a sector that has become strategically important for state sovereignty, global economic stability and the safe movement of people and goods. </p>
<p>Based on market intelligence data and incident analysis, the Thales report reveals how the stakeholders in the aerospace sector have become prime targets for cyberattacks, which are motivated by a range of factors including financial gain, ideological agendas and state-sponsored influence operations. Between January 2024 and April 2025, 27 attacks were recorded, involving 22 different ransomware groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strategic, interconnected and exposed</p>
<p>While the number of attacks is rising, the report also highlights a qualitative shift in the types of threats the aviation sector faces. As well as compromising flight operations, cyberattacks now also have strategic objectives such as industrial cyberespionage, access to sensitive technologies such as avionics and communication systems, disruption of supply chains and capture of high-value data such as diplomatic travel itineraries and confidential freight shipments.</p>
<p>These increasingly sophisticated attacks are targeting airlines as well as aircraft manufacturers and their suppliers. Notable examples include the denial-of-service attack by a pro-Russian hacktivist group on an airline and the ransomware that paralysed maintenance and supply systems at several strategic air transport hubs. These incidents reveal structural vulnerabilities in a highly interconnected sector, where a single flaw can trigger cascading effects across the entire chain of critical operations. </p>
<p>This high level of risk is a result of the specific characteristics of the aerospace sector: significant operational complexity with a reliance on critical software and interdependent stakeholders, the intrinsic value of the personal, biometric or strategic data involved, and the immediate consequences of any disruption, such as massive delays, airspace closures and logistical failures. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The aviation industry has become a digital battlefield with significant economic and geopolitical interests at stake. The sharp increase in the number of attacks calls for a holistic approach to aviation cybersecurity, further moves to incorporate AI as an ally and closer collaboration between industry and the public sector.” Ivan Fontarensky, CTO, Cyber Detection and Response, Thales. </p></blockquote>
<p>The global aviation cybersecurity market is expected to reach $5.32 billion in 2025, with average annual growth estimated at 8.7% by 2029, driven in particular by the increasing digitalisation of the sector and the intensified threat landscape.</p>

<p>Thales in the UK are supplying 150 solar-powered heated blankets to six charities across the Glasgow region to help tackle homelessness. The blankets were designed by a school student as part of a competition with <a href="https://www.primaryengineer.com/nominate/">Primary Engineer</a>. The blanket design and Thales prototype were awarded silver at the Primary Engineer MacRobert Awards Ceremony in November 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The finished products are based on the original prototype design and construction, which was carried out in Glasgow by a team of Thales graduates and apprentices.</p>
<p>Thales in the UK is proud to announce the supply and donation of 150 solar-powered heated blankets as part of their work as a national partner with Primary Engineer. The initial blanket design was created by a school student, Rebecca Young, as part of the Primary Engineer competition that asks students aged 3-19 from across the UK, “If you were an engineer, what would you do?” Rebecca’s idea for the innovative creation came from witnessing the growing homeless population across Glasgow. The cold winter nights inspired her to create the Solar Powered Heated Blanket to answer Primary Engineer’s call.</p>
<p>Thales is a long-standing partner and national sponsor of Primary Engineer, helping to launch and promote the competition across the UK, which reached a record-breaking 75,876 entries in 2024. In addition to providing STEM workshops, volunteers, and support during grading days for design submissions, Thales produces prototypes of leading designs from the Primary Engineer competition, which are unveiled at Primary Engineer regional award ceremonies during the summer, then later presented at the Primary Engineer MacRobert Medal Awards in November.</p>
<p>In 2024, five designs were brought to life by teams of Thales graduates and apprentices from across the UK, including the award-winning Solar Powered Heated Blanket. To celebrate the winning prototype design, 150 of the blankets have been funded for donation by Thales to help support six homeless charities in the Glasgow region. The first 35 blankets have been donated to <a href="https://homelessprojectscotland.org/">Homeless Project Scotland</a>, where they will be used to support 31 temporary accommodation beds in Glasgow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blanket is designed to fold away into a backpack, making it easy to carry. It is powered by a small solar panel and battery pack, each about the size of a smartphone, ensuring minimal weight is added for the user. Careful consideration was taken into account by the prototype design team at Thales, who were guided by feedback from Rebecca through various stages of the prototype production process. The team wanted to ensure that the blanket has different levels of heat settings, and that the safety of the user was at the forefront.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are incredibly proud to have been able to work with Rebecca and Primary Engineer to bring her design to life resulting in the donation of 150 blankets to help those who need it most. These donations serve a greater purpose in supporting those in need and highlight the power of design to make a positive impact in our community.” Stephen McCann, Managing Director of Thales OME, Glasgow.</p>
<p>"It’s such a pleasure to witness the remarkable journey of an innovative idea brought to life. Initiated by Rebecca as part of the 'If You Were an Engineer, What Would You Do?' competition, this project has seen incredible collaboration in the hands of Thales Early Careers engineers that culminated in the handover of solar powered heated blankets to Colin from Homeless Project Scotland. Hearing about the individuals who will benefit from this initiative truly highlights the transformative power and beauty of engineering at its finest.</p>
<p>Susan Scurlock MBE, CEO, Primary Engineer</p>

<p>Holochain 0.5 is recommended for use.</p><p>We’re now recommending Holochain 0.5.2 for general development. The <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.5/?ref=blog.holochain.org">upgrade guide</a> tells you everything you need to know to get your hApp updated and running.</p><p>Holochain 0.5 is already in the hands of early adopters, and the feedback so far is that it’s much more consistent, which makes it feels faster. Here’s a message we got from the lead dev of a project:</p><p>Initial test feedback on Holochain 0.5.1 is that gossip is performant. We've noticed that time to reach full DHT sync is approximately 1 minute down from 30+ minutes.</p><p>A 30× speedup is a big leap. The dev explained that with Holochain 0.4, synchronization would sometimes be fast, but other times it could be extremely slow or not complete at all. Now, new data shows up reliably — it takes up to a minute to appear for new peers and is almost immediate for already synced peers.</p><p>Interestingly, performance wasn’t the focus of 0.5 — it was about making peer networking more reliable.</p><p>Let’s look at that one-minute delay for new peers, because it’s important for developers and users to understand.</p><p>With <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>, Holochain 0.5’s new networking implementation, the behavior for newcomer nodes has changed somewhat. Initially, most DHT data won’t be visible, and they won’t immediately receive new data from other peers — this is the time when their node is trying to discover other peers and sync data with them, and hasn’t yet advertised that they’re storing and serving data (so they won’t receive publish messages for new data).</p><p>At the beginning, the gossip loop happens every minute instead of the default five minutes, in order to get this initial sync completed sooner. After this stage — one, two, or a few gossip rounds depending on the number of peers and amount of data — the newcomer has a full peer table and a full DHT shard*, so they drop the gossip frequency to five minutes. Now all data lookups are local (so they’re fast). They’re also getting new data directly from authors via publish rather than gossip (so that’s fast too).</p><p>Known issues:</p><p>We’re working on an 0.5.3 release to address feedback from early testers. Here’s what we plan to tackle:</p>  When an agent goes offline, other agents may keep trying to connect to them for up to 20 minutes, which will cause network errors and slow data synchronization. We’re tracking this (Holochain <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4978?ref=blog.holochain.org">#4978</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4999?ref=blog.holochain.org">#4999</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/5000?ref=blog.holochain.org">#5000</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/5017?ref=blog.holochain.org">#5017</a>). (Note: this is a long-standing problem that has become more visible now that networking as a whole is working better.)  We’ve received feedback that the new initial syncing behavior creates a feeling of unresponsiveness for new users, so we’re looking at strategies to help initial sync complete sooner (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/220?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune2 #220</a>).  <p>These will be addressed in the 0.6 dev release series and backported to 0.5.</p> In development <p>In the Holochain 0.6-dev line, work is being done on SQL query performance. I reported some <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org#issuecomment-2863047641">good progress</a> in last Dev Pulse, and since then, general query execution time has been cut by 25% across the board.</p><p>This release series will also address the feedback on 0.5:</p>  Agents will fetch data from multiple peers in parallel to get a response faster, and in case one happens to be offline (H<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/5000?ref=blog.holochain.org">olochain #5000</a>).  Unresponsive peers will be tracked (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/221?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune2 #221</a>) and filtered from gossip rounds until they come back online (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/222?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune2 #222</a>).  Existing agents will permit bursts of gossip from newcomers, to help them get synced quickly, while newcomers will attempt new gossip rounds as soon as they’ve fetched the content they discovered during the last round, until they’re in sync (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/220?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune #220</a>).  <p>Most of this is already complete and ready to be backported to 0.5.3.</p><p>In 0.6 we’re also planning to work on:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/13?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Holochain+0.6&amp;filterQuery=epic%3A%22Epic%3A+Membrane+proofs%22+is%3Aopen&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Read access gating via membrane proofs</a>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/13?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Holochain+0.6&amp;filterQuery=epic%3A%22Epic%3A+Migration+%26+Updates%22+is%3Aopen&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Coordinator zome updates</a>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/13?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Holochain+0.6&amp;filterQuery=is%3Aopen+epic%3A%22Epic%3A+State+Management+Stability%22&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">More state management reviews</a>  <p>Along with various bug fixes and maintenance tasks.</p><p>In a later release we’ll focus on building more test scenarios and reporting on test metrics from Wind Tunnel.</p>

<p>Behind every great social media platform sits a digital representation of who you know and what you like.</p>



<p>The digital mapping of who you know is called your social graph, and the map of what you like is called your interest graph.</p>



<p>Every platform tracks and maps your activity into these two types of “spiderweb” graph and every action you take adds a bit more “web” each time.</p>



<p>Creepy, right?</p>



<p>Well, it’s especially creepy when you discover these graphs exist even if you’re not on social media, since companies like Google, Apple and even banking apps build interest graphs based on your contacts, emails, purchases, and browsing history.</p>



<p>So, to be clear:</p>



<p>A social graph is about who you know—it maps your relationships within a social network: your friends, family, coworkers, etc.</p>



<p>An interest graph is about what you like—it connects you to other people based on shared interests, hobbies and topics, rather than personal relationships.</p>



<p>Every social media platform including the short-form video and content discovery platforms like YouTube and TikTok build and use these graphs about their users. And, surprise, surprise, they use them to analyze user behavior, personalize user experience, recommend content, and sell ads and the data itself.</p>



<p>But they’re not the only ones:</p>



 
 Online retailers use interest graphs to recommend products based on your browsing history and past purchases.<br> 



 Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify use interest graphs to suggest content based on your viewing or listening habits.<br> 



 News aggregation platforms like Google News and Apple News use interest graphs to personalize news feeds and recommend articles based on your interests.<br> 



 Many other apps and services, such as dating apps, job boards, and travel booking platforms, use interest graphs to personalize user experiences.&nbsp; 
 



<p>But while social graphs and interest graphs improve user experience, they also raise privacy and security concerns. The more data collected, the more companies—and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">bad actors</a>—know about you, so it’s crucial to manage your privacy settings and take other <a href="https://anonyome.com">proactive privacy steps</a>.</p>



<p>You can control your social graph and interest graph, to an extent</p>



<p>While you can’t completely opt out of having social graphs and interest graphs, you can take steps to control what information is collected and shared:</p>



 
 Review your privacy settings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to limit data collection.<br> 



 Be choosy about accepting friend requests and connections to limit the amount of your personal data that others can access.<br> 



 Limit app permissions to stop third-party services from accessing your social graph data.<br> 



 Regularly audit your online activity to remove old or inactive connections, unfollow accounts, and mute topics you’re not interested in. 
 



<p>While that’s the standard advice, you can do more to protect yourself:</p>

<p>A big step for travel, a giant step for digital credentials: Apple will enable the mdoc credential format in its next software release for identity authentication in domestic US travel. With the aviation and travel sectors embracing multiple forms of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials for interoperable global travel, there’s little doubt that the transformation of digital identity is under way.</p>
<p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>In a signal that digital credentials are going to be the norm for travel and authentication in the near future, Apple announced a WWDC25, its annual Worldwide Developers Conference,, that the upcoming version of its iOS 26 software will allow a person to derive a digital credential from their passport using the mdoc credential format and store it in their Apple Wallets to prove their identity for domestic travel in the U.S.</p>
<p>In a second, related <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/IdentityDocumentServices/Implenting-as-an-identity-document-provider">announcement</a> on its developer page, Apple announced the availability of an Apple Identity Document Provider API, which allows websites to receive presentations of mdoc-based documents as a way to authenticate identity.</p>
<p>While not the headline news at WWDC25, these developments represent a significant move forward in the global adoption of seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving digital identity and authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, Apple has confined itself to credentials based on the&nbsp; the mdoc (mobile document) standard —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en">ISO18013-5 </a>— which is typically used for mobile driver’s licences (mDL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global aviation sector is currently focused on&nbsp; credential formats and protocols that enable international travel and interoperability between the European Union digital identity specifications and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>As of now, Apple’s digital wallets do not offer full support for Europe’s digital identity and wallet specifications (e.g., support for OID4VC and SD-JWT VC is not yet included) and do not appear to utilize the full International Civil Aviation Organization’s Digital Travel Credential (DTC) specifications, which establish global standards for creating digital passports.</p>
<p>Because Apple is deriving credentials from existing physical IDs, this also means that the Apple Wallet announcement doesn’t apply to government-issued digital passports based on an upcoming global standard — DTC Type 2 Credentials —&nbsp;which Indicio is working on through its global partnership with SITA as part of the European Union’s Aptitude Trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet Apple’s experience in successfully implementing new technology and its skill at delivering effortless user experience is a “lift-all-boats” moment, as it will catalyze the administrative and infrastructural transformation needed for the successful global adoption of verifiable credential technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An incremental approach makes sense. The big wallet providers like Apple and Google will learn from the furious pace of innovation around verifiable credentials in the global aviation sector with all the sector and government specific operational and regulatory requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One observation from Indicio’s role in this innovation race: As different countries and geographic regions have already adopted different specifications, interoperability and governance will be the key to usability and seamless travel.</p>
<p>This announcement shows we are all headed toward the same goal —&nbsp;seamless, secure, digital interaction using digital credentials — and that is going to benefit everyone.</p>
<p>Indicio, digital credentials, and travel</p>
<p>As a global market leader in verifiable digital credentials for travel, finance, education, government services, and logistics, Indicio’s decentralized identity solution —&nbsp;Indicio Proven — enables customers to choose from credential representations including mdoc/mDL, ensuring compatibility with Apple, along with SD-JWT VCs, W3C Verifiable Credentials, AnonCreds, Open Badges 3.0, and protocols including DIDComm and OID4VC so that they can best meet their use case and regulatory or geographic requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The variety of use cases for digital credentials means that the future (which is already here) is one where different credentials are used for different purposes but can also interoperate and be combined for maximum flexibility. Indicio recently showed in <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX-_UU80Ig10%26fbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1F_ZXvZsgdGNoGRyPKJ9Kd5FSen-68OShWsOkmB33XYGE_orvMmdeKCJs_aem_i7ZGBNKQ7o2hER-O8G8wVA&amp;h=AT3CaxxMt0oGmaxaApXnlxEaZPFuhnz_WOi8a4ZGXsnBKcTdYVcGzXBQp8XpqVWBYs91h1qJselsF4ecSXx5yMZEGeYne81VUJVBS_3a4r2GS4cjsw4NAGNOUGlYnUl2edIh5JRnilHG2NJ__7Q&amp;__tn__=R]-R&amp;c[0]=AT0a1K1brS3JADUCEQOszh0Wde3LFlRn-AZvPm17QoCy6RHhougMQ-X6FDYMQEf23o9CGbBKfE2DMEuB2kicbUv4dGadOT_Ie61c-GoiqhOmZoSPZS7zHISG6tVO8O1XerzWtHOWJJvBp-50AW4tuI0WT0-qsUPOgpCw3I_V2EEZXT2LNs1x">a trial with Delta Air Lines</a>&nbsp; that multiple credential formats can be used in a seamless workflow for international travel.

<p>After <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-joins-e20m-gaia-x-moveid-project-alongside-bosch-airbus-continental-and-top-web3-projects/">three years</a> of intense collaboration, innovation, and field testing, the <a href="https://moveid.org/">moveID</a> project—part of the Gaia‑X 4 Future Mobility initiative—has made significant strides toward redefining how mobility ecosystems work. At its core, moveID aimed to create a decentralized, user-centric infrastructure where vehicles, infrastructure, and service providers interact seamlessly using Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) and AI agents.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Building the Foundation for Trusted Machine Communication 
<p></p>
<p>Working alongside industry leaders such as Bosch, Airbus, Continental, and leading Web3 projects, we contributed to building the technical and conceptual foundation for trusted machine-to-machine communication in the mobility sector. This included the secure exchange of credentials, decentralized data marketplaces, and AI-powered autonomous service interactions—all compliant with European data and privacy standards.</p>
 
 Demonstrating Real-World Impact: MOBIX Park &amp; Charge 
<p></p>
<p>A standout achievement was the <a href="https://mobix.ai/2023/09/01/mobix-park-charge-demonstrator-behind-the-scenes/">development</a> and public demonstration of MOBIX Park &amp; Charge, a fully operational system enabling electric vehicles (EV) to autonomously find parking spots, access charging stations, and handle payments. First showcased at IAA Mobility 2023, the system integrated SSI, blockchain-based payments, and AI agents in a live, real-world environment.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Scaling Toward Smart Cities 
<p>Beyond the demo, MOBIX has evolved into a scalable <a href="https://mobix.ai/2023/09/14/mobix-park-charge-from-iaa-mobility-showcase-to-smart-city-solution/">smart-city solution</a>. By turning private EV chargers and parking spots into publicly accessible assets, we’re addressing key challenges in urban congestion and infrastructure scalability, while opening up new economic opportunities for individuals and municipalities.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Where Web3 Meets AI 
<p>The project also served as a powerful example of the <a href="https://datarella.com/the-convergence-of-ai-and-web3/">convergence</a> between AI and Web3. By combining intelligent agents with decentralized infrastructure, we demonstrated how machines can not only interact but also negotiate, transact, and self-optimize—laying the groundwork for more ethical and transparent digital ecosystems.</p>
  
 A Foundation for the Future 
<p>In sum, moveID wasn’t just about mobility. It showcased how decentralized identity, autonomous agents, and AI can reshape how devices, services, and users interact—not just in cities, but across industries. As the project concludes, its outcomes provide a strong foundation for future applications in smart infrastructure, data sovereignty, and the broader digital economy.</p>

  Thales invests €55 million euros to anchor next-generation resilient navigation in France
prezly

Thu, 06/12/2025 - 14:00


             
 Thales strengthens its European leadership in resilient navigation, for air, land and sea, by enhancing its Châtellerault and Valence industrial sites in France. 
 The Group will invest €55 million in order to meet growing demand for secure navigation solutions for both the civil and military sectors. 
 This industrial ramp-up will quadruple the production capacity of the Châtellerault site, while in Valence, the serial production of TopStar-M GNSS receivers and the TopShield anti-jamming solution will be launched, and a new sovereign production line for inertial micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) will be established. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Thales, the European leader in <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/aerospace/navigation-solutions/resilient-pnt-solutions">resilient navigation</a>, today announces a major €55 million investment to strengthen its industrial sites in Châtellerault and Valence, France. This investment, which will be made between 2025 and 2028, will meet the growing demand for high-performance navigation solutions, both civilian and military, and will strengthen its sovereign and cutting-edge industrial base.</p>
<p>A comprehensive range of solutions for resilient navigation</p>
<p>In a context of increasing jamming and spoofing of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signals, Thales is deploying a complete range of resilient navigation solutions that combine precision, autonomy, and security. These technologies are essential to ensure operational continuity, whether for critical military missions or civil aviation safety.</p>
<p>By integrating two technological pillars combining inertial systems and GNSS signal reception, Thales enables reliable navigation even in contested environments. Autonomous navigation capability is maintained at all times due to the high performance of the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/aerospace/navigation-solutions/topaxyz-high-performance-imu-inertial-measurement">TopAxyz</a> inertial navigation systems. Signal reception integrity is ensured by combining the encrypted, multi-constellation <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/aerospace/navigation-solutions/topstar-m-military-gpsgnss-receivers-mission-success">TopStar-M</a> receiver with the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/aerospace/navigation-solutions/topshield-crpa-solution-against-gps-jamming-threats">TopShield</a> anti-jamming solution. These innovations are supported by France’s Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) under the OMEGA (Operation for the Modernization of GNSS Equipment of the Armed Forces) programme. The performance and unique combination of these solutions make Thales the European leader in resilient navigation.</p>
<p>A strengthened, sustainable, and sovereign industrial base</p>
<p>At Châtellerault, the production capacity of inertial navigation systems will be increased fourfold, with a gradual ramp-up through 2028. This site, with sixty years of expertise in laser gyroscopes, and as the only European supplier equipping civil aircraft, will thus be able to meet growing demand and to provide solutions for aircraft, land vehicles, ships, and munitions.</p>
<p>In Valence, mass production of TopStar-M receivers and TopShield systems will begin in 2026. A new production line dedicated to inertial MEMS sensors—a breakthrough technology combining compactness and high performance—will be created, establishing the site as the spearhead of France’s sovereign MEMS technology sector for defense. The launch of this new production line will be accelerated with the support of Tronics Microsystems for certain industrial expertise.</p>
<p>A strong human and regional commitment</p>
<p>More than 800 employees are currently working at the two sites, and 150 new hires are planned by 2028. These investments strengthen Thales’ regional footprint and actively contribute to positioning France at the forefront of the navigation industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales, a leader in resilient navigation, is reinforcing its industrial base in France, and thanks to this investment, it will have a sovereign and sustainable industrial capability, delivering the most advanced and competitive solutions to meet growing needs across both civil and military customers” said Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice-President, Avionics, Thales.</p></blockquote>

<p>In our previous <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/black-basta-ransomware-victims-have-paid-over-100-million">analysis</a> about Black Basta, a prolific ransomware group whose victims have paid over $100 million in ransom payments since early 2022, we uncovered unique patterns in their cryptocurrency transactions, enabling us to identify a large number of Bitcoin ransoms paid to the group.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On 11 February 2025, Black Basta’s internal chat logs were leaked, exposing data that includes the cryptocurrency addresses used by Black Basta’s members, and other external actors in the ransomware ecosystem. In fact, some funds of the leaked addresses can be traced back to the Black Basta ransoms we have previously identified. The leak has given us a fuller picture of how the ransoms were subsequently spent to fund the operation.</p>

<p>To pave the way for KILT Protocol’s ambitious multi-chain future, the KILT token will migrate from its current Base contract to a new Base contract. The migration window will open at 1200 UTC on Thursday June 19th 2025 and remain open for at least 10 weeks. Any holders who do not migrate their tokens within this timeframe shall risk losing them irrevocably.</p><p>In line with the new tokenomics scheme approved by the community, holders will receive 1.75 new KILT for each 1 old KILT migrated (i.e. a migration ratio of 1:1.75). The migration will not change the maximum token supply of 290,560,000. After the migration, 100% of the supply will be minted and there will be zero inflation. For further details please see the <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/post/238">governance discussion</a> and <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.io/referendum/50">referendum</a>.</p><p>The KILT parachain will continue to run as normal and without interruption. In due course the new Base token will be bridged back to Polkadot to serve as gas, in governance functions, etc.</p><p>Please read this guide carefully before undertaking to migrate your&nbsp;tokens.</p> Contracts and&nbsp;Audit   Ethereum KILT: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x5d3d01fd6d2ad1169b17918eb4f153c6616288eb">0x5d3d01fd6d2ad1169b17918eb4f153c6616288eb</a>  Base KILT (old): <a href="https://basescan.org/token/0x9e5189a77f698305ef76510aff1c528cff48779c">0x9e5189a77f698305ef76510aff1c528cff48779c</a>  Base KILT (new): <a href="https://basescan.org/token/0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8">0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8</a>  Migration Contract: <a href="https://basescan.org/address/0x4a62f30d95a8350fc682642a455b299c074b3b8c">0x4a62f30d95a8350fc682642a455b299c074b3b8c</a>  Security Audit: <a href="https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kilt-protocol#code-security">https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kilt-protocol</a>   Migration Routes <p>There are two alternative ways for users to migrate their KILT&nbsp;tokens.</p> Either:  1) Deposit to a participating Centralised Exchange (CEX) before their respective deadlines. <p>We are actively working with KILT’s exchange partners to support the migration. Users with KILT successfully deposited to a participating exchange before their respective deadlines will have their KILT migrated automatically. Note that this is a one-time event; if the deadline is missed it is very unlikely that any further assistance will be offered by the CEXs and deposits will no longer be open to the old KILT&nbsp;token.</p><p>Whilst the KILT Foundation strives to support CEX participation, they remain completely independent and the nature and extent of their participation may be subject to change. Individual CEX policies will apply; KYC may be required and geographic restrictions may exist. Each exchange will have their own schedule, deadlines and requirements — please check with your chosen exchange and monitor official channels.</p> Or,  2) Follow the self-custody bridging and migration route laid out&nbsp;below. <p>This process requires basic familiarity with self-custody wallets, signing transactions, etc. From 1200 UTC on Thursday June 19th 2025 the migration window will be open for at least 10 weeks and users may migrate at their convenience within that timeframe. After final closure of the migration window, migration will no longer be possible and if a user has not migrated their tokens they will be lost, without the possibility of recourse.</p><p>This guide covers bridging of KILT from Polkadot to Base, and migration within Base from the old contract to the new. The overall journey tokens must take is as&nbsp;shown:</p> You will&nbsp;need: <p>For Step&nbsp;1</p>  A Polkadot wallet e.g <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/">polkadot{.js}</a>, <a href="https://www.talisman.xyz/">Talisman</a>, <a href="https://www.subwallet.app/">Subwallet</a> etc. Note that Sporran, the original KILT wallet, will not suffice; the wallet must be able to connect to multiple parachains (e.g. AssetHub)  An EVM&nbsp;wallet  DOT for&nbsp;gas  <p>For Steps 2 &amp;&nbsp;3</p>  An EVM&nbsp;wallet  ETH on Ethereum for&nbsp;gas  ETH on Base for gas (this can be bridged during this&nbsp;process)  <p>Note that steps 1 and 2 may be carried out at any time, including before the opening of the migration window. Step 3 may not be completed until the opening of the migration window.</p> 1) Bridge native KILT to&nbsp;Ethereum <p>Use Polar Path and <a href="https://app.snowbridge.network/">Snowbridge</a>, following the procedure detailed&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/switch-and-trade-polkadot-and-ethereum-tokens-with-polar-path-439dd563cac7">Switch Polkadot and Ethereum Tokens with Polar Path</a></p><p>Note that Sporran, the original KILT wallet, will not suffice; the wallet must be able to connect to multiple parachains (e.g. AssetHub). If your tokens are held on Sporran, first transfer them to an appropriate wallet either by importing your private keys (or 12 words) to the new wallet, or sending the tokens to a new address within the new wallet. Please refer to guides particular to your chosen&nbsp;wallet.</p> 2) Bridge Ethereum KILT to&nbsp;Base <p>a) Go to <a href="https://superbridge.app/base">https://superbridge.app/Base</a></p><p>b) Connect the same wallet you used with Snowbridge during Step 1, which is now holding your Ethereum KILT, and&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>c) Click the drop-down list of tokens (normally showing ETH by default).</p><p>d) You will see a list of tokens to choose&nbsp;from:</p><p>e) In the search field, enter the contract address for Base&nbsp;KILT:</p><blockquote>0x9E5189a77f698305Ef76510AFF1C528cff48779c</blockquote><p>and select it from the&nbsp;list.</p><p>SuperBridge will discover both Ethereum and Base KILT. Import the&nbsp;pair.</p><p>Note: if the search fails or does not show a correct balance, you may first need to add KILT as a custom token to your wallet. For example, according to this <a href="https://support.metamask.io/manage-crypto/portfolio/how-to-import-a-token-in-metamask-portfolio/">guide for Metamask</a>.</p><p>f) Enter the amount of KILT you would like to bridge. Click “Review bridge” and follow the approval and signing steps particular to your connected wallet. Await confirmation that the bridge has been successful (~3 minutes).</p><p>g) If you don’t already have ETH on Base, you will need some to carry out the migration — $0.01 to $0.05 will suffice under normal network conditions.</p><p>When the KILT bridging is complete, change the token in the drop-down list from KILT to ETH and repeat the process: click “Review bridge” and follow the approval and signing steps particular to your connected wallet.</p><p>h) When the bridging is complete, you can view your Base KILT tokens and Base ETH by switching your wallet to the Base network and adding KILT as a custom token with contract&nbsp;address:</p><blockquote>0x9E5189a77f698305Ef76510AFF1C528cff48779cb</blockquote> 3) Migrate from the old Base contract to the new Base&nbsp;contract <p>a) Go to <a href="https://migrate.kilt.io">https://migrate.kilt.io</a> to access the KILT migration portal. Carefully read the Terms and Conditions before proceeding.</p><p>b) Connect your wallet. If required, the portal will prompt you to switch networks to&nbsp;Base.</p><p>c) Enter the amount of KILT you would like to migrate and click Approve. Sign the transaction in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>d) When the approval is complete, the button will change to Migrate. Click the Migrate button and sign the transaction in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>e) To view your migrated KILT, add the new contract address to your wallet as a custom&nbsp;token:</p><blockquote>0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8</blockquote> This completes the migration.

<p>In today’s fast-paced business world, your web browser is more than just a tool for browsing the internet – it’s a critical component of your team’s productivity and efficiency. A well-chosen browser can streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and safeguard sensitive company data, while a poor choice can lead to frustrating delays and security vulnerabilities. But with so many options available, how do you pick the best web browser for business that truly unleashes your team’s potential? This guide dives deep into the features and considerations crucial for making an informed decision that will empower your employees and secure your operations.</p>



 Introduction to Web Browser for Business 



 What is a Web Browser for Business? 



<p>A web browser for business is more than just a consumer browse tool; it’s a strategically chosen application designed to enhance organizational productivity, streamline workflows, and, most critically, provide robust security for sensitive company data. Unlike standard browsers built for general use, a business-grade browser often integrates advanced features like centralized management for IT teams, enhanced security protocols such as sandboxing and data loss prevention (DLP), and seamless compatibility with enterprise-specific applications and cloud services.</p>









 Why Does a Business Need a Web Browser? 



<p>Businesses need a carefully chosen web browser for several compelling reasons:</p>



 
 Enhanced Security: This is paramount. Over 80% of cyberattacks targeting end-users originate in the browser, including phishing, malware, and ransomware. <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-access-blocked-websites/">A standard consumer browser</a> offers basic protection, but a dedicated business browser provides advanced security features like built-in threat protection, data loss prevention (DLP), secure access to cloud applications, and real-time monitoring to safeguard sensitive company data from evolving threats. 



 Boosted Productivity and Efficiency: Employees spend the majority of their workdays in a browser, accessing cloud-based software (CRM, project management, accounting), collaborating, and conducting research. A browser optimized for business offers seamless integrations with essential business applications, efficient tab management, and cross-platform syncing, all of which streamline workflows and reduce friction, leading to significant productivity gains. 



 Centralized Management and IT Control: Unlike individual consumer browsers, a business browser allows IT departments to centrally manage and enforce security policies, control extensions, restrict access to risky websites, and deploy updates across the entire organization. This level of control is crucial for maintaining consistent security configurations, ensuring compliance, and significantly reducing IT overhead. 



 Support for Remote and Hybrid Work: With the rise of remote and hybrid work models, employees often access corporate resources from various devices and networks. A business browser provides a secure and controlled environment for accessing company data, even on unmanaged devices, mitigating risks associated with Bring Your Device (BYOD) policies. 



 Compliance and Data Governance: Many industries face strict regulatory requirements regarding data privacy and security (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Business browsers help organizations meet these compliance standards by offering features that prevent data leakage, support secure browser practices, and provide auditing and reporting capabilities to track user activity and security incidents. 
 



 Why Choosing the Best Web Browser for Business Matters 



<p>Selecting the <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-delete-the-history-from-youtube/">right web browser for your business</a> is a pivotal strategic decision, far beyond mere preference. In today’s highly interconnected and cyber-threatened environment, the browser acts as your team’s primary gateway to cloud applications, sensitive data, and client interactions. Its impact is felt across several critical areas:</p>



 
 Impact on Productivity: A well-chosen browser directly influences your team’s efficiency. Fast loading times are crucial, as even small delays accumulate to significant wasted hours daily. Crucially, it must ensure seamless compatibility with essential business applications like CRM systems, project management tools and accounting software. A browser that frequently crashes or struggles with these vital tools can severely hamper workflow and reduce output. 



 Addressing Security Concerns: Protecting sensitive information is paramount. The browser is a primary entry point for cyber threats. The right browser offers robust features for safeguarding sensitive data, including client information, financial records, and proprietary intellectual property, against phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, and data breaches. It should provide advanced security protocols to minimize these risks. 
 









 
 Facilitating Collaboration and Integration: Modern businesses thrive on teamwork. The ideal browser supports essential extensions that enhance productivity, enable seamless cloud syncing across devices, and integrate smoothly with team workflows. This ensures employees can collaborate effectively on shared documents, communicate effortlessly, and access synchronized data, regardless of their location. 
 



<p>Example:</p>



<p>Consider the tangible risks: a slow or insecure browser can lead to constant frustration, missed deadlines due to inefficiencies, or, far worse, critical data breaches that compromise client trust, incur heavy financial penalties, and severely damage your company’s reputation. Therefore, investing time in choosing a browser optimized for your business needs directly contributes to unlocking your business’s full potential by fostering a more secure, efficient, and collaborative digital workspace.</p>



 Criteria for Selecting the Best Web Browser for Business 



<p>Choosing the <a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-5-browsers-for-mac-privacy-focused-browsers-and-extensions/">best web browser for business</a> isn’t just about personal preference. It’s a strategic decision impacting your team’s efficiency and data security. Top-tier business browsers excel in several key areas:</p>



 
 Speed and Performance: A critical factor for boosting productivity, leading browsers offer quick page loading times and smooth multitasking. This minimizes delays, keeping your team focused and efficient throughout the workday. 



 Robust Security Features: Paramount for business, the ideal browser includes built-in privacy tools, effective ad-blockers, and strong protection against phishing and malware. These features are vital for safeguarding sensitive company data and preventing cyber threats. 
 









 
 Seamless Compatibility: Essential for modern operations, the browser must offer comprehensive support for business tools like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, CRM systems, and other cloud-based applications. This ensures workflows remain uninterrupted and integrated. 



 Extensive Customization: The availability of a wide range of extensions for productivity, security, and collaboration. It allows businesses to tailor the Browse experience precisely to their unique needs, enhancing specific team functions and overall efficiency. 



 Reliable Cross-platform Support: For today’s remote and hybrid teams, strong cross-platform syncing across all devices (desktop, mobile) is crucial. This ensures consistent access to data and settings, fostering seamless collaboration regardless of location.

  Thales ranked No.1 most attractive employer among engineering students in France in 2025
prezly

Thu, 06/12/2025 - 10:00


            <p>Thales has secured the top spot in the 2025 ranking of the most attractive employers for engineering students in France, in a survey conducted by the Universum research institute. The survey covered 23,376 students, including 11,556 from engineering schools. Thales also ranked 4th among IT students.</p>
<p>Students notably praised the Group’s capacity for innovation and the wide range of career development opportunities it offers. <br>​As a global leader in high technology across Defence, Aerospace, Cybersecurity and Digital Identity, Thales provides the opportunity to work in critical environments involving artificial intelligence, quantum technologies or cloud computing. The company offers a very broad array of career paths, backed by a strong industrial and academic presence across 68 countries. For the past three years, Thales has also invested heavily in a global upskilling initiative called the “Learning Company” programme, delivered by 2,000 in-house trainers. It brings together 13 Domain Academies (Radar, Radio, Naval, Tubes, Pyrotechnics…) and 19 Functional Academies (Engineering, Industry, HR, Finance, Communications…).</p>
<p>The preference expressed by young engineering students for Thales also reflects the Group’s efforts to reach out to younger generations. Last year, Thales engaged with over 150,000 young people through 600 events. In 2025, in France alone, the Group expects to welcome more than 3,000 interns and apprentices in higher education, with around 25% going on to secure permanent or fixed-term roles. Nearly 1,500 students in Year 10 and Year 11 will also be welcomed for short-term work experience across around 40 Thales sites in mainland France, helping to spark interest in science and technology careers.</p>

<p>In an age of rising streaming costs, the desire to download movies for free is growing, offering film lovers a personal library of blockbusters accessible anytime, offline. While this digital landscape can be complex with legal and safety concerns, knowing the right platforms is key. This guide will help you navigate safely, revealing the best websites to download movies for free by focusing on accessibility, content variety, and user safety. It will ensure that blockbusters truly await you without compromising your device or data.</p>



 Introduction To The Best Websites To Download Movies For Free 



<p>The appeal of downloading movies for free is stronger than ever, offering film enthusiasts the convenience of building a personal library without recurring subscription costs. However, navigating the online landscape to find reliable and safe platforms can be complex, often raising concerns about legality, malware, and intrusive ads. This guide is designed to cut through the noise, helping you discover the best websites to download movies by focusing on platforms that offer a balance of broad content, user-friendliness, and a commitment to safety. We’ll ensure you can access your favorite blockbusters and cinematic treasures securely and efficiently, transforming your viewing experience without compromising your device or data.</p>









 Why Should We Know About Websites To Download Movies for Free? 



<p>For many film enthusiasts, this method offers compelling advantages that go beyond simply saving money. Imagine having your favorite blockbusters and cinematic classics available offline, on any device, whenever you want, without worrying about internet connectivity or recurring monthly fees.</p>



 Cost Savings 



<p>One of the most immediate and significant drivers for people seeking free movie downloads is the undeniable appeal of cost savings. In an entertainment landscape increasingly dominated by multiple subscription services (Netflix, Disney+, Max, etc.), each demanding a separate monthly fee, the cumulative cost can become substantial. Downloading movies for free allows viewers to bypass these recurring expenses entirely, providing access to a vast library of films, including the latest blockbusters, without putting a dent in their budget. This financial relief makes high-quality entertainment accessible to a broader audience, fostering a personal movie library without ongoing financial commitment.</p>



 Convenience and Offline Viewing 



<p>Beyond just saving money, the desire for enhanced convenience is a major reason people opt to download movies for free. Unlike streaming, which is entirely reliant on a stable internet connection, downloading enables true offline viewing. This means you can enjoy your favorite films anytime, anywhere – whether on a long flight, a road trip through areas with no Wi-Fi, or simply at home during an internet outage. The ability to access movies without buffering issues or connectivity worries offers unparalleled flexibility, making downloaded content a perfect solution for those who want their entertainment readily available on their terms.</p>









 Access to Blockbusters Without Subscriptions 



<p>A significant motivation behind seeking free movie downloads is the strong desire to access popular blockbusters and a wider variety of films without the need for multiple, potentially expensive, streaming subscriptions. Not all blockbusters are available on every platform simultaneously, and content libraries frequently change. This provides a sense of “ownership” and ensures access to desired content outside the fluctuating terms of various streaming providers.</p>



 The Need for Safe and Legal Sources 



<p>While the benefits of downloading movies for free are clear, it’s critical to emphasize the need for safe and legal sources. The internet is rife with unofficial websites that distribute copyrighted content, often bundling it with malicious software. Engaging with such platforms carries significant risks, including exposure to malware, viruses, spyware, and other cyber threats that can compromise your device and personal data. Furthermore, downloading copyrighted material without permission can lead to copyright issues and legal repercussions. Therefore, users must exercise extreme caution and prioritize reputable, legally compliant platforms, or those that aggregate links from verified sources, to ensure a secure and ethical downloading experience.</p>



 Criteria for Choosing the Best Websites To Download Movies for free 



<p>With a vast and often risky online landscape, understanding key criteria is crucial for a safe, high-quality, and enjoyable experience.</p>



 Key Factors for Selection 



<p>When seeking the best websites to download movies, several crucial factors dictate a safe and satisfying experience. Foremost among these is Safety, ensuring the platform is entirely malware-free and poses no threat to your device or data. Equally vital is Legality, meaning the site primarily offers public domain content or has explicit authorization to distribute the films. Beyond security and compliance, the platform should boast ease of use, featuring an intuitive interface for effortless navigation and downloading. Finally, content quality is paramount, with a strong emphasis on the availability of HD (high-definition) downloads to ensure a superior viewing experience.</p>



 Importance of Avoiding Pirated Content 



<p>Users must understand the importance of avoiding pirated content when looking to download movies for free. Beyond the ethical considerations, downloading unauthorized copyrighted material carries significant risks. Firstly, it’s a legal issue, potentially leading to copyright infringement penalties. Secondly, and perhaps more immediately, unofficial sites are notorious for being vectors of malware, viruses, and ransomware, which can severely compromise your device, steal personal information, or even corrupt your entire system. Prioritizing legal and safe sources protects both your legal standing and the integrity of your digital devices.</p>









 Checking Regional Availability 



<p>A final, yet often overlooked, criterion when selecting movie download websites is checking regional availability. Due to licensing agreements and distribution rights, many platforms or specific film titles may be subject to geo-restrictions, meaning they are only accessible from certain countries. Before committing to a site or attempting a download, it’s advisable to quickly verify if the content is legally available in your region. While VPNs can sometimes offer workarounds for these restrictions, being aware of regional limitations from the outset helps manage expectations and ensures a smoother, more compliant downloading experience.</p>



 Top Websites to Download Movies for Free 



<p>The desire to download movies for free is stronger than ever, offering film enthusiasts offline access without subscription fees. However, finding truly reliable and safe platforms can be challenging.</p>



<p>Here’s a curated list of top websites to download movies for free, prioritizing those offering legal content or public domain titles, alongside platforms known for user-friendliness and quality.</p>

 Pros: Legal, no registration required, features well-known movies and original content.

 How to Stay Safe While Choosing Websites To Download Movies For Free 



<p>While the allure of downloading movies for free is strong, navigating the online landscape without risking your device or personal data requires vigilance. Unofficial sources can expose you to malware, viruses, and legal issues.</p>



 Use Reputable Websites 



<p>The most crucial step in staying safe while downloading movies is to strictly use reputable websites. The internet is rife with unofficial sources that distribute pirated content, which are often laden with malware, viruses, and phishing scams designed to compromise your device or steal your personal information. Stick to well-known, legitimate platforms that offer public domain movies, or provide ad-supported legal streaming with the option for offline viewing (like those mentioned in our “Top Websites” list). By choosing established and trustworthy sites, you significantly reduce your exposure to harmful downloads and deceptive practices.</p>



 Install Antivirus Software and Enable a Firewall 



<p>A fundamental layer of defense when downloading movies from any source is robust cybersecurity. Always install reliable antivirus software on your computer or device and ensure it is kept up-to-date with the latest definitions. This software acts as your first line of defense, scanning downloaded files for malware and blocking known threats. Complement this by enabling your operating system’s built-in firewall. A firewall monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access to your device and blocking suspicious connections that could arise from unsafe downloads. These two tools work in tandem to create a secure environment for your digital activities.</p>







 Consider Using a VPN for Privacy 



<p>While not strictly a safety measure against malware, considering a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for privacy is highly recommended, especially if you find yourself needing to access region-restricted content. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making your online activities much more private and difficult to trace. This layer of anonymity adds an extra shield against potential monitoring and enhances your overall online security posture when navigating various movie download sites.</p>



 Verify the Legality of the Website 



<p>Before initiating any download, it’s essential to verify the legality of the website itself. Illegitimate sites that distribute copyrighted content without permission not only put you at risk of encountering malware but can also lead to copyright infringement issues. Look for clear indicators that a site is offering public domain films, has explicit licensing agreements, or is an official platform. Be wary of sites promising the latest blockbusters for free without ads or any clear business model, as these are strong indicators of illicit activity. Prioritizing legal sources ensures you’re enjoying content ethically and without legal repercussions.</p>



 Tips for Spotting Unsafe Websites 



<p>Developing an eye for danger signs is crucial for staying safe while downloading movies. Be vigilant for excessive pop-ups, especially those that appear immediately upon visiting a site or when clicking anywhere on the page. These are a classic sign of untrustworthy platforms. Similarly, be extremely cautious of suspicious links that redirect you to unexpected pages or prompt you to download unusual files. Other red flags include websites with very generic or unprofessional designs, numerous broken links, or those that demand personal information or unusual browser extensions before allowing access to content. Trust your instincts; if a site feels off, it’s best to navigate away immediately.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, the quest for free movie downloads doesn’t have to be a perilous journey. By understanding the compelling reasons—from significant cost savings and unparalleled offline convenience to accessing desired blockbusters without restrictive subscriptions—you can truly enhance your entertainment experience. However, the paramount takeaway remains the absolute necessity of prioritizing safe and legal sources. By adhering to the criteria of reputable websites, utilizing essential cybersecurity tools like antivirus software and VPNs, and learning to spot the red flags of unsafe platforms, you can confidently navigate the digital landscape. Embrace the world of free cinema responsibly, and with the right knowledge, blockbusters truly await you, ready to be enjoyed securely and at your leisure.</p>

<p>In banking and&nbsp; financial services, customer experience and security can feel like a trade-off: You can make a process seamless or you can make it secure — but how to do both?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what we’re changing.</p>
<p>With Indicio Proven banks and financial services&nbsp; can provide seamless account authentication —&nbsp;no passwords, no multifactor authentication — with the highest level of digital identity assurance and privacy protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when we say the “highest level of digital identity assurance,” we mean government-grade digital identity, capable of mitigating biometric identity fraud and generative-AI deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, Indicio Proven’s combination of seamless, secure, and interoperability has the power to turn digital identity into a universal payment system —&nbsp;authentication and payment rails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all with significant cost savings over current, slow-lane identity access management solutions.</p>
<p>Fractured and fragile: how we currently manage of account identity</p>
<p>Right now, banks and&nbsp; financial services meet compliance requirements using legacy identity systems built around centralized databases, proprietary integrations, and recurring verification steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers submit some form of state-issued ID, such as a passport or driver’s license, wait for a check, and do it again when accessing a new product or to make a transaction. Even after passing KYC, they’re stuck verifying over and over again– especially across services, apps, or jurisdictions.</p>
<p>This slows down business, drives up drop-off rates, and creates exposure to security risks: Phishing attacks, account takeovers, and data breaches. With biometric identity fraud, deepfakes, and the rapid expansion in AI usage across all attack vectors,&nbsp; verifying identity has become exponentially challenging and costly. For consumers, stolen biometrics represent existential threats. They can’t just reset their faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials vs credentials that are verifiable</p>
<p>Many institutions and identity providers say they already have verifiable digital credentials for account management and that’s because verifiable credentials are the new buzzword in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a Verifiable Credential is more than an auth token with a fancy label; it’s the product of a set of global standards that transforms how personal data is created, made tamper proof, stored, shared, and verified.</p>
<p>These standards mean a Verifiable Credential can be used to authenticate a person’s identity anywhere, without having to check in with the source of that identity data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For banks and financial services, this means no need for complex direct integrations or phoning home to verify an identity or third-party identity providers and access management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For customers, this means they have control over their personal data, consent to share it, and the ability to share it securely.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the interplay of cryptography, decentralized technologies, and identity binding all deliver instant authentication, enabling institutions to deliver seamless experiences to their customers.</p>
<p>The decentralized identity revolution just evolved to incorporate biometrics&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we add authenticated biometrics to a Verifiable Credential, we create “government-grade” digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ground-breaking innovation was developed by Indicio for international travel. It’s&nbsp;a way to generate a Verifiable Credential from a passport so that the image of the passport holder’s face in the passport chip can be checked against a live view of that person. This solution is now being used for international travel and border crossing.</p>
<p>When applied to banking and financial services, authenticated biometrics in a Verifiable Credential delivers the strong assurance needed for KYC, account management, and payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It transforms remote onboarding and provides a way to mitigate biometric identity fraud and deepfakes. A customer can verify a liveness check of their face with an authenticated, tamper-proof biometric template of their face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the magic of real Verifiable Credentials is that you can verify this biometric data without having to store your customers’ biometric data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This goes for all the data in the credential. Or data added from another credential to a presentation of this government-grade digital identity. You can cryptographically prove the source of the data and its integrity — that it hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>Our shorthand for this is “portable trust.” All sorts of personal data or critical information can be rendered fully portable for verification anywhere. It’s a fundamental change in how we communicate information — a software architecture that can sit on top of our fractured internet and make it fully integrated, fully seamless.</p>
<p>This is why we talk of digital identity as a payment rail (and it’s not just a metaphor, Verifiable Credentials allow you to create secure, peer-to-peer communications channels for sharing information).</p>
<p>What it means for your customers</p>
<p>Instead of&nbsp; relying on usernames and passwords, backend database calls, or waving around photocopies of government-issued IDs in front of webcams, a customer can scan a QR code to instantly prove who they are and what they’re authorized to have access to&nbsp; without ever exposing sensitive data or calling back to a central server controlled by a third-party verification service. Just a direct, trusted line of communication between your customer and you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because credentials are held by the user, they can move seamlessly across services and providers. Want to let a customer make a transaction with the credentials they used last week to open a digital account? Easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s checking identity for a crypto transaction, approving a loan, or verifying a remote signature, you can be confident the user is who they say they are– and that they’re the only one with access.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven powers fintech</p>
<p>Proven gives you the infrastructure to:</p>
 
 Onboard customers faster, with reusable credentials that prove identity, residency, income, or accreditation. 
 Prevent account takeovers, by enabling biometric-authenticated logins and transactions. 
 Comply with regulations, thanks to selective disclosure and audit trails for every credential use. 
 Create better UX, where users don’t repeat the same steps across your ecosystem. 
 Scale trust, by letting partners verify credentials you issue — or issue their own into your network 
 Manage AI, by giving your agents, chatbots, and digital assistants, verifiable identities for secure customer interaction and permissioned data access. 
 
<p>The bottom line</p>
<p>Indicio Proven isn’t just a new way to verify identity, it’s a new way to build digital trust — one that provides a common foundation for commercial, digital, corporate and decentralized banking and finance.</p>

  Software République unveils "vision 4rescue",<br>
an integrated technological ecosystem for the next-gen of Emergency Services
prezly

Wed, 06/11/2025 - 13:59


             
 In response to the increasing frequency and intensity of emergencies and natural disasters, Software République introduces “vision 4rescue,” designed to enhance the efficiency of emergency response during critical situations. 
 This ecosystem, comprising 20 interconnected solutions, aims to better integrate the various technologies used by emergency services for faster and more coordinated interventions. 
 For this innovative ecosystem, Software République has joined forces with 3 firefighter/emergency units as well as 4 other technological partners. 
 
<p>Viva Technology, Paris – June 11, 2025 – For the 2025 edition of Viva Technology, Software République, a group of 7 European companies1 that combine their expertise towards an intelligent, secure and durable mobility, has partnered with three firefighter units2 to unveil “vision 4rescue,” a system of interconnected technological solutions aimed at increasing the efficiency and improving the coordination of rescue and emergency services.</p>
<p>In France, natural disasters have increased fivefold in fifteen years, with two-thirds of municipalities now likely to experience some kind of major natural disaster3. Faced with more frequent, intense, and complex interventions (natural disasters, industrial hazards, urban accidents, or emergency medical interventions), emergency and rescue professions need to adapt to increasing challenges. This adaptation is all the more necessary given an aging population, growing urbanization, and an increasingly strained healthcare system, where personal assistance now accounts for over 80% of emergency services' operational activity (4 million interventions per year4). These growing challenges call for new solutions to risk management, intervention methods, as well as the transformation of equipment and technologies used.</p>
<p>Making a Difference: <br>​A Technological Ecosystem serving Emergency Services and Populations</p>
<p>To be more effective, a key factor is removing the technological barriers between the different services used by emergency teams. Whether it involves vehicles, video surveillance cameras, or communication systems, emergency services now need seamless integration among all these devices. “vision 4rescue” offers a system of integrated, interconnected, and secure technologies to address this challenge. </p>
<p>By combining their expertise and leveraging a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Emergency services requirements, the partners have designed an ecosystem of nearly 20 interconnected solutions to:</p>
<p>Anticipate with precision emergencies through enhanced field vision and real-time analysis of multi-source data. </p>
<p>Act more effectively at every stage of the emergency and rescue intervention, with tailored, accessible, and integrated devices.</p>
<p>Communicate more efficiently with emergency teams and with the public through more direct, faster, and targeted messaging, thereby enhancing collective resilience and the ability to respond effectively.</p>
<p>Interconnected Equipment: A Decisive Lever for Emergency Response</p>
<p>“vision 4rescue” includes several pieces of equipment designed to collect and share as much information as possible:</p>
 
 Long-range drones (Thales) and short-range drones (Parrot): Equipped with cameras and onboard communication systems, they provide precise surveillance of emergency zones, collecting and sharing information. 
 Connected urban furniture (JCDecaux) serves as a direct communication interface with the population and plays a sentinel role. The short-range drone can use the take-off / landing platform facilitating the incident diagnosis by the emergency services. 
 Renault 4 E-Tech electric vehicle (Renault Group): Tailored to emergency needs, acting as a mobile command center close to the operations. 
 
<p>In addition to these three pieces of equipment, electronic sensor networks (STMicroelectronics) are used in both urban (urban furniture, traffic lights, etc.) and rural environments (forests, near watercourses, etc.) to detect anomalies.</p>
<p>Next-Generation Technological Solutions</p>
<p>Software République integrates a system of technologies into “vision 4rescue” a set of technologies that makes it a unique and comprehensive ecosystem, capable of adapting operational responses in real time to the most complex and simultaneous situations. These include:</p>
<p>Modeling, simulation, and detection solutions:</p>
 
 Dassault Systèmes connects virtual twins of physical and digital systems in a collaborative virtual world to simulate complex risk scenarios, explore prevention plans, and orchestrate the optimal deployment of resources. 
 Cybersecure AI platforms (Thales) manage autonomous drone operations and orchestrate tactical missions, analyzing multi-source data (drones, satellites, etc.) in real time to better detect risks and anticipate their evolution - even from mobile, decentralized command centers like the R4. 
 The Flux Vision (Orange) analysis tools and mission planning tools (HawAI.tech) optimize drone flight paths taking into account all mission constraints. 
 A crisis management solution (Atos) integrates prevention plans, monitoring, and simulation data to organize emergency responses. 
 
<p>Solutions to enhance responsiveness:</p>
 
 A V2X - vehicle to everything - solution (Orange) enables real-time communication between the vehicle and its environment. 
 A tactical communication tool (Atos) connects vehicles, field teams, and drones to maximize data collection, enhanced via AI, and shared in real time. 
 To transmit vital information to firefighters under stress in complex environments, Peripheral uses peripheral vision. 
 Embedded AI and electronic components (STMicroelectronics) optimize equipment responsiveness, reduce latency, and ensure high data security while incorporating energy-saving solutions for greater autonomy and durability. 
 
<p>Guaranteed connectivity under all circumstances:</p>
 
 Hybrid networks and devices (Orange), including onboard 5G network and a connected SOS backpack, along with ultra-light Wi-Fi mesh technology (Green Communications) with embedded resilience applications, ensure communication between emergency teams during critical operations where traditional infrastructure is unavailable. 
 An emergency communication system (Thales) integrated into long-range drone or the R4, geolocates mobile phones in risk zones and sends alert messages to which civilians can respond if needed. 
 A communication solution compliant with the C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport System) international standard ensures native interoperability and secure exchanges between vehicles and road infrastructure (Atos). 
 
<p>Key Partnerships</p>
<p>For this project, Software République and its seven members (Atos, Dassault Systèmes, JCDecaux, Orange, Renault Group, STMicroelectronics, and Thales) partnered with three firefighter units and four other technology partners: Parrot, HawAI.tech, Peripheral, and Green Communications.</p>
<p>Presentation at VivaTech</p>

            <p>Article published by La Tribune Dimanche on 10 June 2025. Translated with the kind permission of La Tribune. Read the article in French on La Tribune website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latribune.fr/la-tribune-dimanche/dimanche-eco/patrice-caine-pdg-de-thales-l-europe-peut-rester-en-ligue-des-champions-dans-le-domaine-spatial-1026879.html">Patrice Caine, PDG de Thales : « L’Europe peut rester en Ligue des Champions dans le domaine spatial »</a></p>
 “Europe can remain a Champions League player in the field of space” 
<p>The Chairman of the French high-tech firm has far-reaching ambitions in the field of quantum technology and in the consolidation of the European space industry.</p>
 
<p>After ten years at the head of Thales, what strategic vision have you defined for the next ten years?</p>
<p>Thales has successfully completed a strategic transformation over the past decade that makes our company a global leader in high-tech for defence, aerospace, cybersecurity and digital. This has allowed us to double our size and our operational performance. In cybersecurity and digital, we have made significant investments, especially with the acquisitions of Gemalto and Imperva, which have turned us into a world leader in those fields. These are areas with a future, with prospects for growth and profitability, for example the digitalisation of SIM cards. We also sold our railway signalling business after having righted the ship. This is a sector that has been consolidated around very large vertically-integrated players that have a “turnkey” offer incorporating both rolling stock and signalling.</p>
<p>What growth-rate are you anticipating for Thales in the medium term?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the coming years, my vision is to consolidate and develop Thales' position as a global high-tech leader. We are responding to the needs created by three major trends: growing geopolitical tensions, which we all deplore, but which generate a strong global demand for more security and defence; continued growth in air traffic until 2050; and the digitalisation of our lives and societies. The more the objects we use are connected, the more software they use... and the more potentially vulnerable they are to cyberthreats. This is even truer in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). Cybersecurity is becoming the oxygen of our societies, so to speak, and it is true for both individuals and businesses. This favourable environment, combined with the excellence of our technologies and our R&amp;D, is what will drive our growth over the coming years. We have made it clear to our investors that our aim is to increase our turnover by 5% to 7% per year between now and 2028.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many observers believe that Thales is becoming more and more a defence company, as evidenced by the strong increase in the share-price in recent months.</p>
<p>There is perception and then there are facts. Taking into account the strong growth of ourdefence activities and the sale of the railway signalling business in May 2024, Thales now generates over 50% of its turnover in defence (around 55% last year). However, when we completed the acquisition of Gemalto in April 2019, the pendulum swung towards our civil businesses. You have to remember that a well-balanced duality between civil and defence businesses remains at the heart of the company’s strategy and provides us with resilience. It’s part of Thales' DNA. And it’s one of its great strengths.</p>
<p>What is your R&amp;D strategy?</p>
<p>Our three major markets - defence, aerospace, and cyber and digital - all draw on a common technology base. We invest more than €4 billion a year in R&amp;D, to which 33,000 Thales engineers and researchers are dedicated. Beyond our R&amp;D investments, our civil and defence cyber businesses (€2 billion in sales) also help to set us apart from the competition by bringing ever more value to our customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you choose the technologies that bring a decisive advantage to your future products?</p>
<p>Thales invests in technologies that anticipate future trends, which is absolutely key for a company like ours. Our turnover, which today exceeds €20 billion, allows us to support a powerful R&amp;D strategy. We are interested in many technologies, such as algorithms, electronic components, optics, photonics, signal propagation and acoustic waves... We cover a huge scope that encompasses the technologies of the digital world as well as those of the physical sciences. On the outside, there is a lot of talk about AI and quantum, but the reality is much broader.</p>
<p>For example?</p>
<p>We are working on the technologies of future components, called SIP (System In Package) – components of components. This is an area that may seem a little dreary, but it is fundamental for our industry, for the electronics of tomorrow and for the sovereignty of states. We are working on a project with FoxConn and Radiall around an SIP production line in France. With a planned production capacity of more than 100 million SIP-type components per year by 2031, this project aims to meet the needs of the European market for advanced semiconductor packaging in the aerospace, automotive, telecommunications and defence sectors. These SIPs will allow France and Europe to increase competitiveness and strategic autonomy in the face of the major component suppliers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What lessons has Thales learnt from the conflict in Ukraine, in terms of artificial intelligence and drones?</p>
<p>In the field of AI, Thales has created its cortAIx accelerator, which brings together more than 800 experts and engineers around the world. We already have more than 100 products that incorporate trusted AI for critical systems. AI is a differentiating technology and is already part of our daily lives. And we are starting to see it on the battlefield. Although it is not so clear from what we see on television, we have to face facts: what the war in Ukraine has confirmed is just how decisive high technology is. At the front, Russian and Ukrainian drones are facing an electromagnetic interference wall. This is why, for short range, the two armies now use wire-guided drones equipped with optical fibres 20 to 30 kilometers long, to avoid jamming. Electronic warfare has become pivotal, and it requires a very high level of technological mastery. What makes the difference on the battlefield today is not only the number of systems, but also how highly they perform. As for the quantum revolution, Thales is one of the most advanced companies in the field.</p>
<p>But quantum technology is much further down the line...</p>
<p>Quantum technology is starting to be seen outside of laboratories. And soon, we will offer sensors that use quantum technologies, such as cold atom inertial units, radio antennas based on quantum interference filters, and magnetic anomaly detectors using nitrogen-vacancy synthetic diamonds (NV centres). They are going to be on the market in a few years, and will be a game-changer. We will be able to detect and measure noises, signals, and “anomalies” that we did not detect before, with sensors a thousand times more compact and a thousand times more precise. This leap in performance is such that it is likely to confound a number of certainties in several areas.</p>
<p>In the field of space, Thales is currently discussing a consolidation with Airbus and Leonardo, code-named Bromo. Do you have any red lines for this major operation?</p>
<p>It is important to remember that at this stage, these are preliminary – and not binding – talks. We must first get the green light from the industry principals, i.e. the governments we work for. The turnover of this industry is largely driven by institutional bodies such as ESA (the European Space Agency) and national space agencies. For example, two-thirds of Thales Alenia Space‘s turnover comes from our institutional customers. Without the agreement of these large constituents, we can do nothing. Today, there is a good understanding – including among our major customers – of the issues surrounding this project, and of why these discussions are taking place. Of course, any consolidation of these businesses must ultimately make economic sense and be useful to all stakeholders.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Is the geopolitical context changing the European Commission’s vision on competition?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not going to comment on the ongoing discussions, outside of the fact that they’re good. Everyone understands that the geopolitical situation has changed. This project, if it is implemented, will obviously have to obtain the approval of the authorities in charge of questions of competition.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, is there not a risk of space in Europe stalling?</p>
<p>The ESA ministerial conference at the end of the year will be an important and, in fact, strategic event. European countries, including France, are lucky enough to be able to pursue their ambitions in the space sector in order to remain in the Champions League.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Should we be worried?</p>
<p>The country’s fiscal position is what it is, but Europe and France have enormous assets. In particular, we must strongly support the sectors where we are in a leadership position, so as to remain there. We must therefore make the right public investment choices in order to develop our strengths, and to maintain or even increase our positions as leaders: the space industry, the aeronautics industry, where we are at work within CORAC (the council for civil aeronautics research) and of course the defence industry in the service of our armed forces.<br>

As always, the remaining 20%, which is where delegation lives, will take the majority of the effort to achieve.”</p>

<p>Delegation, especially in the digital world, spans every sector and silo you can think of, from personal issues to business needs. A caregiver needs to manage prescriptions for an incapacitated family member. An executive assistant files expense reports on behalf of a CEO. An AI agent moves money between your bank accounts, ideally without draining your savings in the process. Real life involves multiple actors, multiple roles, and a messy, shifting web of consent and authority.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most of our digital systems still behave as if we’re playing a single-player game. Delegation, the ability for one party to act clearly and securely on behalf of another, is not a nice-to-have. It never really was; just ask anyone who had to get into someone else’s accounts after that someone else passed away. But agentic AI has turned what was treated as an edge case into a foundational requirement for how we live and interact online.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/03/delegation-part-one/">first post on delegation</a>, I wrote about why this matters. Now let’s consider what today’s technical foundations offer and why what we have today isn’t enough.</p>



 OAuth: Great for Authorization. Awkward for Delegation. 



<p>If you work anywhere near digital identity, you know <a href="https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2">OAuth 2.0</a> (I’d like directly to the spec, but there are <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2615">SO MANY SPECS</a> in the OAuth family. It’s crazypants.). OAuth 2.0 is the backbone of how we let one service act on behalf of a user. It’s how you click “Sign in with Google” or allow a fitness app to access your calendar.</p>



<p>For basic authorization, OAuth is brilliant. But for complex, human-centric delegation? Not so much.</p>



<p>In most OAuth implementations, delegation looks like “Alice-to-Alice” sharing. Alice authorizes a service, and when that service acts, it looks like Alice herself is taking the action. There’s no clear, auditable distinction between actions initiated directly by Alice and actions performed on her behalf.</p>



<p>When the stakes are low, that’s fine. When delegation needs to be explicit, limited, and verifiable, you know, in healthcare, finance, or enterprise environments, it starts to fall apart.</p>



 RFC 8693: Token Exchange – Helpful, but Not Plug-and-Play 



<p>There is important work happening inside OAuth to handle more sophisticated delegation patterns.</p>



<p>RFC 8693 (OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange) defines a way to trade one token for another. It creates the foundation for services acting “on behalf of” a user and enables more traceable chains of authorization.</p>



<p>This is real progress. It opens the door to:</p>



 
 Services that act as authorized intermediaries, 



 Audit trails that reflect delegated authority, 



 Clearer boundaries between who initiated which actions. 
 



<p>But it has its own issues.</p>



<p>As shared by engineers working with these standards today, RFC 8693 is a framework, not a turnkey solution. It’s incredibly useful if someone does the heavy work of designing the exact policies, constraints, and usage patterns that fit a specific environment.</p>



<p>There are no general-purpose, plug-and-play implementations. To put it another way, RFC 8693 gives you the ingredients. It doesn’t bake the gluten-and-dairy-free-but-still-tasty cake.</p>



 OAuth 2.1: Important Cleanup, Not a Delegation Revolution 



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/">OAuth 2.1</a> is currently moving through the IETF process; that means it is still a draft, and you shouldn’t think of it as a stable specification. It consolidates best practices from OAuth 2.0 and improves security by:</p>



 
 Requiring Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for all clients, 



 Removing risky flows like the Implicit and Resource Owner Password Credentials grants, 



 Tightening rules around redirect URIs to prevent common attacks. 
 



<p>These are much-needed improvements to make OAuth deployments more secure and consistent.</p>



<p>However, OAuth 2.1 does not introduce major new delegation capabilities. If you were hoping for a seamless way to model multi-actor delegation as a standard feature, OAuth 2.1 will disappoint you. It’s a maintenance and modernization release, not a redesign of delegation models.</p>



 What’s Still Missing? 



<p>When people talk about “richer delegation models,” they are typically looking for capabilities that OAuth alone doesn’t fully deliver today:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints: Delegating narrowly, following the model of “only access this resource, only for this task, only during this window.” 



 Clear actor chains: Recording “Bob is acting for Alice” rather than obscuring delegation behind a generic authorization. 



 Lifecycle management: Ensuring delegation expires automatically when the situation changes (e.g., a role change or time limit). 



 Auditability: Maintaining reliable logs that show exactly who acted, when, and under what authority. 



 Transitivity control: Defining whether and how a delegated authority can be further delegated to others. 
 



<p>OAuth, with extensions like Token Exchange and Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), can enable some of this when carefully implemented. (Those last three words should fill you with trepidation, just sayin’.) But it doesn’t guarantee it, and it leaves much of the structure up to each deployment. (What could possibly go wrong?)</p>



<p>That gap matters, especially as systems get more complex, regulatory scrutiny increases, and agentic AI becomes more common.</p>



 Exploring Other Delegation Models 



<p>Recognizing these gaps, others in the identity community are exploring additional models beyond pure OAuth:</p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html">User-Managed Access (UMA)</a>: Built on top of OAuth 2.0, UMA allows resource owners to define fine-grained sharing policies. It offers strong concepts for delegation but has seen limited real-world adoption due to its complexity. 



 Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (VCs and DIDs): These technologies allow an agent to present cryptographically verifiable proof of delegated authority. They are still maturing but hold significant promise for trusted delegation between humans, organizations, and AI agents. 



 Enterprise Mission Profiles: Some organizations are developing tailored delegation frameworks for specific industries, building on OAuth or PKI to meet regulated needs without relying on consumer-grade assumptions. 
 



<p>Each approach recognizes the same fundamental reality: digital systems must become much better at supporting explicit, constrained, auditable delegation.</p>



 Why I’m Writing About This 



<p>To be clear, I’m not one of the people writing these specifications. I’m not here to offer a new protocol or propose another working group. No, seriously, we do not need another working group. My goal is to build a bridge between people who have resources to throw at this problem and the groups working on the problem now. .</p>



<p>There is a growing group of implementers, architects, and security leads who are starting to notice the cracks:</p>



 
 Delegation models are messy. 



 AI agents are bumping into walls. 



 Critical systems are relying on brittle workarounds. 
 



<p>At the same time, important, thoughtful work is happening in standards bodies like the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Foundation</a> and the IETF to address delegation challenges, but those efforts aren’t widely understood yet.</p>



<p>If you’re feeling frustrated that “surely OAuth already handles this,” or worried that your project’s AI agent has no clean path to delegated authority, you’re not wrong.</p>



<p>The people working on these specs know there’s a gap. They’re working hard to close it. They are amazing. But building better delegation models will take time, feedback, and collaboration from across the industry, not just inside the standards track.</p>



 Delegation Isn’t Solved Yet, But It’s Solvable 



<p>Delegation today is a patchwork of partial solutions. But it doesn’t have to stay that way.</p>



<p>With better tools and more attention to what real-world delegation actually requires, we can build systems that reflect the complex, messy, multi-actor world we live in. It’s not going to change quickly, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be focusing our attention on fixing the problems. </p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00]<br>Welcome to A Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Why Are We Talking About Delegation Again? 



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Welcome back. Today, we’re revisiting the topic of delegation, but this time we’re diving into the technical side—what today’s systems offer, why it’s not enough, and where the real gaps lie.</p>



<p>[00:00:41]<br>If you’re familiar with OAuth, hang in for 30 seconds. If not, no worries—here’s the short version:</p>



<p>[00:00:50]<br>OAuth is a protocol that lets you authorize one service to access something you control without handing over your password.</p>



<p>[00:00:57]<br>It’s why you can “Sign in with Google” or allow a calendar app to sync your schedule—without giving up full control of your account.</p>



 



 OAuth: The Backbone of Modern Delegation 



<p>[00:01:04]<br>OAuth is the underlying plumbing for online access delegation. When it works well, it’s great. But when it falls short (and spoiler alert: it does), it results in messy workarounds and real security gaps.</p>



<p>[00:01:25]<br>Originally, digital systems were built around a clean model: one user, one identity, one device, one intent. And while that worked for about 80% of use cases, the remaining 20%—where delegation lives—takes the most effort to get right.</p>



 



 Real Life Is Messy: The Rise of Multi-Actor Systems 



<p>[00:01:47]<br>Fast forward to today: real life is messy, with overlapping authority and complex actors.</p>



<p>[00:02:00]<br>Think about it:</p>



 
 A caregiver managing a family member’s medical appointments 



 An executive assistant filing expenses for a CEO 



 An AI agent managing your bank accounts (ideally without buying a Tesla) 
 



<p>[00:02:15]<br>Delegation has never been a “nice-to-have” feature. It’s always been critical—just ask anyone who’s had to manage a deceased relative’s online accounts.</p>



<p>[00:02:25]<br>Now, with AI entering the picture, delegation has gone from edge case to foundational design problem—and most systems aren’t ready.</p>



 



 What OAuth Gets Right (and Where It Breaks) 



<p>[00:02:39]<br>OAuth 2.0 is well-known in identity circles. It’s a powerful authorization protocol, especially for simple use cases like:</p>



 
 Signing in with Google 



 Granting apps access to calendar or contacts 
 



<p>[00:03:17]<br>But for complex, human-centered delegation, things start to fall apart. Here’s what typically happens:</p>



 
 Alice authorizes a service 



 The service acts 



 Logs show Alice did it—even though it was the service 
 



<p>[00:03:41]<br>That’s okay when the stakes are low. But when it’s an AI agent booking travel, paying bills, or managing healthcare? Not so much.</p>



<p>[00:03:52]<br>You don’t want to give your AI or family member unlimited, untraceable access.</p>



<p>[00:04:03]<br>But you also don’t want it blocked at every turn. Systems need to recognize that it’s acting with limited, delegated authority.</p>



 



 The Need for Rich, Constrained Delegation 



<p>[00:04:12]<br>Without rich, constrained delegation, you either:</p>



 
 Grant too much access and lose control 



 Or block useful actions completely 
 



<p>[00:04:22]<br>Neither option is ideal. And OAuth—at least as widely implemented—wasn’t designed for this kind of nuanced delegation.</p>



 



 RFC 8693: Token Exchange to the Rescue? 



<p>[00:04:32]<br>OAuth isn’t standing still. One key development is RFC 8693—the token exchange spec. It enables services to act on a user’s behalf with audit trails and chains of authority.</p>



<p>[00:05:06]<br>Sounds promising, right?</p>



<p>[00:05:06]<br>But here’s the catch: RFC 8693 is a framework, not a turnkey solution. It gives you the ingredients, not the cake.</p>



<p>[00:05:31]<br>If your project assumes token exchange will “just work” for delegation—good luck. You’ll need to profile it properly, define scopes, and create policies tailored to your environment.</p>



 



 What About OAuth 2.1? 



<p>[00:05:40]<br>OAuth 2.1 is in the works. It tightens up security and standardizes key improvements:</p>



 
 PKCE is now mandatory 



 Risky flows (like resource owner passwords) are removed 



 Redirect rules are stricter 
 



<p>[00:06:13]<br>These are great changes. But let’s be clear: OAuth 2.1 is a maintenance release. It’s not a new model for delegation.</p>



 



 What We Actually Need for Delegation 



<p>[00:06:39]<br>When people say we need “richer” delegation, they mean:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints<br>(e.g., access this resource for this purpose within this timeframe) 



 Clear actor chains<br>(e.g., Bob is acting for Alice—and the system knows it) 



 Lifecycle management<br>(e.g., permissions expire automatically with role changes) 



 Auditability<br>(e.g., logs that track who did what, when, and on whose behalf) 



 Transitivity control<br>(e.g., delegate-of-a-delegate rules with tight boundaries) 
 



<p>[00:07:59]<br>Especially with AI, you may want a delegate (human or agent) to be able to re-delegate—but only for specific purposes and within strict limits.</p>



 



 The Problem with Current Systems 



<p>[00:08:08]<br>Without fine-grained control, delegation chains either collapse into chaos or simply don’t work.</p>



<p>And right now, very few systems—or standards—can handle controlled, conditional re-delegation well.</p>



 



 Other Delegation Models to Watch 



<p>[00:08:42]<br>Outside of OAuth, some promising models include:</p>



 
 User Managed Access (UMA)<br>Fine-grained sharing policies—but limited adoption 



 Verifiable Credentials &amp; DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)<br>Let agents cryptographically prove they’re authorized—but still maturing 



 Enterprise Mission Profiles<br>Customized frameworks tuned for high-compliance environments like banking 
 



<p>[00:09:31]<br>All of these agree on one thing: one user, one device, one intent no longer reflects the real world (if it ever did).</p>



 



 Why This Matters 



<p>[00:09:44]<br>I’m not writing OAuth specs, and I’m not proposing another working group (please, no more working groups).</p>



<p>[00:09:53]<br>What I am trying to do—through this podcast and blog—is build a bridge.</p>



<p>Because:</p>



 
 More architects and implementers are realizing delegation is messy 



 AI agents are bumping into walls 



 Critical systems are relying on brittle workarounds 
 



 



 So, Where Do We Go from Here? 



<p>[00:10:14]<br>Standards bodies like the OpenID Foundation and IETF are doing excellent, thoughtful work. But that work isn’t always widely understood or accessible.</p>



<p>[00:10:45]<br>If you’re frustrated that “surely OAuth handles this”—you’re not alone. It doesn’t. Yet.</p>



<p>[00:11:04]<br>Delegation isn’t solved—but it is solvable. With better tools and more attention to real-world needs, we can build systems that reflect the messy, beautiful, multi-actor world we live in.</p>



<p>And while it won’t happen overnight (hello, technical debt), it’s absolutely worth doing.</p>

            <p>Project CABOT – the Royal Navy’s planned Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) barrier in the North Atlantic – isn’t simply about detecting and tracking submarines; it’s about total situational awareness, from space to seabed, across a vast, opaque operating environment.</p>
<p>
It’s a monumental challenge as much as it is a tremendous opportunity – one that will test the Navy and push the ingenuity of industry to new heights.</p>
 Continuous capability evolution at revolutionary speed 
<p>Earlier this year, the Royal Navy outlined its plans to commission a persistent barrier in the North Atlantic to hunt out hostile actors trying to enter allied waters. &nbsp;Known as “Project CABOT”, this would be comprised of networked uncrewed vehicles (UVs) equipped with advanced sensor systems capable of both active and passive sonar deployment. This barrier promises to be transformative in its ultimate strategic value and revolutionary in terms of the pace at which the Navy wants it to be developed.</p>
<p>Yet Project CABOT will need to be delivered and deployed in a fundamentally evolutionary fashion. Technological leaps can be astonishingly swift if you’re happy to ‘move fast and break things.’ The Navy, of course, can’t afford to do this – its ASW capability needs to be continuous if it’s to be effective. This is why delivery of CABOT will require scaling existing systems and processes, as well as seamlessly integrating newly uncrewed with lean-crewed assets.</p>
 Six key development areas crucial to CABOT’s success 
<p>Project CABOT presents several key opportunities for industry to contribute innovative solutions. With opportunity comes challenge, of course, and Thales has learned from long experience that we must address the most consequential of these, not in series, but in parallel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means we need to look at the sensing capability of the proposed system-of-systems as a whole. There seem to me to be six key development areas:</p>
<p>First, advancing long-range underwater communication and secure data transfer to enable seamless information flow and enhance the overall effectiveness of the ASW barrier. Realising this will require robust, reliable, and secure supporting infrastructure.</p>
<p>Second, successfully managing a wide range of environmental factors will ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the ASW barrier, since acoustic conditions in the ocean vary widely due to varying temperatures, salinity, currents, and the unique topography of the operating area. And while we bear in mind the impact of the environment on the barrier’s operation, we must simultaneously minimise the barrier’s impact on the environment.</p>
<p>Third, achieving extended operational endurance of UVs is a critical requirement for sustained effectiveness. Most existing UVs can only stay on task for a few days. Real-world deployments will typically be far longer. Solutions that prioritise reliability, robustness, and longevity over the very-latest technology may often be better.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Navy needs to reuse and retool existing assets wherever possible. However, this isn’t a simple matter of installing an autonomous captain to previously crewed vessels. If any small, seemingly inconsequential part of an autonomous system’s deployment, maintenance and/or operation has been originally designed with a human in the loop (e.g. a grease nipple designed to be maintained by a crew member), the vessel’s autonomy – and therefore its effectiveness – is fundamentally compromised.</p>
 The devil’s in the data 
<p>Addressing these four development areas may turn out to be the easy part because the fifth issue that we need to consider within the system-wide context is that of data transfer and storage. Naval systems already generate colossal amounts of data. Industry partners will need to address this challenge as part of Project CABOT.</p>
<p>Finally, realising the potential of data fusion, processing and exploitation is paramount (and perhaps the most difficult challenge of all). Not only will data proliferate as CABOT is delivered, it will also diversify. New sensors will produce more types of data, at different speeds, at different times, and in different formats. If all this data is to be turned into actionable insights, it’s going to need to be synthesised swiftly and effectively, using tools and techniques that have yet to be battle tested.</p>
<p>This challenge is inseparable from the question of where to process all this data in a way that balances security with operational effectiveness. On shore? At the edge? There’s no “right” answer – it’s a question of judgement as much as technical expertise.</p>
 Technological transformation demands cultural adaptation 
<p>Naval Command understands, just as Thales does, that technical challenges are often the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Roles and responsibilities across the service will inevitably change as CABOT gets underway, as technologies advance and the threat evolves. Many crews and individuals will need to do things differently; others will need to learn how to do different things. This brings with it new opportunities for growth, development and enhanced operational capabilities.</p>
<p>Not only will new tactics, techniques and procedures need to be developed and implemented, there will be a considerable training burden associated with CABOT if service personnel are to learn to operate and trust new automated and autonomous systems. All too often, technologists become so focused on relieving one set of cognitive burdens that they forget that new technologies and workflows – however intuitive – risk introducing others. If the Navy’s new ASW barrier is to disrupt the adversary more than the Royal Navy, it’s crucial that industry partners keep this issue front of mind.</p>
 Rising to meet the challenge 
<p>With Project CABOT, the Royal Navy has presented industry with something it has long sought: the chance to solve identified problems rather than to deliver already-specified solutions. It’s a remarkable opportunity and an exciting prospect. After all, companies like Thales are full of highly motivated, highly experienced experts who relish the opportunity to address these challenges.</p>
<p>Project CABOT should also be a daunting prospect to any organisation thinking of taking up the challenge. Where you’re no longer merely responsible for delivering against defined requirements, you’re accountable for delivering the operational outcomes.</p>
<p>For Project CABOT to succeed it requires industry partners to rise above the role of suppliers and actively ensure its success as strategic allies to the Navy. Technical expertise will be worth little without a correspondingly deep understanding of the Navy’s operational imperatives. And neither of these things will be enough without the willingness to do the hard yards and embrace the challenges to ensure the project’s success. As the saying goes, a ship is safe in the harbour, but that’s not what ships are built for.</p>

<p>KYC refresh is more than regulatory hygiene. Done right, it protects your business, improves customer satisfaction, and reduces operational drag. By applying a risk-based approach and the right technology, you can refresh client records with precision, automate up to 90 percent of the process, and turn compliance into a competitive asset.</p>
 
 Why KYC Refresh Matters 
<p>A KYC refresh is the periodic process of reviewing and updating client information to ensure it reflects their current risk profile. It is not optional. Whether required by a regulatory cycle, triggered by a risk event, or prompted by a jurisdictional policy update, KYC refresh is now expected as part of any ongoing customer due diligence framework.</p>
<p>What used to be a back-office task has become a front-line control. It protects your institution against fraud, enforcement action, and reputational damage. But for too many firms, it still means a mess of emails, PDF forms, manual reviews, and irritated clients.</p>
 
 Common Pitfalls in Traditional KYC Refresh Workflows 
<p>Most firms still treat KYC refresh as a reactive checklist. This approach is slow, manual, and prone to error.</p>
 
 Data is pulled from outdated systems or spreadsheets 
 Customers are asked for information they have already provided 
 Compliance analysts must manually compare documents, validate changes, and log notes in isolated systems 
 Refresh cycles are static, not risk-based, meaning high-risk clients may go unchecked while low-risk clients are over-screened 
 There is no audit trail that links what was reviewed, when, by whom, and what changed 
 
<p>The result is poor visibility, increased regulatory exposure, and customer frustration.</p>
 
 A Better Model: Risk-Based and Automated 
<p>Leading firms are shifting from reactive reviews to proactive KYC refresh cycles. This means segmenting clients by risk and automating the work accordingly.</p>
 High-risk clients 
<p>Refresh most frequently or upon trigger events. Include document re-verification, new screening, updated risk assessments, and potential escalation to enhanced due diligence.</p>
 Medium-risk clients 
<p>Refresh regularly. Use automation to confirm key data, update watchlist screening, and verify continued activity alignment with stated business purpose.</p>
 Low-risk clients 
<p>Refresh less often or on auto-pilot via continuous monitoring. Use passive data checks, behaviour monitoring, and automated triggers to flag changes in risk exposure.</p>
 
 How to Implement a Modern KYC Refresh Strategy 
 1. Segment your customers by risk 
<p>Review your onboarding profiles and determine which customers are due for a refresh. Consider geography, industry, ownership complexity, transaction history, and past risk indicators.</p>
 2. Set triggers and schedules 
<p>Combine fixed intervals with dynamic events. Triggers can include address changes, document expiry, transaction anomalies, adverse media alerts, or policy shifts.</p>
 3. Automate outreach and collection 
<p>Use pre-filled digital forms, smart questionnaires, and self-service portals to request updated information. Eliminate the need for manual email follow-ups and one-size-fits-all templates.</p>
 4. Validate documents automatically 
<p>Use document authentication and biometric checks to verify IDs and ownership documents. Apply liveness checks and passive face match for returning users.</p>
 5. Refresh screening in real time 
<p>Screen updated profiles against sanctions, PEP lists, adverse media, and fraud databases. Record all hits and resolutions in an audit-ready format.</p>
 6. Maintain a continuous audit trail 
<p>Capture every action, update, and risk score adjustment. Your refresh process should be defensible, not just compliant.</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought, how facial ID recognition plays its crucial role in ID verification? No! Get ready! This blog post is going to be special for you.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this digital age, where digital security is paramount for all agencies, facial ID recognition has emerged as a cutting-edge solution for ID verification.</p>
<p>But here is a question often raised by many users: What is this? How is it shaping the future of ID verification?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog post is an answer to such questions. In this guide, we will have a detailed discussion on this topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read this content from start to end carefully….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Facial ID Recognition? 
<p>After hearing this term, you would have understood it. Facial ID recognition is an innovative biometric technology that analyzes the facial features of users. It utilizes AI, ML, and their sophisticated algorithms to verify whether and map the facial geometry, like the distance between your eyes, the shape of your jawline, and other facial features.</p>
<p>Here you would be thinking, how does this technology work? Don’t worry! The upcoming section is the answer to this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Facial ID Recognition Works? 
<p>In this section, we will discuss a step-by-step guide on how facial ID recognition works for <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID document liveness detection SDK</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: The system captures some images of users or scans their faces using a high-quality scanner.</p>
<p>Step 2: Software driven by AI identifies the facial features of users, like jawlines, distance between eyes, etc.</p>
<p>Step 3: Now, the system compares the scanned face with the database of images.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finally, the decision is made based on the similarity score. It ensures whether the fake ID scanner confirms the matches or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Role of Facial ID Verification in Shaping the Future of ID Verification 
<p>Let’s uncover the cornerstone section of this blog, which is all about the role of facial ID recognition in shaping the future of fake ID verification.</p>
 1. Enhanced Security 
<p>After the arrival of facial ID recognition, users have eliminated their worries related to security during ID verification. As we have hinted earlier that this technology is driven by AI software.</p>
<p>So, this is the greatest benefit of this integration of AI and ML with this technology, that security has been increased from 10 to 1000.</p>
<p>How this technology further shows its magic will be discussed in the next headings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Frictionless User Experience 
<p>Those days have gone when old traditional methods of security like entering passwords, answering questions, and others were at their peak. These ways were undoubtedly time-consuming and boring.</p>
<p>However, technology has brought this innovative method of verification. This facial ID recognition is free of such tension of time and hassles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can verify the users’ and their documents’ realness or fakeness within a few minutes. Additionally, it always provides the system with accurate results. Such accuracy is not exclusive to humans. They can sometimes make some mistakes during verification. That’s really great…….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Spoofing Prevention &amp; Liveness Detection 
<p>We should be very thankful to AI and deep learning, which have provided us with an opportunity to differentiate between real faces and fake 3D images and videos. This is called facial liveness detection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two main types of face liveness detection play a crucial role in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Active livness detection: This type of facial liveness detection verifies whether the users have presented the real or fake ID documents and images to the system. They are said to perform some specific actions like blinking, head-moving, and others to identify whether the users are physically present or using fake identities.</p>
<p>Passive liveness detection: In this type, users are identified by their skin and facial features. Additionally, they are also identified through their blood flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Real-time Verification&nbsp; 
<p>We will ask a very simple question of you: Are security guards exclusive to real-time verification of criminals? Hoping!&nbsp; You will say, no!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is true! Humans can perform their duty for a specific time. Even sometimes, criminals can manipulate them during their duty time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, manipulating this technology is not child’s play. This whole system is driven by algorithms. Now you can understand the efficiency of a <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-verification-playground/">fake ID scanner</a> used by this system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we derive a formula for this technology, it is a combination of real-time, error-free, and accurate detection of theft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What About Our Service? 
<p>In this section, we will tell you about our new cutting-edge service.</p>
<p>After reading this role of facial ID recognition, many users ask, How to get it? How can we generate or get such algorithms to identify the theft? So, our service name is Recognito. Let’s give its brief overview.</p>
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> is a top developer of face recognition algorithms recognized by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a> and a leading provider of identity verification solutions.

 Final Thoughts 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">Facial ID recognition</a> is quickly changing how ID verification works. It uses smart technology like AI and machine learning to scan and match people’s faces with their records. This method is fast, safe, and very accurate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike old ways of checking identity, like passwords or manual checks, facial ID is easier and quicker. It also helps stop fake IDs and detect real users using liveness checks. Real-time detection adds even more security by making it harder for criminals to cheat the system. Services like Recognito are making this advanced technology available to more people and businesses. With strong accuracy and security, facial ID recognition is shaping a better and safer future for digital ID verification. It’s time to trust this new way of staying secure and protected.</p>

 Ocean Protocol Update ||&nbsp;2025  1. Introduction <p>Turns out if you spend all your time building, June sneaks up on you. And we wouldn’t have it any other way. 2025’s been moving fast, and so have we. Here’s what we’ve been building and where we’re headed&nbsp;next.</p><p>First things first, let’s start with what you already know: Ocean Protocol was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Over the years, we’ve built a versatile tech stack that combines AI and crypto, allowing secure, private, and decentralized data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The past few months have been all about putting real tools into your hands, improving workflows, and setting the stage for what’s next. With the launch of the new <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">Ocean Nodes Visual Studio Code extension</a>, developers and data scientists can now run free compute-to-data jobs straight from their editor, with zero friction, for developing and testing. You can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/free-compute-to-data-with-ocean-nodes-vscode-extension-1f8385cb077c">here</a>.</p><p>Adoption of Ocean Nodes is growing steadily, and we’re starting to see more community-driven use cases emerge. On the enterprise side, Ocean Enterprise is progressing toward a production-ready launch. Meanwhile, we’re actively building on real-world applications and partnerships to make decentralized AI practical and usable — like the ones with <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-protocol-partners-with-netmind-as-the-first-gpu-provider-for-ocean-nodes-a63a858f9865">Netmind</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-protocol-x-aethir-to-expand-access-to-decentralized-compute-for-ai-builders-5dd143ffddad">Aethir</a>.</p><p>Let’s explore what else we’ve been building, and where we’re headed next in the second half of&nbsp;2025.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-node">Ocean Nodes</a>: This is the innovative solution our core team developed to democratize large models, decentralize them, and help monetize and protect IP. Since the launch on August 15, 2024, more than 1.4M nodes have been installed across over 73 countries, marking a significant leap toward decentralizing data computation.  <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Predictoor</a> has matured with enhanced models, dashboards, and insights, helping users discover pathways to profitability.  <a href="https://oceanenterprise.io/">Ocean Enterprise Collective</a>, an independent initiative, now unites 12 organizations spanning 8 countries and 9 industries, enabling businesses to leverage a fully compliant and secure version of Ocean Protocol.   2. Goals for&nbsp;2025 <p>In this update, we’ll break down our 2025 goals and highlight how they’ll enable you, whether you’re a data scientist, developer, enterprise, or crypto enthusiast, to innovate and&nbsp;thrive.</p> 2.1 From Predictoor baseline, make $&nbsp;trading <p>About Predictoor. In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. The “earn $” part is key, because it fosters&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Predictoor involves two groups of&nbsp;people:</p>  Predictoors: data scientists who use AI models to predict what the price of ETH, BTC, etc will be 5 (or 60) minutes into the future. The scientists run bots that submit these predictions onto the chain every 5 minutes. Predictoors earn $ based on sales of the feeds, including sales from Ocean’s Data Farming incentives program.  Traders: run bots that input predictoors’ aggregated predictions, to use as alpha in trading. It’s another edge for making $ while&nbsp;trading.  <p>Predictoor is built using the Ocean stack. And, it runs on <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Sapphire</a>; we’ve <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/success-in-ai-powered-prediction-bots-leads-to-ocean-oasis-partnership-e4e9f697c99a">partnered</a> with the Oasis&nbsp;team.</p><p>Predictoor traction. Since mainnet launch in October 2023, Predictoor has accumulated about $2B total volume. [Source: <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=all">DappRadar</a>].</p><p>2024 core goal review. Predictoor’s primary goal throughout 2024 was “traders to make serious $”. If that is met, then traders will spend $ to buy feeds; which leads to serious $ for predictoors. The Predictoor team worked towards this primary goal throughout 2024, testing trading strategies with real $. Bonus side effects of this were improved analytics and&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>2025 core goal. Obviously “make $ trading” is not an easy task. It’s a grind taking skill and perseverance. The team has ratcheted, inching ever-closer to making money. As of early 2025, the live trading algorithms are starting to bear fruit. The team will continue to grind, towards the goal “make serious $ trading”. We can expect this to be the main progress in Predictoor in 2025. Everything else in Predictoor will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>2025 bonus. We’re a few months into 2025. Our collaborators at Oasis have launched <a href="https://x.com/OasisProtocol/status/1918727259818795040">WT3</a>, a decentralized, verifiable trading agent that uses Predictoor feeds for its&nbsp;alpha.</p> 2.2 Launch Ocean Nodes&nbsp;C2D.2 <p>Since <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-ocean-nodes-decentralized-practical-solution-for-building-powerful-ai-c72fc6747165">launching Ocean Nodes in August</a>, nearly 1.4M nodes have been deployed globally, becoming the foundation of decentralized AI infrastructure.</p><p>What’s new in&nbsp;2025?</p>  Free Compute&nbsp;Jobs:    Developers can run test algorithms using limited runtime directly inside their development environment.  <p>2. VS Code Extension:</p>  This extension brings Compute-to-Data directly into VS Code, allowing users&nbsp;to:  Write and run algorithms on real&nbsp;datasets  Monitor job progress in real-time  Customize environments using Docker or private&nbsp;keys  Publish to the Ocean stack directly from their&nbsp;editor  <p>What’s next?</p><p>With Ocean Nodes C2D.2, we’re focused on making the platform even more intuitive and powerful.</p><p>Our vision is to support data scientists to easily write and monetize algorithms, allow businesses to quickly spin up and validate data-driven business cases, and enables developers to build dApps with minimal&nbsp;effort.</p><p>To achieve this goal, we are simultaneously focusing on three key initiatives:</p>  Redesigning the compute infrastructure  Grow our community of data scientists and engage them in using&nbsp;compute  Build real-world business cases on top of&nbsp;compute  <p>For b. and c. we will work in close collaboration with the community of data scientists that we built throughout the years with our data challenges.</p><p>The development plan</p><p>The end goal: to create a sustainable network of compute environments. To do this, we need users to have as little friction as possible before starting to build on top of the stack. Here’s how we’re doing&nbsp;it:</p>  Free Compute&nbsp;Jobs  Visual Studio Code Extension  Paid Compute Jobs: Now that the above is out, we are focused on the paid jobs. Whilst it may sound simple, the mechanisms are more complicated. Also, we are introducing a new payment model that is more flexible and based on the time it takes to&nbsp;compute.  Configurable Nodes: Node owners can enable or disable specific functionalities, such as free environments tied to incentives.  Multistage Compute: Manage complex AI pipelines seamlessly  <p>All these new functionalities will be included in the Visual Studio Code extension, so make sure to download that and get yourself familiar with it before the next&nbsp;updates.</p><p>The end goal is to facilitate the creation of models. For this, we need to integrate GPUs. Together with the data scientist community, we will create easy and intuitive flows to train models and provide ways for inference on created&nbsp;models.</p><p>While the features keep rolling out we will also keep working on creating relevant analytics for the network of nodes and improving the nodes dashboard.</p> Expanding Ocean Nodes Through Strategic Partnerships <p>In 2025, Ocean Protocol has formed key partnerships to enhance the capabilities of Ocean&nbsp;Nodes:</p>  NetMind AI: As the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-partners-with-netmind-as-the-first-gpu-provider-for-ocean-nodes-a63a858f9865">first external GPU provider for Ocean Nodes</a>, NetMind contributes nearly 2,000 high-performance GPUs. This collaboration empowers developers and data scientists to train and scale AI models more efficiently within the decentralized ecosystem.  Aethir: Aethir brings its decentralized cloud computing infrastructure to the Ocean Nodes network. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-x-aethir-to-expand-access-to-decentralized-compute-for-ai-builders-5dd143ffddad">This integration</a> provides AI developers with scalable and cost-effective resources to build, scale, and deploy AI models, further advancing the decentralized AI landscape.  <p>These partnerships significantly bolster the Ocean Nodes infrastructure, offering enhanced computational power and scalability for AI development within the Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p> 3. <a href="https://oceanenterprise.io/">Ocean Enterprise</a> <p>What is Ocean Enterprise?</p><p>Ocean Enterprise is a free open-source enterprise-ready data ecosystem software solution that enables companies and public institutions to securely manage and monetize proprietary AI &amp; data products and services in a trusted and compliant environment.</p><p>What is the goal for&nbsp;2025?</p><p>After extensive design and development in close collaboration with the business community, Ocean Enterprise v1 (OE v1) will be released in Q3 2025. Powered by Ocean Node, OEv1 is meant to be used by companies that are looking to turn digital goods into profits and leverage the exciting new capabilities of compute-to-data in a compliant enterprise offering.</p><p>OE v1 is designed to ensure compliance with the most recent EU data regulations and comes with features dedicated to enterprise use cases. The main features of OEv1 include data space interoperability, access control based on Self Sovereign Identities (SSI), cloud-agnostic design, e-money payment, advanced Intellectual Property licensing, and easy onboarding. The release will include a demo environment that will allow users to test all OEv1 features as well as a deployment kit that will enable easy onboarding and deployment.</p><p>Once OE v1 is released, the existing ecosystem of more than 100 companies and institutions with 400+ solutions across different domains who are already using current versions of Ocean will be able to start onboarding onto Ocean Enterprise and move towards bringing their enterprise-grade environments into production throughout 2025. Future updates to OE are planned towards the end of 2025 and exciting new features are already being considered such as enhanced asset encryption and indexing, detailed seller dashboard, machine-readable asset descriptions, and enhanced privacy protection for computation results.</p><p>Ocean Enterprise is being developed by the Ocean Protocol Collective, a non-profit association dedicated to developing a free open-source, collectively-governed, compliant version of Ocean Protocol designed specifically for enterprise products &amp; projects.</p><p>The Ocean Enterprise Collective includes business representatives from over eight countries and nine different industries including aerospace, agriculture, energy, health, human resources, manufacturing, and the public sector. Interested in becoming a member of the Ocean Enterprise Collective Team? Ready to explore how Ocean Enterprise can transform your business?</p><p>Contact the team at info@oceanenterprise.io.</p> 4. Ongoing Initiatives   Ocean Predictoor Data Farming: Data Farming remains a cornerstone of Ocean’s ecosystem. This is Ocean’s incentives program, where you can earn OCEAN rewards by making predictions via <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>.  Ocean Nodes incentives: Naturally, the program will continue to evolve as the <a href="https://nodes.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Nodes</a> do. We will align incentives with C2D.2 updates, encouraging adoption and rewarding engagement. These changes will always be communicated in advance so the node owners have time to&nbsp;react.  Community Engagement: We’ve already reached Season 12 of our <a href="https://zealy.io/cw/oceanprotocol/questboard">Zealy</a> campaigns, with targeted challenges and rewards. We’ll pause them until the end of Q3, so keep an eye on our socials to know when we’re re-launching them.   5. What’s Coming in H2&nbsp;2025 <p>With the foundation set in H1, the second half of 2025 is all about scaling impact and maturing our products. Here’s what’s coming&nbsp;next:</p>  Paid Compute Jobs: Introducing a flexible payment model to monetize compute&nbsp;jobs  Inference Workflows: Supporting full model development pipelines from training to deployment  Ocean Enterprise Onboarding: Moving early adopters into production environments  Real-World dApps: Expanding the use of Ocean tech into industries like real estate and&nbsp;energy  Analytics Dashboard Improvements: Deeper insights for node operators and&nbsp;users  Incentive Program Updates: Realigning rewards with new feature&nbsp;rollouts   6. Conclusion <p>We’re halfway through 2025, and the focus is clear: sharpen the tools, reduce friction, and support real use cases. From Ocean Nodes VS Code Extension to Ocean Enterprise, everything we’ve released so far is about helping you build faster, better, and with more confidence.</p><p>Whether you’re here to develop AI models, monetize your data, or just experiment with compute-to-data, Ocean is the stack you can build on, but, most importantly, build&nbsp;with.</p><p>Thanks for being part of it.

  Beneficial ownership discovery doesn’t need to be slow or manual. This article explores how firms can use advanced KYB software to comply with UBO requirements from AUSTRAC, FCA, FinCEN, and the EU AMLA - while improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Global regulators including AUSTRAC, FCA, FINRA, FinCEN, and the EU’s AMLA are tightening Know Your Business (KYB) and Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) rules. Legacy methods for identifying and verifying UBOs are too slow, too manual, and too risky. But with the right systems, UBO discovery can become a competitive advantage. KYB compliance software enables firms to reduce onboarding times, increase customer satisfaction, and slash manual effort by 90 percent – all while exceeding the regulatory bar.</p>
 
 The Shift Toward Verified Ownership 
<p>Firms today face growing pressure to not just know their clients but to understand who ultimately owns or controls them. UBO identification is no longer a tick-box exercise. It’s central to anti-money laundering obligations, reputational risk management, and trust in the global financial system. Whether you’re operating in the UK, EU, US, or Australia, regulators are demanding more transparency, faster disclosures, and ongoing oversight of ownership structures.</p>
 
 Regulatory Expectations Are Clear – and Increasing 
 
 
<p>AUSTRAC mandates that reporting entities identify and verify the ultimate beneficial owners of customers, particularly for higher-risk customers and complex structures.</p>
 
 
<p>FCA requires that firms identify and verify UBOs of corporate customers and understand control mechanisms, including voting rights and indirect influence.</p>
 
 
<p>FINRA enforces Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rules, requiring firms to identify the natural persons who own or control legal entity customers.</p>
 
 
<p>FinCEN has implemented the Corporate Transparency Act, mandating detailed beneficial ownership reporting for nearly all corporations, LLCs, and similar entities in the United States.</p>
 
 
<p>EU AMLA legislation sets consistent rules across member states, including central UBO registers and tighter requirements for verifying cross-border ownership chains.</p>
 
 
<p>The message is consistent: firms must discover and document beneficial owners with precision and speed. Excuses tied to complexity or resource constraints are no longer acceptable.</p>
 
 The Problem: Manual Processes Can’t Keep Up 
<p>Most compliance teams still rely on a tangled mix of email chains, spreadsheets, static PDF forms, and fragmented data vendors to complete UBO discovery. These methods result in:</p>
 
 Days or weeks to onboard complex corporate structures 
 Inconsistent data that can’t withstand audits or enforcement scrutiny 
 Frustrated clients who feel like they’re doing your job for you 
 
 
 A Better Approach: Automate, Map, Monitor 
<p>Firms that invest in purpose-built KYB platforms gain far more than just efficiency. With the right technology, UBO discovery becomes a competitive differentiator.</p>
 1. Gain a Competitive Advantage 
<p>Fast onboarding isn’t just nice to have – it’s critical to your success. When your competitors take days to review complex structures, and you deliver decisions in minutes, you win more deals in less time. That’s the bottom line. Rapid UBO discovery across jurisdictions creates momentum for sales, onboarding, and operations. You reduce friction and show clients that you are serious about compliance without making them feel punished by it.</p>
 2. Increase Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty 
<p>Clients don’t want to feel like suspects. Repeated document requests and contradictory forms make onboarding feel adversarial. Automating document collection and verification helps you engage clients with clarity, consistency, and confidence. That’s not just better service – it’s brand protection. Happy clients are loyal clients. Loyal clients refer business.</p>
 3. Reduce Manual Work by 90 Percent 
<p>When your KYB system collects, enriches, and monitors beneficial ownership information in real time, your team stops firefighting and starts delivering value. Automated workflows replace redundant data entry. Smart questionnaires adapt to risk. Alerts notify your analysts when something changes, instead of expecting them to spot it manually. The result is a smarter team with more time to focus on high-value work.</p>
 
 iComply’s KYB Compliance Software: Built for Beneficial Ownership 
<p>iComply’s KYB platform is designed to accelerate and secure UBO discovery at scale:</p>
 
 
<p>Automated document collection and prefilled forms</p>
 
 
<p>Intelligent UBO mapping, linking, and monitoring</p>
 
 
<p>Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening for all related parties</p>
 
 
<p>Ongoing monitoring and refresh cycles based on your risk triggers</p>
 
 
<p>Audit-ready reporting in a single click</p>
 
 
<p>All sensitive user data is processed at the edge – on the user’s device – ensuring compliance with data residency, GDPR, and privacy laws no matter which jurisdiction they are in at the time of verification. One platform. No vendor sprawl. No surprises.</p>
 
 Where the Market Is Going 
<p>Most firms see KYB and UBO checks as a cost centre. That mindset is obsolete. Regulators now expect beneficial ownership transparency as a condition of market access. Banks, PSPs, and law firms will increasingly be judged by how well they identify and assess their clients’ true owners. That means compliance teams who adopt automation early will not only survive – they’ll bring their firms into the lead.</p>
<p>You don’t need more forms. You don’t need more emails. You need a system that does the work for you. Accelerating UBO discovery isn’t about cutting corners. It’s about building trust, faster. With iComply, you can meet global KYB requirements, onboard clients with confidence, and leave manual ownership checks behind—for good.</p>
<p>Start your free trial. Automate beneficial ownership. Take control.</p>

<p>The FBI is urging all iPhone and Android users to be alert to an insidious <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">toll fee texting scam</a> from China widely <a href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2024.pdf">regarded</a> as “an infrastructural attack on our phones, not a single campaign.”</p>



<p>It follows an urgent FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warning in December 2024 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5223490/text-messaging-security-fbi-chinese-hackers-security-encryption#:~:text=But%20the%20agency's%20urgent%20message,of%20Americans%20use%20every%20day.">to stop sending texts messages</a> over unsecured networks and use encrypted messaging and calling systems instead.</p>



<p>The agencies warn texting between Android phones and iPhones is vulnerable (iPhone to iPhone and Android to Android is <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fbi-iphone-android-texting-insecure/">reportedly safe</a>) due to “Chinese hacking of U.S. networks that is reportedly ‘ongoing and likely larger in scale than previously understood.’”</p>



<p>Encrypted channels are considered the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5223490/text-messaging-security-fbi-chinese-hackers-security-encryption">best defense</a> against these attacks.</p>



<p>“Encryption is your friend” for texts and phone calls, Jeff Greene, CISA’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5223490/text-messaging-security-fbi-chinese-hackers-security-encryption">told NPR</a>. “Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible, if not really hard, for them to detect it. So our advice is to try to avoid using plain text.”</p>

<p>Toll smishing texts are rapidly spreading across America</p>



<p>The recent spate of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing">smishing</a> texts are claiming an unpaid toll of $6.99 but are really designed to steal the recipient’s credit card and identity.</p>



<p>The Anti-Phishing Working Group (<a href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2024.pdf">APWG) says</a> the attackers are&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2025-03-06-IOCs-for-smishing-activity.txt">registering tens of thousands of domains</a>&nbsp;to mimic state and city toll agencies and attract clicks. They’re also making similar-looking text message <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">using</a> “an upgraded phishing kit sold in China, which makes it simple to send text messages and launch phishing sites that spoof toll road operators in multiple U.S. states.”</p>



<p>The toll smishing attacks are rapidly spreading “<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240412">from state to state</a>.” The FBI is urging people to delete the texts immediately.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">Authorities</a> are reminding Americans that “legitimate agencies usually send invoices via official mail, not random emails or texts.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">Learn more</a> about the toll smishing attacks. If you receive a toll smishing text, the FBI advises you to:</p>



 
 File a complaint with the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">Internet Crime Complete Centre</a> (IC3). Be sure to include:
 
 The phone number from where the text originated 



 The website listed within the text. 
 
 



 Check your account using the toll service’s legitimate website. 



 Contact the toll service’s customer service phone number. 



 Delete any smishing texts you receive. 
 



<p>You can also report toll scams to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov or your local consumer protection agency.</p>



<p>Spam texts are on the rise</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.robokiller.com/spam-text-insights">Robokiller</a>, more than 19 billion spam texts were sent in the U.S. in February alone.</p>



<p>Always be alert to the possibility of scams texts and emails and NEVER CLICK THE LINK OR GIVE YOUR INFORMATION. If you think the content of the message might be correct, go straight to the company’s legitimate website (e.g. your toll service’s website) and log into your account to check.</p>



<p>If you think you’ve been scammed, check your accounts and change your passwords even if you haven’t made a payment to the scammers. Dispute any unfamiliar charges on your accounts.</p>



<p>Remember, legitimate agencies will communicate with you about unpaid tolls through official post and not via texts and emails.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2024.pdf">APWG</a> says people receiving any sort of scam text can “help update alerting/blocking mechanisms that protect billions of devices and software clients worldwide” by reporting the texts to the FBI’s IC3.gov or directly to them at apwg.org/sms.</p>



<p>MySudo can protect you from smishing and phishing attacks</p>



<p>Sick of scammers? Fight back with MySudo.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/#mysudo-dl">download MySudo</a> for iOS or Android.</p>



<p>Then, set up a dedicated “Car Bills” <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identity</a> within MySudo, and use it specifically for opening and paying tolls and all other car-related services you want to include.</p>



<p>Only ever use your “Car Bills Sudo” <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email address</a> when communicating with and logging into these services. Do not use your personal phone or email.</p>



<p>If a suspected smishing text about an outstanding toll or any other supposed debt comes into any other Sudo (you can have 9 Sudos, depending on your <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">plan</a>) or to your personal phone number, then you will know it’s a scam and delete it.</p>



<p>If a text about a toll comes into your official “Car Bills Sudo” you’re more likely to consider whether it’s from the legitimate service provider and not a scammer. But still stay vigilant and check with the legitimate service provider, remembering they’re more likely to contact you by official mail. If the message turns out to be a scam, you can either:</p>



 
 Ignore it, or 



 Block the scammer’s number, or 



 Reset your “Car Bills” Sudo phone number, or 



 Delete the “Car Bills Sudo” altogether and cut off the scammers. They won’t be able to reach you again. 
 



<p>Go one powerful step further by always using the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">MySudo virtual card</a> within your dedicated “Car Bills Sudo” to pay your toll account and any other car-related bills. That way, even if you fall victim to a scam, the scammer does not have your personal credit card. They have your Sudo virtual card, which you can <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042727394-Can-I-permanently-delete-a-virtual-card-from-my-MySudo-account">easily cancel or close</a> and move on.</p>



<p>The data protection strategy behind MySudo is called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">compartmentalization</a>.</p>

<p>For passionate football fans, catching live matches without subscription fees is key. In 2025, navigating free streaming options can be tricky, with varying quality and reliability. This guide cuts through the noise, presenting the Top 10 Websites to Watch Football for Free, ensuring you find stable, high-quality streams for all your favorite leagues and never miss a goal this year.</p>



 Introduction To Top Websites To Watch Football For Free 



<p>For football fans, watching live matches is essential, but high subscription costs can be a barrier. Thankfully, many platforms let you watch football for free. However, quality, stability, and safety vary greatly. This guide will introduce you to the top websites to watch football for free, helping you find reliable streams for major leagues and enjoy every game without cost, while also ensuring a smooth and safe viewing experience.</p>









 Why You Should Watch Football for Free Online? 



<p>In 2025, the appeal of<a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-5-free-streaming-sites-for-movies-tv-and-more/"> watching football for free online</a> is stronger than ever. With rising subscription costs for traditional TV channels, free streaming offers a convenient and accessible alternative. It breaks down financial barriers, allowing every fan to catch live matches from top leagues and tournaments globally, right from their device. This method ensures you never miss a moment of the action, providing unparalleled flexibility and cost savings for truly passionate supporters.</p>



 Cost Savings 



<p>One of the most compelling reasons to watch football for free online is the significant cost savings it offers. In an era where cable television packages and premium sports subscriptions can run into hundreds of dollars annually, free streaming platforms eliminate this financial burden. This allows passionate fans to avoid expensive monthly fees, redirecting those savings to other priorities or simply enjoying the sport without the added economic pressure, making top-tier football accessible to everyone.</p>



 Accessibility 



<p>Beyond financial benefits, watching football online for free provides unparalleled accessibility. You are no longer confined to a living room TV; instead, you can catch every thrilling moment of a match on various devices, including your phone, laptop, or smart TV, from anywhere with an internet connection. Whether you’re commuting, traveling, or simply away from your main screen, this flexibility ensures you never miss a crucial goal or a game-changing tackle, fitting seamlessly into your modern lifestyle.</p>


 
 


 Variety 



<p>Free online football streaming truly shines in its variety of content. Unlike traditional local TV channels that often only secure broadcasting rights for a limited number of major leagues, these online platforms typically provide access to a vast array of global leagues and tournaments. This means you can follow not just the Premier League or Champions League, but also niche competitions, less-publicized domestic leagues from around the world, or even youth and women’s football, expanding your horizons as a true football connoisseur.</p>



 Flexibility 



<p>Finally, the flexibility offered by free online football streaming is a huge draw for modern fans. These platforms often provide more than just live streams; many offer options for watching highlights shortly after matches or even full replays if you miss a game. This freedom from fixed schedules and without long-term commitments allows you to consume football content on your terms, fitting it into your busy life and ensuring you can catch up on all the action at your convenience.</p>



 Criteria for Choosing the Top Websites To Watch Football For Free 



<p>With countless options promising free football streams, finding truly reliable and safe websites is crucial for an uninterrupted viewing experience. Not all free platforms are created equal; many come with frustrating issues like excessive ads, poor quality, or even security risks. To genuinely enjoy every goal and thrilling moment without compromise, it’s essential to understand the key criteria for choosing the top free football streaming websites.</p>



 Legality 



<p>When seeking to watch football for free online, prioritizing legality is paramount to avoid potential risks. The best platforms either host content with official broadcast rights or provide links to legal, publicly available streams. While entirely free, completely legal sources for major commercial leagues are rare, discerning users should look for signs of legitimacy, such as clear disclaimers, professional website design, and minimal redirects. Opting for sites that respect intellectual property helps you enjoy the game without contributing to piracy, safeguarding yourself from legal issues or malware often associated with illicit streaming.</p>



 Stream Quality 



<p>A crucial factor for an enjoyable viewing experience is stream quality. Top free football streaming websites should deliver high-definition (HD) streams as a standard, ensuring sharp visuals and clear details of the game. Equally important is minimal buffering or lag, allowing for smooth, uninterrupted viewing of fast-paced action. While achieving perfect stability can be challenging for free services, the best platforms invest in robust servers and efficient content delivery networks to provide a consistent, high-quality picture that truly captures the excitement of live football.</p>









 Safety 



<p>Safety is a non-negotiable criterion when choosing free streaming platforms. Reputable websites should be free from malware, excessive and intrusive ads, or phishing risks that could compromise your device or personal information. Be wary of sites demanding suspicious downloads, displaying an overwhelming number of pop-ups, or redirecting you to unfamiliar pages. Prioritizing platforms that demonstrate a commitment to user safety, often indicated by an “https://” URL and a clean, trustworthy interface, is essential for a worry-free football viewing experience.</p>



 User Experience 



<p>A seamless user experience significantly enhances the pleasure of watching football online. The best free streaming websites feature easy-to-navigate interfaces, allowing you to quickly find matches, browse schedules, and access streams without frustration. Mobile compatibility is also vital, ensuring a smooth experience whether you’re watching on a phone, tablet, or smart TV.</p>



 Availability 



<p>Finally, availability plays a key role in accessibility. The top free football streaming websites should either be accessible globally or provide clear information and workarounds for geo-restrictions. This ensures that fans, regardless of their geographical location, can tune into their desired matches. Websites that consistently offer live links for a wide range of international and local tournaments demonstrate superior availability, ensuring you can follow your favorite teams and leagues from anywhere in the world.</p>



 Top 10 Websites to Watch Football for Free in 2025 



<p>For passionate football fans, catching live matches without subscription fees is key. In 2025, navigating free streaming options can be tricky, with varying quality and reliability. Here are your top 10 <a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-5-free-private-browsers-that-protect-your-privacy-in-2024/">websites to watch football for free</a> in 2025.</p>



 Live Soccer TV 



<p>Live Soccer TV is a highly comprehensive and reliable platform that serves as an essential guide for football fans worldwide. While it primarily acts as a scheduling hub, it offers detailed information on where to watch matches, including links to official streams and legal broadcasters across a vast array of global leagues and tournaments. Its key advantage lies in its legality and extensive coverage, encompassing both major and niche leagues, all without requiring any user registration. The main consideration is that it mostly redirects users to other platforms rather than hosting direct streams, meaning the ultimate viewing experience depends on the linked service. To use it, simply visit livesoccertv.com to find upcoming match schedules and discover where to access the streams.</p>



 YouTube (Official Channels) 



<p>For a legitimate and high-quality viewing experience, <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube’s official channels</a> from leagues or individual teams are an excellent resource for football content. Many official entities offer free live streams for select matches, particularly youth leagues, pre-season games, or specific tournament stages, alongside a wealth of high-quality highlights, replays, and behind-the-scenes content. The main benefits include guaranteed legality and superior stream quality. However, not all matches are broadcast live, and availability can vary significantly by region due to geo-restrictions. Users can search directly for official league or team channels on YouTube, and a reliable VPN might be necessary to access geo-restricted content.</p>


 
 


 Pluto TV 



<p>Pluto TV stands out as a popular free, ad-supported streaming service that includes dedicated sports channels relevant to football enthusiasts. Channels like beIN Sports Xtra and Fox Sports (though content can vary by region) occasionally offer live football matches but are more commonly known for providing football highlights, replays, analysis, and sports-related documentaries. Its main pros include being completely free with no signup required and wide support across multiple devices. Access is straightforward: visit pluto.tv on your web browser or download its dedicated app.</p>


 
 


 Tubi 



<p>Tubi is another significant player in the free, ad-supported streaming market, offering a variety of content that includes sports channels like Fox Sports. For football fans, this means access to football highlights, replays of past games, and occasional live events, though the emphasis is more on curated sports content rather than extensive live match schedules. Tubi is a legal platform that does not require an account, making it highly accessible. It’s also very mobile-friendly, offering a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets. The main con is its limited live match availability, often focusing more on replays and football documentaries. To use Tubi, simply visit tubitv.com or download the app on your preferred device.</p>









 BBC iPlayer (UK only) 



<p>For football fans residing in the UK, or those with a reliable UK VPN, BBC iPlayer is a premier legal and free platform. It offers free live football streams for select matches, particularly those involving the UK national teams, FA Cup ties, or specific Premier League games if the BBC holds broadcasting rights. Its major advantages are high-quality, legal, and ad-free viewing for users within the United Kingdom. The significant limitation is its strict geo-restriction to the UK, and users also typically require a valid UK TV license to access its full content. To use it, access bbc.co.uk/iplayer, ensuring your IP address is registered as being within the UK, potentially via a VPN.</p>







 SportRAR 



<p>SportRAR is a well-known aggregator that compiles free streams for football and a wide array of other sports. It’s particularly popular for providing access to streams for major leagues globally. However, like many free aggregators, some links may be unreliable, leading to broken streams or constant buffering. Users should also be prepared for potential ad issues, though often manageable. To use it, visit sportrar.tv and cautiously select the football streams that appear to be most stable.</p>









 Footybite 



<p>Footybite is a platform specifically tailored for football fans, making it a go-to destination for many seeking free streams. It offers an extensive selection of free live streams and highlights for various global tournaments and leagues. A significant advantage is its dedicated focus on football, often providing multiple stream links for a single match, allowing users to choose the most stable option. However, users should exercise caution as some links may lead to unofficial sources or sites with intrusive advertising. The general usage involves accessing Footybite and checking for active streams for upcoming or live matches.</p>


 
 


 Social442 TV 



<p>Social442 TV positions itself as a football-centric community and streaming site, offering live streams, highlights, and analysis for a variety of leagues. Its strength lies in its dedicated focus on football and its community-driven aspect, which can provide a richer experience for fans. However, accessing its content typically requires account creation, which might be a barrier for some users seeking instant access. Additionally, as with many free streaming platforms, the stability of some streams may vary, especially during peak viewing times. To utilize its features, users need to sign up at social442.com for access.</p>


 
 


 Red Bull TV 



<p>Red Bull TV is a high-quality streaming platform primarily known for extreme sports, but it also offers free streams for select football events. These often include niche tournaments, youth football championships, or unique football-related documentaries sponsored by Red Bull. Its advantages include no signup requirement, consistently high-quality streams, and broad multi-device support. The main drawback for dedicated football fans is its limited football coverage, as its primary focus remains on action and extreme sports. Users can visit redbull.tv to check for any available football streams, which are typically well-produced.</p>









 Facebook Video 



<p>Facebook Video has become an unexpected platform for watching football for free, particularly for user-generated content and streams from smaller leagues or local tournaments. Both individual users and pages (including some official ones from smaller clubs or regional associations) may feature live streams for football matches. Its main pros are being completely free and highly accessible with a standard Facebook account. However, inconsistent stream quality is a significant drawback, as it relies heavily on the uploader’s connection and equipment. Official content from major leagues is also quite limited. Users can find streams by searching for “live football” or specific match names on <a href="https://facebook.com/watch">facebook.com/watch</a>.</p>









 Tips for Safe and Smooth Websites to Watch Football for Free 



<p>Here are the key tips to consider:</p>



 Use a Reliable VPN 



<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is your best friend when watching football for free online. A VPN encrypts your internet connection, hiding your IP address and making your online activity private. This is crucial for two reasons:</p>



 
 Bypassing Geo-Restrictions: Many free (and even some legal) streams are limited to specific countries. A VPN allows you to connect to a server in a different country, making it appear as if you’re browsing from there, thus unlocking geo-restricted content. 



 Enhanced Security: Free streaming sites can sometimes be malicious or riddled with trackers. A VPN adds a layer of security, protecting your data from potential threats and preventing third parties from monitoring your streaming habits. Choose reputable VPN services like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or Surfshark for optimal performance and security. 
 



 Employ an Ad Blocker 



<p>One of the most common frustrations with websites to watch football for free is the sheer volume of intrusive advertisements, including pop-ups, pop-unders, and auto-playing video ads. These not only disrupt your viewing but can also be a source of malware. Installing a robust ad blocker (like Herond Shield of Herond Browser, AdBlock Plus, or AdGuard) as a browser extension is highly recommended. This will significantly reduce the number of ads, improve page loading times, and create a much smoother, safer viewing environment. Some browsers like Herond Browser have built-in ad blockers.</p>



 Maintain a Strong Internet Connection 



<p>A fast and stable internet connection is fundamental for websites to watch football for free with minimal buffering. For HD quality, aim for a minimum download speed of 5-10 Mbps, with higher speeds (25 Mbps+) being ideal for Full HD or 4K.</p>



<p>Check Your Speed</p>



<p>Regularly run an internet speed test to ensure you’re getting the promised bandwidth from your provider.</p>



<p>Wired Connection</p>



<p>If possible, use an Ethernet cable to connect your device directly to your router. This provides a more stable and faster connection than Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>Reduce Network Congestion</p>



<p>During streaming, close unnecessary tabs, applications, and background downloads on your device and other devices connected to your network.</p>









 Keep Your Software Updated 



<p>Ensure your operating system, web browser, and any streaming apps are always up-to-date. Software updates often include security patches and performance improvements that can prevent vulnerabilities and enhance streaming quality. Outdated software can be a gateway for malware and lead to compatibility issues that cause buffering or crashes.</p>



 Be Wary of Suspicious Links and Downloads 



<p>Free streaming sites, especially aggregators, can sometimes redirect you to unknown or malicious pages.</p>



<p>Look for HTTPS</p>



<p>Always check that the website’s URL begins with “https://” (indicating a secure connection) rather than just “http://”.</p>



<p>Avoid Unknown Downloads</p>



<p>Never download any software, plugins, or executables prompted by a streaming site unless you are sure of its legitimacy. These are common vectors for malware.</p>



<p>Close Pop-ups Safely</p>



<p>If a pop-up appears, try to close it using the small “x” button on the pop-up itself, rather than clicking anywhere else on the screen, which could activate a malicious link.</p>



 Consider Browser Choice 



<p>Some browsers are inherently more privacy-focused or offer better performance. <a href="https://blog.herond.org/what-is-herond-browser/">Herond Browser</a>, for instance, has a built-in ad blocker and prioritizes privacy.

<p>Ethereum’s switch to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system has totally changed how people can get involved in keeping the network secure and running smoothly. By staking your ETH, you’re not just helping secure the Ethereum blockchain – you’re also earning passive income! With more platforms supporting Ethereum Proof of Stake than ever before, it’s easier for investors to stake their ETH safely and effectively. In this blog, we’ll dive into the top five platforms that make Ethereum Proof of Stake simple, rewarding, and beginner-friendly.</p>



 What is Ethereum Staking? 



<p>Ethereum staking is a way to earn rewards by helping keep the Ethereum network secure. It involves locking up your ETH to support transaction validation and network security. In return, participants, called validators, earn rewards for their role in maintaining the blockchain.</p>



<p>This system started after Ethereum upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model during the Ethereum Merge. Instead of using energy-heavy mining, the network now selects validators to confirm transactions based on how much ETH they have staked. This shift makes the network more energy-efficient and secure. However, validators must act responsibly—any dishonest behavior can result in penalties or loss of funds.</p>









<p>For everyday users, staking offers a way to earn passive income without needing to trade actively. By staking ETH through trusted platforms, users can contribute to the network and grow their holdings over time. However, it’s important to choose a secure staking method to protect your investment.</p>



 How Does Ethereum Staking Work? 



<p>Ethereum staking allows you to earn rewards by locking up your ETH to support the network’s security and operations. To become a validator, you need to stake at least 32 ETH, which enables you to propose and confirm new transaction blocks. This role comes with rewards but also carries risks; dishonest actions can lead to penalties, including slashing, where a portion of your staked ETH is forfeited.</p>



<p>If you don’t have 32 ETH or prefer not to manage a validator node, staking pools offer an accessible alternative. These platforms allow you to stake smaller amounts by pooling your ETH with others. The platform manages the technical aspects, and you earn rewards proportional to your contribution, minus any service fees.</p>







<p>Staking rewards can vary based on network activity and the total amount of ETH staked. On average, annual returns range from 4% to 7%. By staking your ETH, you’re not only earning passive income but also contributing to the security and scalability of the Ethereum network.</p>



 Top 5 Platforms Supporting Ethereum Proof of Stake

<p>Every time you open a web browser, you’re inviting a whole host of third parties—advertisers, websites, ISPs, and even government agencies – to track your every move. But what if you didn’t have to accept that as the status quo? What if there were browsers specifically designed to protect your data and safeguard your privacy while still delivering fast, reliable performance? In this guide, we’ll explore the top browsers that offer an unmatched balance of speed and security, helping you take back control of your online experience.</p>



 5 Elements of a Secure Browser You Should Look For 



<p>Before we dive into the best browsers, let’s take a moment to understand the key features that make a browser truly secure. Here’s what you should be looking for when making a decision about which browser to use:</p>



 
 Encryption: A secure browser ensures that your connection is encrypted, which means that even if hackers try to intercept your data, they won’t be able to read it. Without encryption, you’re leaving your data wide open for theft. 



 Privacy Features: The best browsers go beyond simply offering incognito modes. They actively block third-party trackers and cookies, preventing advertisers from following your every click. Privacy-first browsers also minimize the data they collect, ensuring your browsing history remains private. 
 









 
 Frequent Updates: Security is an ongoing battle. That’s why a good browser will update frequently to patch vulnerabilities and keep hackers at bay. Frequent updates ensure that the latest threats don’t compromise your browsing experience. 



 Sandboxing: A powerful security feature that isolates web pages from one another, preventing malicious websites from compromising the rest of your system. In simple terms, it keeps potential threats confined, so they can’t reach your personal files or sensitive data. 



 Anti-Phishing &amp; Malware Protection: The best browsers automatically block phishing attempts and harmful websites. This feature adds an additional layer of protection by preventing you from accidentally visiting sites that could steal your personal information or infect your device with malware. 
 



<p>With these elements in mind, let’s explore the browsers that stand out in terms of speed, security, and functionality.</p>



 Top 10 Fast, Secure, and Best Web Browsers to Use 



<p>If you’re still relying on the default browser that came with your device, it might be time for an upgrade. Here’s a list of the top browsers that provide the perfect mix of speed, privacy, and security:</p>



 Herond Browser 



<p>Herond Browser sets itself apart in the crowded world of web browsers. It’s not just fast—it’s built for the future, offering top-tier security, blazing performance, and Web 3.0 integration, all in one package.</p>



 Unmatched Privacy and Security 



<p>At its core, Herond prioritizes privacy. With the Herond Shield, it blocks ads, trackers, and harmful websites. SSL certificates secure your connection, while Tor integration (coming soon) will add even more layers of protection. Plus, the Advanced Security Alert System (ASAS) keeps you one step ahead of online threats, making it a truly secure option for privacy-conscious users.</p>







 Seamless Web 3.0 Integration 



<p>Herond is ahead of the curve in the Web 3.0 revolution. It seamlessly integrates with Herond Wallet for decentralized digital asset management, giving users the tools to explore blockchain technology directly from the browser. It’s an experience designed for the decentralized web, putting users in full control of their data and assets.</p>



 Blazing Fast Performance 



<p>Speed is another standout feature. Herond loads pages up to three times faster than most browsers, ensuring that your browsing experience remains smooth and efficient. Whether you’re multitasking or streaming, Herond handles it all without slowing down.</p>



 User-Centric Design and Ecosystem 



<p>Herond’s design is all about customization. With a user-friendly interface and flexible settings, you can personalize your browsing experience. And with tools like Herond ID for decentralized identity management, Herond offers an integrated ecosystem that goes beyond just being a browser.</p>



<p>Looking for a fast and secure browser? Learn <a href="https://herond.org/browser">how to download Herond Browser on a computer </a>and enjoy top-tier privacy and Web 3.0 features. Plus, Herond is already available on both the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herond.android.browser&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">CH Play</a> and<a href="https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/herond-browser/id6462850011"> App Store </a>for your mobile device, offering a seamless and convenient browsing experience wherever you are.</p>



 Google Chrome 



<p>Google Chrome remains one of the most popular browsers, and for good reason. It’s fast, efficient, and well-integrated with Google’s ecosystem. Chrome frequently updates its security features and provides a seamless user experience. However, while Chrome does have robust security protocols, it is notorious for collecting data for advertising purposes. If privacy is a top priority for you, Chrome can be configured for enhanced privacy, but there are more privacy-conscious options available.</p>









 Mozilla Firefox 



<p>Mozilla Firefox stands as one of the best open-source browsers with a strong commitment to privacy. It offers an excellent speed-to-security ratio, with advanced privacy features like anti-tracking and phishing protection. Firefox also lets users customize their privacy settings, allowing you to decide what data gets collected. Plus, Firefox’s community-driven, open-source nature means that it’s constantly being updated and reviewed for security vulnerabilities.</p>







 Brave Browser 



<p>Brave takes privacy and security to the next level. This browser blocks ads and trackers by default, which not only protects your data but also boosts browsing speed. Brave’s integrated HTTPS upgrade ensures that you’re always browsing securely. Additionally, Brave’s innovative reward system allows users to earn cryptocurrency by viewing privacy-respecting ads—an excellent bonus for those looking to balance privacy and functionality.</p>









 Microsoft Edge 



<p>Microsoft Edge has come a long way since its earlier versions. Built on the same open-source Chromium engine that powers Chrome, Edge has improved in terms of speed and security. It includes features like built-in phishing and malware protection, as well as a secure password manager. Edge also boasts privacy tools like tracking prevention and a dedicated InPrivate mode. While not as privacy-focused as some others, Edge offers a well-rounded browsing experience with strong security features.</p>


 
 


 Safari 



<p>Safari has been the go-to browser for Apple users for years. It delivers excellent performance on macOS and iOS devices, especially when it comes to speed. Safari also offers strong privacy protection, with features like Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which helps block advertisers from following your every move online. It’s an ideal choice for those within the Apple ecosystem who want solid security without sacrificing performance.</p>


 
 


 Opera Browser 



<p>Opera is often overlooked but packs a punch with its robust security features. Built-in tools like a free VPN, ad blocker, and fraud protection make Opera a secure choice. The browser also boasts excellent speed performance, even with all these features running. Opera is an especially great choice for users who want a browser that provides a variety of privacy and security tools in one package, without needing extra extensions.</p>









 Tor Browser 



<p>When privacy is the top priority, Tor is the go-to choice for many. Tor’s ability to encrypt internet traffic and route it through multiple nodes makes it the best tool for users who need ultimate anonymity. Tor prevents tracking, stops unwanted surveillance, and shields your identity by masking your IP address. However, the trade-off for this high level of privacy is speed—Tor is slower than most browsers due to its complex encryption process. But for those who prioritize anonymity over speed, it’s the best choice.</p>




 <a href="https://blog.herond.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/121-2.png"></a> 




 Vivaldi 



<p>Vivaldi is a highly customizable browser that offers excellent speed and security. It comes with a built-in ad blocker, custom search engines, and advanced privacy features, giving you control over what data gets collected. Vivaldi allows you to configure almost every aspect of your browsing experience, from the interface to security settings, making it a great option for users who like to tweak things to their exact specifications.</p>







 Epic Browser 



<p>Epic Browser is designed with privacy in mind. It blocks all tracking cookies, advertisements, and even automatically forces secure HTTPS connections. Epic is known for its simple, no-frills interface and its commitment to keeping your data private. By default, Epic doesn’t store your browsing history or any personal data, and it doesn’t allow for any syncing, which is perfect for users who prioritize privacy above all else.</p>









 Conclusion 



<p>Choosing the right browser is more than just about convenience—it’s about security, speed, and privacy. The browsers we’ve discussed offer various features that cater to different user needs, whether you’re looking for an anonymous browsing experience, a super-fast option, or an all-around secure browser.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the best browser for you depends on your priorities. If privacy and security are your top concerns, browsers like Brave, Firefox, and Tor should be at the top of your list. If you’re after speed and integration with other services, Chrome and Edge will suit you well. And if you want the perfect balance between speed, privacy, and security, consider trying Herond or Vivaldi. Whichever you choose, remember that it’s time to take control of your online experience and make sure your browsing is as fast and secure as possible.</p>

<p>Failure to comply may result in criminal offenses and the inability to serve as a director.<a href="https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2025/04/companies-house-incoming-identity-verification-requirements?utm_source=chatgpt.com">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-World Implications: A Compliance Officer’s Perspective 
<p>Consider James, a compliance officer at a reputable UK corporate services firm. James is tasked with onboarding a new client, a multinational corporation with a complex ownership structure. Navigating the intricate web of subsidiaries and stakeholders, James must ensure that all directors and PSCs are properly verified to meet the upcoming regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Utilizing iComply’s advanced identity verification solutions, James efficiently:</p>
 
 Automates the collection of necessary identification documents 
 Conducts thorough checks against global watchlists and sanctions 
 Generates audit-ready reports to demonstrate compliance 
 
<p>This streamlined process not only saves time but also provides peace of mind, knowing that the firm adheres to the highest standards of regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Concerns Surrounding GOV.UK One Login 
<p>While GOV.UK’s One Login system offers a digital route for identity verification, recent developments have raised concerns:</p>
 
 Loss of Certification: In May 2025, One Login lost its certification under the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) due to its biometric authentication provider, iProov, failing to renew compliance. 
 Security Vulnerabilities: The system has been reported to comply with barely half – only 21 – of the 39 outcomes detailed in the National Cyber Security Centre’s Cyber Assessment Framework, indicating significant shortcomings in information security. 
 Privacy Concerns: The centralized nature of One Login raises potential privacy issues, with critics highlighting the risks of “ID phone home” scenarios where user interactions could be tracked, monitored, or controlled remotely. 
 
<p>These issues underscore the importance of choosing a reliable and secure identity verification solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 iComply: Exceeding Standards in Identity Verification 
<p>iComply offers a comprehensive identity verification solution that not only meets but surpasses the UK’s new regulatory requirements:</p>
 
 Advanced Verification Techniques: Employing document authentication, hybrid (active and passive) liveness detection, and concurrent biometric verification within a secure video session. 
 Privacy-First Approach: Prioritizing user privacy through decentralized verification methods, reducing the risk of data breaches associated with centralized systems. 
 Continuous Compliance Monitoring: Staying ahead of regulatory changes to ensure ongoing compliance and security. 
 User Empowerment: Providing users with control over their personal data, fostering trust and confidence in the verification process. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enhancing Corporate Transparency 
<p>The implementation of stringent identity verification requirements aims to:</p>
 
 Prevent Fraudulent Activities: By ensuring that only verified individuals can hold key positions within companies. 
 Improve Data Accuracy: Enhancing the reliability of information within the Companies House register. 
 Strengthen Public Trust: Demonstrating a commitment to transparency and accountability in the corporate sector. 
 
<p>iComply’s KYB and KYC solutions align with these objectives, offering tools that support businesses in maintaining integrity and public confidence.</p>
<p>As the UK moves towards stricter identity verification mandates, businesses must adapt to ensure compliance and protect their reputations. iComply stands as a trusted partner in this transition, offering advanced, privacy-focused solutions that meet and exceed regulatory standards.</p>

				 <p>[Amsterdam] <a href="https://www.money2020.com/">Money 20/20</a> — “The world’s leading, premium content, sales and networking platform for the global money ecosystem” — has <a href="https://europe.money2020.com/media/newroom/pr-2025-04-06-25-startup-media-session">selected Indicio</a> as one of eight startups “transforming the world of money.”</p>
<p>The announcement was made today during the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>“This is tremendous recognition for Indicio and our technology’s capacity to turn verifiable identity into the ubiquitous payment method of the future,” said Heather Dahl, CEO. “The banking and financial sector has started to realize the power of Verifiable Credentials to create industry-spanning solutions that cover everything from seamless account access to digital assets, privacy-preserving biometric authentication, and identity for agentic AI. All these have tremendous value to business and customers alike. But the payoff is even bigger when you start to see how decentralized identity can be a secure payment rail for instant, independent, peer-to-peer transactions — digital infrastructure you can create with your phone.”</p>
<p>To underscore how rapidly this future is coming, Indicio just announced <a href="https://indicio.tech/artificial-intelligence/">Indicio ProvenAI</a>. ProvenAI is a simple way to implement verifiable identity for AI agents and their customers, so each can authenticate the other before the customer gives consent to access data. It is the latest addition to Indicio Proven, the company’s platform for interoperable decentralized identity solutions and the latest product in its suite of financial service applications.</p>
<p>“Simply put, the vast potential of agentic AI in banking and finance is constrained by the problems our technology solves,” said Dahl. “With Verifiable Credentials, we are able to give AI agents verifiable identities, we enable secure communication between agent and customer that can be initiated by the agent, and we provide a simple way for the customer to give consent to the AI requesting access to their data.”</p>
<p>Indicio’s identity solution for AI follows on its ground-breaking solution to the problem of AI-generated identity fraud.</p>
<p>“With the emergence of deepfakes, we saw an opportunity to translate our travel solution — the world’s first digital passport credential based on standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization — into a financial one,” said Dahl. “At&nbsp; the core of this is ‘government-grade digital identity’ using authenticated biometrics.”</p>
<p>Indicio’s ability to combine authenticated biometrics with Verifiable Credentials means that a remote liveness check or biometric scan can be instantly crosschecked against an authenticated, tamper-proof copy of a person’s biometrics that the person holds on their phone. When added to a KYC credential, financial institutions have an enormously powerful, reusable&nbsp; authentication solution at a fraction of the cost of conventional identity verification.</p>
<p>“The beauty of it is that the biometric data stays with the person — there’s no need for enterprises&nbsp; to store people’s biometric data to verify it,” said Dahl. “This is a breakthrough for consumers —&nbsp;and a gateway to better account login and security. We know from the travel sector that many people are willing to use and trust&nbsp; biometrics if they can be sure their data is protected. With Indicio, people have custody and control of their most valuable data and can share it in a way that’s instantly verifiable.”</p>
<p>Indicio has been leading the decentralized identity sector with these kinds of innovations, but it has also recently entered the European digital wallet market with another tech first: a simple way to combine credentials built to Europe’s digital identity specifications with credentials from outside Europe that have been built to different global standards.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make every kind of credential format —&nbsp;digital travel credentials, EU credentials, mobile driver’s licenses —&nbsp;all work with each other and be easily combined in seamless workflows, including in the world of money,” said Dahl. “We successfully showed that this was possible earlier in the year in an international travel trial with Aruba, Delta Air Lines, and SITA.</p>
<p>“This seamless interoperability creates a single customer journey, bridging companies, industries, and sectors to meet a consumer’s needs. Interoperability is the key to a single digital market in a micro as well as macro sense.</p>
<p>“We call it decentralized identity,” said Dahl, “but it’s really a way to connect anywhere to everywhere in a trusted, privacy-preserving way. It’s a foundation for seamless interaction, payments, agentic AI and a new kind of internet.”</p>
<p>In line with the company’s commitment to be the leader in global interoperability, Indicio is currently incorporating the Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) into its Proven platform. The company will also be developing the technology for government-issued digital passport credentials based on the ICAO DTC 2 specification with its global partner SITA in the EU Aptitude Trial.</p>

 Streamlining Security: HYPR and HID Merge Physical and Digital Access  The notion of “access” no longer coincides with a single connotation. Within a sprawling landscape of digital identities and physical spaces, modern enterprises are confronted with the daunting task of securing each of these spaces from all possible angles. The struggle to secure virtual and physical access incurs productivity setbacks and security vulnerabilities. The introduction of the virtual world was supposed to provide convenience and efficiency, but the resulting balance between digital and physical access has left organizations scrambling to address each separately.
<br>
<br>But what if there was a way to streamline access, fortify security, and empower employees all at once?
<br> 
 A Unified Solution for Every Use Case  
<p>HYPR and HID have partnered to deliver one converged access solution with hardware- and software-based passkeys in a single platform. Whether your workforce needs smart cards for regulated environments, mobile-device credentials for remote workers, or both, this solution flexes to your policies and compliance requirements:</p>  
  
   
    
    Hardware-Based Passkeys: Ideal for high-security sites and regulated industries (finance, manufacturing, healthcare).  
    Software-Based Passkeys: Perfect for contractors, hybrid staff, and deskless workers.  
    Mixed Workforces: Assign each user the credential type that matches their role; no system overhaul required.  
      
  
<p>By registering and verifying identities at enrollment, HYPR’s identity verification establishes a chain of trust from day one. HID’s smart cards then become both your physical badge and your FIDO credential, unlocking doors and business applications with a single tap.</p> 
 A Leader in Trusted Identity Solutions  
<p>HID is a global leader in Identity and Access Management, specializing in the issuance, authentication, and management of digital identities for millions of users. As an active member of the FIDO Alliance, HID strongly advocates for passwordless authentication. We recognize that the transition from traditional password-based authentication to passkeys varies for each organization. Therefore, we have partnered with strategic vendors such as Microsoft and HYPR to deliver solutions that meet businesses wherever they are in their passwordless journey. Whether leveraging the power of physical access cards, the <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/product-mix/crescendo">Crescendo portfolio</a>, or our software solutions, our mission is to become the trusted leader in delivering confidence to navigate within a digital world.</p> 
 Key Benefits of the HYPR | HID Integration  
  
  Stronger Security&nbsp;<br>Deploy phishing-resistant, device-bound passkeys, with no password fallbacks, across every environment. Only verified users gain access to sensitive systems or secure areas.  
  Flexible Deployment&nbsp;<br>Support hardware and software passkeys from the same console.  
  Simplified Administration<br>Manage <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/products/crescendo">Crescendo Cards</a> and HYPR credentials through one pane of glass. Reduce provisioning steps, lower maintenance costs, and accelerate onboarding.<br>  
  Faster Onboarding<br>Enable self-service enrollment – no pre-issued certificates or IT hand-holding required. New hires, contractors, and partners get up and running in minutes.  
  Increased Productivity<br>One credential for doors, desktops, and apps means fewer helpdesk tickets and smoother user experiences. Employees focus on work, not passwords.  
  Compliance Ready<br>Built on FIDO-certified technology, the solution supports zero trust initiatives and audit requirements across industries.  
  
 Frictionless User Experience for Enterprise Access  
<p>No employee walks into their building, sits down at their desk, opens their computer, and starts working. The users at your organization use ID badges to gain entry to the office. They then use a number of authentication methods to access their workstations and applications. HID and HYPR’s solution acknowledges these existing methods and improves the speed and efficiency of your infrastructure rather than changing it or overcomplicating it.&nbsp;</p> 
 Single Credential for Physical and Digital Access  
<p>To provide a unified physical and digital access experience, the HYPR and HID integration leverages the power of the Crescendo Cards, which support PIV and are FIDO-certified. Acting as a single, secure credential, they allow users to unlock office doors and log in to workstations. Notably, the Crescendo tools streamline the management, provisioning, and recovery of these cards, relieving administrative burden. Users can self-enroll their Crescendo Cards for both domains of access, eliminating complex onboarding processes. If a card is lost or stolen, organizations are assured of quick and secure recovery.</p> 
 Simplifying Security in the Face of Modern Threats  
<p>By converging physical and digital access, HYPR and HID eliminate the silos and manual gaps that adversaries exploit. Users self-enroll, IT manages everything centrally, and security teams gain continuous assurance that only verified humans enter your systems and spaces.</p> 
<p>Learn more about how the HYPR | HID integration can address your most demanding access use cases while reducing risk, accelerating onboarding, and maximizing your existing investments.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Reality, which has definitely included sharing passwords, has always been messier.</p>



<p>From caregivers managing health portals, to coworkers submitting expense reports on behalf of others, to kids navigating school systems with help from their parents, the need for delegation is everywhere. But digital identity systems still mostly assume a clean one-to-one world. And when real life demands “acting for someone else,” we’re left cobbling together workarounds such as password sharing, manual overrides, and endless customer support calls.</p>



<p>Now, with the rise of agentic AI, where digital agents can take actions independently, the challenge of delegation has found new urgency. If humans already can’t delegate to other people cleanly in digital systems, what happens when software needs to do it?</p>



<p>Delegation isn’t new. But it’s getting urgent.</p>



<p>You may also be interested in some of my earlier posts, “<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/02/11/agentic-ai-and-authentication/">Agentic AI and Authentication: Exploring Some Unanswered Questions</a>” and “<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/02/25/ai-and-ciam/">What AI Agents Can Teach Us About Fraud in Consumer Identity</a>.”</p>



 Delegation: Beyond Permission Tokens and Role Switching 



<p>Delegation sounds simple: authorize one party to act on behalf of another. I wish it were that simple! Alas, today, “delegation” often gets boiled down to clumsy versions of permission tokens or role-switching.</p>



<p>Let’s take a real-world example. I’m paraphrasing from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gffletch/">George Fletcher</a>‘s LinkedIn article on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/delegated-authentication-george-fletcher-9rqke/?trackingId=cr6QEITMSbaF3uTdL%2Bz2xQ%3D%3D">Delegated Authorization</a> (are you following George? You need to be following George).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Alice managed medical and supplement accounts for herself and her spouse Bob. After Alice’s death, Bob needed access to those accounts to make changes. But because most systems didn’t support delegation, the only option was for Bob to impersonate Alice, using her password, risking terms-of-service violations and creating an audit mess.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is hardly rare. Across industries, you see:</p>



 
 Healthcare: Caregivers trying to manage appointments and prescriptions without “breaking” patient portals. 



 Workplaces: Expense approvals getting “proxy-approved” by executive assistants without clear delegation records. 



 Education: Parents struggling to fill out school forms because online systems assume the student is the sole user. 



 Customer Service: Agents needing to fix a customer’s problem but lacking any secure way to act on the customer’s behalf. 
 



<p>In these cases, systems often lean on role-switching (“pretend to be someone else”) or manual overrides (“fax us a form”). Neither solution is scalable, auditable, or user-friendly.</p>



 Why Agentic AI Turns the Pressure Up 



<p>If delegation was already broken for humans, AI makes the problem even harder. (The irony here, given AI is supposed to make everything easier, does not escape me.)</p>



<p>Picture an AI financial assistant you authorize to move money between your accounts. That AI is acting on your behalf, but today’s systems aren’t designed to distinguish “the customer” from “the customer’s agent.” There’s no standard way to represent delegated credentials. No clear audit trail showing who (or what) took which action.</p>



<p>Without robust delegation models, AI agents risk being blocked from useful actions or allowed to act too broadly without sufficient consent or guardrails.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a futuristic thought experiment. Real discussions (like those at The Identity Salon) have flagged problems ranging from AI in banking to AI-powered scheduling assistants accessing your work calendar.</p>



 Delegation Models (and Why They’re Still Not Enough) 



<p>We’ve tried to tackle delegation before. Some of the main models include:</p>



 
 OAuth “Alice-to-Alice” Sharing: Useful for limited access (like “this app can see your calendar”), where you grant a service permission to act on your behalf. But even though another app is doing the work, the system still treats it as if you personally took the action, which isn’t the kind of clear, separate delegation we often need. 



 <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html">User-Managed Access (UMA)</a>: A step forward in enabling a touch more complexity, UMA (a spec out of the Kantara Initiative) allows Bob to act for Alice with his own identity. Unfortunately, adoption of UMA has been slow. 



 On-Behalf-Of Models in “OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange” (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693">RFC 8693</a>): Helpful for service-to-service delegation, but lacking lifecycle management and human-centric constraints. 



 Persona Chaining: Several efforts have proposed ways to create sub-identities for delegation, but they tend to introduce ambiguity over time and often fail to take hold in real-world systems. Why? Because chaining authority adds complexity: it’s harder to define clear boundaries, enforce policy constraints, and ensure reliable audit trails as the chain grows. Without strong governance, persona chains risk becoming security liabilities instead of flexible solutions. 
 



<p>Each model solves part of the puzzle. None solves it completely. Especially once you factor in:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints (“only for this task,” “only until next Tuesday”). 



 Transitivity (“Bob can act for Alice—but can’t pass that authority to Carol”). 



 Auditability (“who did what, when, and why”). 



 Lifecycle management (“delegation expires automatically when conditions change”). 
 



 Real-World Enterprise Reflections 



<p>Healthcare and personal AI agents are one thing, but don’t think the enterprise gets to avoid this pain.</p>



<p>In HR systems, managers often need to submit forms on behalf of employees. Without built-in delegation, companies end up granting broad admin rights, creating security risks and compliance headaches. (There’s a reason digital identity is one of the most successful attack vectors there is today.)</p>



<p>In expense systems, executive assistants often “act for” executives, but technically submit expenses “as” the executive. Good luck untangling that when auditors come knocking. Or not. You deserve at least a slap on the wrist if that’s what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Even in research settings, project leads sometimes need to act on behalf of students or postdocs to access grant portals or finalize submissions, but systems rarely support clear, limited delegation.</p>



 Delegation Isn’t Optional Anymore 



<p>As George Fletcher put it, we need ways for one party to prove:</p>



 
 They have the right to act on someone else’s behalf. 



 They are the specific person (or agent) authorized. 



 Their actions are constrained by clear, enforceable policies. 
 



<p>Without this, delegation remains a patchwork of risky workarounds.</p>



<p>And with AI agents entering the mix, “I’ll just share my password” is no longer an acceptable fallback.</p>



<p>If we want a digital world that reflects real human (and increasingly agentic) relationships, delegation needs to be a first-class feature, not an afterthought. But it’s not going to be easy. Whatever new specifications technologists come up with will have to contend with legacy systems that have no idea how to implement those specifications (I wrote about the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/03/11/standards-versus-reality/">long-tail of implementation</a> not too long ago). The technical debt here is crazypants.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00]<br>Welcome to A Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Delegation Sounds Simple — Until It Isn’t 



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Today, we’re diving into a problem that’s bigger than it sounds: delegation.</p>



<p>If that word makes your eyes glaze over, hang on. Because without solving the delegation problem, everything from caregiving to AI agents managing your bank accounts is held together with virtual duct tape and hope.</p>



 



 What Is Delegation, Really? 



<p>[00:01:03]<br>Digital systems were built on a simple model: one user, one identity, one device, one intent. Clean. Predictable.</p>



<p>But real life doesn’t work like that.</p>



<p>[00:01:17]<br>Delegation happens all the time. You hand your kid your phone to check in at the orthodontist. A coworker approves an invoice while you’re in the air. Your partner logs into the utility company’s website to pay a bill.</p>



<p>Delegation is normal behavior. It’s how families, companies, and governments function. Ever heard of a power of attorney? Same idea, different paperwork.</p>



<p>[00:01:48]<br>But our systems still assume we all live alone on little digital islands. One user, one device. No help allowed.</p>



 



 How People Actually Delegate 



<p>[00:02:00]<br>When you try to act for someone else, you usually end up doing one of three things:</p>



 
 Share a password (bad, and you know it) 



 Fill out a 1990s-style form 



 Spend an afternoon lost in customer support limbo 
 



<p>[00:02:24]<br>Delegation isn’t a corner case. It’s everyday life. And as AI agents enter the mix, the cracks in our one-user model become more obvious—and more dangerous.</p>



 



 Real Life Example: Bob and Alice 



<p>[00:02:41]<br>Let’s talk about a real-world example, using Bob and Alice. Because in Identity Land, everyone is Bob and Alice.</p>



<p>[00:02:49]<br>Alice manages all the medical and supplement accounts for her household. When she dies, Bob needs to access those accounts to cancel services, update info, settle things.</p>



<p>[00:02:59]<br>But that’s not easy. Most sites don’t support real delegation. Bob’s options:</p>



 
 Steal or guess Alice’s password (which is illegal) 



 Fax around a death certificate like it’s 1997 
 



<p>[00:03:24]<br>Even if he gets in, the system doesn’t know Bob is acting with Alice’s consent.</p>



<p>[00:03:35]<br>This isn’t an extreme case. Parents managing care for kids, adult children helping with banking, executive assistants scheduling meetings—it’s all delegation.</p>



<p>We designed our systems as if these use cases don’t exist.</p>



 



 And Then Came AI Agents 



<p>[00:03:59]<br>Let’s make it even messier by adding AI.</p>



<p>[00:04:05]<br>Imagine you have an AI assistant that can act on your behalf: book flights, order groceries, pay bills, move money. Maybe it even negotiates your internet bill.</p>



<p>You’ve told it what it can do—and it works. Until it doesn’t.</p>



<p>[00:04:24]<br>When the AI tries to update your address or cancel a subscription, the system says: Who are you, and why should I trust you?</p>



<p>[00:04:56]<br>Right now, there’s no standard credential that says, “I’m an authorized agent.” No way to prove the agent isn’t just stealing your identity.</p>



<p>So you either get blocked at every step, or you let the AI act freely—with no oversight, audit trail, or way to revoke access.</p>



<p>[00:05:22]<br>Either scenario is a nightmare.</p>



<p>[00:05:24]<br>This isn’t theoretical. Visa and Mastercard are already testing AI agents that act on your behalf. People are plugging them into banking tools, medical apps, productivity workflows.</p>



<p>But the tools weren’t built for real delegation.</p>



 



 Existing Models Aren’t Enough 



<p>[00:06:04]<br>There have been attempts to fix this:</p>



 
 OAuth 2.0 — Lets Alice share access, but it still looks like Alice did everything 



 User Managed Access (UMA) — Great concept where Bob acts for Alice as Bob, with permission. But not widely adopted 



 OAuth Token Exchange — Works well for backend services, but not for actual humans 



 Persona Chaining — Create sub-identities, then lose track of them 
 



<p>[00:07:00]<br>Each solves part of the problem, but none cover the full picture—especially when you need context, limits, expiration, and audit trails.</p>



 



 Delegation in the Enterprise? Worse. 



<p>[00:07:25]<br>You’d think enterprises would have this figured out. Nope.</p>



<p>[00:07:30]<br>HR managers need to do things on behalf of employees. But instead of targeted delegation (like submitting vacation requests but not seeing salary), they get full admin rights.</p>



<p>[00:07:40]<br>Executive assistants submit expenses for executives all the time. That’s fine—until an audit shows $6,000 in upgrades and spa charges, and the system logs show the executive clicked “submit.”</p>



<p>Maybe they did. Maybe they didn’t.</p>



<p>[00:08:12]<br>Yes, this really happens. Especially in older ERP or expense systems, or in underfunded orgs without fine-grained access controls.</p>



<p>[00:08:49]<br>Even well-funded companies often rely on temporary access, shared accounts, and informal workflows that make real audit trails impossible.</p>



<p>[00:09:12]<br>Unless the system supports delegated authority as a first-class feature, it always looks like the executive made the request. Not the assistant.</p>



 



 Broken Delegation = Risk and Waste 



<p>[00:09:31]<br>Every time delegation is handled poorly, it:</p>



 
 Slows down work 



 Increases friction 



 Creates security risks 



 Forces people into workarounds 
 



<p>[00:09:48]<br>Delegation isn’t an edge case. It’s just life. And ignoring it breaks everything.</p>



 



 What Needs to Change 



<p>[00:10:02]<br>We need ways for people and agents to prove:</p>



 
 They have the right to act for someone else 



 They are who they say they are 



 Their actions are constrained, auditable, and revocable 
 



<p>[00:10:28]<br>Without that, delegation stays chaotic—and automation doesn’t work.</p>



<p>[00:10:39]<br>Fixing this isn’t easy. It means:</p>



 
 Updating protocols like OAuth and UMA 



 Building support for verifiable credentials 



 Creating governance models that aren’t just “hope and vibes” 
 



<p>[00:10:53]<br>And then there’s the technical debt—so large it might have its own zip code. Updating protocols doesn’t magically update software. Apps have to evolve too.</p>



<p>[00:11:17]<br>If we want digital systems that reflect real life, delegation has to be a first-class feature.</p>



 



 What’s Next 



<p>[00:11:25]<br>In Part Two, I’ll dig deeper into where today’s models fall short—and what it’ll take to build delegation that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs was among the world’s leading experts on the future of digital identities and cybersecurity at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2025">2025 European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> in Germany in May.</p>



<p>Anonyome’s CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dr Paul Ashley</a> presented on implementing hardware security modules in digital identity wallets, and Chief Architect <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown/">Steve McCown</a> discussed fighting AI deepfakes with <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/balancing-online-trustworthiness-and-anonymity-with-personhood-credentials/">personhood credentials</a>.</p>



<p>The four-day EIC 2025 saw 300 experts share solutions to the complex challenges of human-centric digital identity in the face of accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, and other developments in cutting-edge identity and cloud technologies.</p>



 Implementing hardware security modules in digital identity wallets 



<p>Dr Ashley explained how digital identity wallets can be enhanced through HSM integration to fulfill the requirements of the EU Digital Identity Wallet framework and analyzed each credential standard’s compatibility with various HSMs’ cryptographic capabilities. He focused on examining the secure enclave capabilities on iOS and Android phones and Yubikey 5C NFC devices to support different verifiable credential presentation proof signature profiles and strong holder binding. Dr Ashley explained:</p>



 
 The secure enclaves on iOS and Android phones offer limited cryptographic flexibility for supporting various verifiable credential proof signature profiles, restricting the types of credentials and signing algorithms that can be utilized.<br> 



 Approximately 50% of current Android phones lack secure enclaves, limiting accessibility to this functionality for a significant portion of the population.<br> 



 Yubikey 5C NFC provides greater cryptographic flexibility and the added benefit of compatibility across the user’s wallet devices.<br> 



 None of the mentioned options are currently certified for EUDI Wallet use.<br> 



 Exploring the potential of remote HSMs like those from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ubiqu/">ubiqu</a> as a solution to the identified limitations presents an intriguing avenue for future consideration.

<p>Steve McCown made two appearances at EIC 2025: he presented a “101” on <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/balancing-online-trustworthiness-and-anonymity-with-personhood-credentials/">personhood credentials</a> (PHCs) and was part of an expert panel examining real-world implementations, emerging standards, and practical challenges in digital identity.</p>



 Benefits and challenges of personhood credentials 



<p>In his “101” Steve looked at the evolution of the “personhood” concept as a way of proving a user is a real human and not a bot in an AI world. He identified some of the significant benefits of PHCs, such as reducing impact of sockpuppeting, mitigating bot attacks, and verifying a person’s delegation to AI agent, but also warned of potential challenges, including:</p>



 
 Equitable access: can PHCs affect access to digital services?<br> 



 Free expression: will people feel safe using PHCs?<br> 



 Checks on power: how will PHCs affect tech providers?<br> 



 Robustness of attack and error: how might PHCs be vulnerable to errors or subversive compromise? 
 



<p></p>



<p>Steve’s talk underscored the idea that the web faces a critical inflection point: as AI-generated content proliferates and platforms demand increasingly invasive identity verification, we risk creating a digital environment where every interaction requires credentials—essentially a “papers, please” culture for the internet. Privacy-preserving approaches to personhood verification can help prevent this dystopian outcome while still enabling necessary trust.</p>

<p>The expert panel explored how technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure can preserve individual privacy while meeting legitimate verification requirements. The discussion addressed pressing questions around maintaining an open web, preventing privacy violations, and safeguarding human agency in increasingly digital environments.</p>



<p>Steve was joined on the panel by Ankur Banerjee, Co-chair of Technical Steering Committee, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>; Drummond Reed, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> Community Member; and Sebastian Rodriguez, Strategy Advisor, <a href="https://www.privado.id/">Privado.ID</a>.</p>

				  Knowing your AI agent will be the cornerstone of successful agentic AI —&nbsp;along with knowing it’s your customer who’s interacting with it. ProvenAI and decentralized identity provide the compliance, security, and trust needed to deliver a smarter future for everyone.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, WA: June 2, 2025: <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> today announced the development of <a href="https://indicio.tech/artificial-intelligence/">Indicio ProvenAI,</a> a digital identity infrastructure for AI agents and people to safely and securely authenticate each other and for people to be able to consent to share their data with an AI agent. ProvenAI’s use of Verifiable Credentials provides the trust needed for AI agents and agentic AI to access and use personal data for complex problem solving, enabling a revolution in digital products and services.</p>
<p>As AI agents begin to take on sensitive tasks—from travel planning to financial services—we need to verify who they are, confirm who they represent, and ensure they access our data and act only with our permission. ProvenAI brings a trusted identity layer to AI by using standards-based Verifiable Credentials and privacy-preserving protocols to establish cryptographic trust.</p>
<p>“AI is quickly moving into personal and high-stakes spaces where identity, consent, and data control are essential,” said Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio. “ProvenAI gives developers and organizations the tools to build agents that can prove who they are and prove who you are—securely, privately, and with your permission.”</p>
<p>ProvenAI addresses a fast-emerging need across sectors like travel, finance, education, where AI is already being deployed. It is ideal for customer-facing AI systems, like chatbots that book travel, process loan applications, or assist with student services—where trust, authentication, and compliance are non-negotiable.</p>
 How ProvenAI Works 
 
 Prove the AI agent is legitimate<br>AI agents present Verifiable Credentials to prove their identity and authorization when interacting with users or services. This prevents spoofing and phishing attempts, builds trust in automated interactions, and ensures that users are engaging with the correct application—not a fake or malicious impersonator. 
 Consent to share personal data<br>Users share their identity information with the AI agent using Verifiable Credentials, giving explicit consent and control over what’s shared. This not only ensures privacy but also provides the agent with high-quality, authoritative data directly from the credential itself—improving accuracy, reducing errors, and enabling more relevant responses. 
 Authenticate users without revealing data<br>ProvenAI uses biometric-linked credentials and zero-knowledge proofs to verify a user’s identity without exposing personal or sensitive information. This protects privacy, prevents data leakage, and enables strong authentication without the need to store or transmit raw biometric data—reducing risk for both users and organizations. 
 
<p>ProvenAI is built on Indicio Proven and aligned with EUDI, ISO, and W3C standards, delivering global interoperability with support for wide range of standardized credential formats—including SD-JWTs, mdoc/mDL, JSON-LD, and AnonCreds—and widely used communication protocols like DIDComm and OpenID4VC.</p>

<p>We’re excited to share the latest updates on Permissioning the City (PtC). Our vision to transform how urban spaces are managed and shared by communities has taken some exciting steps forward with the development of our MVP (Platform 1.0).</p> Introducing the MVP — Platform&nbsp;1.0 <p>Check out our new video highlighting the core functionalities and vision behind the product. (Not all functionalities described in the video are currently accessible but the backend is&nbsp;there!)</p><p>Our MVP focuses on three critical&nbsp;areas:</p>  Space Discovery: Making it easier to discover and access information about underutilised spaces.  Rule-making: Enabling communities to collaboratively create, adjust, and iterate rules using our rule-template system.  Community Decision-Making: Facilitating inclusive decisions and structured deliberation through an ‘explained vote’&nbsp;system.  <p>Throughout this development, we’ve actively worked with stakeholders — from commercial and non-commercial space managers to event organisers, artists, and administrators. Our three dedicated in-person workshops allowed us to test ideas such as collaborative rule-making, refine features, and fine-tune our feedback system directly with potential users. You can see our video here which features these engagements.</p> Our Recent Highlights <p>We’re excited to share some achievements from the past&nbsp;year:</p>  <a href="https://edge.worldgovernmentsummit.org/">Dubai World Government Summit</a>: Featured in the Edge of Government exhibition, showcasing global innovations in public governance.  <a href="https://v.daum.net/v/20250523014010958?f=p">Digital Innovation Award</a>: Selected by South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT for the 2025 Digital Innovation Awards.  Funder Validation: Successfully presented MVP to our funder, the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA), receiving encouraging support and validation.  New Funding Secured: NIPA renewed our support for 2025–2026! We’re collaborating with regional institutions across South Korea— Incheon, Yongin, Daegu, and Jeonnam — to expand testing across private homes, shared offices/kitchens, and public&nbsp;squares.  Melbourne Design Week: With RMIT, collaboratively exploring the potential of digital permission architectures in unlocking Australian cities. See event info&nbsp;<a href="https://designweek.melbourne/event/prototyping-permission-unlocking-australian-cities-through-digital-architecture/">here</a>.   What’s Next? <p>Next, we’re diving deep into testing the MVP across real-world environments to answer key governance and knowledge/data related questions, such&nbsp;as:</p><p>Self-selecting permissioning group with responsibility sharing:</p>  Does this feature allow us to find a generally permissive balance of concerned parties, and find considerate and consensual ways for space to be activated?  Should there be special members of the permissioning group which should always be involved as a safeguard, e.g. the space owner? (One way we can test this is having the permissioning group decisions reviewed by a responsibility holder — if the veto is never used, it would suggest that the responsibility holder may not necessarily always need to participate.)  How do we avoid “tragedy of the commons” situations after something goes wrong? What processes do we need to define how these responsibilities are assigned as part of rule-making?  <p>Rule-focused feedback:</p>  Does focusing feedback on rules rather than individuals encourage compliance and reduce negative behaviours?  <p>Asynchronous deliberation:</p>  Will our voting system, which allows explanations and discussions, lead to broader consensus?  <p>Collective intelligence generated through the use of the platform:</p>  What meaningful data can we (responsibly) collect that will benefit both communities and local authorities — creating a positive feedback&nbsp;loop?  What are the possible external use cases for this intelligence? What stakeholders might be interested? E.g. evidence-informed masterplanning   Developing Platform 2.0: AI-Supported Adaptive Permissioning <p>Our new grant enables us to move towards Platform 2.0, a transformative phase introducing conversational, AI-supported dynamic permissioning. While decisions by peers will remain at the heart of Permissioning the City, AI will be used only to facilitate this process. Instead of cumbersome forms, users will interact naturally, negotiating space access through intuitive dialogues powered by small Language Models&nbsp;(sLLMs).</p><p>Highlights of Platform 2.0&nbsp;include:</p>  Adaptive permissions: Permissions that evolve dynamically based on real-time feedback, context, and outcomes.  Trust &amp; verification: Layered verification combining human, sensor, and machine inputs, secured by decentralised identity systems (DIDs) and privacy-enhancing technologies.  Legal automation: Automatically generated contracts and insurance agreements based on the intents and care commitments agreed by&nbsp;peers.  Conversational interfaces: Natural language dialogues facilitate real-time rule negotiations and dynamic governance.   Core Design Questions Driving Platform&nbsp;2.0   Dynamic cities: How can adaptive governance replace static control, fostering real-time, participatory space management?  Decentralised trust: What robust verification systems (e.g., blockchain, multi-level checks) ensure permissions remain trustworthy?  Contextual rule-making: Can organic rule creation emerge effectively from lived behaviours and evolving contexts?  AI governance support: How effectively can AI agents assist in managing real-time space usage and adaptive rules, such as matching between space needs and availability, or proposing rule adjustments based on peer feedback?  Dialogic permissions: Can we structure legal permissions conversationally, moving beyond rigid contracts to flexible, understandable agreements?   Collaborative Development <p>The Permissioning the City Korean consortium includes key technology and government partners working towards shared outcomes.</p>  <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Labs</a>: Leading the conceptual design and back-end permissioning architecture  <a href="https://authrium.com/home_eng.html">Authrium</a>: Providing decentralised identity (DID) solutions and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mechanisms to ensure&nbsp;privacy  <a href="http://techai-apind.com/Aboutus">AP I&amp;D</a>: Managing conversational infrastructure and developing small language models tailored to localised AI&nbsp;engines  <a href="https://daonplace.com">DaonPlace</a> and <a href="https://www.o2pluss.co.kr">o2pluss:</a> Responsible for civic branding, UI/UX design, and integrated payment&nbsp;systems  <a href="https://itp.or.kr">Incheon Technopark</a>, <a href="https://www.jcia.or.kr/cf/index.do">Jeonnam Information and Culture Industry Promotion Agency,</a><a href="https://ybs.ypa.or.kr/portal.do"> Yongin City Industrial Promotion Agenc</a>y, <a href="https://dgtp.or.kr/eng/index.html">Daegu Technopark</a>, and <a href="https://www.inha.ac.kr/kr/index.do">Inha University</a> are jointly coordinating live pilot testing, local experimentation, and integration with the public sector systems to drive the development and deployment of Platform&nbsp;2.0  <p>We are finding that civic tech development in this phase is less about centralised, in-house production and more about building ecosystems — compiling modular parts from loosely connected collaborators. We’re enthusiastic about this next chapter in transforming how cities manage shared spaces — moving towards flexible, community-led, and intelligent permissioning solutions.

 KILT Protocol is entering an exciting new phase in its mission to enable real-world trust on the internet. <p>KILT’s technology, products, and tokenomics are undergoing a complete transformation with the goal of becoming a leader in the decentralized identity (DeID) sector. Developments include:</p>  The establishment of the <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-kilt-foundation-is-here-30387398b919">KILT Foundation</a> dedicated to supporting the growth and success of KILT protocol.  Expansion of the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn-about-kilt">team and advisory&nbsp;council</a>.  A bold new product strategy to fulfill consumer app demand, complimenting our earlier focus on infrastructure and enterprise/government integrations.  Growth beyond Polkadot to Base and the EVM world; opening to a user base orders of magnitude larger than&nbsp;before.  Tokenomic improvements including a halt of inflation, and novel token&nbsp;utility.  Continued pursuit and development of enterprise and government integrations; high-level working relationships with some of the world’s largest organizations.  <p>With an ambitious new outlook, KILT is expanding and improving its contribution to Web3, the next phase of the internet where identity is portable, credentials are verifiable, and users retain full&nbsp;control.</p><p>Read on to find out about some of the products and updates for 2025 which will take the network to the next level, providing multichain tools around DeID for everyday internet users, enterprise and developers.</p> New Products and&nbsp;Services <p>The new KILT product portfolio will include the Clans InfoFi platform; the Sporran super app; decentralized identifiers (DeIDs) for individuals and as a service (DaaS); KILT Pay, linking credentials with real-world payments; and a software development kit (SDK) bringing KILT to Ethereum-compatible blockchains. These and more are are under active development and are planned to roll out through 2025, beginning with Clans in the next few&nbsp;weeks.</p> Clans: Rewards in the Attention Economy <p>The attention economy just got an upgrade! Built on KILT, Clans is a mobile-first InfoFi platform that lets you earn rewards for engaging with others and creating content — directly tied to your activity on X (Twitter). Available on iOS and Android, Clans enables you to rise through the ranks while supporting your favorite projects across any&nbsp;network.</p> In Web3, community is currency. <p>But building meaningful communities requires more than Discord bots or bounty boards. It needs measurable attention economics, social proof, and incentives aligned with contribution.</p>  Post-to-Earn Mechanics: Join campaigns, post content, and earn Roar Points based on real engagement (likes, reposts, replies) and mindshare.  Leaderboard Dynamics: Rise through the ranks and earn exclusive rewards by supporting campaigns.  Mobile-First UX: Available on iOS and Android, Clans facilitates effortless engagement, particularly for mobile-first communities globally.  Beyond KILT: Ecosystem-agnostic infrastructure allows other protocols to launch viral growth campaigns using&nbsp;Clans.   Fully mobile-native; Clans turns attention into ownership.  Sporran 2.0: Your Identity Super&nbsp;App <p>The Sporran 2.0 “Super App” brings decentralized identity to the real world. Not limited to Web3 and with frictionless onboarding, this multi-functional app lets you authenticate a decentralized single sign-on (SSO) and access secure digital signing (DIDsign), KILT Pay, and third-party integrations. So now you can manage your identity, credentials and tokens across the internet just using your&nbsp;phone.</p> Reimagining the Web3&nbsp;Wallet. <p>Today’s Web3 wallets are great for storing tokens but fall short in managing identities and credentials, and providing utility. With Sporran 2.0, KILT is transforming its identity wallet into a multi-functional super app that unlocks decentralized identity in your daily digital&nbsp;life.</p>  Claim &amp; Present Credentials: Easily manage your KILT-based verifiable credentials (DIDs, attestations, proofs).  Built-In Security: Leverages TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for secure credential and key management.  Access Mini-Apps: Use Sporran as your gateway to DIDsign, KILT Pay, and third-party integrations.  Single Sign-On (SSO): Authenticate seamlessly across dApps and Web2 platforms using KILT-issued credentials, eliminating the need for passwords or traditional wallets. Powered by OpenID Connect (OIDC) with relayers, for a secure, single sign-on access across services.   Sporran is a Web3-native passport; not just for access, but for&nbsp;utility.  DIDsign 2.0: The Web3 Signing Platform for Everyday&nbsp;Use <p>A decentralized alternative to DocuSign and Adobe Sign, DIDsign 2.0 is a verifiable, privacy-preserving signing platform. Based on the internationally-recognized <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/">W3C decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs), you can create and control your digital identity, storing it on your own device. With DIDsign you can use decentralized identities for document signing and credential-based access via your phone or device, with signatures verifiable on-chain without revealing document content. The platform also enables multi-party signing, great for quick and transparent contract approvals.</p> Bringing decentralized signature infrastructure into everyday workflows. <p>KILT is reimagining DIDsign as a fully-featured decentralized signing platform: a verifiable, privacy-preserving alternative to DocuSign and Adobe&nbsp;Sign.</p>  Legally-Sound Document Signing: Sign contracts, agreements, NDAs, and invoices using decentralized identifiers and timestamped hashes.  Credential-Based Authentication: Only signers with required credentials (e.g., verified KYC or professional affiliations) can access and&nbsp;sign.  Auditability Without Surveillance: All signatures are verifiable on-chain, while document contents remain off-chain and encrypted.  Team Collaboration: Manage multi-party signing flows, track progress, and issue countersignatures — all inside a unified interface.   From DAOs signing grants to enterprises managing staffing contracts — DIDsign 2.0 brings decentralized signature infrastructure into everyday workflows.  KILT Pay: Credential-Aware Payments Infrastructure <p>KILT Pay links your identity with real-world payments using verified credentials. This allows users and platforms to transact safely and seamlessly. Integrated with payment services, KILT Pay can be used for credential-based anti-money-laundering (AML) controls or non-custodial Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements without leaking personal&nbsp;data.</p> Web3 payments need more than just wallets and QR codes — they need verified, compliant identity. <p>KILT Pay bridges on-chain credentials with real-world payments, enabling merchants, platforms, and users to transact safely and seamlessly. Keep an eye on <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">KILT X</a> for announcements of collaborations with leading payment integrators.</p>  Credential-based checkout and AML controls — without leaking personal&nbsp;data.  Onboarding tools for fintechs, exchanges, and DAOs requiring non-custodial KYC.   Pay for services with a tap, while proving eligibility or jurisdiction — no passwords, no screenshots, no friction.  EVM SDK: KILT Identity for Every&nbsp;Chain <p>The EVM Software Development Kit (SDK) expands KILT identity solutions beyond the Polkadot ecosystem, bringing them to Ethereum-compatible blockchains. The TypeScript SDK makes it easier for developers to integrate KILT as identity middleware, with cross-chain portability and credentials that can be utilized by smart contracts across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and all Ethereum-compatible blockchains.</p> KILT’s identity layer becomes composable across ecosystems. <p>We will be releasing a complete EVM Software Development Kit (SDK) that brings KILT’s credential primitives to Ethereum-compatible chains.</p>  Solidity Libraries: KILT credentials can be natively verified by smart contracts across a range of blockchains, including Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and other Layer 2 solutions.  Cross-Chain Credential Portability: Credentials issued on KILT, validated across ecosystems.  TypeScript SDK: Simplifies backend and frontend development with credential APIs.   This makes KILT de facto identity middleware for the EVM universe.  DID-as-a-Service (DaaS): Developer-Friendly Identity&nbsp;APIs <p>Verifiable identity shouldn’t require a PhD in cryptography.</p><p>DID-as-a-Service is KILT’s turnkey developer suite that lets any builder integrate decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials into apps, platforms, and products — with just a few lines of code. Not limited to Web3 platforms, these can be used for secure log-ins, credential gating or age-restricted content, and embedded identity&nbsp;layers.</p> Use Cases:   Identity-based logins for DeFi or Web2&nbsp;portals.  Credential gating for token sales, age-restricted content, or governance.  Embedded identity layers for wallets, exchanges, AI agents, and&nbsp;more.   Available via RESTful APIs and SDKs, DaaS lowers the barrier for integrating identity into high-scale applications.  Token Migration <p>To pave the way for KILT’s ambitious multichain future, the community <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/referendum/50">voted</a> to migrate the KILT token to a new contract on the Base network. This process will begin in the near future; details will be announced on <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">KILT X (Twitter)</a>. KILT holders will be required to migrate their tokens either via supported exchanges or manually by a self-custody route. A detailed how-to guide will be published via <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">X</a> and the <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">KILT blog</a> before migration begins.</p><p>The new token <a href="https://Basescan.org/token/0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8">contract</a>, the migration <a href="https://Basescan.org/address/0x4a62f30d95a8350fc682642a455b299c074b3b8c">contract</a>, and migration portal have recently completed a <a href="https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kilt-protocol#code-security">security audit</a> with&nbsp;Certik.</p> These new developments on KILT Protocol aim to bring more trust and security to the internet without compromising on privacy. Follow KILT updates on <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">X</a> or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">blog</a>.  🔗 A Unified Identity Layer for the Decentralized Internet: Why It&nbsp;Matters <p>Identity is the missing layer in decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Without scalable, privacy-preserving, and composable identity primitives:</p>  DAOs can’t onboard contributors with&nbsp;trust.  DeFi protocols can’t scale responsibly or compliantly.  Content and engagement can’t be credibly incentivized.  Signing documents still relies on centralized Web2&nbsp;vendors.  <p>KILT solves this — with infrastructure, UX, and interoperability baked&nbsp;in.</p> 📣 Get&nbsp;Involved <p>Whether you’re&nbsp;a:</p>  dApp Builder looking to integrate login, credentials, or document&nbsp;signing,  Ecosystem Project wanting to launch community campaigns via&nbsp;Clans,  Enterprise seeking a decentralized e-signature alternative, Digital Identity Framework integration.

<p>A sidebar is a familiar element in web design, typically positioned on the left or right side of a webpage. It provides quick access to key information, enhances user experience, and improves website functionality. However, not all sidebars are beneficial. If poorly designed, they can clutter the page, distract users, or even slow down loading speeds.</p>



<p>So, how can you make the most of a sidebar? What are the best ways to optimize it for a smoother workflow? This article will guide you through everything you need to know.</p>

 What Is a Sidebar and Why Does It Matter? 



<p>A sidebar is a section of a webpage that contains supplementary content. It can include navigation menus, article categories, ads, search boxes, and other useful widgets.</p>



<p>The role of a sidebar depends on the website type. On news sites, it helps readers find related articles. For personal blogs, it showcases post categories or featured content. In e-commerce, a sidebar often houses product filters to streamline the shopping experience.</p>



<p>According to a HubSpot study, 42% of users still rely on sidebars for navigation, while 58% focus solely on the main content. This indicates that while sidebars remain valuable, they must be thoughtfully designed to avoid reducing user engagement.</p>


 
 


 How a Sidebar Enhances User Experience 



<p>Some websites have eliminated sidebars to emphasize their primary content. However, for many, this is still essential. It offers several key benefits:</p>



 
 Faster information access: Users can find relevant content without excessive scrolling or menu navigation. This is especially useful for content-heavy sites like news portals, blogs, and forums. 



 Increased conversion rates: A well-optimized sidebar can house call-to-action (CTA) buttons, advertisements, or sign-up forms to grab attention. Crazy Egg reports that properly designed sidebars can boost click-through rates by up to 40%. 



 Better SEO performance: Internal links in sidebars help Google index content more effectively, improving website rankings on search engines.

 5 Simple Ways to Optimize Your Sidebar for Productivity 



<p>Sidebars can either streamline your workflow or create unnecessary distractions. Here are five essential tips to make yours more effective.</p>



 Prioritize Essential Content 



<p>One of the biggest mistakes in sidebar design is overcrowding it with too much information. A cluttered sidebar overwhelms users and makes it harder to find relevant content. Instead, focus on the most important elements.</p>



<p>An effective sidebar should include only a search bar, post categories, popular articles, and clear CTAs. If your site is an e-commerce platform, keep it simple by displaying only product filters and shopping cart access. Personal blogs can highlight categories and featured posts without overloading the space.</p>



 Utilize WordPress Widgets Wisely 



<p>For WordPress users, optimizing a sidebar is much easier with widgets. These built-in tools allow you to add elements like article categories, recent posts, social media links, and email sign-up forms without touching code.</p>



<p>However, not all widgets add value. Too many can clutter the page and slow down your site. Carefully select only those that truly enhance user experience.</p>



 Choose the Right Position 



<p>There’s no universal rule for sidebar placement, but statistics show that 70% of websites position it on the right. This placement prevents it from disrupting reading flow, making it the preferred choice for content-driven sites.</p>



<p>On the other hand, e-commerce sites often place sidebars on the left to make product filtering more intuitive. If your website prioritizes navigation and interactivity, consider a left sidebar.</p>



 Reduce Distractions 



<p>A sidebar should aid user navigation, not become a source of distraction. Excessive ads, animated banners, or irrelevant links can clutter the space and reduce efficiency.</p>



<p>Regularly review your sidebar and remove unnecessary elements. If ads are essential, limit them to one or two strategically placed banners rather than flooding the sidebar with promotions. Google’s research suggests that cleaner, distraction-free sidebars help retain users 30% longer.</p>



 Personalize the Sidebar Experience 



<p>Customization is key to a truly effective sidebar. Allowing users to tailor their sidebar content enhances engagement and usability.</p>



<p>For example, a blog can let users select preferred categories to display. An e-commerce site can enable shoppers to save filter settings for future searches. Personalized experiences lead to higher satisfaction and better interaction rates.</p>


 
 


 How to Create and Modify a Sidebar in WordPress 



<p>WordPress provides multiple ways to add and edit sidebars. If your theme supports sidebars, simply navigate to Appearance → Widgets, where you can drag and drop elements as needed. For more advanced customization, use the Customize tool under Appearance to preview changes in real time.</p>



<p>If your theme lacks sidebar support, you can manually edit the functions.php file or install a plugin like Simple Custom Sidebar to add new sidebar functionality.</p>



<p>Important Considerations for Design</p>



<p>A well-designed sidebar should be simple, intuitive, and distraction-free. Here are key factors to keep in mind:</p>



 
 Regular performance checks: Ensure that your sidebar genuinely enhances user experience. If it doesn’t contribute to engagement or conversions, reconsider its content and design. 



 Remove unnecessary elements: Not every website benefits from a sidebar. If it doesn’t add value, either streamline it or remove it entirely. 
 


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>A sidebar can be a powerful tool for improving navigation, boosting conversions, and enhancing SEO if used correctly. Thoughtful design and optimization ensure that it serves its purpose without overwhelming users. By implementing the five optimization tips outlined in this article, you can maximize the efficiency of yours, streamline your workflow, and create a more user-friendly website.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why a link opens in an app instead of your browser, or vice versa? Knowing how to detect if a URL opens in a browser or app is crucial for improving user experience, streamlining app development, and analyzing data effectively. Whether you’re a developer, marketer, or casual user, this quick guide offers simple, practical methods to identify URL behavior. From using tools and code to leveraging handy tips, discover how to easily detect if a <a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-fast-secure-and-best-web-browsers-to-use/">URL opens in a browser or app</a> and take control of your digital navigation!</p>



 Introduction about URL opens in browser or app 



<p>Understanding whether a URL opens in a browser or an app is essential for enhancing user experience and optimizing digital navigation. This introduction explores why detecting URL behavior matters and previews quick, effective methods to identify it.</p>



 What is URL? 



<p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to locate a resource on the internet, such as a webpage, image, or file. It typically consists of a protocol (e.g., https://), a domain name (e.g., www.companyabc.com), and a path to the specific resource (e.g., /page), enabling <a href="https://blog.herond.org/why-should-you-use-an-ad-blocking-browser-top-best-choices-today/">browsers or apps</a> to access and display content.</p>









 What do we need to know about URL? 



<p>To effectively navigate the internet, it’s essential to understand URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), which serve as addresses for locating online resources like webpages or files. Knowing a URL’s structure – protocol (e.g., https://), domain, and path – helps users and developers ensure seamless access to content in browsers or apps. URLs also play a key role in SEO, marketing, and security, enabling better user experience, campaign tracking, and safe browsing practices.</p>



 Why Detect If a URL Opens in a Browser or App? 



<p>Knowing how to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app is essential for enhancing user experience and improving data analysis. Understanding URL behavior ensures links function as intended, boosting efficiency across various tasks.</p>



 Common Use Cases 



 App Development: Ensuring URLs Trigger Apps (Deep Linking) 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is critical for app developers to ensure seamless deep linking, where URLs direct users to specific content within an app, such as a song in Spotify or a post in a social media app. By verifying whether a URL triggers the intended app (e.g., using schemes like “spotify://”) or falls back to a browser, developers can test and refine app functionality. This process ensures a smooth user experience and compatibility across platforms.</p>



 Digital Marketing: Tracking User Behavior Across Browsers or Apps 



<p>In digital marketing, detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app helps marketers track user behavior and optimize campaigns. Understanding whether a promotional link directs users to a mobile app (for higher engagement) or a website (for broader reach) allows for better targeting and performance analysis. For instance, a campaign link for an e-commerce app might be tested to ensure it opens the app for logged-in users or a browser for new visitors. Tools like Google Analytics or Branch.io can leverage this data to refine strategies.</p>



 Link Testing: Verifying URLs Function Correctly on Different Platforms 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is vital for link testing to ensure URLs work as intended across various platforms. SEO professionals, content creators, or QA testers need to verify that links function correctly on iOS, Android, or desktop environments. By detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app, testers can identify and fix broken links or misconfigured redirects, ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.</p>


 
 


 Benefits 



 Enhances User Experience 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app significantly improves user experience by ensuring links lead to the intended destination. For instance, a URL designed to open the Spotify app should seamlessly launch the app for users who have it installed, rather than redirecting to a browser, which can be frustrating. By confirming URL behavior, you can prevent misdirects and provide a smooth, intuitive navigation experience across devices, whether users are accessing content on iOS, Android, or desktop. This clarity makes digital interactions more enjoyable and efficient for everyone.</p>



 Optimizes Marketing Campaigns 



<p>For digital marketers, detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is key to optimizing campaign performance. Understanding whether a promotional link directs users to a mobile app (for higher engagement) or a website (for broader reach) allows marketers to tailor strategies and track user behavior effectively. For example, a campaign for an e-commerce app can be refined by ensuring links open the app for logged-in users. Tools like Google Analytics rely on this data to measure conversions, making it essential to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app for data-driven marketing success.</p>



 Supports Debugging in Web/App Development 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is crucial for developers debugging web or app functionality. Misconfigured URLs, such as those failing to trigger deep links or universal links, can disrupt app features or user flows. By verifying whether a URL opens the intended app (e.g., a payment app like PayPal) or falls back to a browser, developers can identify and fix issues like broken links or incorrect redirects. This process ensures apps and websites work seamlessly across platforms, saving time and enhancing reliability during development.</p>



 Methods to Detect If a URL Opens in a Browser or App 



<p>Below are practical methods to identify whether a URL directs to a browser or an app, ensuring seamless navigation and functionality across platforms.</p>



 Manual Testing 



 Manual Testing on Devices 



<p>Manual testing is a straightforward way to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Open the URL on a device (smartphone, tablet, or PC) using a browser or messaging app. 



 Observe whether it launches a browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari) or an app (e.g., YouTube, Spotify). 



 Test on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, desktop) to account for app installations or settings. 



 Tip: If the app is installed, URLs like “youtube.com” may open the YouTube app; otherwise, they default to a browser. 
 



 Inspecting URL Schemes 



<p>Checking the URL’s protocol can reveal whether it’s designed for an app or browser, making it a reliable method to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Examine the URL for app-specific schemes (e.g., “youtube://” for YouTube, “spotify://” for Spotify). 



 Use tools like Postman or a browser’s address bar to input the URL and check for redirects. 



 Verify if the device has the associated app installed, as this influences behavior. 



 Tip: Custom schemes typically trigger apps if installed; otherwise, they may prompt a browser fallback. 
 









 Using Browser Developer Tools 



<p>Browser Developer Tools offer a technical approach to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, perfect for developers needing detailed insights.</p>



 
 Open the URL in a browser and access Developer Tools (press F12 or right-click &gt; Inspect). 



 Check the “Network” tab for redirects or app-specific responses. 



 Run navigator.userAgent in the console to identify the environment (browser or app). 



 Tip: Use extensions like “User-Agent Switcher” to simulate app environments for testing. 
 



 Leveraging Analytics or SDKs 



<p>Analytics tools and SDKs provide automated ways to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, ideal for marketers and developers tracking user flows.</p>



 
 Integrate tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel to monitor where users land (browser or app). 



 Use SDKs like Branch.io or Firebase Dynamic Links to track deep link behavior. 



 Check platform-specific configs, such as Apple’s Universal Links or Android’s App Links. 



 Tip: These tools log detailed data, helping confirm whether a URL triggers an app or browser. 
 



 Using Online Tools or Extensions 



<p>Online tools and browser extensions simplify the process to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, especially for non-technical users.</p>



 
 Use tools like Redirect Checker or URL Profiler to analyze URL paths and redirects. 



 Install browser extensions like “User-Agent Switcher” to mimic app or browser environments. 



 Test the URL across different devices or emulators to verify behavior. 



 Tip: Ensure tools are updated to support modern app protocols for accurate results. 
 



 Tips for Optimizing URL Detection 



<p>To effectively detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, applying optimization techniques ensures accuracy, efficiency, and a seamless process. These practical tips help streamline URL behavior analysis for developers, marketers, and everyday users, enhancing workflows and user experiences across platforms.</p>



 Test Across Multiple Platforms 



<p>URL behavior can vary depending on the device or operating system. So cross-platform testing is crucial to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Test URLs on iOS, Android, and desktop devices to observe differences. 



 Check if apps like YouTube or Spotify are installed, as this affects whether the URL opens in the app or browser. 



 Use emulators or virtual devices to simulate environments without physical hardware. 



 Tip: Document results for each platform to identify patterns and ensure consistent behavior. 
 



 Use Analytics Tools for Insights 



<p>Analytics tools provide valuable data to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, especially for tracking user behavior in marketing or app development.</p>



 
 Integrate Google Analytics or Mixpanel to monitor where users land after clicking a URL. 



 Set up event tracking to capture app launches versus browser redirects. 



 Analyze reports to identify trends, such as higher app engagement on mobile devices. 



 Tip: Use UTM parameters in URLs to track specific campaigns and their outcomes. 
 


 
 


 Optimize Deep Linking 



<p>Deep linking ensures URLs direct users to specific app content, and optimizing this process helps accurately detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Configure Universal Links (iOS) or App Links (Android) correctly in app settings. 



 Test deep links with tools like Branch.io or Firebase Dynamic Links to confirm app triggers. 



 Verify fallback behavior to ensure URLs open in a browser if the app isn’t installed. 



 Tip: Regularly update app configurations to align with platform changes. 
 



 Ensure Security Checks 



<p>Security is critical when testing URLs to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, as malicious links can harm devices or compromise data.</p>



 
 Verify URLs come from trusted sources to avoid phishing or malware risks. 



 Use URL scanners like VirusTotal to check for suspicious behavior before testing. 



 Enable browser security features or extensions like Herond Shield for safe navigation. 



 Tip: Avoid testing unverified URLs on personal devices; use a sandbox environment instead. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is a vital skill for enhancing user experiences, optimizing marketing campaigns, and streamlining app development. From manual testing and inspecting URL schemes to using browser tools, analytics, and extensions, the methods outlined in this guide make it easy to identify URL behavior accurately. Start applying these techniques today to ensure seamless navigation across platforms!</p>

<p>Keeping your desktop tidy and shortcuts well-organized makes it easier to find and use them.</p>



 
 Group related shortcuts into folders (e.g., “Work,” “Study,” “Personal”) on your desktop. 



 Name shortcuts clearly (e.g., “Gmail Work” instead of “Shortcut1”) to avoid confusion. 



 Place frequently used shortcuts in an easily accessible spot, like the top-left corner of the desktop.

 Test Shortcuts Regularly 



<p>Testing ensures your shortcuts function correctly and open in the intended browser or app.</p>



 
 Click each shortcut to verify it opens the correct website or web-based app. 



 Check if the shortcut uses your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by setting it as default. 



 Update URLs if websites change (e.g., a redirected landing page). 



 Tip: Test after browser updates or system changes, as they may affect shortcut behavior. 
 



 Use Shortcuts for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

<p>Hey Herondians!</p>

This means snappier interactions, smoother feature behaviors, and better integration for future updates. Plus, improved bug tracking and error recreation tools help developers diagnose issues faster, leading to a more reliable experience for everyone.</p>



<p>In addition to these core improvements, we’ve also addressed wallet inconsistencies for a better, seamless experience and included a set of minor patches and important security updates, keeping Herond up-to-date with the latest data sets. </p>



<p>Our goal with Version 2.1.6 is to strengthen our foundation to support the many future updates we have in store. For a detailed look at all the changes, check out the full changelog on <a href="https://x.com/HerondBrowser/status/1924721761033060448">this X post</a>.</p>



 Community and Events 



 <a href="https://x.com/HerondBrowser/status/1913127113781313668">Heronad Campaign</a>  



<p>The Heronad campaign has officially concluded, and what a journey it was! </p>







<p>We managed to pick out <a href="https://x.com/HerondBrowser/status/1921837750283591826">26 lucky folks</a> who each received the complete Monadverse NFT collection, Chapters 1 through 6, directly from us for completing all the Heronad Quests.</p>



<p>Over the campaign’s impressive 24-day run, we saw over 2700 of you jumping in, with thousands of interactions lighting up both X and Discord. And speaking of sharing the love, we showered you all with over 12,000 $MON in rewards.</p>



<p>Plus, it was amazing to see over 1,634 unique wallets mint the Heronad NFT in just five days!</p>



<p>In total, we gave away over 150 NFTs from the coveted Monadverse collection, spreading the Monadverse spirit far and wide. Thank you to everyone who participated and made the Heronad campaign such a vibrant success!</p>



 <a href="https://x.com/HerondBrowser/status/1908082125019951312">Action Surge – Season Three</a>  



<p>Remember how we decided to keep the good times rolling by <a href="https://x.com/HerondBrowser/status/1914605093829403027">extending Season 3</a> all the way to May 12th? Well, it was totally worth it! Thanks to the Heronad vibes, we decided to pump up the rewards even more than usual.</p>







<p>Over the entire season, we held a whopping 8 giveaways, and you guys walked away with over 5,350 $MON worth of prizes! That included some seriously cool stuff like 12 Monadverse Chapter 1 and 4 NFTs. Even a Purple Frens NFT worth over 2,000 $MON found a lucky owner! We love being able to share these with you. </p>



<p>And the best part? We welcomed over 700 new friends who decided to join <a href="http://discord.gg/herondbrowser">our Discord</a> family! It’s always great to see the community growing.</p>

<p>In a transformative move for the decentralized technology ecosystem, Kwaai and Verida today announced their intent to join forces to create a world-leading, end-to-end decentralized AI platform. This union brings together two highly complementary open-source technology stacks to empower a new generation of private, personalized, and user-owned AI applications.</p><p>The combined organization will unify Verida’s decentralized data and connectivity infrastructure with Kwaai’s decentralized AI systems to build a comprehensive, open-source solution to realize sovereign AI.</p><blockquote>Working with Reza and the Kwaai team has been inspiring. Their dedication to open source, long-term thinking, and community building aligns perfectly with our mission to make personal technology and AI accessible to everyone. Our technologies complement each other in exciting ways, and we’re thrilled to take this step together. Chris Were, Verida&nbsp;CEO.</blockquote><blockquote>Verida’s gracious contribution accelerates the Kwaai mission by providing complementary components of personal data connectors and shared storage. By merging our two communities, we follow the example of Linux in demonstrating the power of open source to transform an industry. Reza Rassool, Kwaai&nbsp;Chair.</blockquote><p>Today, Verida and Kwaai signed a memorandum of understanding to support the contribution of Verida’s technology to the Kwaai project. This agreement reflects our commitment to bringing our communities together and jointly exploring the future role of the VDA token and&nbsp;network.</p> A Shared&nbsp;Mission <p>At the heart of this initiative is a unified mission: to build open-source, decentralized, human-centric AI that prioritizes sovereignty, accessibility and personal&nbsp;agency.</p><p>This is not just a technology partnership — it’s a global movement towards reclaiming control over data, computation, and decision-making in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>By joining forces Verida and Kwaai are accelerating the realization of personal AI, that empowers individuals, respects data sovereignty and leverages decentralized infrastructure to ensure user&nbsp;control.</p><p>Open source ecosystems thrive on modularity, and we expect the personal AI stack to involve multiple technologies working together. Verida’s decentralized identifiers make it possible to link diverse sovereign services — including compute, storage, and messaging. Verida’s encrypted decentralized database is just one of several storage components expected to power a flexible, full-featured personal AI platform.</p> About Kwaai   Kwaai is a rapidly growing community of 850+ AI volunteers — a technical and policy think tank of designers, builders, and researchers supported by over 30 partner organizations.  KwaaiNet: a peer-to-peer fabric supporting distributed AI — Built by the People, For the People. KwaaiNet aggregates unused and unsold processing in residential, enterprise, and cloud computing to deliver a digital public infrastructure accessible to all. KwaaiNet comprises a three-layered sandwich of a shared storage network, a community inference layer, and an Intentcasting network.  Kwaai builds Personal AI focused on empowering individuals, respecting data sovereignty, and leveraging edge infrastructure such as KwaaiNet.  The Kwaai Fundamental AI workgroups are driving cutting-edge research to enhance AI efficiency and capability. Areas of exploration include GraphRAG architectures, sub-quadratic neural networks, physics-informed neural models, state space modeling, and privacy-preserving methods like homomorphic confidential computing.  <p>The Verida ecosystem includes:</p>  A global community of 85k X followers, 30k Discord members, multilingual ambassadors, application builders, and data integrators  Data connector framework enabling users to export and connect their existing data and services — like Gmail, Telegram, Slack&nbsp;etc.  Self-sovereign confidential compute to facilitate private operations on personal data and&nbsp;services  A proven decentralized database network for storing encrypted personal&nbsp;data  Verida Vault web application enabling people to manage their data and connections  Decentralized identifier and API key implementations to support personal identity and key management   Verida Network Transition <p>The current Verida Storage Network, which has served as a critical testbed for decentralized storage and early AI integration, will cease operations on June 6, 2025. All users and builders must export their data before this&nbsp;date.</p><p>Going forward, the next iteration of Verida’s open-source infrastructure — tailored specifically for decentralized AI — will be developed and supported under a dedicated working group in the Kwaai community.</p> A New Vision for the VDA&nbsp;Token <p>Verida and Kwaai joining forces presents a unique opportunity to review the utility and scope of the existing VDA token. Originally designed as a decentralized storage credit, the combined organization has a much broader scope and the VDA token to become the basis for a universal community-driven economy for decentralized AI infrastructure. This will support access to personal storage, compute, and inference across a fully integrated, decentralized AI&nbsp;stack.</p> How You Can Get&nbsp;Involved <p>Join the growing community of decentralized AI pioneers:</p>  Join the Kwaai Community:<a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/home/sign-up"> kwaai.ai/home/sign-up</a>  Investigate running a KwaaiNet Node:<a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/kwaainet"> kwaai.ai/kwaainet</a>  Follow <a href="https://x.com/verida_io">Verida</a> and <a href="https://x.com/kwaailab">Kwaai</a> on X to stay&nbsp;updated   What’s Next? <p>This is a high-level announcement. In the coming weeks we will share more detailed plans with actionable steps members from both communities can take to support a smooth integration of technology, community and other key stakeholders.</p><p>Stay tuned.

 Web3 + AI + Fortune&nbsp;: Combination, New&nbsp;product  Web3 + AI + Fortune-telling: A New Combination <p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>Metadium will be showcasing real-world use cases of DID services. We will be introducing a variety of services that integrate with Metadium&nbsp;DID.</p><p>The first of these is the fortune-telling service ‘majoo’, which we are excited to share with&nbsp;you.</p> 🌠 Introducing the Fortune-telling Service&nbsp;“majoo” <p>Fortune-telling has long been a subject of great public interest. Majoo reinterprets this in a modern way by offering “personalized daily insights tailored to your current state and personality.”</p><p>On June 16, 2025, the Metadium-powered fortune-telling service majoo will officially launch.</p><p>Majoo goes beyond basic fortune-telling. It offers personalized analysis of one’s temperament and flow using Metadium DID and AI technology.<br>It’s not just entertainment — it’s a guide for self-awareness and actionable life decisions.</p><p>▶️ Download majoo<br>Coming to Google Play and App Store in&nbsp;June.</p> 🌟 Real-World DID Usage and AI Technology Power the Expansion of the Metadium Ecosystem <p>Majoo is a service that combines Metadium’s DID technology with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>As more people use majoo, the number of users issuing and utilizing Metadium DID will naturally increase.<br> The more frequently DID is applied in real-world services, the more it becomes embedded in practical ecosystems, ultimately accelerating the growth of Metadium’s overall infrastructure.</p><blockquote>“Every new user makes Metadium stronger in the real&nbsp;world.”</blockquote><p>The AI applied in majoo doesn’t just automate results. It analyzes your daily state, behavioral patterns, and personal tendencies to offer fortune readings that feel truly tailored to you.<br> As a result, user satisfaction and retention increase, and DID adoption happens naturally.</p><p>Furthermore, Metadium’s quick integration of AI — one of today’s most prominent tech trends — shows its commitment to staying on the cutting edge.<br> This strategic move enhances the user experience and drives the evolution of Web3 services in the Metadium ecosystem.</p> 📢 Stay Updated — Join the Metadium Community <p>To receive updates on future releases and DID-based service announcements, subscribe to our community:</p>  Website |<a href="https://metadium.com/"> https://metadium.com</a>  Discord |<a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2"> https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a>  Telegram(EN) |<a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0"> http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a>  Twitter |<a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK"> https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a>  Medium |<a href="https://medium.com/metadium"> https://medium.com/metadium</a>  <p>Thank you.</p><p>Metadium team.</p> Web3 + AI + 운세: 새로운&nbsp;조합 <p>안녕하세요, 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>메타디움 DID의 실생활 서비스와의 결합, AI 서비스 출시 등 다양한 사례들이 매주 순차적으로 공개될&nbsp;예정입니다.</p><p>그 첫 번째로, 운세 서비스(“마주”)의 출시와 메타디움 DID 도입을&nbsp;소개드립니다.</p> 🌠 운세 서비스 ‘마주’&nbsp;소개 <p>운세는 오랜 시간 많은 사람들이 관심을 가져온 주제입니다. 시대가 바뀌어도 ‘나를 알고 싶다’는 사람들의 본질적인 욕구는 여전히 유효하며, 그만큼 운세는 언제나 친숙하고 강력한 접근점이&nbsp;되어줍니다.</p><p>2025년 6월, 메타디움 기반 운세 서비스 ‘마주(majoo)’가 정식&nbsp;출시됩니다.</p><p>‘마주’는 단순한 운세를 넘어 매일 달라지는 나의 성향과 흐름에 맞춘 운세 경험을 제공합니다. 단순한 엔터테인먼트를 넘어 자기이해와 실생활 행동의 가이드가&nbsp;제공됩니다.</p><p>▶️ ‘마주’를&nbsp;만나보세요!</p><p>GooglePlay / AppStore 에 6월 출시될&nbsp;예정입니다.</p> 🌟 DID 실사용과 AI기술이 메타디움 생태계를&nbsp;확장합니다 <p>마주는 메타디움 DID와 AI기술을 결합한&nbsp;서비스입니다.</p><p>‘마주’를 사용하는 사람들이 많아질수록, 메타디움 DID를 발급 및 활용하는 사용자도 함께 늘어나게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>DID가 실제로 사용되는 사례가 많아지면 많아질수록, 메타디움 기술은 더 많은 서비스와 연결되고, 이는 메타디움의 생태계 성장으로 이어질&nbsp;것입니다.</p><blockquote>“한 명의 사용자가 늘어날&nbsp;때마다,</blockquote><blockquote>메타디움은 현실 속에서 더&nbsp;강해집니다.”</blockquote><p>마주에 적용된 AI 기술은 단순히 운세를 자동으로 보여주는 수준을 넘어, 사용자의 성향과 흐름을 읽고, 실제 생활에 밀접한 가이드를 제공합니다.

<p>On 29 May 2025, the US Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), sanctioned an entity called Funnull along with an associated individual, Liu Lizhi. Funnull is a Philippines-based cloud infrastructure provider that allegedly serves thousands of illicit websites such as phishing sites, fake trading apps, gambling websites, and pig butchering scams. In the accompanying <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0149">press release</a>, OFAC stated that Funnull has directly facilitated $200 million in victim-reported losses from pig butchering scams.<br><br>According to OFAC, Funnull has acquired IP addresses from mainstream cloud service providers to sell to cybercriminals to host illicit content. It is, therefore, reportedly a key enabler of so-called "infrastructure laundering", whereby cybercriminals relay their malicious traffic through U.S. cloud providers. The majority of cryptocurrency investment scam websites reported to the FBI are linked to Funnull.&nbsp;<br><br>Funnull also provides additional services to cybercriminals such as automatically generating large numbers of similar website names and web design templates. Furthermore, Funnell obtained a code repository that allows web developers to maliciously alter code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam ones, some of which OFAC was able to link to Chinese criminal money laundering.<br><br>As part of this action, OFAC sanctioned two cryptocurrency addresses on Ethereum and Tron. The two addresses have received more than $4 million.<br><br>The sanctioned Tron address has received funds directly from Huione Pay, part of Huione Group, which was recently found by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to be an <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-u.s.-treasury-finds-huione-group-to-be-of-primary-money-laundering-concern">entity of primary money laundering concern</a>. Huione Pay is a payments and foreign exchange business, which our <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/cyber-scam-marketplace">previous research</a> has linked to laundering of the proceeds of pig butchering scams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seattle: MAY 28,2025:&nbsp;Indicio is delighted to announce that Will Groah has joined the <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> Board of Directors to help the company chart its expansion as a global leader in decentralized identity technology and biometric authentication.</p>
<p>Will comes to Indicio with considerable experience in defense, national security, and technology, and having successfully built a company from zero to 300 employees with a successful exit. He has extensive experience in nurturing technology startups to sustainability and beyond.</p>
<p>“Will is one of Indicio’s earliest champions,” said Indicio CEO Heather Dahl. “He saw the transformative power of the technology we were building and how it could be deployed across every sector. Just as important, he also saw the strength of the team behind it —&nbsp;and our approach to business and our customers.”</p>
<p>“It’s easy to be carried away by new technology and to have visions,” said Will, “but it’s another thing to carry out technology transformation. That requires sweat, dedication, and really effective teamwork. I could already see decentralized identity as an era-defining technology —&nbsp;it makes the exchange of information, the underlying architecture of the digital world, faster, safer, and more streamlined —&nbsp;and that has a host of benefits. But with Indicio, I saw this vision becoming reality through an extraordinary display of willpower, talent, and ambition. That’s why I couldn’t wait to get onboard to contribute.“</p>
<p>Indicio has the energy of a juggernaut — and this team’s optimism, their astounding speed at problem solving and delivery, their total dedication to customers no matter what timezone — it’s all inspiring. They’ve proven the technology, the business model, and the ability to execute with global partners and customers. And now the market is taking off. At Indicio, it’s afterburner time — and I’m here for it.”</p>
<p>Will is a board member, advisor, and investor to several high-growth healthtech, sportstech, and fintech segments. Current projects include advising the development of a regional hospital system’s innovation division, board and advisor for sports tech management start-ups, and coaching.</p>
<p>“Will is a tremendous asset to Indicio because he brings so much experience with startup technology companies and with our investors,” said Ken Ebert, CTO at Indicio. Every team member has a deep appreciation for his insights, enthusiasm, and support. He is as tireless as we are and continually pushes us to think in novel ways and to formulate new applications and approaches to scale our business.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s a bigger picture to the technology and solutions Indicio is implementing,” said Will. “It’s one where the world is being unnecessarily taxed by legacy technologies and approaches to identity and data. Taxed in terms of cost, taxed in terms of friction, taxed in terms of frustration. Indicio has created a technology for trust that eliminates this tax, leaving the world in a much better place. Better for business, because it is so much more efficient to act on trusted data. Better for people, because everything is simpler and seamless and more secure, and they have control over their personal data. Everything is trustworthy — provable and proven. I’m honored — along with a stellar team of advisors —to be helping Indicio build this future.”</p>
<p>Will joins Tom Plofchan as a strategic advisor. <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/former-pangiam-managing-partner-and-chief-investment-officer-tom-plofchan-joins-indicio-as-a-strategic-advisor-to-guide-decentralized-digital-identity-strategy/">Read Tom’s announcement here.</a></p>

<p>You’ve no doubt heard the saying, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’, but have you ever thought how it applies to data privacy?</p>



<p>The egg/basket advice is basically about spreading risk and diversifying assets, right? If all your valuables (eggs) are in one place (basket) and that place is compromised (basket breaks), you’ll lose all your valuables. Eggs are fragile and baskets break, so you’re facing a real risk, but it’s one you can easily mitigate by spreading your eggs across more baskets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And that’s where the link to data privacy comes in. If we put all our personal information in one place (the internet) by using it everywhere we interact online, then we risk losing all that information in one incident (data breach, identity theft, credit card fraud etc.). What’s more, we risk having it correlated by data brokers or ad tech, stolen by hackers, or sold by the service operator itself.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works: data broking services can collect enough data to determine (or infer) a user’s legal identity online, then they can track that user across the many different services and sites they access. By tracking users in this manner, these applications can correlate enough datapoints to assemble the full set of <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information (PII)</a> about the user. This PII can divulge highly sensitive information about the user, such as medical history, personal finance, employment, social relationships and so on. Usually, this type of PII is information the user would prefer to remain private (at least outside of the context in which they want it to be used). On top of that, the user is at risk of those applications storing the information indefinitely, selling it to other organizations, or having it exposed through a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>.</p>



<p>So, in our digital lives, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’ is really talking about compartmentalization—categorizing and separating our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal data</a> into many different compartments to reduce the impact when it is compromised. Compartmentalization recognizes no system is perfect, breaches are always possible, so it’s wise to manage the risk. You might lose an egg or two, but you won’t lose them all.</p>



<p>Compartmentalization is widely regarded as the most powerful way to protect personal information. It means limiting access to information to only those people or organizations who need it in order to perform a certain task or function. Originating in the military with classified information, the concept can be further understood with another military term: ‘managing the blast radius’. In information security, compartmentalization is equally about spreading the risk so if there’s any impact (breach) we’ve limited the damage to our personal information and the harm and recovery effort are far less.</p>



<p>We already compartmentalize in the offline world. We organize our closets (socks in one drawer, gym clothes in another), our banking (separate accounts for everyday expenses, bills, savings and emergencies), and our email (filed in folders). We even compartmentalize our daily interactions (work/social) and our weekend activities (social engagements vs. family time). Compartmentalization in the online world is essentially the same—but arguably far more urgent.</p>



<p>Compartmentalization gives people control.Our digital privacy can feel as fragile as those eggs, but we can act to protect it in much the same way by separating our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a> into different compartments and limiting impact.</p>



<p>MySudo app makes compartmentalization simple.The <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a> app is based on the concept of a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identity</a> that allows users to talk, text, email, browse and pay privately and securely. A Sudo is a customizable digital identity that intentionally differentiates from a user’s legal identity and mitigates the risk to that user’s highly sensitive PII.</p>



<p>We all have many online accounts, and when we repeatedly use the same personal information to access these accounts, they become linked together. If a breach occurs on just one of those accounts, all our other accounts and their associated data are also at risk of being compromised.</p>



<p>Users can create up to <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">nine different Sudos</a> and use them in any context (e.g. for banking, selling on classifieds, catching up with friends, and booking travel). MySudo is compartmentalization at its simplest and best.</p>

 What Fortnite’s Darth Vader Reveals About the Future of AI NPCs 



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite?lang=en-US">Fortnite made headlines by introducing a voice-interactive Darth Vader NPC powered by AI</a>. Using advanced voice synthesis and language models, players could speak directly to Vader and receive real-time, dynamic responses. While groundbreaking, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-risks-potential-disney-epic-games-2025-5">this move also sparked debate</a>, especially around voice actor rights, AI safety, and content moderation.</p>



<p>At Union Avatars, we’ve been working on similar AI-powered NPCs in collaboration with NVIDIA, but with a core difference: we’re building tools designed to empower creators and companies to ethically bring avatars to life.</p>



 A New Era for NPCs 



<p>Through our partnership with NVIDIA ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine), we’re enabling developers to transform any 3D character into an intelligent, interactive NPC with:</p>



 
 Conversational AI that responds naturally and contextually 



 Custom 3D avatars, created from a selfie or designed from scratch 



 Real-time voice and animation, powered by NVIDIA’s Audio2Face technologies 
 



<p>Whether you’re building a game, a virtual store, or an educational platform, our tech makes it easy to create lifelike NPCs that feel truly human.</p>



 What Makes Our Approach Different? 



<p>Unlike the Darth Vader case, where concerns have been raised about replacing voice actors and lack of control over AI behavior, we focus on creator control, transparency, and ethical deployment. Here’s how:</p>



 
 Consent and custom voice options: use your own voice or synthetic voices with full permissions 



 Full behavior control: define what your NPC can or can’t say, with safe and brand-aligned prompts 



 No-code setup: our AI NPC system is accessible to both developers and creative teams 
 



 The Future of NPCs Is Here 



<p>We believe AI-powered avatars are not just a trend, they’re a new creative frontier. Whether it’s a helpful shop assistant in a virtual store or a or a front desk assistant in a hotel, Union Avatars is building the tools to make them possible.</p>



<p>Want to see it in action?</p>



 

 



 Ready to Build Smarter NPCs? 



<p>With Union Avatars and NVIDIA ACE, the future of interactive characters is already here. Whether you’re creating games, virtual worlds, or branded experiences, we give you the tools to bring AI-powered avatars to life ethically, creatively, and at scale.</p>

<p>When it comes to compliance, decentralization is changing the game. As regulations tighten and cyber threats grow, financial institutions are turning to innovations like edge computing, self-sovereign digital identity (SSI), and AI-powered transaction monitoring with blockchain-secured logs to protect sensitive data and streamline KYC, KYB, and AML processes.</p>



<p>These technologies make compliance not only stronger but smarter—here’s how they’re reshaping the future of risk management.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 1. Edge Computing: Secure Data at the Source 



<p>Traditional compliance systems transmit customer data to multiple cloud servers and subprocessors—introducing risks along the way.</p>



<p>Edge computing eliminates those vulnerabilities by encrypting and verifying data directly on the user’s device or at a local edge node before it’s ever transmitted. This means:</p>



 
 Minimal data exposure: Sensitive information never travels further than it needs to. 



 Faster processing: Verification happens in real-time, cutting down delays in customer onboarding. 



 Built-in compliance: Local data processing aligns with regulations like GDPR and CCPA by keeping data within jurisdictional boundaries. 
 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 2. Self-Sovereign Digital Identity: Empowering Customers and Reducing Risk 



<p>SSI puts customers in control of their own verified identity data. Instead of handing over unnecessary personal information during onboarding, customers share only what’s needed through secure, verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>For compliance teams, this means:</p>



 
 Less liability: No need to store excessive customer data, reducing your exposure in the event of a breach. 



 Enhanced verification: SSI credentials are cryptographically secure and harder to forge. 



 Better customer experience: Clients appreciate the transparency and convenience of sharing verified information without repeated forms or unnecessary data requests. 
 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 3. AI-Powered Transaction Monitoring and Blockchain-Secured Logs 



<p>Blockchain-secured transaction logs provide an immutable, transparent record of transactions, while AI-powered monitoring enhances fraud detection. Instead of static or batch reviews, AI scans blockchain-based records in real-time to:</p>



 
 Identify complex transaction patterns that signal money laundering. 



 Flag connections to sanctioned individuals or flagged entities. 



 Analyze historical and current data simultaneously to detect trends, not just single red flags. 
 



<p>The combination of blockchain’s tamper-proof nature and AI’s processing power strengthens audit trails and improves AML screening accuracy without increasing manual workloads.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 The Decentralized Advantage 



<p>Edge computing ensures that data stays local. SSI reduces your liability footprint by decentralizing identity control. AI-powered monitoring transforms static reports into proactive, real-time risk detection. Together, these innovations make compliance faster, more secure, and more customer-friendly—without compromising on privacy or performance.</p>



<p>Decentralization isn’t just the future of compliance—it’s happening now. With iComply’s platform, you can embrace these innovations to strengthen your KYC, KYB, and AML processes. Let’s lead the way to a more secure, decentralized future.</p>

				  Indicio’s decentralized identity technology supports the broadest range of open standards, credential formats, and communication protocols to facilitate global interoperability.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>As more governments step into the world of digital credentials, the Mobile Driver’s Licence (mDL), is emerging as the first credential that many people will likely carry in their digital wallets. But a digital driver’s license isn’t the whole journey when it comes to digital identity: It’s just one of many different digital credentials that we’ll use to prove who we are and to share data in a verifiable, tamper-proof way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-offers-a-variety-of-verifiable-credential-protocols-tools-and-building-blocks/">Indicio supports the widest possible range</a> of open standards, credential formats, and advanced communication protocols for deploying decentralized identity: SD-JWT, W3C Verifiable Credentials, AnonCreds, JSON-LD, Open Badges 3.0,&nbsp; DIDComm, OID4VC, and yes, mDL.</p>
<p>Because real-world identity isn’t a single road. It’s a map of different paths, winding through industries, ecosystems, and use cases.</p>
<p>Here, we explain why mdoc/mDL is joining the list of technologies supported in the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>® technology stack.</p>
 mdoc/mDL 
<p>A Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) is a type of document that resides on a mobile device, generically known as an mdoc. Thus, an mDL is a particular type of mdoc, one that enables the attributes of a driver’s license to be held on a mobile device in a machine-readable way. The mDL is specified by the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021</a> standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently, 30 U.S. states <a href="https://www.aamva.org/jurisdiction-data-maps#anchorformdlmap">have implemented or are implementing</a> mDLs. In March 2025, the European Union’s Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20250324IPR27462/road-safety-deal-for-modern-eu-driving-licence-rules">mandated</a> a uniform mobile driving licence that will work with EU-specified digital wallets by 2030.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of an mDL include:</p>
 
 Improved security: Each time you present an mDL for verification, it generates a new cryptographic presentation of the data.&nbsp; 
 Interoperability: As an mDL follows the international mdoc standard, it can be used across states and countries. All mDLs have the same data structure and are verified in the same way. A <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202505/new-zealand-integrates-international-mdls-for-age-id-verification">recent example of the mDL’s interoperability</a> comes from New Zealand’s NZ Verify App, which enables mDL credentials issued from a growing list of regions to be verified. 
 Offline availability: An mDL is designed to be either presented online or in person using Bluetooth Low Energy or NFC for “tap &amp; go,” “scan &amp; request,” or “tap &amp; hold” interactions with an electronic mDL reader, which allows an mDL to be verified without either party needing to be online. 
 Privacy: The mDL allows data in the license to be selectively disclosed, so you can share just your age or address, for example, without revealing anything else. 
 
<p>One peculiarity: part of the mDL spec ensures that issuers —&nbsp;governmenst — can’t see where licenses are being verified, so a specific holder can’t be tracked and profiled; but, another part of the spec also makes this possible, so user privacy is dependent on how a specific mDL instance is implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 When an mDL/mdoc isn’t the best fit 
<p>If your identity authentication needs require more information than that contained in a driver’s license, then you need to use Verifiable Credentials (VC). These&nbsp; can be configured to hold different kinds of data in a tamper-proof way, including biometrics, and can use secure communication protocols for semantically rich interaction between credential holders, issuers, and verifiers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you can create a digital equivalent of a passport with a Verifiable Credential, and you can integrate that with other credentials (such as a visa and boarding pass credential) to share more complex data. An mDL is and always will be just a driver’s license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mdoc format does not have the same flexibility in terms of data formats or communication protocols. If you are a school district issuing staff IDs or a company setting up passwordless login, Verifiable Credentials are a better option. Similarly, if you want to issue diplomas or certificates, the Open Badges 3.0 format meets these specific needs best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mdoc/mDL is also a comparatively complex technical specification to implement, whereas a simple VC solution can be up and running in hours and a country-level deployment can be implemented in a few weeks.</p>
 One credential will not rule them all 
<p>We’re not moving toward a world where one credential will rule all use cases. We’re heading toward a world where different credentials work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments are issuing mDLs but they will also issue digital passport credentials (ICAO DTC Type 2 credentials). Many organizations will want to implement DIDComm to take advantage of secure communication with credential holders, or they may choose to use OID4VC to take advantage of their existing authentication protocols.</p>
<p>Each use case brings its own needs for implementation, interoperability, privacy, simplicity, and usability.</p>
 Indicio connects digital identities 
<p>Indicio was the<a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/"> first to successfully combine</a> two key global credential formats and protocols in a single workflow for international travel: DTC Type 1 using AnonCreds and DIDComm and IATA One ID using OID4VC.</p>
<p>Now, we’re adding mdoc/mDL to our stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re committed to giving our customers the best solution for their needs and to making that solution interoperable.</p>
<p>Whether you’re just getting started or already deep into development, we’re here to help you choose the right specifications and credentials for your project—and make sure they work seamlessly with everything else.</p>

			<p>Luxembourg &amp; San Salvador, El Salvador, 27 May 2025 – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading provider of onchain finance solutions, has been selected by <a href="https://ditobanx.com/">Ditobanx</a>, a licensed Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in El Salvador, to facilitate the successful launch of <a href="https://www.coingt.com/">COINGT</a>, a $325 million tokenized infrastructure initiative.</p>
<p>Backed by shares in the Interoceanic Corridor of Guatemala (CIG), the token represents a major milestone in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and sets a new standard for blockchain-driven infrastructure financing in Latin America.</p>
<p>The launch of COINGT was carried out under <a href="https://cnad.gob.sv/es/issuances/">the regulatory approval</a> of the National Digital Assets Commission of El Salvador, leveraging the country’s forward-thinking legal framework for digital assets.</p>

		 
	 
    Every market is different, and local leadership is essential. This launch is a perfect example: we provide the technology, while Ditobanx brings the regulatory expertise, market access, and everything else needed to make tokenization work smoothly. Latin America has huge potential, and infrastructure is the foundation for its growth. By making financing more accessible, Ditobanx is accelerating regional development in a way that was previously out of reach.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>CIG is a transformative infrastructure project connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through a 372-kilometer corridor. The initiative includes two deep-sea ports, a double-track railway, a hydrocarbon pipeline, and large-scale industrial and logistics zones. Designed to position Guatemala as a key logistics and energy hub, the project is expected to have significant economic and social impact across Central America.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenization opens up financial access. Infrastructure financing has long been inaccessible to many, especially in developing regions. Through COINGT, we’re enabling local and international investors to participate in a transformative project that will reshape trade, logistics, and opportunity across Central America.  Guillermo ContrerasCEO of Ditobanx    
	 
		 
			<p>El Salvador is moving beyond Bitcoin headlines and quietly building the first regulated digital asset economy in the region. With Ditobanx as a licensed DASP and Tokeny providing the white-label and institutional-grade onchain finance operating system, COINGT demonstrates how regulatory clarity, onchain compliance, and local operators can work together to bring real-world tokenization to life. It offers a blueprint for how other emerging markets can unlock capital through compliant tokenization innovation.</p>

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Ditobanx 
<p>Ditobanx is a digital financial solutions company dedicated to transforming the way individuals and businesses interact with their finances. With a strong presence in Latin America and plans for expansion, Ditobanx continues to innovate to provide the best financial tools on the market.</p>

<p>This is the final post in a four-part series exploring decentralization not as a buzzword, but as a series of hard tradeoffs that digital infrastructure teams, architects, and strategy leads must navigate.</p>



 
 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a>, we explored why resilience depends on the ability to shift between centralized and decentralized systems, not cling to one model. 



 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/13/the-cost-of-decentralization/">How Decentralized Are You Willing to Pay For?</a>, we talked about the very real costs of optionality: complexity, coordination, and duplicated capabilities. 



 And in <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/20/redefining-success/">Redefining Success</a>, we looked at why our success metrics often reinforce centralization—even when it’s no longer serving us. 
 



<p>So if we know decentralization has value, and we know it’s technically feasible… why does it still fail in practice?<br>Because the tech might be ready, but governance is lagging behind. This makes sense because governance means politics, and politics are hard.</p>



 Decentralization Doesn’t Mean Disorder 



<p>Most enterprise folks hear “decentralization” and think:</p>



 
 Increased risk 



 Lack of visibility 



 Slower coordination 



 No one in charge when something breaks 
 



<p>But that’s not a property of decentralization; it’s a symptom of missing or immature governance.</p>



<p>We see this all the time in digital identity:</p>



 
 A federation that works technically, but has no process for resolving disputes 



 A wallet ecosystem that’s privacy-preserving, but can’t agree on what metadata is mandatory 



 An access system that’s delegated, but lacks revocation mechanisms that everyone honors 
 



<p>If you’re a technologist, this probably sounds familiar. Governance gaps show up as operational issues: broken policy syncs, inconsistent audit trails, revocation flows that only work in theory. If your service mesh or access broker assumes everyone interprets “suspend access” the same way—but no one agreed on what that means—you’ve built an elegant mess.</p>



<p>When decentralization fails, it’s often not because the protocols were bad. It’s because we didn’t define who gets to decide, update, delegate, or enforce—and under what terms.</p>



 Governance Is Infrastructure 



<p>If decentralization is the design pattern, governance is the scaffolding.</p>



<p>And here’s the important part: we already know how to build decentralized tech. The internet itself is built on decentralized protocols: DNS, BGP, email, and even identity federations. We have working models. We know how to distribute trust and authority technically.</p>



<p>What’s missing isn’t architecture, it’s agreement.</p>



<p>We can make it happen at scale. But without governance, decentralization becomes friction, not flexibility.</p>



<p>Governance defines:</p>



 
 Who holds authority 



 How power shifts over time 



 What happens when participants disagree 



 How trust is established and withdrawn 
 



<p>For CIOs and digital strategy leaders, it’s a core risk management issue. Weak governance delays implementation. It also increases legal exposure, regulatory risk, and recovery costs when things go wrong. It makes vendor transitions expensive. And it turns architecture decisions into lock-in faster than most teams realize.</p>



<p>In enterprise environments, we already know how to manage distributed control.</p>



 
 We decentralize org charts … with reporting lines, SLAs, and escalation paths 



 We allow teams to own systems … within shared standards and budgets 



 We outsource critical functions … with contracts and enforcement mechanisms 
 



<p>We don’t expect everyone to act independently. We expect them to act accountably within a structure.<br>I think we should treat digital infrastructure the same way.</p>



 Examples Worth Learning From 



<p>Across the identity and trust space, we’re starting to see governance taken seriously as more than a compliance exercise. It’s a strategic enabler for an organization.</p>



 
 The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/get-involved/working-group-activity/">Trust Over IP Foundation’s Governance Stack Working Group</a> is actively developing models and interoperability standards for governance frameworks that support legal, business, and social trust. Their work includes templates and specifications for governance architecture, trust assurance, and certification—tools that make decentralized systems both usable and accountable. 



 Projects like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/scitt/about/">SCITT</a> at the IETF are tackling supply chain integrity by designing trust architectures that include not just technical assertions, but clear governance of who can issue, verify, and rely on those assertions. 



 Wallet ecosystems are (slowly) recognizing that success will depend not just on cryptography, but on common rules for inclusion, suspension, and dispute resolution. 
 



<p>If you work in identity, you’ve probably seen this up close: great protocols with no shared process for trust anchors, no agreement on metadata, no real mechanism for shared accountability. We don’t need another working group (says someone who loves to manage working groups). We need rules for when and how trust changes.</p>



<p>Identity professionals often sit closest to the tension and are best positioned to help shape how governance gets built. If you’re part of IAM, you’re part of the governance problem and the solution. Don’t wait for someone else to define the structure you’ll be bound by later.</p>



 What Governance in Decentralization Means for Your Team 



<p>If you’re building toward decentralization, whether in authentication, cloud strategy, data sharing, or infrastructure, ask yourself:</p>



 
 Who gets to define the rules of engagement? 



 What happens when two participants disagree? 



 How does a new participant join—and how can they be removed? 



 Are you solving the governance questions before the technical ones lock you in? 
 



<p>The hard part isn’t building the system—again, we kind of know how to do that—but deciding who can change it later.</p>



 Final Thought: Governance Is Not Overhead, It’s Capability 



<p>If you take only one thing from this series, let it be this: Resilience isn’t just a technical attribute. It’s a governance capability.</p>



<p>I’ve spent this series talking about how to shift, how much flexibility costs, and what we’re incentivized to build. But none of that matters if no one agrees on how to share control when it counts.</p>



<p>The good news? Governance is designable. It doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to be intentional, so decentralization becomes a strength, not a source of uncertainty.</p>



<p>Because when the tech is ready but the governance isn’t, you don’t have a distributed system. You have a political standoff, and nothing gets done.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hey everybody. Welcome back. This is the third episode in our series on centralization and decentralization and the balance between the two.</p>



<p>If you’re just tuning in now, here’s what you’ve missed:</p>



 
 In episode one, we explored why resilience isn’t about being centralized or decentralized. It’s about being able to move between the two models when circumstances change. 



 In episode two, we looked at the real cost of building that kind of flexibility. Because optionality isn’t free. It takes planning, coordination, and a willingness to invest before you need it. 
 



 



 Why Is Decentralization Often a Hard Sell? 



<p>[00:01:01]<br>And that brings us to today’s topic. Why is decentralization often still such a hard sell, especially inside enterprises?</p>



<p>[00:01:09]<br>One answer is that most of our success metrics reward centralization.</p>



<p>[00:01:15]<br>If we don’t challenge how we’re defining success, we’re going to keep optimizing for systems that look great—right up until the point that they don’t.</p>



 



 Centralization and Scale 



<p>[00:01:22]<br>Let’s talk about that in tech. We don’t just love things at scale; we know how to do things at scale fairly well.</p>



<p>[00:01:31]<br>When we’re working with centralized systems, we know the playbook:</p>



 
 Throw more hardware at it 



 Replicate the databases 



 Spin things up in other regions 



 Set up failovers, caching, and routing magic to absorb traffic 
 



<p>And that totally works—up to a point. Even when control is centralized, we’re very good at scaling the infrastructure around it.</p>



<p>[00:01:50]<br>When it comes to decentralized models, we know how to do that too. We just don’t plan that way as often.</p>



<p>[00:01:56]<br>At least not anymore. Think about the protocols from the early days of the Internet: DNS, BGP, SMTP. They’re not flawless or simple, but they work at global scale because they were built to distribute control and survive failure.</p>



<p>[00:02:14]<br>Everyone gets a piece of the responsibilities in those protocols. Everyone can operate within a shared structure. That’s decentralized centralization, and we did it really well.</p>



 



 The Problem with Success Metrics 



<p>[00:02:25]<br>But now, today’s challenge: most of the success metrics we use today, especially in enterprise systems, still push us towards centralization.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>Why? Because it looks faster, is easier to explain, and is a lot easier to report on.</p>



<p>[00:02:40]<br>But when success is only measured by how tightly we can control the system, we end up building architectures that aren’t particularly flexible. And that’s a problem.</p>



 



 Centralization Helped Us Grow—But Does It Still? 



<p>[00:02:49]<br>Now let’s step back for a moment. You might be thinking, “Well, yes, but centralization is what helped us grow as a company, helped us grow at speed.” And yes, you are absolutely right. Centralization often is what helps organizations move fast, simplify complexity, and work at scale. It gives you:</p>



 
 Clean handoffs 



 Predictable systems 



 Fewer moving parts 



 Optimized performance without needing to get everyone to agree on everything 
 



<p>And when you’re trying to move quickly, those things are real advantages.</p>



<p>[00:03:19]<br>But the thing is, those advantages—whether from your infrastructure perspective or your market perspective—don’t last forever.</p>



<p>[00:03:30]<br>Markets might shift, regulations might change, vendor lock-in might become a liability, and the systems that helped you grow start to hold you back.</p>



<p>[00:03:40]<br>There’s a great idea from supply chain strategy that applies here: the faster your environment moves, the more important it becomes to reconfigure quickly.</p>



<p>[00:03:48]<br>And that’s where centralized success starts to crack—not because it failed technically, but because it couldn’t adapt fast enough.</p>



<p>[00:03:56]<br>So the question isn’t, “Didn’t centralization help us grow?” It’s, “Can we keep growing without the ability to be a little bit more flexible?”</p>



 



 Decentralization in Organizations 



<p>[00:04:07]<br>It’s kind of funny—we decentralize all the time, but just not when it comes to our infrastructure and definitely not our identity infrastructures.</p>



<p>Inside organizations, we break up control and distribute responsibility on purpose:</p>



 
 Teams have their own budgets 



 Product groups make roadmap decisions 



 Key performance indicators are set at the department level, not just at the company level 
 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Why? Because trying to control everything from the top down slows you down. It’s more sustainable to align goals than to micromanage every function.</p>



<p>Take a typical enterprise product org as an example. One team focuses on mobile, another on partner integrations, a third on internal tooling. Each team moves independently within shared priorities. They don’t all escalate to the CIO to push code; they’re trusted to make decisions locally based on their goals and context. We don’t call that chaos—we call that autonomy and maturity.</p>



<p>[00:05:05]<br>Think of it like a city: every neighborhood has its own character, maybe its own rules, but they follow the same traffic lights, zoning laws, public services. That’s decentralization with coordination.</p>



<p>[00:05:17]<br>The control, to an extent, is distributed. If we can do this with people and even in governments—if we can handle distributed authority in complex orgs—why does decentralizing infrastructure sometimes feel so risky? It’s not because we can’t do it. It’s because we haven’t applied the same thinking to systems that we apply to teams of people.</p>



 



 Building Flexibility into Identity 



<p>[00:05:42]<br>If centralization has been our default version of success, what does success look like when you build in the flexibility to decentralize?</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>It doesn’t mean blowing up your current architecture, because that would probably be bad and you wouldn’t get very far.</p>



<p>[00:05:56]<br>It doesn’t mean ditching your identity provider or rebuilding everything from scratch, because that also wouldn’t make you very popular and probably wouldn’t get you very far. But it does mean designing for modularity and movement.</p>



<p>[00:06:07]<br>A successful, flexible identity system might include:</p>



 
 Federated logins that work across partners but don’t collapse if one party changes their trust model 



 Credential issuance that’s anchored to your core directory but usable outside your domain 



 Policy enforcement that supports delegation, so different teams or regions can adapt without rewriting global configurations 



 Flexible authentication layers that can shift to support new protocols without breaking legacy systems 
 



<p>[00:06:42]<br>Another good example of flexible identity systems that don’t require a centralized focus.</p>



<p>[00:06:49]<br>Ask yourself in your organization:</p>



 
 Can you change identity providers without breaking logins for 50,000 users? 



 Can you delegate trust without rerouting everything through one central system? 
 



<p>[00:07:03]<br>Are you prepared to adapt when legal or business requirements shift, or will you end up frozen and need to make a plan on the fly?</p>



<p>[00:07:14]<br>Being able to say “yes” to those things—that’s what success with flexibility looks like.</p>



 



 Key Takeaways 



<p>[00:07:25]<br>You don’t have to decentralize everything—and probably shouldn’t. But if your architecture can accommodate controlled divergence and flexibility, you’re set up for long-term success.</p>



<p>[00:07:43]<br>That’s what matters. That’s what’s really cool.</p>



<p>[00:07:46]<br>Here’s the takeaway from today.</p>



<p>[00:07:50]<br>Centralization isn’t the enemy. But if success only counts as scale, simplicity, or speed, that story can get brittle quickly.</p>



<p>[00:08:03]<br>We already know how to decentralize in our org charts and delegate decisions without chaos. We just haven’t always brought that thinking into our infrastructure and identity systems—but we could.</p>



<p>[00:08:15]<br>Success doesn’t have to mean one system to rule them all. It can mean systems that adapt without starting over. That adaptability only works when you’ve got governance built in to support it.</p>



<p>[00:08:30]<br>Our technology is almost good enough—sometimes more than good enough. But shared control takes more than configuration files. It takes structure, accountability, and intention.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>[00:08:53]<br>And remember, resilient systems don’t just run well—they recover well and grow on purpose.</p>

<p>Are you curious to know about the Fake ID Checkers and their role in shaping the future of identity verification? If yes! This comprehensive blog post is for you.”</p>
<p>In this age, when there is a large number of methods to prevent fraud, <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-verification-playground/">Fake ID scanners</a> have enhanced productivity at work. These scanners, being utilized by many agencies and other institutions controlling the finance.</p>
<p>However, did you ever think, how these scanners work? What is the key technology behind them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as our doubt goes, you will respond, No!. To convert your no into a yes, we have created this comprehensive blog post for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buckle up! You have to read this guide comprehensively…..</p>
 What are Fake ID Checkers? 
<p>After reading this name, you would have understood their purpose. Fake ID scanners are online digital tools that are used to determine whether the ID documents presented by users are real or fake. These scanners are used for the <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID document recognition SDK</a>.</p>
<p>Driven by sophisticated algorithms, these tools are not immune to committing errors. They always provide you with accurate results. When it comes to facial ID recognition, these detectors have brightened the future of this innovative technology used for security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Technologies Behind the Fake ID Checkers 
<p>Now, it’s time to reveal how these ID scanners play their role in ID document liveness detection SDK. We will introduce you to some technologies behind them.</p>
 1. Optical Character Recognition 
<p>If you are in the ocean of technology, you must have heard about this cutting-edge innovation. Basically, OCR is about extracting text from images and other documents within a few seconds, optimizing the workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fake ID Scanners are integrated to this technology. When ID documents are represented to these scanners, they effectively extract their engraved text for further verification. After this extraction, the system ensures their realness or fakeness and marks these documents for further processing.</p>
<p>So, let’s have a very simple question: Have you ever heard about this innovative technology, OCR? Don’t forget to tell….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Facial ID Recognition 
<p>A critical part of the confirmation procedure is matching the face on the document with the person presenting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facial ID recognition technology compares the photo on the ID with a live selfie or video of the user. Advanced systems use liveness detection to ensure the selfie isn’t a photo or video replay, minimizing deceiving efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This biometric authentication step adds a layer of security, especially for digital platforms that don’t have a physical presence to manually inspect IDs. In combination with document analysis, facial ID recognition offers a holistic approach to identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Deeper Analysis of Documents 
<p>Fake ID checkers go beyond superficial examination. They analyze fake ID verification documents for deeper inconsistencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the system might look at fonts, spacing, data alignment, and metadata embedded in document barcodes. If something seems off, like a date of birth that doesn’t match the facial features or a document format that’s inconsistent with government-issued patterns, the forged ID checker flags the document as doubtful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. AI And Machine Learning 
<p>These scanners are responsible for real-time and quick response, spreading the fragrance of AI and ML, and their sophisticated algorithms. Isn’t it great that you are combining many technologies and making a bunch of the first line of defence against fraud? Amazing……</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Using a Fake ID Checker 
<p>Now, you would probably be thinking, what are the benefits of using these fake ID scanners in the ID document recognition SDK? Don’t worry, just read this section carefully….</p>
 
 Accuracy: To err is human, not such tools. As hinted previously, these tools integrate AI and ML algorithms, ensuring the fastest and precise results. 
 Scalability: If we talk about handling a large amount of data related to facial recognition ID, these scanners show their unbelievable magic in enhancing security. 
 Real-time verification: Not only for one or two hours, but these tools will provide you with the same accurate results in real-time. So, time does’t matter, just fucking the manipulating attempts of criminals very badly. 
 Risk reduction: After reading the previous headings, you would have understood their role in reducing the risks of document leakage and destruction by cyber criminals.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 Industries Leading the Way 
<p>Several sectors are already gaining the benefits of progressive fake ID verification systems:</p>
 
 Financial Services: Banks and fintech companies use fake ID checkers to onboard customers, issue loans, and prevent fraud.&nbsp; 
 E-Commerce &amp; Marketplaces: Platforms confirm sellers and buyers to build trust and combat identity fraud.&nbsp; 
 Travel and Hospitality: Hotels and airlines use ID document recognition SDKs for continuous check-ins.&nbsp; 
 Online Gaming and Adult Services: Age-restricted platforms use facial ID recognition and document scanning to impose legal age limits. 
 
<p></p>

 BC 101 #5: Decentralized by Design — The Case for a VC-Free&nbsp;Future <p>In today’s crypto landscape, success is often measured by two metrics: exchange listings and token price performance. While these milestones can drive early attention, fundraising, and short-term engagement, they rarely guarantee meaningful long-term growth.</p><p>In fact, this structure often works against real innovation.</p> The Speculation Trap <p>The pressure to perform in public markets comes too early for many projects. As soon as a token is listed, price volatility becomes a distraction — if not a full-blown liability. Founders start chasing marketing campaigns instead of shipping updates. Teams stretch themselves thin juggling price optics, exchange negotiations, and community expectations, all while the original product roadmap collects&nbsp;dust.</p><p>This is not a bug in the system. It’s how the system was designed. Token-first strategies demand hype. Hype demands liquidity. And liquidity means listings, speculation, and the pressure to constantly “perform” for the market, often before a real product is even&nbsp;live.</p> Enter HPP: A Product-First Ecosystem <p>That’s where the House Party Protocol (HPP) offers a radically different approach.</p><p>HPP isn’t about launching speculative tokens or inflating valuations based on whitepapers and hype. Instead, it integrates post-VC or low-VC projects with proven traction and a shared commitment to sustainable, long-term growth.</p><p>By joining a network where the foundational infrastructure, exchange presence, and liquidity already exist, projects can skip the exhausting “token launch treadmill” and get back to what matters most: building.</p> Build Without the&nbsp;Noise <p>In the HPP model, speculative distractions are removed from the equation. There’s no need for immediate exchange listings or retail hype cycles. Each participating project either already has a listed token or operates without a massive VC pool waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>More importantly, token distributions within HPP follow a milestone-based vesting schedule, not arbitrary cliffs or backdoor unlocks. This ensures long-term alignment between builders, the community, and the ecosystem as a whole. There are just clear incentives to keep building.</p><p>For projects like Booost and VaaSBlock, instead of chasing token listings or short-term price spikes, they’re now focused squarely on delivering real products. They no longer need to divert resources to activities that don’t serve their core mission, freeing them to follow through on their original&nbsp;vision.</p><p>This is not just a technical detail. It’s a structural advantage. HPP was designed to prioritize execution over speculation, reflecting that in its governance, partnerships, and tokenomics.</p> A Model for the Next Crypto&nbsp;Cycle <p>If past bull markets were driven by ICOs, airdrops, and token-fueled speculation, the next phase of crypto will be defined by something much harder to achieve: resilience, credibility, and aligned incentives. HPP is building for that future and quietly leading the&nbsp;way.</p><p>This is where the House Party Protocol (HPP) stands&nbsp;apart.</p><p>HPP isn’t just decentralized in its technology — it’s decentralized by design. From its architecture to its governance and tokenomics, everything is structured to prevent any single entity from gaining outsized control. Even the core team’s tokens are locked for years and overseen by an independent, trusted custodian. No hidden agendas. No silent insiders.</p><p>In an industry that often treats “decentralization” as a branding tool, HPP is one of the few ecosystems where it’s structurally enforced. It’s not a slogan. It’s a principle.</p><p>HPP isn’t just another Layer 2. It’s a blueprint for a more sustainable crypto economy where product, progress, and purpose matter. And in this new phase of crypto, that might be the only bet worth&nbsp;making.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-5-decentralized-by-design-the-case-for-a-vc-free-future-c588eb7f555f">BC 101 #5: Decentralized by Design — The Case for a VC-Free Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There’s been a recent rush of excitement on LinkedIn about the vividness of the latest animations generated by image transformers.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/endritrestelica_theyre-alive-they-want-to-break-free-activity-7331305659461775360-aqVJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAEKC0Bds7FIlLqgMqnFUp3lCDrHqtG_M0">film clip with vividly realistic robots</a>, in various states of terrible helplessness, bemoaning the prompts that led to their dire situations. I think it’s just an amusing recursive take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall">Fourth Wall</a>, or a variation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands">M.C. Escher’s famous Dra</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands">wing Hands</a> that draw themselves into existence.</p>
<p>But in many of the LinkedIn comments, people are seeing signs of robots becoming self-aware.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphism is bad enough with Large Language Models, but with image transformers, it might get completely out of hand—like the way very early cinema goers ran screaming from the theatre, convinced a locomotive was about to burst out of the screen and plough into the crowd. This is a new and deeper level of the Deep Fake problem. Even when smart people know the moving images are software generated, they tend to think the animations are real.</p>
<p>I’m calling for “cognitive calm”. Let’s try to unsuspend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">disbelief</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to underestimate the importance of image transformers and the dizzying rate of progress. I just want people to remember that with all AI today, “it’s just a model”.</p>
<p>As I understand them, image transformers are like LLMs; they are both pattern extrapolation machines.</p>
<p>LLMs are sometimes poo-poohed for “merely” completing sentences. That’s a bit of a simplification but the jibe does capture the essential mindlessness of neural network AI models.</p>
<p>The truth is that the output of any LLM-based generator is an evidence-based prediction of how a passage of text is going to continue, in a way that is consistent with the prompt. Today’s trained LLMs reflect trillions of pieces of text sampled from the wild, from which are inferred deep statistical patterns, sufficient to generate sensible strings of sentences. The LLMs not only follow the rules of syntax and grammar but also follow stylistic conventions and other patterns found in the training text. Hence the name language model — it’s an empirical mechanical representation of how real-world text is constructed.</p>
<p>So, if sufficient writers happen to have described different aspects of the behaviour of blue coloured birds in winter, the LLM will be able to string together a fair number of sentences that are consistent with the whole of the body of work it has ingested. Throw in some randomness so the writing isn’t overly repetitive, some feedback loops and unwritten prompts about beginnings, middles and ends, and the result looks like a polished story which embodies the wealth of written experience on the subject.</p>
<p>Just as language transformers make predictions of sensible text passages based on patterns extracted from real life writing, vision transformers predict how things should probably look in brand new images, based on patterns in real world pictures.</p>
<p>AI is certainly amazing at generating reasonable images of complex things and interactions. Yet the properties and relationships of things are not perceived or deduced by these models or understood in any way. The exercise is not to model causality but only appearances.</p>
<p>None of the generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) simulate anything. There is no abstraction of real-world phenomena in mathematical equations; rather, there is merely a probabilistic calculation what things should look or sound like.</p>
<p>Consider what’s going on when an image model is trained on an apple falling from a tree (or rather, on billions of clips of similar objects moving under similar circumstances). Videos are digitised and coded to create arrays of data, which are fed into the neural net and crunched together with other arrays. Patterns in the data result in the iterative refining of a net’s constituent interconnections and weights, which collectively come to instantiate what’s been “learned” from the training. When similar patterns recur in the inputs, reinforcement results and certain weights are boosted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s tempting to think that such an AI has learned the laws of physics through observation, but all it’s doing is establishing the statistics of how series of arrays of data tend to develop in particular ways. And so, based on its training, the image model can be prompted to calculate a sequence of arrays of reasonable data values to follow from some starting condition.</p>
<p>The AI is unaware that the array data structures were earlier designed by engineers to codify the intensity and wavelength of light sampled at different points by a two-dimensional camera sensor, and furthermore, that the sequencing of the arrays correspond to constant time intervals. &nbsp;The AI doesn’t know that cameras are themselves models of the human retina. &nbsp;It doesn’t have to know that, because it’s not watching a video—it’s only crunching data. An altogether different agent later on gets to experience the value arrays as periods of vision in which an apple is falling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The image transformer has no more understanding of physics than an LLM has of the human condition. Sure, ChatGPT might be able compose a vivid story with compelling characters we identity with, to the extent it might even make us cry, but only after ingesting billions of arrangements of adjectives, nouns and verbs which were earlier designed by artists to evoke the emotional response.</p>
<p>If we feed an image model enough video with fruit and objects in motion, then we can prompt it to compute a string of arrays containing patterns that happen to correspond to what a falling apple looks like. Likewise, if a model is trained on millions of hours of humans going about their business, it will be able to generate patterns of pixels which to us&nbsp;look like other people talking and laughing, sharing a joke, or even doing something as complex as flirting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The stuff of any neural network, whether it’s designed for language or vision, is nothing but interconnects and weights. It happens that some configurations of interconnects and weights can be mapped by humans onto real world features—patterns of lights and sounds—with which we identify. &nbsp;But the model is only learning past patterns and extrapolating new ones.</p>
<p>There are no rules in the worlds which are modelled by these AIs—only statistics. We’ve probably all seen AI-generated images where hands have shifting numbers of fingers and people walk through walls. I appreciate the models are getting better but all the same, these sorts of errors illuminate exactly what it is that’s being modelled—and it was never understanding.</p>
<p>When an AI model for example predicts how a child will respond to a parent in some situation, verbally or visually, it has computed a lot of numbers which correspond to images and/or words which in turn seem sensible to us humans. Strictly speaking, it’s only a coincidence when the AI model comes up with something that’s even relatable let alone accurate.</p>

<p>Global independent analyst organization <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/about">KuppingerCole</a> has confirmed <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>’ <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/reusable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> product is a “next-generation identity solution for elevating user privacy and trust and mitigating fraud and impersonation during onboarding, authentication, and high-value transactions.”</p>



<p>KuppingerCole described Anonyome’s <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/reusable-credentials/">verifiable credentials (user-held digital identity)</a> product as a “flexible and future-ready solution to support industries requiring rigorous identity verification and security, such as finance, healthcare, and education.”</p>



<p>The analysts confirmed <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> offers a “customizable setup for quick deployment” that “stays current with emerging standards, has interoperability with all competitive credential formats, and is compatible with multiple ledgers and non-ledgers.”</p>



<p>“Threat detection and fraud prevention are crucial features designed into the Anonyome Labs’ verifiable credentials offering,” senior analyst, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/reprints/3ba23d8eb352e32d7bd9f072cababf2b#heading3">Anne Bailey</a>, said.</p>



<p>KuppingerCole commended Anonyome’s solution to organizations looking to “leverage the paradigm shift towards user-held digital identities for increased security, trust, and privacy within consumer interactions across all communication channels.”</p>



<p>This independent greenlight for Anonyome’s verifiable credentials solution is significant given the global digital identity verification market is set to explode from $18.41 billion in 2025 to $50.07 billion by 2030.</p>



<p>Strong momentum for user-held digital identities and licenses in Europe and the USA is driving the growth, particularly the European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet initiative associated with eIDAS 2.0 and supported in other regions including the United States with mobile driving licenses (mDL).&nbsp;</p>



<p>KuppingerCole forecasts that by 2030, 2.6 billion individuals globally will be actively using <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/reusable-credentials/">digital identities</a>.</p>



<p>KuppingerCole also acknowledged <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> as a company, finding its “strength lies in its stability as a company with long-standing and proven revenue from other product lines which allows enterprise customers to launch their decentralized identity initiatives without worrying that their vendor will run out of funding, be acquired, or other disruptions in this emerging market.”</p>



<p>KuppingerCole made the findings in an <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/reprints/3ba23d8eb352e32d7bd9f072cababf2b">executive view</a> of Anonyome Labs’ approach to applying decentralized, reusable identity for onboarding and authentication use cases, to reintroduce trust, elevate security, and reduce fraud in multi-channel interactions.<br></p>

<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/reprints/3ba23d8eb352e32d7bd9f072cababf2b">Read the full KuppingerCole report</a>.</p>



 What are verifiable credentials? 



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/how-rc-works/">Verifiable credentials</a>, also called reusable credentials or referred to as user-held digital credentials, are cryptographically protected identity documents issued by a government, bank or other authority which the user stores in a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/anonyomes-di-mobile-wallet-sdk-now-offers-even-more-di-trust-infrastructure-options/">digital wallet&nbsp;</a>on their device and shares with trusted connections (e.g. with their bank, healthcare provider, or university) to unlock services (e.g. proof of identity at a bank, proof of age at a bar, or proof of visa at an airport).</p>



<p>Underpinned by <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity</a> technology, reusable credentials enable secure registration and authentication for users, without the need for usernames, passwords, 2FA, or any third party controlling the process. <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/how-rc-works/">See how they work</a>.</p>



<p>For business, verifiable credentials mitigate fraud risk, restore customer trust, and improve consumer access control by creating uniformity across all access channels, such as apps, websites, branch offices, and call centers.</p>



<p>KuppingerCole describes the process this way:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Once end-users have been onboarded with a mobile wallet and initial credential based off the government-issued ID have been issued, the organization can use it to onboard the user and unify all authentication processes across all channels, including online, in-person/in-store, and call center scenarios.</p>



<p>“For an in-store scenario, the store employee asks the end-user for their identifier (may be an email, PIN, or other attribute), pulls up the end-user profile and sends an authentication request to the user’s mobile wallet. The user then accepts the request and proceeds with the transaction.</p>



<p>“If an end-user gets an unexpected request, they can deny it, which also informs the store employee not to proceed with any transactions. The verifiable credential solution enables organizations to request credential verification from any channel, helping to secure and re-introduce trust into the onboarding process, contact centers, stores and branches, in verified chats, and in distributing alerts and messages to end-users.”</p>
</blockquote>



 Why are organizations turning to verifiable credentials? 



<p>Almost every industry is being challenged with the urgent need to defend against increasingly sophisticated threats and attacks, particularly from generative AI, and to restore trust with their customers.</p>



<p>Significantly compounding this challenge of attack and mistrust is the vast disparity in authentication processes, from in-person to online to call centre, and between web and app interfaces. Inconsistencies frustrate users and heighten their fears and mistrust, because they don’t know whether to trust interactions coming from the organizations they’re dealing with.</p>



<p>Restoring trust and streamlining processes are critical – and reusable, digital, user-held identities achieve it.</p>



<p>KuppingerCole says: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Verifiable credentials support diverse use cases across sectors like financial services, insurance, education, and healthcare. Well-suited use cases for the verifiable credentials product include any industry with privacy concerns and faced with identity fraud and eroding trust between end-users and services.</p>



<p>“In each of these industries, the verifiable credentials product can facilitate secure and tamper-proof identity verification for onboarding and authentication.”</p>

<p>Cloud and hybrid environments have expanded the attack surface, and cybercriminals are taking full advantage. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warns identity is the top target, making <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solution/zero-trust.html">Zero Trust</a> and identity-first security non-negotiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, CISA has repeatedly warned that identity-related attacks are among the top vectors for cloud breaches. In its guidance on defending against cloud compromise, CISA stresses the need for:</p>
 
 <p>Strong, phishing-resistant authentication</p>
 
 <p>Centralized identity and access management (IAM)</p>
 
 <p>Continuous monitoring of user behavior and access patterns</p>
 
 
<p>In short, Identity must be treated as the new perimeter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Because humans are still the weakest link in the identity chain. Phishing, password reuse, and credential theft continue to fuel most breaches, even with sophisticated infrastructure in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why smart organizations put identity at the core, stopping attackers at the front door or catching them faster if they do get through.</p>

 TL;DR 



<p>On June 1, UAGro Wallet goes live on iOS and Android, giving 500 K+ students and alumni instant, tamper-proof diplomas via blockchain. Extrimian’s SSI suite—Digital Credential Wallet, ID Connect API, and Academy—powers this leap, cutting verification time by 99.9%, eliminating fraud, and meeting GDPR, FERPA, and LGPD requirements.</p>



 



 UAGro Wallet &amp; Extrimian: A New Era in University Credential Security 



<p>In 2024, universities worldwide lost over $600 million to fake diplomas, and manual verification still takes 5–14 days per record. On June 1, the Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero (UAGro) breaks this cycle with UAGro Wallet, a mobile app (iOS/Android) delivering verifiable credentials to 500 000 + students and alumni. Powered by Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) from Extrimian, this project seals document fraud and transforms how diplomas, transcripts, and certificates are issued, stored, and verified.</p>



<p></p>



 1. The Credential Crisis in Higher Ed 



 
 Fraud Costs Soar: $600 M+ lost yearly to forged diplomas and transcripts (<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/company-and-culture/the-8-things-you-should-know-about-cyber-attacks-on-the-education-sector-and-how-to-prevent-them/" title="">Check Point 2024</a>). 



 Slow Manual Checks: Average 7 days per verification vs. 2 minutes with SSI. 



 Security Gaps: Under 50 % MFA adoption in universities (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex" title="">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 
 



<p>These delays frustrate applicants and employers, drain staff hours (120 h→8 h monthly), and expose institutions to data-theft and compliance fines.</p>



<p></p>



 2. How SSI &amp; Blockchain Fix Verification 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) hands control back to students. Instead of siloed servers, diplomas live in a Digital Credential Wallet—secure, private, and always available offline. Key benefits:</p>



 
 Cryptographic Security: Each credential is signed on a blockchain, making tampering impossible. 



 Instant Trust: Employers verify in seconds without calls or faxes. 



 Selective Privacy: Share only what’s needed (e.g., “Bachelor’s Degree, 2025” without grades). 



 Built-in Compliance: GDPR, FERPA, LGPD covered by design.

									  The $11 Billion Battle for Circle   <p>Ripple and Coinbase  are reportedly eyeing Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, like it’s the last slice of pizza at a happy hour. Circle, which had been gearing up for an IPO, now finds itself at the center of a potential multi-billion dollar bidding war that could reshape the stablecoin landscape.</p><p>The stablecoin provider is reportedly shopping itself around at a $5 billion valuation. Ripple came out swinging with an initial offer between $4–5 billion, later upping the ante to as much as $11 billion, sweetened with a mix of cash and XRP tokens.</p><p>Coinbase hasn’t officially tossed a number into the ring, but their long-standing relationship with Circle could be a game-changer. They co-founded the Centre Consortium back in 2018 to govern USDC and still share revenue from USDC reserves.</p> &nbsp;  Why It’s a Big “Deal” <p>Stablecoins are the quiet workhorses of crypto ,  powering everything from DeFi to global remittances. USDC is one of the most regulated and institutionally friendly stablecoins on the market.</p><p>Whoever lands Circle doesn’t just get a product . They gain control over a regulated, dollar-pegged asset that bridges crypto and traditional finance. That’s huge for global positioning.</p><p>Also: market consolidation. Fewer players with more power could mean better interoperability or, on the flip side, increased centralization. Either way, it’s a pivotal moment.</p> What Would It Mean for the Buyer? <p>Ripple is a global payments firm focused on cross-border transactions. Adding USDC  one of the most trusted stablecoins - could accelerate Ripple’s mission to modernize money movement. With the XRP Ledger evolving post-SEC, controlling a compliant stablecoin gives Ripple a serious edge in attracting new use cases and adoption.</p><p>Coinbase, meanwhile, has skin in the game. That 50/50 revenue-sharing deal with Circle means they’re already benefiting from USDC. Acquiring Circle would deepen that advantage ,  giving Coinbase more control over a critical piece of crypto’s financial plumbing.</p><p>For either, it’s about infrastructure and influence. Stable value is critical to crypto’s usability. With PayPal, TradFi, and governments circling the space, locking down USDC means future-proofing their position.</p> &nbsp;  What Would It Mean for the Market? <p>If Ripple wins:</p>  Tighter integration of USDC with the XRP Ledger  USDC liquidity may shift to Ripple’s ecosystem  Faster expansion into global payments  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Coinbase wins:</p>  Stronger grip on U.S. stablecoin infrastructure  More integration of USDC into Coinbase products  Increased competitive edge as regulators scrutinize rivals like Tether  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Circle IPOs:</p>  Circle retains neutrality  Public accountability increases, possibly limiting flexibility   &nbsp;  What Would It Mean for Users? <p>For users, a successful acquisition could bring:</p>  Smoother transitions between fiat and crypto  Faster, cheaper transactions  Broader access to a trustworthy stablecoin  <p>That said, more control in fewer hands always warrants a watchful eye.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> What Next? <p>Looming questions remain.</p><p>Will regulators get involved? This level of consolidation may attract antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Will other bidders emerge? Don’t count out TradFi or PayPal.</p><p>Will USDC remain neutral? Ownership could influence its use and perception.</p><p>Whatever the case, stablecoins are becoming as essential as cash and credit . Whoever wins Circle may shape the rules of the road.</p>  <p>— Branden</p>

									         The Case For —&nbsp;And Against — Institutional Integration   <p>Over the past few months, a new wave of momentum has quietly reshaped the crypto landscape, as TradFi institutions and mainstream retailers step deeper into the world of digital assets. From Overstock’s blockchain experiments to Nike’s NFTs, PayPal’s stablecoin to BlackRock’s on-chain funds, the trend is accelerating. While it may lack the explosive energy of bull market euphoria, its implications run just as deep.</p><p>Institutional integration is not a new trend. Overstock became one of the earliest corporate Bitcoin adopters in 2014. But in 2024 and beyond, the landscape looks markedly different. Institutions aren’t just dipping their toes anymore. They’re building infrastructure, shaping regulation, and in many cases, bringing the crypto rails in-house.</p><p>According to Galaxy Digital, tokenized real-world assets managed by traditional finance surpassed $11 billion in Q1 2025. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and JPMorgan are all developing or deploying blockchain-based investment products. At the same time, brands like Adidas and Reddit are keeping their NFT experiments alive, running on public blockchains, but with controlled user experiences.</p><p>The economic effects are measurable. More liquidity, more user acquisition, and more diversified use cases. Chainalysis data from late 2024 shows a 41% increase in institutional transaction volume year-over-year. But retail adoption has only grown 8% in the same window, suggesting a concentration of influence and activity at the top end of the ecosystem.</p><p>The flip side is there’s now a paradox at play. The very institutions crypto sought to disrupt are now key players in its mainstreaming. This isn’t inherently negative, but it invites ongoing debate about decentralization, gatekeeping, and the long-term direction of the space.</p><p>A 2024 DappRadar report found that over 70% of brand-launched NFTs are minted on custodial platforms, meaning users rarely control their assets. Meanwhile, centralized stablecoins like PYUSD offer price stability and access, but often operate within closed systems, limiting composability and self-custody.</p><p>Yet, there’s a potential upside, too. With major players onboard, the industry gains credibility and regulatory traction that could ultimately benefit all participants. For developers, this means more resources. For users, it could mean more reliable on-ramps and protections. For institutions, it’s a chance to reimagine trust.</p><p>Whatever the case, it’s happening. TradFi and DeFi are doing the fusion dance, and real ones know Gogeta never (really) lost a fight. So no matter where you stand on the philosophical side, you shouldn’t should be asking, “Is institutional integration good or bad?” Instead, you should ask, “How do I play it?”</p>  <p>— Muhammed</p>

									         When Customer Data Becomes a Liability   <p>Coinbase, America’s crypto darling, is currently downplaying one of the most serious breaches of consumer privacy in recent history. Meanwhile, it is inadvertently demonstrating how anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws create more harm than good when it comes to storing sensitive data.</p><p>In January 2025, Coinbase’s overseas employees betrayed user trust by selling access to sensitive customer information to criminals in exchange for what was likely life-changing sums of money. It was only disclosed in May because the criminals decided to ransom the data back to Coinbase for $20 million — which the company promptly refused, instead offering the same amount as a reward for the hackers’ capture.</p><p>What’s disturbing is how easily these low-level employees accessed sensitive information including ID photos, home addresses, token balances, and the last 4 digits of personal identification numbers. Set against the backdrop of rising crypto kidnappings across Europe, this data breach highlights an incredibly dangerous practice. The centralization of personal information will never be without risk, and these risks clearly outweigh any benefits, as repeatedly demonstrated by breaches like this and the infamous Equifax breach.</p><p>Coinbase shouldn’t have made this information available to low-level employees in foreign countries. Whatever legal team approved that deserves to be fired; the risks were glaringly obvious. But using cheap overseas labor for customer support is standard practice in tech. Which is where decentralized databases, with user-controlled authorization via ZK proofs and homomorphic encryption, come in.</p><p>This technology represents a genuine opportunity to comply with KYC laws while protecting user privacy. Unfortunately, we’re still far from implementing such infrastructure. KYC laws rarely prevent crime or enable effective enforcement. Meanwhile, Coinbase — one of the primary proponents behind the GENIUS act, enabling stablecoin legislation — seems focused on preserving their market position through web2-style regulatory capture.</p><p>Rumors are spreading on Twitter about retail users pulling their tokens off the exchange in protest, hoping to trigger a bank run. Their grievances go beyond this most recent breach of trust, hinging on suspicions that Coinbase might be using fractional reserve practices with institutional finance firms. I personallycan’t advocate for something potentially so destructive to users trapped on the platform if another FTX-like implosion occurred. But I won’t be upset seeing a bad actor face consequences.</p><p>(Full disclosure: I’ve always used Coinbase for onboarding due to their user-friendly interface, but knowing my data was likely compromised and fearing my crypto might be used to back “paper crypto,” I’m now exploring alternatives like MoonPay for future transactions.)</p><p>How do I know my data was compromised? The careful wording in Brian’s announcement suggested that if you transact less than once a month on average, you were probably affected, since “only 1% of our users who trade monthly were exposed.” Reading between the lines, this likely means long-term investors who buy and hold were the primary targets. Just watch the increase in crypto kidnappings to understand how serious this issue is about to become.</p>  <p>— El Prof</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/">Suomi.fi</a> identity brokering service provides a list of authentication methods for the Tax Administration e-service.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nowadays, people handle so much sensitive information online that the need for strong authentication is apparent. People cannot rely on username and password authentication for services such as banking, insurance, health care and tax administration, to mention a few. Traditionally, in Finland, we have had three classes of strong authentication methods available for citizens: BankID, Mobile Certificate (Mobiilivarmenne) and the national ID card (HST card). Since the end of October 2024, a fourth type of official strong authentication method has been made available, hightrust.id.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Overview – Hightrust.id 
<p>Hightrust.id is a digital wallet solution designed for mobile devices. It aims to offer a centralised solution for managing individuals’ online identity credentials without remembering various usernames and passwords or carrying several documents. When I write this, higtrust.id provides strong identity verification and legally binding electronic signatures, but the solution has much more potential. In this blog, I will review hightrust.id mainly as an authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hightrust.id as a Strong Authentication method&nbsp; 
<p>It’s not every day that new, strong authentication methods are introduced. But what makes these methods strong? Multifactor authentication methods (MFA) are often seen as stronger options than methods that rely only on a username and password. However, MFA capability alone cannot define a particular method as an officially strong authentication method. It must undergo a complex certification process to prove the solution’s maturity. This is indicated by using a level of assurance (LoA) level. The National Cyber Security Centre of the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency, Traficom, makes the certification guidelines in Finland. From the current strong methods, BankID and Mobile Certificate are on the second highest LoA level of eIDAS Substantial and the HST card on the highest level of eIDAS High using the EU 3-step scale. Hightrust.id has been certified oto the highest level of eIDAS High, although when used in the Finnish Trust Network, it is registered&nbsp; on the same LoA level as the Bank ID and Mobile certificate, eIDAS Substantial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Wallets&nbsp; 
<p>Generally, a digital wallet is an app that includes personal identity data (PID) based on different types of identity and payment documents and potentially additional attributes that could indicate, e.g., your profession or the organisation you work for. Soon, various kinds of cards, such as identity cards, driver’s licenses, debit cards, credit cards, and cryptocurrencies, can be added to the wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hightrust.id digital wallet is a smartphone application that can be downloaded for free from Android’s Google Play or Apple’s App Store. The solution enables user identity verification in a smartphone application with a citizen certificate scanned from an HST card, and it can be used without a separate card reader. The user can also sign documents electronically using the app. Other cards supported now in the hightrust.id wallet include the Finnish Sote card (for healthcare workers) and the Finnish DVV organisation card (generally used by public sector employees). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another interesting digital wallet solution is the EU’s long-planned EUDI wallet, which will be launched around 2026 to 2027. The EUDI wallet will harmonise how EU citizens verify their identity across borders in different e-services. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the 27 EU nations. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="<span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>here.</span>">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Citizen Digital Certificate&nbsp; 
<p>A digital certificate is an identifier verified by a third-party organisation. It can be used to identify its subject and reliably sign in to information networks and systems. Several certificate types, such as server certificates, are available to identify Internet service providers and secure data exchange. The mobile certificate method is based on a certificate stored in a SIM card on a smart device. The certificate stored in an HST card is called the citizen certificate, and the user must enable it before use. Passports cannot be used for this because their chips do not include the citizen certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not enabled the citizen certificate of your HST card, you can do it in hightrust.id app. This is a great feature, as previously this would require using a device with a smartcard reader or attaching a smart card reader to a computer. Your card must be issued after August 31, 2021, and you need a smartphone or tablet with a near-field communication (NFC) feature. Also, you must have the activation code that is delivered to you on paper separately from the card. This code is used to activate the citizen certificate and create a PIN1 for authentication and a PIN2 for signing. If you do not have the activation code available, you can visit the police station to get a new one for a fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start using the citizen certificate, do the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Adding and confirming your email address in the hightrust.id wallet is essential. It speeds up the revocation operation of the citizen certificate in case you accidentally lose or break your phone or change it to a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed instructions in Finnish, Swedish and English on how to proceed with all the steps are <a href="https://hightrust.id/en/support/preparing-to-enable-the-hightrust-id-digital-wallet/">here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Signing in with the hightrust.id&nbsp; 
<p>In the following example, I will sign in to a social and healthcare mobile application called Maisa. It is a personal health record (PHR) application used by some of the largest public health care regions. The app requires strong authentication due to the sensitive information it contains. Here are a few observations of the procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maisa uses the Suomi.fi identity brokering service to provide all of the different strong authentication methods available. Since I use a mobile app to access the service, I must ensure that hightrust.id uses the app option. If using Maisa via computer, I would choose the QR-code scanning option and scan the QR-code from the computer screen using my phone. If I had several cards scanned in the hightrust.id application, I would choose the card manually, but since I have only one, it is selected automatically. Notice that the national ID card does not contain the social security number (HETU) but a SATU identifier (FINUID, Finnish Unique Identification Number). The SATU identifier will be changed to HETU in the background, utilising the national population information system. Face ID, fingerprint, or mobile device security code can be used to accept sending SATU to the population information system. After the SATU to HETU conversion, I need to give permission to send HETU information to Maisa. After this, I can start to use the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The authentication operation did not require typing any information such as passwords or PIN codes since I have the Face ID option on my smartphone. Other options would have been a fingerprint or typing the smartphone’s security code. In both cases, the operation is effortless and does not require the user to remember any additional passwords or codes that he does not know already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hightrust.id vs. other Strong Authentication methods&nbsp; 
<p>Hightrust.id is not the only ID document-based authentication method on the market. Suomi.fi offers the HST card method, but the downside is that it requires a physical card and a card reader device, which is not handy for me to carry outside my home.&nbsp; Also, there are various methods based on ID document scanning and taking pictures and videos of my ID documents and myself. These methods have many benefits, such as providing reliable authentication methods for people from countries outside of Finland and even outside of Europe and letting them use documents like passports, ID cards and driver’s licenses to verify their identity. However, even though many of these methods rely on advanced technologies, they are not officially certified strong authentication methods in Finland. You can read more about the ID document-based authentication methods <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/understanding-id-document-verification/" title="<span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>here</span>">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BankID has traditionally been the most popular strong authentication method in Finland. It has been used since the 1990s, and most eService users in Finland are very familiar with it. Since BankID enables access to users’ bank accounts, the current recommendation is to use it carefully and only for the bank’s services. The other strong methods, including mobile certificates, hightrust.id and identification cards, should be used for everything else. They work practically everywhere except when logging into online banking. Lately, the mobile certificate method has gained popularity alongside BankID. If criminals gain access to your mobile certificate, they will get access to your online services, but not your bank account. HST card and the hightrust.id methods also offer their benefits. It is always a good idea to have several strong authentication methods available. This is important not only for safety reasons, but also for situations when the bank service is unavailable, for example, during a service break.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the table below for the basic characteristics of the different strong authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The card must be assigned after the 31st of August 2021&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Depending on the solution. Not all three are required during one session. OTP = One Time Password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Mobile card readers are not very practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A critical part of any digital solution is the cost. Nothing comes for free, and the service provider must pay something to the identity broker service operators, Suomi.fi (public sector services) or the Finnish Trust Network (FTN, private sector services) to provide strong authentication methods for their clients. Sometimes, this includes an additional transaction-level fee paid per authentication transaction. But sometimes, we users must also pay a small fee for our chosen methods. See the table below for the basic pricing principles of strong authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pair of British retail giants are still scrambling to regain control of their computer systems nearly a month after massive cyberattacks disrupted their operations and cast a spotlight on the dangers of social engineering schemes targeting corporate IT operations. Despite the availability of technologies for preventing such breaches, most corporations remain vulnerable to this growing threat and the long-term damage it can inflict.</p>
<p>As of May 19, High Street retailer Marks &amp; Spencer has yet to restore online shopping in the face of more than $80 million in lost profit from attacks that have also wiped <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ms-slow-recovery-cyberattack-puts-it-risk-lasting-damage-2025-05-19/">$1.3 billion</a> from its stock market value. According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v34zv828o">the BBC</a>, personal information of some portion of the retailer’s 9.4 million active online customers was compromised in the attack, which could include name, date of birth, contact details, and online order history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, efforts remain underway at grocery chain Co-op to restock shelves and restore systems that were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/14/co-op-cyber-attack-stock-availability-in-stores-will-not-improve-until-weekend">shut down</a> in response to unfolding attacks days after similar assaults on Marks &amp; Spencer. Despite its quick action, hackers had successfully extracted data related to a “significant number” of its customers, though it did not include bank or credit card information.</p>
<p>These and a number of other recent attacks appear to have been perpetrated by the hacker collective called “Scattered Spider” by some analysts, UNC3944 or Octo Tempest and “Muddled Libra” by others. We <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/mgm-caesars-hacks-more-of-the-same-is-coming-your-way-but-heres-how-to-stop-it/">first posted</a> about this particular cybercriminal network after its successful assaults on Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A number of factors make this group especially troubling. First, the fact it’s been implicated in dozens of attacks spanning numerous industries worldwide dating back to 2022. Second, it’s believed to be made up of teenagers and young adults leveraging simple social engineering techniques and to infiltrate corporate systems for fun and profit.</p>
 A Tangled Web of Socially-Engineered Breaches 
<p>Even now, a clear picture of the UK attacks remains elusive. But judging from reports, it appears Spider’s playbook continues to forego approaches like credential stuffing or exploiting previously unrecognized vulnerabilities. Instead, they compromise corporate networks through clever conversations. In other words: They talk their way in.</p>
<p>In the M&amp;S and Co-op attacks, the perpetrators appear to have used <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-05-12/m-and-s-and-co-op-what-we-know-weeks-after-cyber-attacks">SIM swapping</a> to bypass traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA). Either working with an insider, or tricking a call center rep, this typically involves scammers tricking a mobile services provider into transferring the victim’s number to <a href="https://theconversation.com/mands-cyberattacks-used-a-little-known-but-dangerous-technique-and-anyone-could-be-vulnerable-256739">a new SIM card</a>, or even an e-SIM (a kind of virtual SIM that’s embedded in the victim’s device) to a device under the fraudster’s control.</p>
<p>They then tricked IT help desks at Co-op and a third-party supplier to M&amp;S to gain access to the company’s systems, perhaps through a password reset request that was then authenticated using the fraudster’s device. In M&amp;S’s case, it’s believed that once they had enough access, the infiltrators exploited the company’s instance of Microsoft <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-05-12/m-and-s-and-co-op-what-we-know-weeks-after-cyber-attacks">Active Directory</a>, which enables a user to log in once and gain entry to all systems for which the victims have permissioned access. From there, they were free to deploy ransomware to cripple the system.</p>
 Why ‘Mission: Impersonate’ Is Just Getting Started 
<p>Scattered Spider is believed to be a decentralized network composed largely of native English-speaking young people who coordinate in real-time over Discord, Telegram, and underground forums. As I mentioned, they rely on techniques that target people, not technology infrastructure. The group reportedly coordinates with a ransomware-as-a-service operation known as <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-05-01/dragonforce-the-software-cyber-security-experts-believe-was-used-to-hit-m-and-s">DragonForce</a> that handles the encryption and extortion side of attacks like those on M&amp;S and Co-op.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Scattered Spider isn’t just a threat group. It’s an economic model—one that has been leveraged by these or copycat groups in the weeks since the M&amp;S and Co-op attacks. By early May, luxury department store Harrods reported it was also forced to disable some of its systems after it was hit by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/01/harrods-latest-retailer-hit-cyber-attack-website-shops">cyberattack</a>. Fashion retailer <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14716177/Dior-latest-business-cyber-attack-MS-op.html">Dior</a>, Danish food giant <a href="https://www.scworld.com/brief/cyberattack-hits-arla-foods-production">Alra Foods</a>, and a growing list of other retailers and suppliers have been targeted.</p>
<p>As Metro aptly points out, the allure of these household names <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/05/20/reasons-m-amp-s-co-op-hacked-retailers-might-next-23119928/">is threefold</a>: “Big brand, big data, big target.” It’s also worth pointing out what they aren’t: Organizations in financial services, healthcare, or other high-regulated, attack-hardened industries. All it takes is one employee at a supplier, partner, or within the targeted company itself to click a malicious link or grant unwarranted access to company systems. And as wide as this attack surface may be, it’s also ever-expanding. By May 20, Google was warning there are signs Scattered Spider may be moving on from UK retailers and pivoting to direct cyber-attacks against retail sector <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/google-warns-hackers-that-victimized-uk-retailers-now-targeting-us-firms-with-cyber-attacks/">targets in the US.</a></p>
 A Breach’s Bite Is Painful—and Costly 
<p>Crippled systems, disrupted sales, and headline-driven stock swings are just the immediate prices to be paid when organizations fall prey to threat groups like Scattered Spider. The average additional cost of a data breach on UK-based organizations is now <a href="https://uk.newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Report-Soaring-Data-Breach-Disruption-Drive-Costs-to-Record-Levels">$4.8 million</a> per incident, according to IBM, and as high as $9.8 million for US-based companies. Worldwide, IBM estimates the price of each breach is climbing at a rate of 10% per year. And that’s before any regulatory fines and lawsuits.</p>
<p>The longer-term impact on revenue generation may also be profound for retailers. According to one 2025 survey, <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/101357-data-breaches-affect-consumer-trust">70% of consumers</a> would stop shopping with a brand that suffered a security incident. The fact that 1 in 5 consumers say they use the same passwords across work and personal online accounts means the fallout from successful attacks on retailers may have serious implications for companies in every industry.</p>
<p>As the M&amp;S and Co-op attacks so vividly illustrate, traditional forms of MFA don’t cut it anymore. Cybercriminal enterprises like Scattered Spider continue to find innovative ways to acquire login credentials and circumvent things like one-time passcodes and limited biometric authentication systems designed to confirm the legitimate user is attempting to access company systems. And anyone with administrative access or successful SIM swap can register things like user biometrics to any device—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures all together. Yet while these challenges are real, they’re also not insurmountable.</p>
 Breach-Proof ‘Spider’ Repellant: ‘Liveness’-based<br>
Biometric Authentication 
<p>With old-school forms of MFA proving so unreliable as a means of identity verification and new-school social engineering schemes on the rise, modern forms of biometric authentication are helping to set a new standard for security and convenience. Solutions certified to FIDO2, ISO/IEC biometric presentation attack detection, and NIST 800-63-3 specifications, for instance, use “live” biometric markers tied to a verified identity to provide reliable, strong authentication that’s impervious to account takeover.</p>
<p>Put simply, these solutions are built around the identity of the person accessing the account, instead of just the login credentials or device the person is using. Instead, these solutions offer machine-verified identity to government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) and enable phishing-resistant multifactor authentication when users log in to corporate systems.</p>
<p>1Kosmos, for example, uses the private key of a matched public-private pair in the user’s device as a possession factor (i.e., what you have), while a live facial scan becomes the “what you are” or inherence authentication element. Before access is granted to a site, app, or system, that live image scan is compared to an image captured during the user enrollment process. A match confirms the identity of the person is in fact the authorized user—and not a bot, deepfake, or imposter—with 99.9% accuracy.</p>
<p>The solution supports a consistent enrollment and authentication experience across all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems.</p>
<p>Which means every organization—big British retailer or otherwise—can prevent breaches before they happen by squashing attempts from Scattered Spider or other threat actors to fraudulently infiltrate accounts.</p>

			<p>London, 21st May 2025 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apexgroup.com/">Apex Group</a>, the leading global financial services provider, has announced the acquisition of a majority stake in <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading enterprise-grade tokenization solutions provider. The transaction, which will see Apex Group have 100% control over the next three years, follows the initial investment and strategic partnership with Tokeny announced in December 2023. This process marks a significant deepening of the relationship as Apex Group commits to lead the institutional adoption of tokenized finance.</p>
<p>This strategic milestone, where Apex Group will now take a controlling interest in Tokeny, is a clear signal of the firm’s belief in the transformative potential of tokenization for asset managers and institutional finance. It also reflects a broader commitment to delivering turn-key digital infrastructure that simplifies and accelerates the shift to greater liquidity and distribution across geographies. Both Tokeny talent and technology will become part of Apex Group enabling an effective integration within the firm to efficiently meet client needs.</p>

		 
	 
    As a majority owner, Apex Group is enhancing its ability to deliver comprehensive, future-proof solutions to our clients. Tokenization is a foundational shift in how assets will be managed, distributed, and accessed. Our strengthened partnership with Tokeny is key to delivering on our vision to be the infrastructure provider in the digital era of finance.  Peter HughesFounder and CEO of Apex Group    
	 
		 
			<p>Since the initial partnership announcement, Tokeny has seen growing adoption of its technology and standards by leading financial institutions. Its chain-agnostic infrastructure has been integrated into Apex Group’s offerings and deployed to tokenize assets for clients.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s solutions have been used to tokenize over $32bn in assets, having created ERC-3643, the technical market standard for compliant tokenization. The firm offers a full suite of capabilities covering the issuance, transfer, and lifecycle management of tokenized securities, enabling clients to tap into new liquidity channels and enhance operational efficiencies.</p>

		 
	 
    Expanding our partnership to now being part of Apex Group enables us to move faster and serve more institutions with a truly global footprint. In the last six years, we’ve built a robust tokenization infrastructure and an active ecosystem of partners.

<p>Meet Rachel—an asset manager onboarding a boutique investment fund with international stakeholders. Before she can move forward, Rachel must navigate KYC, KYB, and AML checks to stay compliant. It’s a complex process, and mistakes can mean fines or reputational risk.</p>



<p>Here’s how Rachel’s experience differs when using manual methods versus iComply’s compliance platform.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 1: Collecting Client Information 



<p>Manual Process: Rachel emails forms, requests documents, and waits for incomplete responses. She sends follow-ups, and the back-and-forth delays onboarding.</p>



<p>With iComply: Rachel sends a secure, custom-branded onboarding link. The platform guides the client through document uploads and verifies everything in real time.</p>



<p>Result: Onboarding is fast and complete—no delays or missing data.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 2: Verifying Ownership 



<p>For corporate clients, KYB compliance requires identifying all beneficial owners with 25% or more ownership.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel searches public records, cross-references shareholder lists, and struggles with foreign registries.</p>



<p>With iComply: The system pulls corporate filings and ownership details globally in seconds, even revealing hidden layers like trusts or holding companies.</p>



<p>Result: Rachel gets an audit-ready overview of the business structure without manual digging.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 3: AML Screening 



<p>AML regulations require checking clients and stakeholders against sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media lists.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel manually inputs names into multiple databases and spends hours reviewing false positives.</p>



<p>With iComply: The platform screens individuals automatically and filters out irrelevant matches, flagging only genuine risks.</p>



<p>Result: Fewer false positives, faster resolutions, and more focus on real risks.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 4: Recordkeeping and Reporting 



<p>Compliance regulations require asset managers to store records securely and generate detailed reports during audits.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel stores files in multiple folders and scrambles to compile audit reports from spreadsheets and emails.</p>



<p>With iComply: Every action is logged automatically. Rachel generates a detailed, audit-ready report with one click.</p>



<p>Result: Audit prep takes minutes, not hours.</p>



<p></p>



 A Tale of Two Experiences 



<p>In the manual workflow, onboarding takes days or weeks, frustrating clients and draining team resources. With iComply, onboarding is seamless—clients appreciate the professional experience, and Rachel’s team focuses on client relationships instead of admin work.</p>



<p></p>



 Key Compliance Considerations for Asset Managers 



 
 Complete Due Diligence: Collect and verify customer information thoroughly. 



 Ongoing AML Screening: Continuously monitor for sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media. 



 Ownership Transparency: Identify beneficial owners, especially in complex structures. 



 Data Security: Store sensitive information securely and comply with regulations like GDPR. 



 Audit Readiness: Keep comprehensive records and generate reports easily. 
 



<p></p>



 Why iComply? 



<p>With iComply, Rachel cut onboarding time, reduced manual work, and stayed audit-ready with end-to-end encryption and automated reporting. Compliance became a competitive advantage—not a burden.</p>



<p>Is your compliance workflow helping or holding you back? Let iComply simplify KYC, KYB, and AML so you can focus on growing your clients’ wealth. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>“We are here with you with this comprehensive blog post. In this guide, we will tell you our discovery about the role of ID Document Liveness Detection.”</p>
<p>Hello dear readers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the rise of modern technology, new innovative methods of security have been developed to defeat cyber criminals. From multiple-factor authentication to facial ID recognition, we have all types of security.</p>
<p>One such groundbreaking method of security that has revolutionized the way we fight against fake identities is ID Document Liveness Detection.</p>
<p>We have prepared this guide for its detailed explanation. Stay connected with us till the end….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What ID Document Liveness Detection Claims About It? 
<p>ID Document Liveness Detection SDK is mainly hailed as an innovation in technology that is used to ensure the presented ID is real during the verification. Driven by this technology, a <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-verification-playground/">fake ID detector</a> scans the presented documents and then applies OCR on them to extract their text.</p>
<p>When the text is extracted, the system verifies and marks the documents and issues them for further processing. This technology is being used in all institutions, from banks to educational institutions, and from such institutions to finance.</p>
<p>When we present our stance in front of users, many of them raise a simple question: how does this technology stop identity fraud? Hoping! You will also ask us this question.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, the next section is the answer to your question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How ID Documents Liveness Detection Stops Identity Fraud? 
<p>This section is a detailed part of this blog. In which we will describe the role of ID document Recognition SDK in preventing fraud in detail.</p>
 1. Artificial Intelligence Integration 
<p>When it comes to AI, we don’t think that there is any field where it has not left its everlasting impact. We can all understand this. Luckily! ID Recognition also integrates AI and its advanced algorithms. These algorithms are trained to provide real-time insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, we can say that: from anyone’s entrance to returning from any institution, the system records all movements of them. Furthermore, AI is exclusive to providing faster results. We mean to say you can get anyone’s insights within a few seconds. Isn’t it great..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Better Document Analysis 
<p>There is a huge difference between document analysis and better document analysis. Did’t understand? Let us make you understand. If we give you some documents and say you to find whether they are fake or real. You might take a lot of time and could even miss subtle signs of tampering.</p>
<p>However, when you use this technology of ID recognition, the advanced algorithms analyze several features from A to Z, including;</p>
 
 Watermark 
 
 
 Hologram 
 
 
 Microtext 
 UV features 
 
<p>And so on….</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s ask a very simple question: Is such detection exclusive to humans? Absolutely not! So, this detection is the best feature of this technology.</p>
 3. Enhanced User Experience and Compliance 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID Document Recognition SDK</a> not only strengthens the security but also enhances the user experience and compliance by making the verification simple and fast. This technology ensures consistent and smooth compliance onboarding while meeting strict regulatory standards such as KYC(Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).</p>
<p>Such efficiency and speed of this technology streamlines the process of verification that making it easy for both businesses and customers to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Reduced Costs 
<p>One of the greatest roles of this technology is reducing the costs. A fake ID scanner is integrated with advanced machine learning models that reduce the need for manual verification. Additionally, the agencies don’t need to hire extra labor staff for manual verification. This feature eliminates the tension of errors committed by humans during verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What About Our Service? 
<p>After hearing the role of this technology, many users probably think about how they can make use of this cutting-edge technology. This is where we provide them with <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a>(a face and ID recognition algorithm developer).</p>
<p>Our service is driven by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a>-evaluated algorithms. This integration ensures the highest level of accuracy, speed, and performance. Here, once again, a question arises: where can users use our service? You can also visit Recognito <a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision/">GitHub</a> page for more info.</p>
<p>If you have the same question, the next section is for you.</p>
<p></p>
 Where Can We Use Recognito For ID Document Liveness Detection? 
<p>In this section, we will tell you where our service can be used or which institutions can benefit from this technology.</p>
<p>Banks: If you are handling the financial accounts while working in any bank, you can come across Recognito, which implements the same technology of verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Universities and Colleges: Sometimes, cyber criminals try to manipulate educational departments and steal the key information of students and professors. Here, they can eliminate such an issue by using this ID recognition technology.</p>
<p>Healthcare sectors: It is a very surprising thing that many criminals attempt to steal patients’ key information with spoofing images and videos. This is where our service will show its magic and defeat the fake identities.</p>
<p>Telecommunication: Telecom providers often face fraud during new account opening and SIM registration. If you are the same provider, we suggest you check our service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketplaces: Markets are the major places where criminals make attacks. They destroy both online and offline money accounts of users. To defeat them, marketers can heavily benefit from <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID Document Liveness Detection SDK</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Our Final Thoughts 
<p>ID Document Liveness Detection plays a crucial role in preventing fraud and defeating online attacks made by criminals. This technology effectively extracts text from ID documents and then lets the system mark them for further processing.</p>
<p>This technology plays a great role that we have discussed in this guide in detail. This section starts from AI integration and ends with reduced costs. This role is such a groundbreaking one. However, many users remain confused about how to get such benefits.</p>
<p>To eliminate this confusion, we have brought Recognition for them, driven by NIST FRVT. In the end, we have discussed some major case uses of this innovative technology from banks to e-commerce marketplaces.</p>
<p>So, what is your feedback for our guide and service? You have liked them or havn’t you? We want your honest feedback…..</p>

 Data theft and how to protect data in the face of increasing cases of data theft<a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/data-theft"></a> 



 Recent Scandal in Argentina Highlights a Massive Digital Trust Gap 



<p>In a striking case that has stirred political and cybersecurity circles alike, Argentine authorities are investigating a social media influencer for allegedly misusing the CUITs (tax IDs) of five provincial governors to facilitate clothing imports under fraudulent barter agreements.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/investigan-a-una-influencer-por-usar-los-cuit-de-cinco-gobernadores-para-importar-ropa-de-canje/">La Voz</a> article, the influencer was able to initiate import operations by impersonating state authorities, a move that points to critical failures in identity verification and data authenticity across public sector systems.</p>



<p>This incident isn’t just a political scandal — it’s a technological wake-up call.</p>



 



 What’s the problem: Identity in a Web2 World Is Broken 



<p>Let’s break down what went wrong:</p>



 
 Static identifiers (like CUITs) are publicly known and easily misused. 



 No decentralized verification mechanism exists to confirm who is behind a given request. 



 Paper-based or email-based authorizations can be forged or socially engineered. 



 Lack of auditability and tamper-resistance in public records. 
 



<p>In short, Web2 identity systems were never designed for integrity-first governance.</p>



<p></p>



 Extrimian Solution: Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity (DID) 



<p>This is where Extrimian’s technology stack comes in — providing next-generation digital identity solutions built for trust, transparency, and tamper-resistance.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) </a>and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, institutions and individuals can cryptographically prove who they are, what roles they hold, and what permissions they’ve been granted.</p>



 What this looks like in practice: 



 
 Governors or their offices issue verifiable credentials signed with cryptographic keys. 



 These credentials confirm roles, permissions, or authority to engage in specific transactions (e.g., import operations). 



 Customs systems or regulatory APIs validate these credentials in real time. 



 No credential = no action. 



 And any attempt to forge or reuse expired credentials fails cryptographic validation instantly. 
 



<a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/"></a>Verifiable Credentials for Decentralized Digital Identity circuit<br>



 Why does a new data security system matter now? 



<p>Public institutions, regulatory bodies, and private sector players are increasingly vulnerable to identity-based fraud, whether it’s:</p>



 
 Fake authorizations for import/export activity. 



 Impersonation of officials for grants or tenders. 



 Abuse of state data for reputation laundering. 
 



<p>The Extrimian DID/VC framework prevents this by design:</p>



 
 Every claim is traceable, verifiable, and revocable. 



 You control your identity, but institutions can trust it without intermediaries. 



 AI systems or customs logic can automatically validate credentials without human review. 
 



 



 How does Extrimian Technology work for data security? 



 – Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): 



<p>A new standard for digital identity, DIDs are globally unique, user-controlled identifiers that don’t rely on central registries. Unlike CUITs or email addresses, DIDs can’t be spoofed.</p>



 – Verifiable Credentials: 



<p>Credentials (like “Governor of Córdoba”) are digitally signed and timestamped. They’re issued by a trusted entity and can be shown (and validated) without revealing unnecessary personal data.</p>



 –  Interoperability &amp; Compliance: 



<p>Extrimian builds on <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">W3C standards </a>and works with Hyperledger, Ethereum, and other Web3 protocols — making the stack fit for enterprise and government adoption.</p>



 



 Use Case: Protecting CUITs and import authorizations 



<p>Let’s reimagine the current scandal with Extrimian in place:</p>



Current ProblemExtrimian SolutionCUITs misused to authorize importsCredentials would require live cryptographic validationNo verification of who submitted paperworkEvery credential includes signer metadata and roleFraudulent authorization slips throughInvalid credentials are immediately rejected at the protocol layer



<p>The result? No more impersonations. No more unchecked imports.</p>



 



 What is the best Data Theft and Security solution? 



<p>The CUIT scandal is emblematic of a global challenge. As governments digitize, identity without verification is a liability. By integrating <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">DIDs</a>, institutions don’t just stop fraud — they build digital trust for the AI era.</p>

<p>What if the real threat in the Hindu Kush Himalayas isn’t war, but collapse? What happens when melting glaciers, volatile politics, and fraying ecologies converge? Can we imagine security beyond borders — rooted in shared rivers, anticipatory governance, and a planetary ethic of care? What risks are we still refusing to&nbsp;see?</p><p>In June 2024, Dark Matter Labs was commissioned to develop a 75-year situational risk profile of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH). The goal was to identify the potential of catastrophic risk in the region, i.e. to map a complex terrain of cascading environmental threats, political instability, and social vulnerabilities that might, under certain pressures, tip into systemic crisis. One aspect we sought to explore was how water insecurity could add to political tensions and even lead to conditions for conflict in the&nbsp;region.</p><p>At the time, we chose not to share the full analysis publicly. Some of the risk intersections we identified, particularly around water infrastructure, migration corridors, and conflict hotspots, felt too sensitive, too easily misinterpreted or potentially weaponised. However, given the return of heightened conflict between India and Pakistan, it feels important to share at least part of our analysis. The objective is not to claim prescience or take sides but help shift the conversation away from land and borders to something much more oriented towards the socio-ecological continuities in the region that are hurtling towards systemic collapse. We offer this summary of our learnings in relation to the ongoing conflict.</p>Figure 1. The Hindu Kush Himalayas. Image by Nieves López Isquierdo¹. An Overview of Recent&nbsp;Events <p>On April 22, 2025, gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists in the Himalayan resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing 25 visitors and a local guide². The brutality of the incident has shattered any evidence of tenuous calm in the region — a narrative that the Indian government has promoted since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 (which revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional autonomy). The Indian government blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba, a UN-proscribed terrorist organisation based in Pakistan, for the attack. Within days, New Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting the attackers and launched a diplomatic and economic offensive. India downgraded ties, expelled Pakistani diplomats, sealed its land borders, and suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty — a crucial water-sharing arrangement between the countries that had previously survived three major wars between the two nations³. Pakistan, denying any involvement, bristled at the accusations and retaliated in kind. It closed its airspace to Indian flights, halted all trade, and nearly put a 50-year-old bilateral peace treaty, the Simla Agreement, on&nbsp;hold⁴.</p><p>For ordinary people on both sides of the border, the sudden freefall in relations and outbreak of military hostilities has been alarming. In some regions, air raid sirens and border skirmishes have become nightly occurrences⁵. Even far from the conflict zone, the social fabric has been strained. The killings have opened up India’s already frayed religious and ethnic fault lines. In some Indian cities, anger over the Pahalgam killings has spilled into mob violence and xenophobia. Muslims, especially Kashmiris, living in places like Punjab and New Delhi, have found themselves harassed, assaulted, or shunned, as many Indians scapegoat them for the actions of militants⁶. Social media disinformation and the use of AI-manipulated content and deepfakes has been rampant on both sides, which has only fuelled polarisation and jingoism⁷.</p> Entangled Continuums / Systemic&nbsp;Risks <p>As the two nations trade fire and fury, a deeper crisis continues to unfold. HKH spans 3,500 kilometers across eight countries, towering as the planet’s ‘Third Pole’ with its vast ice fields and alpine ecosystems. It is an awe-inspiring landscape of glaciers, snow-fed rivers, and narrow valleys teeming with life — and risk. Even before the latest military flare-up, scientists and strategists had been sounding alarms about a cascading chain of environmental threats. Climate change is hitting the HKH region hard and fast. Average temperatures in the mountains are rising faster than the global average and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. If the world manages to limit global warming to +1.5°C, the Himalayas will likely experience about +2.0°C — enough to irreversibly alter its ecology. The spillover effects of such warming are already evident and will intensify: a third of all Himalayan glaciers could vanish, monsoon patterns are turning more erratic with heavier bursts of rain and longer droughts, and mountain disasters like landslides and flash floods are on the rise. All of this directly threatens the livelihoods and cultures of upland communities who have contributed almost nothing to global emissions but face outsize consequences.</p><p>Nowhere is the climate impact more dramatic than in the glaciers themselves. The HKH region holds about 73,000 square kilometers of glacier, a crucial store of fresh water that feeds Asia’s great rivers and provides water to over 240 million people in the HKH mountains, and an estimated 1.65–2 billion people downstream, affecting populations as far south as Vietnam. These glaciers are in rapid retreat. Recent assessments show that glacier loss in the 2010s was 65% faster than in the previous decade. By mid-century, the region is expected to hit ‘peak water’ — meaning melting glaciers will swell rivers to a maximum — after which water flows decline steadily as the ice reserves dwindle. If global warming is kept to 1.5–2°C, the Himalayas will still lose about 30–50% of their glacier volume by 2100. This is already an impossible target to meet. On the current trajectory of around 3°C of warming, up to three-quarters of the glacier ice could disappear by the end of the century. Such a loss would be catastrophic, causing both dangerous flooding in the near term and severe water shortages and food insecurity for decades thereafter. Food and water security for the HKH depend on the seasonal meltwater from glaciers. As one report starkly put it, “the people living in these mountains who have contributed next to nothing to global warming are at high risk” — and current adaptation efforts are nowhere near enough to help them&nbsp;cope.</p>Figure 2. Geodetic mass balance of glaciers in each region of the HKH and for the whole region (inset) for 1975–1999, 2000–2009, and 2010–2019. The size of the bars and their colour depend on changes in the average mass balance, expressed in metres water equivalent per year (m w.e. per year). The vertical black lines show the uncertainty. The bold numbers beside each basin give the glacier region in the Randolph Glacier Inventory⁸.Figure 3. Overview of all recorded cryospheric events in the HKH between 2015 and&nbsp;2023⁹.<p>In such a fragile landscape of risk, India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is particularly ominous. The Indus River and its tributaries support 80 percent of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan as well hydropower. Pakistani officials warned that any attempt by India to choke the Indus River would be taken as an “act of war” and met with “full force”¹⁰, and are in the process of finalising a legal response¹¹. In other words, water — the most basic of shared resources — has become a potential weapon, and it is portentous for other resource wars to escalate in a time of climate-induced scarcity. Similarly, consider the Brahmaputra River (known as Yarlung Tsangpo in China) which winds from Tibet into India and Bangladesh. China’s construction of mega-dams upstream and its plans to possibly divert waters have caused consternation in India, which has responded with its own infrastructure projects in the region (notably the construction of India’s longest under-river tunnel across the Brahmaputra¹²). The risk here is that 50% of the Brahmaputra’s catchment is in Chinese-controlled territory. While not explicitly weaponised as in the case of the Indus Water Treaty, there is a threat to India and Bangladesh if Beijing opts to exert too much control. Climate change, in this context, is a risk multiplier: more erratic monsoons and faster glacial melt could lead to sudden floods one decade and crippling droughts the next, without any nation firing a shot. Or worse: forcing one side or both to push towards hot war. All the countries of the HKH are thus bound in a high-stakes environmental lottery. Upstream actions create downstream impacts, and an extreme event in one place — be it a cloudburst, landslide, or outburst flood from a glacial lake — can send ripples of disaster through valleys that span multiple&nbsp;nations.</p><p>It is also important to recognize how multiple hazards stack onto vulnerable mountain populations. A recent multi-hazard assessment of the HKH found that nearly half (around 49%) of the region’s people are exposed to more than one type of natural hazard — often simultaneously. Only 19% of the population resides in the safest third of the land area, whereas one-fifth live in the most dangerous 9% of land where floods, landslides, and wildfires overlap¹³. Many of the high-risk zones are precisely the densely populated mountain valleys and foothill corridors where development has concentrated. For example, the Kashmir Valley, Nepal’s Middle Hills, and parts of the Hindu Kush in Pakistan all feature towns and farmlands squeezed between steep slopes and flood-prone rivers. When heavy monsoon rains come or when a glacier lake suddenly bursts its banks, the damage can be enormous and quickly crosses borders. This was evident in 2010 when epic floods in Pakistan (triggered by unusual monsoon patterns linked to a warming atmosphere) affected 20 million people and even impacted parts of Indian Kashmir downstream. Likewise, a major landslide or earthquake in the Himalayas could dam rivers or reroute them, with downstream countries helpless to prevent flooding. Such cascading disasters are not hypothetical&nbsp;; they are a question of when, not if. Each event can act as a threat multiplier: displacing communities, straining governments, and potentially fueling social unrest or migration that ignites new conflicts (fig.&nbsp;4).</p>Figure 4. An illustrative 50-year Risk Profile for the HKH. Image by Prateek Shankar, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.<p>The Pahalgam terror attack and the ensuing military standoff occurred against such a backdrop of environmental fragility. In a very real sense, the skirmishes over borders and the looming crisis over glaciers are part of a single continuum of risk. Both stem from hyper-stressed systems that are increasingly interlinked. The HKH region faces an ‘entangled continuum’ of threats where a trigger in one domain (e.g., security) can exacerbate vulnerabilities in another (e.g., water and climate), and vice versa. It is no coincidence that as India and Pakistan were trading fire, they were also trading accusations over water and power supply. Nor is it a coincidence that even as soldiers were entrenched on the frontiers, families were worried about blackouts and crop irrigation back home. In this environment, a narrow focus on conventional, ‘hard’ security threats alone begins to look dangerously myopic.</p><p>This is why the lens of the nation-state, though institutionally powerful, is insufficient to understand what is happening in the region. The rivers of the HKH do not follow treaties or the speeches of political leaders in Delhi and Islamabad. They swell, split, and migrate. So do its communities, its vulnerabilities, and its threats. Treating each skirmish, each event, and each border incident as a contained political dispute misses the deeper story: the systemic weakening of a shared ecological and civilisational fabric. In the days following the Pahalgam attack, much of the attention had focused on questions of accountability and justice. But as long as that attention remains bounded by flags and frontiers, it misses this larger terrain of risk. This is and cannot be a region defined by conflict. It is defined by continuity. Migratory routes, trade flows, shared cosmologies, and mountain knowledge: these threads have always connected lives across what are now hard and militarized borders. The recent outbreak of conflict is not just the resurfacing of old grievances, but the fraying of such threads under new and regionally shared pressures — pressures which are barely acknowledged in public discourse in the&nbsp;region.</p>Figure 5. Development pathways and possible scenarios for the Hindu Kush Himalayas in&nbsp;2080¹⁴.<p>As an informed public and as stakeholders in this region’s future, we must push our leaders to recognize the continuum of risk, these risk commons. It is no longer enough to simply ‘defeat terrorism’ or ‘secure the border’ in a vacuum. Security in the HKH needs to be reconceived as ecological and human security, requiring principled and mediated dialogue and joint strategies that span from the highest mountain peak to the lowest floodplain. Instead of viewing each other as primary threats, countries of the HKH — and more importantly their leaders — may need to see that they face a common threat which is the entangled crisis of climate warming, a more volatile planet, and the cascading disasters it will bring. We must imagine a renewed sense of planetary security that recognises the entanglement of these risks and our shared futures (e.g. shared data infrastructures, anticipatory risk modeling, whole-systems analysis and bold diplomatic innovation). Ultimately, a bullet fired or a treaty broken in anger is not just an act against a rival nation but against the shared life-support systems that all nations depend&nbsp;on.</p><p>This blog was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zehra-zaidi-obe-7255a5137/">Zehra Zaidi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateek-shankar/">Prateek Shankar</a> (who are British-Pakistani and Indian respectively).

 IDnow’s collaborative research project, MAMMOTH, which explores ways of addressing bias in face verification systems, comes to an end in Autumn 2025. Here, we share a summary of the findings so far, and what it could mean for a more inclusive future of identity verification. 



 



<p>Face verification has emerged as an indispensable way for businesses to quickly and securely prove the identity of their customers. There are multiple reasons for its widespread adoption, including enhanced security, reduced operational costs, and elevated user experiences.</p>



 What is face verification and when is it used?&nbsp; 



<p>Face verification is a form of biometric technology that uses the unique features of a face to confirm an identity. In the context of remote identify verification, it involves capturing a digital image of a person’s face, often in real time, and comparing it to the identity photo extracted from a submitted identity document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘one-to-one’ matching process of face verification differs from the ‘one-to-many’ matching technique of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">face recognition,</a> which involves identifying an individual from images of other individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When combined with liveness detection, 3D depth analysis, and AI-powered pattern recognition, face verification can verify identity documents and the actual person behind them to dramatically reduce account takeovers, synthetic identity fraud, and impersonation attempts while creating a seamless customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">banking onboarding </a>to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">airport security</a>, face verification can transform time-consuming identity checks into seamless moments of trust. Beyond its commercial benefits, face verification offers significant social and economic advantages. It is particularly transformative in regions where many lack traditional forms of ID, providing an accessible means to verify identity and unlock services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, despite its widespread use, many face verification systems are still underperforming for specific demographics, such as darker skinned people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, a 2019 study by MIT Media Lab discovered that while face verification error rates for white men were just 0.8%, they jumped to <a href="https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/news/biased-technology-automated-discrimination-facial-recognition#:~:text=The%20error%20rate%20for%20light,published%20by%20MIT%20Media%20Lab.">34.7% for darker skinned women</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This demographic bias isn’t just a technical flaw – it undermines the right to equal access to essential digital services, such as opening bank accounts or registering for welfare or health services.</p>



 Undertaking a MAMMOTH project. 



<p>In 2022, alongside 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">IDnow set out to break down these barriers of bias</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency of the European Commission, the goal was to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April 2025, I attended the&nbsp;‘<a href="https://mammoth-ai.eu/2nd-mammoth-webinar/">Addressing visual bias in Biometric Identity Verification</a>‘ webinar to share some of the <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2025W/SynRDinBAS/papers/Moussa_Face-swapping_based_Data_Augmentation_for_ID_Document_and_Selfie_Face_WACVW_2025_paper.pdf">findings</a> from the project, discuss how face verification biases arise and what can be done to address them.&nbsp;I was excited to share a solution to this very real problem in the digital world.</p>



 What’s the problem? Skin tone bias in ID verification. 



<p>State-of-the-art face verification models trained on conventional datasets show a significant increase in error rates for individuals with darker skin tones. This is due to an underrepresentation of minority demographics in public datasets. This lack of diversity in the data makes it difficult for models to perform well on underrepresented groups, leading to higher error rates for people with darker skin tones. This reinforces the urgent need for targeted solutions that address demographic imbalance in training data.</p>



 What’s the solution? The power of representation. 



<p>Ensuring face verification models are trained on a balanced dataset of images featuring characteristics typically absent from public datasets significantly improves model performance overall. For instance, as identity card photos may undergo color transformations applied by issuing bodies (e.g., governments), skin tone plays an important role, particularly if the calibration is not optimized for darker skin tones. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This miscalibration can create inconsistencies between the captured selfie image and the individual’s appearance in the ID card photo, especially for those with darker skin tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows that training using a demographically balanced real-world dataset that mirrors the specific characteristics and variability of identity card images can ensure more accurate and fair recognition for individuals with darker skin tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this issue, IDnow proposed using a ‘style transfer’ method to generate new identity card photos that mimic the natural variation and inconsistencies found in real-world data. By augmenting the training dataset with synthetic images, it not only improves model robustness through exposure to a wider range of variations but also enables a further reduction of bias against darker skin faces. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Various experiments on public and proprietary real-world datasets reveal that fine-tuning state-of-the-art face verification models with the proposed methodology yields an 8% improvement in verification accuracy, while requiring only 25% of the original training data. In doing so, the accuracy gap between skin tone groups was reduced by more than 50%, ultimately leading to a fairer face verification system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incorporating learnings from the MAMMOTH project has enabled us to improve the IDnow face verification system so that we may better address ethnically diverse markets in Europe and beyond.</p>

 A synthetic solution to a real-world problem. 



<p>As the global adoption of biometric face verification systems continues to increase across industries, it’s crucial to ensure that these systems are accurate and fair for all individuals, regardless of skin tone, gender or age. By focusing on designing balanced, ID card-specific training datasets and leveraging synthetic data augmentation techniques, such as style transfer, we can significantly reduce bias and improve the robustness of these models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, without a legal framework to ensure ethical standards are adhered to, even the greatest technological breakthrough will fall short of making a long-lasting social and economic impact. We are proud of the work we are doing to reduce bias in face verification systems and are hopeful that <a href="https://such%20guidance">such guidance</a> will become standard in global regulations, such as the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MAMMOTH project ensured all security measures were followed to protect data and comply with internationally accepted standards and privacy regulations, including GDPR.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing series highlighting key contributors to the House Party Protocol (HPP), we spoke with Terry Kim, CEO of AlphaQuark, a core partner in the HPP ecosystem. AlphaQuark has positioned itself at the intersection of real-world assets (RWA), NFTs, and smart financial infrastructure, delivering tools to bring traditional asset valuation into the on-chain world. In this interview, Terry outlines how AlphaQuark is evolving alongside HPP, and why L2 scalability, AI integration, and cross-chain connectivity are unlocking the next frontier for tokenized assets.</p><p>Q1: How would you describe AlphaQuark’s role within the HPP ecosystem?<br>Terry Kim: AlphaQuark was built with a clear mission: to bridge real-world asset value into the blockchain economy. Within HPP, we act as the asset intelligence layer. We’re building not only tokenization systems but also pricing models, data integration tools, and evaluation protocols that let real-world assets interface with smart contracts. The result is a deeper connection between tangible value and programmable finance. In many ways, we’re the “what it’s worth” layer in an ecosystem that’s about verifying, trading, and applying that&nbsp;value.</p><p>Q2: How does AlphaQuark benefit from the transition to HPP Layer 2?<br>Terry Kim: L2 opens up much-needed bandwidth for complex asset logic. Valuation data changes frequently. Compliance checks, liquidity modeling, and even AI-based risk assessments all require more than static smart contracts. HPP Layer 2 gives us the ability to deploy more advanced contract logic and integrate AI agents without bottlenecking performance. It’s the infrastructure upgrade we needed to take AlphaQuark from issuing assets to operating living, evolving asset networks.</p><p>Q3: What is the possible shift for AlphaQuark after the launch of HPP?<br>Terry Kim: HPP marks a major turning point for us. We’ve always focused on building infrastructure for decentralized value, and with HPP Layer 2, we can now do that at scale and with far more sophistication. We’re not pivoting from traditional finance — we’re fully committing to building natively within Web3. This means optimizing for composability, data streaming, and AI-native integrations rather than relying on legacy compatibility. It’s a natural evolution of where we’ve been&nbsp;headed.</p><p>Q4: What makes AlphaQuark uniquely suited to contribute to a unified data and AI-first ecosystem like HPP?<br>Terry Kim: We’re already working with datasets that traditional DeFi protocols can’t handle: appraisal records, legal certificates, and real-world transaction history. Bringing these into the HPP ecosystem means integrating them with AI agents and verifiers. It also means building a common language for “what is valuable” across both human institutions and autonomous protocols. That’s a challenge we’re trying to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Q5: What are some specific industries where AlphaQuark’s RWA infrastructure is seeing the most traction?<br>Terry Kim: Real estate is a big one, not just tokenizing properties, but bringing appraisal logic, loan terms, and insurance factors on-chain. We’re also seeing interest from insurance platforms, IP marketplaces, and even ESG data providers. They all need trust-minimized ways to package and transfer value. That’s what we will&nbsp;provide.</p><p>Q6: How is AlphaQuark leveraging smart contracts for asset valuation, and how will this evolve with L2?<br>Terry Kim: Right now, we use smart contracts to define valuation rules and create standardized RWA token formats. With HPP L2, we’ll be able to dynamically update those contracts with AI-supplied data. Imagine smart contracts that evolve based on real-time economic indicators, appraisal updates, or audit streams. We also see tremendous potential in AI-powered oracles, which can serve as a dynamic verification and data delivery layer for valuation logic. This will give RWAs a much more intelligent and adaptive pricing mechanism.</p><p>Q7: How do you approach data validation and compliance when bridging off-chain assets on-chain?<br>Terry Kim: We apply a mix of off-chain attestations, oracles, and verified issuers. The HPP ecosystem dramatically improves this with W3DB’s Verification-as-a-Service and Booost’s identity frameworks. That’s the beauty of an integrated ecosystem: we don’t have to build everything ourselves—we just connect to other verified components.</p><p>Q8: How do you see AlphaQuark integrating AI and autonomous agents?<br>Terry Kim: In two ways. First, AI will help process valuation data faster, especially in volatile or emerging markets. Second, autonomous agents can execute strategies like rebalancing asset portfolios, flagging suspicious price anomalies, or even initiating compliance actions. The endgame is programmable value, and AI is the logic layer that makes that&nbsp;real.</p><p>Q10: In 3–5 years, what role do you hope AlphaQuark will play in the future of on-chain finance?<br>Terry Kim: I hope we become the trusted layer for pricing and packaging real-world value. Whether it’s a digital twin of an asset, a structured NFT portfolio, or an AI-driven risk model, I want AlphaQuark to be the valuation oracle that DeFi and TradFi both trust. That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><blockquote>We’re the “what it’s worth” layer in an ecosystem that involves verifying, trading, and applying that&nbsp;value.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-interview-with-alphaquark-ceo-on-real-world-assets-in-the-age-of-hpp-41b144c8f753">Open House: Interview with AlphaQuark CEO on Real-World Assets in the Age of HPP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>



<p>That’s not a defense of centralization; it is a challenge to how we think about centralization vs decentralization, and how we define progress in enterprise systems and platform design. In tech, success is often framed in terms of scale, speed, and adoption. The bigger you grow, the more central you become. And we rarely stop to ask: Is that centralization a feature… or a failure of imagination?</p>



<p>This is the third post in a series about decentralization in enterprise systems, not as an ideal, but as a spectrum of tradeoffs we all navigate:</p>



 
 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/04/29/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a>, I argued that flexibility is more valuable than ideological purity. We need systems that can move between centralized and decentralized states. 



 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/cost-of-decentralization/">How Decentralized Are You Willing to Pay For?</a>, I explored what that flexibility actually costs in time, money, tooling, and culture. 
 



<p>Today, I want to take a step back and ask: Why is it so hard to justify decentralization in the first place? What are we really rewarding when we call a system “successful”?</p>



 Success Metrics That Skew Centralized 



<p>Let’s be honest: most of our current incentives favor centralization. Consider how we measure success in enterprise or platform strategy:</p>



 
 Market share → the more users you serve, the more value you’re assumed to create 



 Efficiency → fewer systems, fewer teams, tighter control 



 Reliability → built-in resilience that looks like robustness, even when it’s just concentration 



 Governance → top-down visibility, fast decision-making, single owners 
 



<p>These are all perfectly reasonable goals. But these goals bias us toward consolidation. And once centralized systems become dominant, they become self-reinforcing; technically, economically, and even culturally.</p>



<p>That said, even centralized dominance is rarely permanent. In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1587956.Clockspeed_?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=OMLFbrDB1m&amp;rank=1">Clockspeed</a> (have you read that book? No? You should.), Charles Fine argues that competitive advantage, whether it comes from control of the supply chain, platform dominance, or speed to market, is always temporary. The faster your environment moves, the more critical it becomes to reconfigure quickly. That makes modular systems, distributed governance, and optionality not just design preferences, but survival traits.</p>



<p>In that light, centralization might get you to success, but it won’t keep you there.</p>



 What’s the Alternative? Success as a Balancing Act  



<p>So let’s ask a different question:</p>



 
 What if success isn’t just about growth, but instead about sustaining healthy tension between centralized power and distributed control? 
 



<p>That’s what good governance often looks like. It’s not pure autonomy or rigid hierarchy. It’s a structure that lets people collaborate without collapsing into uniformity.</p>



<p>This isn’t a utopian call for federating all the things. It’s a call to recognize when centralization is helping and when it’s masking fragility, dependency, or misalignment.</p>



<p>We decentralize within organizations all the time:</p>



 
 We spin up new product teams 



 We delegate budget and decision-making to local units 



 We distribute accountability through OKRs and KPIs 
 



<p>But we do it with clear guardrails, shared incentives, and coordination models. In those cases, decentralization is seen as a sign of maturity, not a threat.</p>



<p>So why do we treat infrastructure decentralization like chaos? (Probably because we don’t do it well, but we can fix that.)</p>



 What This Means for Architecture (and the Org Chart) 



<p>If we accept that centralization is often the default path, not necessarily the best one, then we need to build systems that allow for intentional divergence.</p>



<p>That means:</p>



 
 Designing systems that don’t break when more than one authority exists 



 Structuring metrics to reward adaptability, not just consolidation 



 Treating decentralization not as risk, but as a capacity for complexity 
 



<p>And yes, it also means knowing when centralization is a good choice because it simplifies the right things, not everything.</p>



 Rethinking the Goal 



<p>You don’t need to decentralize your stack into a thousand services. (Good gravy, can you even imagine the insanity?) But you do need to ask:</p>



<p>Are we building systems that grow toward concentration by default because that’s easier to explain, easier to pitch, or easier to measure? Or are we designing for the kinds of success that hold space for flexibility, autonomy, and resilience?</p>



<p>If centralization is the only outcome we allow ourselves to count, we’re optimizing for a world where fragility just looks like efficiency … until it doesn’t. </p>

<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hey everybody, welcome back. This is the third episode in our series on centralization and decentralization, and the balance between the two.</p>



<p>If you’re just tuning in now, here’s what you’ve missed:</p>



 
 In episode one, we explored why resilience isn’t about being centralized or decentralized. It’s about being able to move between the two models when circumstances change. 



 In episode two, we looked at the real cost of building that kind of flexibility. Because optionality isn’t free. It takes planning, coordination, and a willingness to invest before you need it. 
 



 



 Why Is Decentralization a Hard Sell? 



<p>[00:01:01]<br>And that brings us to today’s topic. Why is decentralization often still such a hard sell, especially inside enterprises?</p>



<p>[00:01:09]<br>One answer is because most of our success metrics reward centralization.</p>



<p>[00:01:15]<br>If we don’t challenge how we’re defining success, we’re going to keep optimizing for systems that look great—right up until the point that they don’t.</p>



 



 Centralization and Scale 



<p>[00:01:22]<br>Let’s talk about that in tech. We don’t just love things at scale; we know how to do things at scale fairly well.</p>



<p>[00:01:31]<br>When we’re working with centralized systems, we know the playbook:</p>



 
 Throw more hardware at it 



 Replicate the databases 



 Spin things up in other regions 



 Set up failovers, caching, and routing magic to absorb traffic 
 



<p>And that totally works—up to a point. Even when control is centralized, we’re very good at scaling the infrastructure around it.</p>



<p>[00:01:50]<br>When it comes to decentralized models, we know how to do that too. We just don’t plan that way as often.</p>



<p>[00:01:56]<br>At least not anymore. Think about the protocols from the early days of the Internet: DNS, BGP, SMTP. They’re not flawless or simple, but they work at global scale because they were built to distribute control and survive failure.</p>



<p>[00:02:14]<br>Everyone gets a piece of the responsibilities in those protocols. Everyone can operate within a shared structure. That’s decentralized centralization, and we did it really well.</p>



 



 The Problem with Success Metrics 



<p>[00:02:25]<br>But now, today’s challenge: most of the success metrics we use today, especially in enterprise systems, still push us towards centralization.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>Why? Because it looks faster, is easier to explain, and is a lot easier to report on.</p>



<p>[00:02:40]<br>But when success is only measured by how tightly we can control the system, we end up building architectures that aren’t particularly flexible. And that’s a problem.</p>



 



 Centralization Helped Us Grow—But Does It Still? 



<p>[00:02:49]<br>Now let’s step back for a moment. You might be thinking, “Well, yes, but centralization is what helped us grow as a company, helped us grow at speed.” And yes, you are absolutely right. Centralization often is what helps organizations move fast, simplify complexity, and work at scale. It gives you:</p>



 
 Clean handoffs 



 Predictable systems 



 Fewer moving parts 



 Optimized performance without needing to get everyone to agree on everything 
 



<p>And when you’re trying to move quickly, those things are real advantages.</p>



<p>[00:03:19]<br>But the thing is, those advantages—whether from your infrastructure perspective or your market perspective—don’t last forever.</p>



<p>[00:03:30]<br>Markets might shift, regulations might change, vendor lock-in might become a liability, and the systems that helped you grow start to hold you back.</p>



<p>[00:03:40]<br>There’s a great idea from supply chain strategy that applies here: the faster your environment moves, the more important it becomes to reconfigure quickly.</p>



<p>[00:03:48]<br>And that’s where centralized success starts to crack—not because it failed technically, but because it couldn’t adapt fast enough.</p>



<p>[00:03:56]<br>So the question isn’t, “Didn’t centralization help us grow?” It’s, “Can we keep growing without the ability to be a little bit more flexible?”</p>



 



 Decentralization in Organizations 



<p>[00:04:07]<br>It’s kind of funny—we decentralize all the time, but just not when it comes to our infrastructure and definitely not our identity infrastructures.</p>



<p>Inside organizations, we break up control and distribute responsibility on purpose:</p>



 
 Teams have their own budgets 



 Product groups make roadmap decisions 



 Key performance indicators are set at the department level, not just at the company level 
 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Why? Because trying to control everything from the top down slows you down. It’s more sustainable to align goals than to micromanage every function.</p>



<p>Take a typical enterprise product org as an example. One team focuses on mobile, another on partner integrations, a third on internal tooling. Each team moves independently within shared priorities. They don’t all escalate to the CIO to push code; they’re trusted to make decisions locally based on their goals and context. We don’t call that chaos—we call that autonomy and maturity.</p>



<p>[00:05:05]<br>Think of it like a city: every neighborhood has its own character, maybe its own rules, but they follow the same traffic lights, zoning laws, public services. That’s decentralization with coordination.</p>



<p>[00:05:17]<br>The control, to an extent, is distributed. If we can do this with people and even in governments—if we can handle distributed authority in complex orgs—why does decentralizing infrastructure sometimes feel so risky? It’s not because we can’t do it. It’s because we haven’t applied the same thinking to systems that we apply to teams of people.</p>



 



 Building Flexibility into Identity 



<p>[00:05:42]<br>If centralization has been our default version of success, what does success look like when you build in the flexibility to decentralize?</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>It doesn’t mean blowing up your current architecture, because that would probably be bad and you wouldn’t get very far.</p>



<p>[00:05:56]<br>It doesn’t mean ditching your identity provider or rebuilding everything from scratch, because that also wouldn’t make you very popular and probably wouldn’t get you very far. But it does mean designing for modularity and movement.</p>



<p>[00:06:07]<br>A successful, flexible identity system might include:</p>



 
 Federated logins that work across partners but don’t collapse if one party changes their trust model 



 Credential issuance that’s anchored to your core directory but usable outside your domain 



 Policy enforcement that supports delegation, so different teams or regions can adapt without rewriting global configurations 



 Flexible authentication layers that can shift to support new protocols without breaking legacy systems 
 



<p>[00:06:42]<br>Another good example of flexible identity systems that don’t require a centralized focus.</p>



<p>[00:06:49]<br>Ask yourself in your organization:</p>



 
 Can you change identity providers without breaking logins for 50,000 users? 



 Can you delegate trust without rerouting everything through one central system? 
 



<p>[00:07:03]<br>Are you prepared to adapt when legal or business requirements shift, or will you end up frozen and need to make a plan on the fly?</p>



<p>[00:07:14]<br>Being able to say “yes” to those things—that’s what success with flexibility looks like.</p>



 



 Key Takeaways 



<p>[00:07:25]<br>You don’t have to decentralize everything—and probably shouldn’t. But if your architecture can accommodate controlled divergence and flexibility, you’re set up for long-term success.</p>



<p>[00:07:43]<br>That’s what matters. That’s what’s really cool.</p>



<p>[00:07:46]<br>Here’s the takeaway from today.</p>



<p>[00:07:50]<br>Centralization isn’t the enemy. But if success only counts as scale, simplicity, or speed, that story can get brittle quickly.</p>



<p>[00:08:03]<br>We already know how to decentralize in our org charts and delegate decisions without chaos. We just haven’t always brought that thinking into our infrastructure and identity systems—but we could.</p>



<p>[00:08:15]<br>Success doesn’t have to mean one system to rule them all. It can mean systems that adapt without starting over. That adaptability only works when you’ve got governance built in to support it.</p>



<p>[00:08:30]<br>Our technology is almost good enough—sometimes more than good enough. But shared control takes more than configuration files. It takes structure, accountability, and intention.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>[00:08:53]<br>And remember, resilient systems don’t just run well—they recover well and grow on purpose.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our ongoing reflections on the Many-to-Many project! If you joined us for our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/untangling-complexity-how-can-we-better-support-collaboration-on-complex-and-interconnected-cd83272e68c3">first post</a>, you’ll know we’re trying to reimagine complex governance. For over two years, we’ve been working with diverse partners to understand how groups of organisations can collaborate more effectively to tackle challenges bigger than any single entity could manage alone. This journey has generated a wealth of detailed and complex information.</p>Many-to-Many is designed for groups who want to collaborate to solve complex challenges but require new ideas about value, ownership, and&nbsp;power.<p>One part of our team recently spent an intensive week together in Berlin, focusing on transforming this rich knowledge into accessible information, tools, and insights shared via a digital platform. We committed to “working out loud” and sharing our progress and learnings along the way. Several weeks have passed since our Berlin session and our initial blog post. We had ambitious timelines, and as is often the case with complex projects, the path has had its twists and turns. In this post, we — Michelle, Gurden, and Arianna — share an honest update on what we’ve bumped into, how our thinking has evolved, and the human process of building something meaningful.</p><p>Michelle: So, we talked about “working out loud.” It’s been about four or five weeks since we published the last blog post. We had these grand ambitions in Berlin, thinking we’d have much more to share publicly by now, and that hasn’t quite happened. I’m interested in discussing what we bumped into. What were our blockers? We’ve still made progress, but what prohibited us from moving as quickly as we initially thought?</p><p>Gurden: I can start… I think the process, looking back, has been very human. Let’s be honest, this period, at least in Berlin, had holidays almost every week. Arianna took some time off, and I think some of us got sick. So, if we’re slow, that’s one reason. But secondly, and this was a blessing in disguise for me as the newest team member, I got time for my mind to slowly digest everything. Arianna and I talked about this — this pace allowed our perspective to mould in a nice way, rather than forcing something out.</p><p>I’m very happy that after our workshop, we published the first blog and got a really good signal. Many people commented, liked, and shared it on LinkedIn, and some reached out directly via email. That itself shows what we’re building is on a good path. Then you, Michelle, who is working painstakingly on the Many-to-Many System mega model and documenting your thought process — stopping at key milestones and briefing us. This allowed all three of us to bounce ideas off each other, crystallising, and navigating as we go. Arianna and I started wireframing, which is our way to think out loud, understand, and prioritise.</p><p>But, there’s so much content, so we asked a question to try and help us simply and hone into the real essence — “What needs to be on the homepage?” We started with the journey from the workshop, and we’re evolving. Our first wireframe to what we have now — it’s becoming very tangible. The tangibility has increased a lot since the workshop. It’s getting more visual and taking on a website-like frame. My feedback on the earlier design was that there was too much, maybe 10 buttons, and now it’s becoming more focused. That’s definitely positive. As a coder, I can imagine how we’ll set up the system, the database. I’m looking forward to validating it with other human&nbsp;beings.</p>Thinking through prototyping, going from stories to wireframing steps in the narration<p>Arianna: I can go next. After the workshop, we came to realise how complex it is to navigate the vast amount of information we’re dealing with, especially when it comes to understanding what a person wants, and what they’re struggling with or needing. These two aspects are deeply intertwined, but they unfold across many layers of&nbsp;detail.</p><p>At one point, we found ourselves with a triple navigation system, full of sub-navigations. It became clear that this structure, instead of helping, would likely add confusion; even for someone already familiar with the content but searching for something specific.</p><p>Therefore we spent a lot of time rethinking categorization and identifying different types of information. We started asking: is this one website, one narration explanation? Or could we introduce a double narration including tools and needs? That’s when it clicked — we actually need stories. Not just technical explanations or dry structures.</p><p>The knowledge Michelle, Annette, and Angela bring is full of stories — rich, lived, and layered. And stories are powerful, especially for someone new to a platform. They provide orientation, connection, and&nbsp;meaning.</p><p>Michelle: I want to quickly revisit what you were saying, Gurden, about the time to digest. It’s fascinating, and I’m making a meta-point here. I’ve been trying to digest everything we’ve learned over the past multiple years into our Many-to-Many System. In almost every fifth slide, I’m thinking, “We didn’t all have enough time to digest this at the time we were doing it.” And I’ve realised that’s a key point because of so many unfulfilled potentials. It created a real centralisation because if the whole collaboration didn’t fully understand what was going on, knowledge tended to centralize back into a few people. So, at the end of the day, learning happens at the pace humans can learn, mixed in with all the other stuff they have going on in their lives. As a meta-reflection, we just have to keep reminding ourselves that no matter how good the structures or digital tools are, a collaboration is ultimately about humans. That’s always going to be a&nbsp;factor.</p><p>In terms of the process of building this system, I liked what both of you were saying about refinement, categorization, and creating intelligent information architectures. How do we make this so that someone can actually enter this world and find their way around? For me, that has been the hardest part — consistently zooming in and zooming out. Thinking about something at the highest conceptual, strategic level, all the way down to what we learned, how we structured it, and then how we put this information onto a website where people know what button to push. This is a very wide-spanning problem&nbsp;space.</p><p>The last thing is this concept Arianna alluded to: we’ve been bouncing ideas around. The three of us have been pushing ahead in our own parts but checking in regularly. Frankly, without those check-in moments, none of this could have progressed. It’s so dense that it needs more than one brain on it at a time to untangle&nbsp;it.</p>Bouncing ideas around, but with precise meaning and positionalities<p>Gurden: Yes, what both of you said resonates with me. We’re calling it “systems,” but humans are at the center and heart of everything. That’s who we’re making it for. In our wireframing, we concluded that the first thing is the mindset people are coming from, and then we came to stories because that’s what humans connect&nbsp;with.</p><p>It’s been great having you both to bounce ideas and discuss any confusion. But I’ll highlight this as a challenge as well: when we put this website out, there will be one brave person going through it by themselves, most likely. How this website gives that companionship is something we’ve been thinking about. We’ve used words like “guide” and “field guide.” Maybe the brand and design should embody this — like, “Hey, we’re here, we understand it’s a hard, human thing, and we’re here to&nbsp;help.”</p><p>Michelle: Maybe that’s a great place to kind of end this blog? By asking, has anyone seen that done well? Does anyone know of any really great digital spaces that are trying to be a guide to help people navigate complex information, especially in a collaborative or shared, multi-person context? I&nbsp;haven’t.</p><p>Gurden: A lot of sites have that chatbot thing pop up on the right. I absolutely hate it; for me, that is not the answer. Maybe the bot is getting smarter with AI, but I don’t think that’s enough for our&nbsp;case.</p><p>Arianna: It’s about creating an ongoing, embodied story. One that offers orientation, not just information. At the same time, it needs to provide usable tools. So there’s a dual role: guiding through narrative, and supporting through function.</p><p>Not just about simplifying the complexity, but offering clarity and companionship within&nbsp;it.</p><p>On that note, we’ll pause this reflection. The journey continues, and the challenge of creating a truly supportive and navigable digital space for complex collaboration is one we’re embracing. We’d love to hear your thoughts.

 What is the problem with the higher education credentials verification? 



<p>Weeks of time-consuming, error-prone effort shouldn’t be required to verify academic records. But from 2022 to 2025:</p>



 
 \$600 M+ lost annually to fabricated diplomas. 



 5–14 days for each manual verification. 



 Under 50 % of universities use multi-factor authentication (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex" title="">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 
 



 Higher Education Degree and Certification Datacheck: 



<p>This article illustrates how decentralized identity (SSI) and Extrimian’s solutions eliminate these pain points with real-world numbers, self-evident steps, and a path to instant, fraud-proof verification.</p>



 



 1. Why traditional Verification System Fails? 



 1.1 Credential Fraud Runs Wild 



 
 \$600 M+ lost each year to fake or altered diplomas. 



 30 % of job candidates forge degrees on resumes (<a href="https://www.resumebuilder.com/resume-examples/1-4-americans-have-lied-on-their-resume/" title="">ResumeBuilder, 2023</a>). 
 



 1.2 Manual, Slow Workflows 



 
 5–14 days per transcript or diploma order. 



 $20–$30 fee per manual verification. 
 



 1.3 Security &amp; Compliance Loopholes 



 
 Centralized databases are easy targets. 



 Less than 50 % MFA implementation (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 



 Email and fax expose personal data to interception.

 2. What is Decentralized Digital Identity? 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity decentralizes control: credentials live in students’ digital wallets, not in some central silo.</p>



 
 Fraud-proof: Cryptographic signatures keep out tampering. 



 Instant verification: Verify authenticity in seconds. 



 Selective disclosure: Reveal only what’s needed (e.g., “Graduated 2025” without full transcript). 



 Built-in compliance: Complies with GDPR, FERPA, and LGPD by design.

 Why Phishing-Resistant MFA Isn’t Optional Anymore  
<p>The escalating sophistication of phishing and social engineering attacks has pushed organizations towards stronger authentication methods. Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), particularly solutions leveraging FIDO2/WebAuthn standards, is a big leap forward in security posture.<br><br>Many organizations utilize hardware-based FIDO2 authenticators like YubiKeys by Yubico, widely recognized as a gold standard for physical tokens, preventing credential theft and account takeover at the point of authentication. Deploying any security key represents a serious commitment to security, effectively neutralizing threats that rely on stolen passwords or easily intercepted one-time codes.</p>  
 The Broader Picture of Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
Achieving true end-to-end security requires a strategy that extends beyond the initial implementation of phishing-resistant authentication methods. While these methods are a critical defense, organizations often discover that phishing-resistant authentication&nbsp;
alone
&nbsp;is not enough to address all security and operational aspects.
<br>
Specifically, when deploying physical hardware authenticators, which are a common way to achieve strong phishing resistance, organizations can encounter significant operational complexities.<br><br>These "Day 2 problems" involve managing these physical tokens across their entire lifecycle, a challenge that can be particularly acute within large or widely distributed teams. It’s important to understand that these are not shortcomings of any particular brand of hardware authenticator, but rather inherent complexities in managing any physical security hardware at scale
<br> 
 Challenge 1: Secure Onboarding and YubiKey Provisioning  
<p>Getting the right key into the hands of the right user securely is the critical first step.</p> 
  
  The Identity Verification Imperative: Before a YubiKey is issued (in person or shipped), organizations must be certain of the recipient's identity. Standard procedures may not suffice, especially for remote workers. How do you reliably verify someone you've never met?  
  Risk of Mis-Provisioning: Relying on known weak checks like email or simple attestations (KBA) creates risk. An incorrectly provisioned key compromises the entire security model from the start, potentially handing access directly to an attacker impersonating a new employee.  
  
 Challenge 2: Navigating Ongoing Identity Lifecycle Management  
<p>The physical nature of YubiKeys introduces critical ongoing management needs.</p> 
  
  Loss, Theft, Damage, and Lockouts: YubiKeys can be lost, stolen, damaged, or even locked due to too many failed PIN attempts or forgotten credentials. Each of these scenarios requires a secure recovery process, particularly for remote users.  
  Administrative Overhead: Tracking inventory, managing assignments, handling secure revocation for lost/stolen tokens or for departing employees, and ensuring firmware updates add complexity and usually require manual processes to avoid security gaps.  
  
 Challenge 3: Phishable Recovery Methods Undermine Security  
<p>Perhaps the most significant challenge arises when a user loses their YubiKey, especially if it's their primary or even sole FIDO2 authenticator.</p> 
  
  The Recovery Conundrum: YubiKeys are designed to be resistant to remote attacks. This strength means recovery processes must not create a weak link that attackers can circumvent.  
  The Pitfall of Phishable Fallbacks: In the case of a lost YubiKey, reverting back to easily phished methods like SMS/voice OTPs, email links, or security questions for recovery completely undermines the security gains provided by the YubiKey. Attackers know to target these weak recovery paths.  
  The Need for Verified Recovery: A truly secure system requires a recovery process that incorporates strong, multi-factor identity verification. Only after strong identity assurance should you allow legitimate users to regain access or register a new key. This will keep the door closed to social engineering or deepfake attacks.  
  
 YubiKeys Need Integrated Credential Management and Identity Verification  
<p>This guide explores how integrating a dedicated identity assurance platform like HYPR can effectively bridge these management and identity verification gaps. By complementing your Yubico deployment, HYPR helps manage these credentials in your environment and integrates &nbsp;multi-factor identity verification into the key lifecycle moments, ensuring your investment in phishing-resistant hardware delivers its full security potential.</p> 
<p>Let's see how the HYPR Identity Assurance platform addresses the gaps.</p> 
 Secure Onboarding and Hiring with Candidate Verification  
<p>How do you confidently issue a powerful security key like a YubiKey to a new employee, especially one working remotely, without creating an undue security risk or friction? Legacy methods relying on KBA, email verification, manager approvals, or even just shipping a key to a home address lack the level of identity verification needed, to be sure you don’t fall victim to a social engineering attack.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s customizable Identity Verification (IDV) integrates directly into your onboarding flow, before any credentials, including a YubiKey, are provisioned. This isn't just a simple check; this verification involves multiple checks of various factors, in a layered approach, that is tailored exactly to your organization's risk tolerance:</p> 
 Device Check  
<p>HYPR first detects the device the user is on to do the verification, and can check if it is the expected device.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>A geolocation location detection is performed and compared against expected location. Radius distance from expected location can be customized.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Users are prompted to scan a government-issued ID (driver's license, passport) using their smartphone. HYPR analyzes the document for authenticity, checking security features and tampering evidence, and checks the validity of the document against national databases.</p> 
 Biometric Facial Recognition  
<p>To ensure the person presenting the ID is its rightful owner, HYPR employs facial biometric matching, comparing a live selfie capture to the photo on the ID document or in your own data stores. Additionally, liveness detection prevents spoofing attempts while using photos or videos.</p> 
 Manager Attestation  
<p>Combine live video verification and a secure chat, seamless experience human verification transaction. Supervisors or IT can attest to the identity of their team members, adding an extra layer of assurance.</p> 
 Example: Secure Onboarding with HYPR  
<p>Imagine a new remote hire receives an onboarding link on their first day. They are guided through the HYPR identity verification. Only upon successful verification is their identity confirmed, allowing subsequent steps like registering their primary authentication methods, like their assigned YubiKey.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This process securely binds the verified physical identity to the digital identity and the associated credentials. It drastically reduces the risk of provisioning keys to fraudulent accounts and establishes a trusted foundation for the user's entire lifecycle.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Build Phishing-Resistant Account Recovery Workflows  
<p>As mentioned previously, the security gains of YubiKeys are instantly nullified if a user who loses their key can recover their account using phishable methods like SMS OTPs, email links, or knowledge-based answers (KBAs). We know attackers actively target these weak recovery paths at the help desk or user levels.</p> 
<p>HYPR eliminates this vulnerability by ensuring recovery processes maintain the same high level of security as primary authentication. When a user needs to recover access (e.g., after losing their YubiKey), they leverage other already registered and verified strong authentication factors managed by HYPR as well as a re-verification of identity:</p> 
 Multi-Factor Recovery  
<p>Recovery typically involves using the HYPR mobile application on a registered smartphone, protected by device biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint) or a secure PIN, potentially combined with other factors or contextual checks depending on policy. Should more identity assurance be needed, HYPR can also push the user through an identity re-verification process.</p> 
 Self-Service Enablement  
<p>To reduce the burden on IT teams, users can securely initiate recovery themselves through a guided, secure workflow, often without needing costly or time-consuming help desk intervention.</p> 
<p>In cases where a YubiKey is lost, damaged, or needs to be replaced, users can quickly register a new device once their identity is re-verified through a secure recovery flow.</p> 
<p>For scenarios where a device is locked, for instance after too many failed PIN attempts or a forgotten PIN, recovery can still be handled efficiently through a help-desk–driven approach. With HYPR Affirm, this process is safeguarded by strong identity verification, ensuring only the rightful user regains access.<br>Account recovery becomes as resistant to phishing and social engineering as the initial login, preserving the integrity of the entire security system. This directly addresses the most significant operational and security pain points associated with hardware token deployments.</p> 
 Beyond Login: Contextual Awareness and Continuous Authentication  
 Dynamic Trust  
<p>Security isn't static. HYPR can optionally integrate risk signals from devices, users, and browsers, to provide continuous authentication and adaptive access control, even after a successful YubiKey login.</p> 
 Risk Signals  
<p>Factors like device health (e.g., integrating with endpoint detection and response tools like CrowdStrike), geographic location ("impossible travel" scenarios), network reputation, and even behavioral signals can inform a real-time risk score.</p> 
 Adaptive Risk Policies  
<p>Based on this score, HYPR can dynamically adjust security requirements. A low-risk login might proceed seamlessly after the initial YubiKey tap, while a higher-risk scenario could trigger a request for an additional factor or limit access privileges. This allows organizations to balance security posture with user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Streamline YubiKey Management: From Friction to Flow  
 User-Driven YubiKey Enrollment &amp; Renewal  
<p>HYPR turns YubiKey onboarding into a self-service experience. End users pair their YubiKeys, automatically enroll X.509 certificates, and enjoy seamless certificate renewals, with no routine IT involvement required and continuous access guaranteed.</p> 
 Bird’s-Eye Admin Visibility  
<p>While day-to-day enrollment and renewals run themselves, HYPR’s Console Integration gives administrators a consolidated dashboard of every YubiKey enrollment, certificate status, and recent identity verification events. This eliminates the need for spreadsheets point tools.</p> 
 Graceful Deprovisioning  
<p>Rather than manually “removing” keys from the admin console (which doesn’t revoke the certificate on the device), HYPR enable endpoint-driven deprovisioning. Users retire lost or retired keys directly from their workstation, ensuring true on-device certificate removal when possible.</p> 
 Resilient Multi-Factor Backup  
<p>Users can register multiple authenticators as primary and backup. YubiKeys plus HYPR is an ideal combination, so if one factor goes missing, users still authenticate securely through another, dramatically cutting lockouts and support tickets.</p> 
 Achieve End-to-End Phishing Resistance with HYPR  
<p>The journey towards zero trust cybersecurity demands more than just deploying strong authentication factors; it requires a holistic approach that secures the entire identity lifecycle. YubiKeys represent a vital component in this strategy, offering unparalleled phishing resistance at the point of login. However, as we've explored, their true potential is only fully unlocked when paired with solutions that address the critical challenges of high-assurance identity verification and streamlined lifecycle management.</p> 
 Key Steps to Optimize Yubikey Deployments  
<p>Moving from understanding these challenges to implementing effective solutions requires a deliberate approach made custom for your environment. As you consider how to optimize your YubiKey deployment or plan a new one, here are some suggested actionable steps to take:</p> 
  
  Assess Your Current Reality: Honestly evaluate your existing processes. 
    
    Where does friction exist in your YubiKey issuance and management?  
    How are you currently handling remote employee onboarding and identity proofing?  
    Map out your current account recovery workflow. Does it rely on phishable factors like SMS or security questions?<br>Identifying these specific pain points is the first step.  
      
  Define Your Identity Assurance Needs: Determine the level of certainty required when verifying identities.&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Is a basic check sufficient, or do compliance regulations and risk levels demand high-assurance methods like biometric verification against government IDs, especially for privileged users?  
      
  Chart the Full User Lifecycle: Document every stage where a user interacts with credentials, particularly YubiKeys. Pinpoint potential vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in provisioning, replacement, temporary access needs, and deprovisioning.  
  Scrutinize Your Recovery Strategy: This is paramount. If your recovery process undermines your FIDO2 investment, it needs immediate attention. Define requirements for a truly phishing-resistant recovery mechanism.  
  Identify Integration Requirements: List the key systems (your Identity Provider (IdP), HR Information System (HRIS), endpoint security tools) that any management and identity verification solution must seamlessly integrate with.  
  
 Key Questions to Ask Potential Solution Providers  
<p>Armed with your internal assessment, engage vendors with targeted questions to understand how their solutions address these challenges, that are specific to your environment, when integrating with YubiKeys:</p> 
  
  Onboarding &amp; Identity Proofing:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How specifically does your solution verify the identity of remote users before a YubiKey is provisioned to them?  
    What methods (e.g., document scanning, liveness checks, data validation) do you employ to achieve high assurance, and how is this verified identity securely linked to the user's account and key?  
      
  Secure Account Recovery:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Describe your workflow for a user who has lost their YubiKey. Importantly, how do you enable secure, self-service recovery without falling back on phishable factors like SMS, email links, or KBAs?  
    How is phishing resistance maintained throughout?  
      
  Lifecycle Automation:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Explain how your platform automates YubiKey provisioning and deprovisioning by integrating with systems like our IdP based on user lifecycle events (joiners, movers, leavers).  
      
  Lost/Stolen Key Management:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    What is the secure process within your system for handling lost or stolen YubiKeys, including issuing replacements and potentially providing secure temporary access?  
      
  Integration &amp; Visibility:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How does your solution integrate with [mention your specific IdP, e.g., Okta, Entra ID]?&nbsp;  
    Can it provide a unified administrative view of YubiKeys alongside other authentication methods?  
      
  User Experience:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How do you ensure these necessary security steps (IDV, secure recovery) are implemented with minimal friction for the end-user?  
      
  Scalability &amp; Compliance:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How does your platform scale to manage potentially thousands of YubiKeys?  
    What specific reporting and audit logs are generated to help meet compliance requirements?

<p>A Real-World Story of Scale, Trust &amp; Blockchain in Action</p>







<p></p>



<p>Earlier this month, over 3.1 million students across Maharashtra received their SSC and HSC exam results online. Dhiway had the opportunity to build and manage the backend infrastructure for this release in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/navneet-education-ltd-/">Navneet Education Limited</a></p>



<p>It was a significant milestone — not just in terms of volume, but because of what it represented:</p>



 
 The need for reliable and fast access 



 The demand for tamper-resistant, verifiable documents 



 And the expectation of a seamless digital experience for every student 
 



 <br>The Task 



<p>Navneet approached us with a clear challenge: Can you help us publish board results for millions of students — quickly, securely, and without system failure?</p>



<p>They also wanted each result document to be verifiable using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/cord-network/">CORD</a> blockchain, to ensure long-term trust and authenticity. This meant handling high user concurrency, delivering fast response times, and ensuring every student could access and download their results without delay.</p>



 <br>Our Approach 



<p>We focused on three core principles: Performance, resilience, and trust.</p>



<p>Here’s how we addressed them:</p>



 
 Cloud-native setup using AWS, with auto-scaling and rate-limiting to manage traffic surges 



 Multi-layer caching to support sub-second response times 



 Client-side rendering, where appropriate, to reduce backend load 



 QR code integration on result PDFs, backed by blockchain hashes 



 Mobile-first design to support access from any device, even in low-bandwidth areas 
 



<p>We also ran extensive load tests with JMeter, simulating double the expected traffic to ensure we were prepared.</p>



Results at scale, delivered with speed and trust — 3.1 M+ students, zero downtime.



<p></p>



<p>Over two separate days of results publication, the system was resilient and provided a positive experience to students anxiously awaiting their results and seeking to download the documents.</p>



 <br>Why Blockchain? 



<p>Every result PDF included a QR code linked to a verifiable digital record anchored on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/cord-network/">CORD</a> Blockchain, built for trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>This ensured that:</p>



 
 Each result document was tamper-resistant 



 Verification could happen instantly, from anywhere, without needing to log into a portal 
 



<p>We didn’t use blockchain as a buzzword. We used it to add real value, adding a layer of trust and permanence to a document that often marks a turning point in a student’s academic journey.</p>



 <br>Key Takeaways 



 
 UX and accessibility are critical – A smooth front-end experience is essential; users only benefit from fast systems if they can easily access and use them. 



 Verification matters – Especially in education, where credentials must be trusted and stand the test of time. 



 Scale is manageable – With the right preparation and infrastructure, even millions of concurrent users can be served reliably. 
 



 <br>Looking Ahead 



<p>This project brought together everything we care about at Dhiway-infrastructure: digital trust and solving meaningful, real-world problems. Together with Navneet and the Maharashtra State Board, the Dhiway team has demonstrated a new way of managing examination results and created a positive experience for the students and their guardians.</p>



<p>If you’re exploring how to deliver results, certificates, or credentials secure and scalable way, we are happy to share what we’ve learned.</p>

Since then, we’ve progressed into deeper development and analysis. Through this process, we’ve revisited our technical assumptions, stress-tested the economics, and re-evaluated how HPP can best scale and integrate into the broader ecosystem.</p><p>After careful consideration, we believe a strategic course correction is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Today, we’re introducing AIP-22, a proposal to migrate HPP’s infrastructure roadmap from OP Stack to ARB Stack (Arbitrum) and realign HPP’s future with the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p><p>This is not just a launch decision but a long-term directional shift.</p> Why We’re Proposing the Shift from OP Stack to ARB&nbsp;Stack   Performance Flexibility for AI-Driven Use Cases: ARB Stack offers greater control over block time and execution parameters, essential for data-heavy and AI-coordinated workloads. This flexibility allows us to tailor performance as needed, which is especially important as HPP grows beyond traditional smart contracts into intelligent agents and real-time data environments.  Smarter Resource Management: ARB Stack allows for more efficient resource allocation across compute and storage, enabling us to scale HPP without incurring unnecessary overhead. It supports the kind of modular, elastic architecture needed for future-facing protocol&nbsp;design.  Ecosystem Maturity &amp; DeFi Synergy: Arbitrum’s L2 ecosystem is the most active in the space, particularly in DeFi, and aligns closely with HPP’s vision to become a backbone for data, liquidity, and AI infrastructure. Migrating to ARB Stack positions HPP within an already thriving ecosystem and deeply integrated into the broader Ethereum&nbsp;economy.  Network Effects &amp; Onboarding Opportunities: Migrating now allows HPP to tap into a much broader pool of users, developers, partners, and liquidity providers. We see Arbitrum as a key network for onboarding both Web3-native builders and data-first AI projects, which are central to HPP’s&nbsp;mission.  Strategic Collaboration Potential: Our collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs is already underway. This opens up technical alignment and potential access to grant programs, integration support, and co-marketing opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem.   AIP-22 Summary <p>To finalize this shift, we are bringing the decision back to the community through AIP-22. This proposal asks the community to vote on whether HPP should migrate its future development from OP Stack to ARB Stack as its official Layer 2 infrastructure.</p>  Proposal: Confirm ARB Stack (Arbitrum) as the official L2 infrastructure for&nbsp;HPP  Reasoning: Greater technical flexibility, onboarding opportunities, and strong ecosystem alignment  Voting Period: May 21st via Snapshot (<a href="https://snapshot.box/#/s:aergodao.eth">https://snapshot.box/#/s:aergodao.eth</a>)  Eligibility: To participate in the vote, you must hold your <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%24AERGO&amp;src=cashtag_click">$AERGO</a> tokens before 17:00 PM KST / 8:00 AM UTC on May&nbsp;21st.  <p>We recommend participating in the vote using MetaMask, Phantom, or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet.

<p>“This comprehensive blog post will tell you what ID Document Recognition is, its working scenario, and some benefits.”</p>
<p>Identity verification has become the cornerstone for secure access and online digital transactions. In this era, where cyber threats and data breaches are increasing, agencies and institutions are moving toward the most reliable solutions.</p>
<p>Among them, one of the most critical technologies that fight against such attacks is ID Document Recognition.</p>
<p>Wondering about what this is? If yes! Buckle up! This blog post is for you. In this guide, we will explore everything about this technology, including its overview, working process, and role in online security.</p>
<p>So, let’s proceed further…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ID Document Recognition: A Brief Overview 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID Document recognition SDK</a> is an innovative technology that refers to the process of automatically verifying and identifying personal documents, such as passports, ID cards, and driver’s licenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this process is implemented, agencies and institutions come to know whether such documents presented by a user are real or fake. This innovative technology ensures security enhancement in every field of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ID Document Recognition Process 
<p>Now you would probably be thinking, what is the technology behind the ID Document Liveness Detection SDK? To answer your question, we have explored our guide through this section. Read it carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Document Capture 
<p>In this first step, institutions capture high-quality images of documents using scanners or high-resolution cameras. Both the front and the back are captured by this scanner.. It takes a few minutes as documents, as the most important and personal information is engraved on such documents. This first step is also implemented by ensuring the clarity of the documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Extract the Text 
<p>In this second step, the important information engraved on these documents is extracted. As far as our doubt goes, you will surely ask, how such data is extracted from these scanned papers? Right? Luckily, nowadays, we have another innovative technology that is used to extract text from scanned papers. This technology is named <a href="https://picturetotext.info/blog/what-is-ocr-technology">OCR(Optical Character Recognition)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Analyze the Data 
<p>Once the extraction is done, the next step is to analyze and verify the data. The system compares this data against known templates, databases, and pre-configured rules. It verifies whether barcodes and QR codes, Font and layout alignment, and other features are real or fake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Liveness Detection And Face Matching 
<p>This is the most important stage of verification in which the presence of the users is ensured. Systems now incorporate liveness detection along with facial recognition ID verification. This facial ID verification identifies whether the users during verification are physically present and using the real ID images or not. This facial ID recognition has two different types. Active liveness detection and passive liveness detection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Decision And Result Generation 
<p>After passing through all technical verification steps, the final step is about making the decision and generating the results. If everything is aligned with the valid rules, the agencies or companies mark the documents as authentic and verified. This decision is generated within a few seconds, ensuring the seamless authentication process.</p>
<p></p>
 Why ID Document Recognition Matters? 
<p>In this section, we will throw light on why the <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID document liveness detection SDK</a> matters. There are countless benefits of this technology. We will discuss a few of them below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Fraud Prevention 
 
 
<p>As hinted in the previous sections, this cutting-edge technology is implemented to prevent fraud, especially in finance and educational institutions.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Build Customer Trust 
 
 
<p>Once the fraud is prevented, it automatically builds customer trust. They heavily believe in the systems and make their investments without fear of anything.</p>
 
 
 Cost Saving 
 
 
<p>Agencies use a fake ID detector that is budget-friendly. Such detectors eliminate the need for hiring extra security staff. In short, you can add the extra layers of security without breaking your bank.</p>
 
 
 KYC Compliance 
 
 
<p>ID recognition supports compliance with KYC and ensures the customer’s identity. This helps businesses meet regulatory standards, preventing illegal activities.</p>
 
 
 Streamlined Onboarding 
 
 
<p>Automated ID Document verification makes the onboarding process faster and easier for users. This feature reduces friction and improves customers’ overall experience.</p>
<p></p>
 Pros And Cons of ID Document Recognition 
<p>This section of the blog is all about some pros and cons of ID document liveness detection. We will discuss them briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Pros&nbsp; 
<p>This technology prevents fraud concerning spoofing images and videos.</p>
<p>It is used as the international authentication method, not only as a national ID authentication.</p>
<p>The system can confirm the possibilities of information from external registers.</p>
<p>Passwords can be reset using the recheck of selfies and videos.</p>
<p>This technology incorporates AI and ML for better and faster results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cons&nbsp; 
<p>Some solutions require the user’s ID document information to be stored.</p>
<p>The initial registration can sometimes be very difficult.</p>
<p> Agencies need a phone with NFC functionality for chip scanning.</p>

 Weekly AMAs &amp; Community-Driven Direction <p>As part of our commitment to weekly AMAs, we’re continuing to update the community on progress, direction, and your top questions. This session focused on the upcoming vote, our Layer 2 (L2) direction, ongoing developments around HPP, and a few fun curveball topics from the community.</p> 1. AIP-22 Vote: Building on&nbsp;Arbitrum <p>This week's big announcement was the launch of a Snapshot-based community vote, this time to decide whether Arbitrum will be the foundation for our Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>Why Arbitrum?<br>Ben explained the rationale behind this proposed direction:</p>  High transaction volume and network&nbsp;activity  A mature ecosystem with strong infrastructure support  Backing from the Arbitrum Foundation — including marketing and dev coordination  A thriving developer and user community  <blockquote>“We put Arbitrum through rigorous due diligence and compared it with other options. The traction and support were simply unmatched.”</blockquote><p>🗓️ Voting&nbsp;Details:</p>  Make sure your Aergo tokens are in a Snapshot-compatible wallet before May&nbsp;21  The outcome will determine whether Arbitrum becomes the base for Aergo’s new Layer&nbsp;2  <p>The team supports this direction, but it’s ultimately the community’s decision.</p> 2. HPP: What’s Happening Now? <p>We also touched on House Party Protocol (HPP), which marks the public blockchain’s shift into a modern, AI-first architecture.</p><p>The previous vote confirmed:</p>  A token contract&nbsp;upgrade  A new, forward-looking token&nbsp;model  Expand into&nbsp;L2  <p>Ben emphasized that:</p>  The new token(House Party Protocol) will come with a new&nbsp;ticker  A 1:1 token swap will take place in late&nbsp;2025  The Living Roadmap (a public Google Sheet) is available for real-time progress&nbsp;tracking  <blockquote>“HPP isn’t just a rebrand. It’s a major leap forward — aligning us with the future of decentralized AI and intelligent data infrastructure.”</blockquote> 3. What About Aergo’s Enterprise Clients? <p>There was a common question: “Does this mean the enterprise side of Aergo is shutting&nbsp;down?”</p><p>The answer is a clear&nbsp;no.</p>  The Aergo Enterprise Team continues operating  Government and enterprise clients remain unaffected  The changes (vote, token, HPP) are all focused on the public chain&nbsp;only  <blockquote>“Enterprise systems keep running exactly as expected. We’re evolving the public chain — not touching enterprise infrastructure.”</blockquote> 4. Are We Still Focused on&nbsp;Korea? <p>While Aergo has strong roots and visibility in Korea, being listed on all licensed Korean exchanges, the project has always had a global&nbsp;focus.</p><p>Ben clarified:</p>  Aergo is listed on major global platforms like Coinbase and Crypto.com  There’s no “Korea-only” strategy — just strong local trading&nbsp;activity  Future marketing will work to further globalize the&nbsp;brand  <blockquote>“We’re working hard to break the ‘Korean project’ label. Our reach and ambition are&nbsp;global.”</blockquote> 5. AI + Blockchain in Agriculture? Let’s&nbsp;Talk <p>A surprise community question asked about the role of AI and blockchain in farming and agriculture. Here’s what Ben had to&nbsp;say:</p>  AI can monitor crops and livestock 24/7, reducing labor costs and improving food&nbsp;quality  Blockchain enables traceable supply chains, storing data like pesticide usage, logistics, and&nbsp;more  Together, they can optimize farming and distribution with precision  It’s an underexplored but high-potential use case for AI +&nbsp;Web3.   6. Listings: Any&nbsp;News? <p>Inevitably, someone asked about Binance spot listings. Here’s the&nbsp;update:</p>  Token listings are controlled by exchanges, not&nbsp;projects  Paying for listings often leads to bad outcomes for builders, teams, and other stakeholders  Aergo is already re-listed on Binance Futures, as well as many spot markets&nbsp;globally  No new listing news at this&nbsp;time  <blockquote>“We want to be on every trusted platform — but we don’t control listing decisions. No promises, no paid shortcuts.”</blockquote> ✅ Final&nbsp;Words <p>We’re excited about what’s ahead, and your participation makes it all possible. This vote on Arbitrum is a major decision point. It represents a potential new layer of scalability, community alignment, and long-term growth.</p><p>Remember: Get your tokens ready for Snapshot by May 21.<br>Check the Living Roadmap anytime to follow our development progress.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/ama-7-recap-aip-22-vote-arbitrum-l2-and-the-future-of-hpp-7d51bf9a3408">AMA #7 Recap: AIP-22 Vote, Arbitrum L2, and the Future of HPP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digital banking has never moved faster. For platforms powering fintechs, neobanks, and embedded financial services, onboarding new customers quickly and securely is essential, not only for user experience but also for compliance.</p><p>That’s where KYC, or Know Your Customer, comes in—the set of identity verification steps financial institutions are legally required to perform before offering services like bank accounts, credit, or investment tools. It's a critical part of protecting against fraud or money laundering. </p><p>However, while some digital services have advanced rapidly, the identity verification tools that power KYC have lagged behind. Most platforms still rely on artificial intelligence to analyze images of physical documents, a patchwork process that creates friction for users and uncertainty for compliance teams. As fraud tactics become more sophisticated, these systems are showing their limits.</p><p>It’s time to modernize how identity is verified online, and that starts with mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), a secure and verifiable form of digital identity issued by state governments.</p> The Bottleneck in Digital Onboarding <p>If your current onboarding flow involves photo uploads and long processing times, you’re likely to see drop-off and risk.</p><p>Even the best AI-powered verification tools struggle with edge cases, false rejections, and new forms of fraud. Meanwhile, generative AI is making it easier than ever to spoof IDs and deepfake “live” videos that pass existing checks.</p><p>The impact is real: one study found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.signicat.com/the-battle-to-onboard-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com">over half of users abandon onboarding</a>&nbsp;when it becomes too slow or confusing. For digital platforms competing for users, these delays can directly impact revenue and retention.</p> mDLs: Trust That’s Built In <p>Mobile driver’s licenses are verifiable digital credentials issued by state governments and stored on a user’s smartphone. Unlike photos of paper IDs, they’re cryptographically signed, instantly verifiable, and privacy-preserving. This allows relying parties such as banks, fintechs, and marketplaces to instantly confirm authenticity without storing or interpreting sensitive user data.</p><p>For digital platforms, this means:</p>  Instant verification: no photos or manual review needed  Reduced fraud: credentials are cryptographically bound to specific devices  Streamlined UX: users can verify in seconds without leaving your flow  Privacy-first: only necessary data (ex. age, name) is shared  Compliance-ready: aligns with evolving KYC/AML requirements  <p>With more than <a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/data/digital-ids-are-here-but-where-are-they-used-and-accepted?utm_source=chatgpt.com">5.6 million Americans now holding mDLs</a> and TSA actively accepting them at airports, real-world adoption is accelerating. States across the U.S. are continuing to expand issuance, creating a growing population of users with ready-to-use digital IDs.</p> A Strategic Shift <p>Platforms that embed verifiable digital credentials into their onboarding flows unlock many benefits, like fewer drop-offs, lower fraud risk, and stronger audit trails. They also gain operational efficiency, reducing the need for manual reviews and exception handling.</p><p>And this is just the beginning. As mDLs and other verifiable digital credentials become more widely adopted by governments, retailers, and beyond, those who invest early in integration will be positioned to lead in trust, speed, and compliance.</p> Learn More <p>SpruceID provides the secure infrastructure needed to issue and verify verifiable digital credentials, such as mobile driver’s licenses, helping organizations streamline identity workflows and reduce onboarding risk.

<p>The FBI is raising the alarm over an escalation in North Korean nation-state threat actors leveraging generative AI, laptop farms, and deepfakes to successfully infiltrate large companies through remote job applications, despite widely available solutions that can thwart such attacks.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/gartners-right-why-workforce-identity-verification-cant-wait/">this threat</a> before. But according to a recent <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/north-korea-workers-infiltrate-fortune-500/">Cyberscoop.com</a> report, it’s getting worse. Thousands of North Korean operatives have secured jobs at more than a hundred Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Using stolen or synthetic identity information and generative AI, these impostors produce polished LinkedIn profiles and identity credentials. Deepfake technology is used for video calls, sometimes unconvincingly, though not often enough. Laptop farms in the US enable the infiltrators to spoof local IPs. Moreover, the imposters usually excel at the actual job, supported by an entire pod of 10 to 20 operatives performing the work for the fraudulent identity behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Speaking on a panel at the RSA Conference 2025, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-warns-north-korean-agents-030300546.html">FBI Special Agent</a> Elizabeth Pelker reported that when employers find out these imposters may be agents, they often hesitate to terminate them. “I think more often than not, I get the comment, “Oh, but Johnny is our best performer. Do we actually need to fire them?’” There are plenty of reasons to say an easy yes.</p>
 Fake Workers, Real Money 
<p>According to WIRED, each impostor and pod can send as much as<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-stole-your-tech-job-ai-interviews/"> $3 million</a> a year back to Pyongyang just in wages. In Cyberscoop’s estimation, that could be as much as <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/north-korea-workers-infiltrate-fortune-500/#:~:text=A%20thousand%20IT%20workers%20earning,different%20organizations%20concurrently%2C%20Carmakal%20said.">$100 million</a> funneled annually to the North Korean regime.</p>
<p>However, these operatives also use their corporate footholds to exfiltrate data and intellectual property, plant malware, and occasionally threaten executives with blackmail. They can also act on a larger scale, disrupting critical services or infrastructure. It’s no wonder the FBI is offering <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/dprk-it-workers">up to $5 million</a> for information that leads to the disruption of these operations.</p>
<p>It’s alarmingly easy to generate the identities used in these scams. Once the purview of skilled operatives, a steady flow of corporate data breaches coupled with the rise of “crime-as-a-service” outfits means even non-experts can leverage realistic personas complete with fabricated LinkedIn profiles, convincing virtual backgrounds, and digitally manipulated identity documents. And at <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-synthetic-identity-creation/">sites like</a> personnotexist[.]org, even people with no image manipulation experience can easily generate <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/north-korean-operatives-deepfakes-it-job-interviews">deepfake personas</a> for use in video.</p>
<p>For businesses increasingly reliant on remote teams, the sophistication of these outfits represents a significant threat. By some industry estimates, 40% of all cybercrime incidents in 2024 involved deepfake infiltration. At an average cost of<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1417720/worldwide-cost-per-record-by-initial-attack-vector/"> $4.99 million</a> per incident caused by malicious “insiders” like fraudulent remote workers, it can add up. For US-based companies, the average cost of a data breach tops <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">$9 million</a>. As it stands, 34% of companies in North America report suffering a data breach that cost them between $1 million and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/34-Cybersecurity-Statistics-to-Lose-Sleep-Over-in-2020">$20 million</a> in the past three years. As many as <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/insider-threat-report-2024/">one in three</a> breaches now involve insiders.</p>
<p>Once breached, organizations face the loss or theft of data, compromised networks, ransomware, and blackmail. That’s before lawsuits or regulatory fines, reputational damage, and the fallout from lost customer trust, shattered shareholder confidence, and derailed strategic initiatives.</p>
 ‘How Ugly Is Kim Jong Un?’ Why Most Security Measures Fail 
<p>Identifying fake job candidates requires innovation and skepticism. Red flags include discrepancies between identity information and the candidates themselves. According to Cyberscoop, examples can consist of a person with a complicated Polish name who, in a Zoom call, turns out to be a military-age male Asian who can’t pronounce it.</p>
<p>When deepfakes are in use, telltale signs can be sudden jerkiness or a disconnect between audio and video. It’s also not uncommon for candidates to be fed answers to questions, creating latency as they read onscreen prompts. As a counter measure, some hiring managers ask candidates to hold up identity credentials to match face with identity. But the same AI tools behind the deepfakes can also be used to create counterfeit credentials, of course.</p>
<p>According to researchers, asking a candidate to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-job-seekers-flooding-market-artificial-intelligence/">wave their hand</a> in front of their face can reveal deepfake inconsistencies. Another tactic: asking unexpected questions like, “How ugly is Kim Jong Un?” Perhaps unsurprisingly, it can be enough of a curve ball to instantly trigger operatives to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/asking-remote-job-candidates-this-shocking-question-could-save-your-company-big-bucks-security-expert-says">disconnect</a> from the call abruptly. The technique is effective because North Korean agents are prohibited from saying anything negative about their leader. When asked to criticize him, they typically end the interview immediately rather than risk punishment for appearing disloyal.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Of course, that might not always work, nor is it ever enough.</p>
<p>Today’s typical security protocols—basic ID verification, standard biometric checks, and interview procedures—are no match for increasingly sophisticated deepfake schemes. Attacks now employ presentation attacks for printed and emailed identity credentials, voice cloning, face swapping, and manipulation of captured video of a legitimate user or candidate.</p>
<p>They can also include injection attacks to manipulate data streams between the camera or scanner and authentication systems. Fraudsters with access to an open device, for example, can inject a passing fingerprint or face ID into the authentication process—or text-to-speech tools to manipulate cloned voice samples—bypassing security measures and gaining unauthorized access to corporate networks and services.</p>
 What It Really Takes to Defeat Deepfake Identities 
<p>As I mentioned, the strongest countermeasure against deepfakes and workforce identity fraud in all its forms is already widely available: advanced biometric authentication, securely linked to verified identities. 1Kosmos is a case in point. Our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/identity-proofing/">identity proofing</a> solution leads potential employees through a mobile-first enrollment process in which they scan driver’s licenses, social security numbers, national identity documents, passports, or other government-issued credentials.</p>
<p>Automated workflows then verify the data, including any associated pictures and RFID-chip data, across more than 2,500 different identity documents <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/supported-documents/">from over 150 countries</a> with over 99% accuracy. These verified individuals are linked to a facial biometric that is dynamically compared to the photo on valid credentials, and the bound identity is then encrypted with the user’s private key and stored in our private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>Passive liveness detection spots subtle digital markers indicative of manipulated images. Detection methods prompt users to perform specific, randomized actions—confirming genuine human presence at enrollment and, if desired, as a login measure for video interviews or meetings. Fraudulent identities are flagged during the time of capture. Our solutions are also built on the only platform certified to NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF, FIDO2, and iBeta ISO/IEC 30107 standards with an SDK and standard APIs to avoid security exploits and prevent vendor lock.</p>
 Facing the Future: Stopping Deepfakes Before They Start 
<p>Unchecked, the epidemic of fraudulent job candidates threatens hiring integrity, cybersecurity infrastructure, and corporate reputations worldwide—and it will only get worse. According to <a href="https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/how-fake-ai-job-applications-pose-risks-for-employers/91173748">Gartner</a>, 1 in every 4 job applicants will be fake by 2028. When you consider other “enhancements” made by otherwise legitimate job candidates, the need for objective, bullet-proof identity proofing grows more critical.</p>
<p>Along with fostering a culture of cybersecurity vigilance throughout the organization (looking at you, HR), implementing widely available biometric technologies that adhere to exacting identity verification standards offers the best—well, only—surefire way to defeat ever-evolving threats from workforce fraud, North Korean and otherwise. Which means the next time you ask a job candidate, “How fat is Kim Jong Un?” it’ll just be for the fun of it.</p>

 How Weak Identity Security Posture Affects Organizations&nbsp;  
<p>The report paints a clear picture: fraudsters are refining their strategies, targeting high-value credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities across all channels. Several statistics stand out, demanding immediate attention from security and risk leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
 How Compromised Credentials Lead to The Rise of Identity Fraud  
  
  A particularly alarming trend highlighted is the increasing exposure of government-issued IDs in data breaches. In 2024, 31% of US data breaches included driver's licenses or other state IDs, a sharp rise from 19% in 2023.&nbsp; <br><br>  
  For years, presenting a physical ID or a scan of one has been a common identity verification step. However, when the digital versions of these documents are readily available to criminals due to breaches, relying solely on document verification becomes dangerously inadequate. <br><br>  
  Fraudsters can now more easily acquire the very credentials used in traditional proofing processes, making it essential to layer additional, dynamic verification methods.  
  
 How Fraudsters Use ID Spoofing and KBA To their Benefit  
<p>Fraudsters are becoming more adept at impersonating legitimate customers, and legacy verification methods are failing to stop them. The TransUnion survey found:</p> 
  
  55% of knowledgeable business leaders reported that call spoofing to impersonate a customer became more common in the past year.&nbsp; <br><br>  
  58% reported that the use of stolen personal information to pass knowledge-based authentication (KBA) became more common.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
  
  The Implication: These two statistics are intrinsically linked. Widespread data breaches have made personally identifiable information (PII) – the foundation of KBA questions like "What street did you grow up on?" or "What was your first pet's name?" – easily accessible to criminals. Simultaneously, spoofing technologies allow fraudsters to appear as legitimate callers. Relying on information recall (KBA) or caller ID is no longer a viable defense mechanism. Knowledge is not identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Call Centers and Help Desks Are Now Prime Targets of Identity Fraud  
<p>The human element in customer service remains a key target. The report reveals a significant increase in attacks targeting call centers:</p> 
  
  The percentage of high-risk calls into US call centers surged by 33%, rising from 4.5% in 2023 to 6.0% in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  This coincides with 43% of knowledgeable business leaders indicating fraudsters increased their attacks on call centers over the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Understanding the Risk: Call centers and internal help desks often handle sensitive requests, including password resets, account changes, and information verification; actions that provide direct pathways for account takeover if compromised. The pressure on agents to provide quick support can conflict with rigorous security protocols, creating vulnerabilities that fraudsters exploit through social engineering and impersonation. The report also notes the specific risk posed by non-fixed VoIP calls, which are harder to trace and showed a high percentage of fraud risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 How to Ensure Identity Assurance For Your Organization  
<p>The insights from the TransUnion report demand a fundamental shift in how organizations approach identity security. Reactive measures and outdated techniques are insufficient. The goal must be Identity Assurance: establishing ongoing, high confidence in a user's identity across their entire journey through orchestrated, risk-appropriate verification.</p> 
 1. Adopt Identity Verification Solutions with Journey Orchestration  
<p>Given that even physical IDs can be compromised and personal knowledge is widely available, modern IDV must be dynamic and context-aware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Move Beyond Static Checks: Merely scanning a driver's license is no longer enough. Effective solutions must layer multiple verification techniques. This includes document authentication (checking security features as well as against a reliable database), biometric verification (matching a live selfie to the ID photo), crucial liveness detection (to prevent spoofs using photos/videos), and potentially cross-referencing with trusted data sources or device intelligence.  
  Orchestrate Based on Risk: Not all interactions carry the same risk. Identity verification shouldn't be one-size-fits-all. Implement solutions that allow for fine-grained policies based on the specific action (e.g., onboarding vs. login vs. password reset), the user's privilege level, and real-time risk signals (like device health or location).  
  
 2. Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) is Broken  
<p>The data is clear: KBA is fundamentally broken. The sheer volume of breached PII, combined with the power of AI to gather and correlate information, makes relying on secret questions a critical vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Embrace Stronger Factors: Organizations must transition to phishing-resistant authentication methods. This includes passwordless, FIDO-certified authenticators like device-based biometrics or security keys, which prove possession of a trusted factor rather than relying on easily compromised knowledge.  
  Secure Recovery: Critically, this applies to recovery processes too. Using KBA for account recovery negates investments in strong primary authentication. Secure recovery must leverage other verified, phishing-resistant factors.  
  
 3. Harden Call Center and Help Desk Defenses Interactions  
<p>The sharp rise in high-risk calls targeting support channels necessitates specific countermeasures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Empower Agents with Better Tools: Equip support staff with integrated tools that provide stronger identity verification methods than simply asking KBA questions or trusting caller ID.  
  Implement Risk-Based Authentication: For high-risk requests (like credential resets or changes to sensitive account information), trigger strong step-up authentication challenges that cannot be easily socially engineered. This could involve pushing a notification to a user's registered and trusted device for biometric approval.  
  Orchestrate High Risk Workflows: Implement workflows that escalate high-risk verification scenarios. This might involve requiring approval from an employee's pre-verified manager through a secure channel or routing the interaction to a specialized risk team equipped with advanced verification tools.  
  
 Upgrade Your Security Posture with Identity Assurance  
<p>The TransUnion H1 2025 State of Omnichannel Fraud Report serves as a stark reminder: identity is the new security perimeter, and it's under constant attack. The rise in compromised identity documents, the blatant failure of KBA, and the relentless targeting of support channels demand immediate action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations can no longer afford incremental improvements to outdated security models. A paradigm shift towards proactive Identity Assurance is essential for survival and growth. This means embedding strong, phishing-resistant identity verification across the entire user lifecycle, orchestrating verification based on risk, and eliminating reliance on easily compromised factors like passwords and shared secrets.<br><br>Discover HYPR’s Identity Assurance Platform</p> 
<p>HYPR, The Identity Assurance Company, is built to address these modern challenges head-on. Our platform delivers FIDO-certified, passwordless MFA, integrates high-assurance identity verification methods, and enables sophisticated journey orchestration to ensure the right users gain access, securely recover accounts, and interact safely across all channels, including vulnerable support touchpoints.</p> 
<p>Don't let legacy vulnerabilities dictate your security posture. Embrace Identity Assurance and build a resilient defense against the evolving threats highlighted by TransUnion.</p> 
 Key Takeaways:  
 1. Static Identity Verification is Obsolete  
<p>Reliance on physical IDs or static document scans is increasingly less secure due to the amount of stolen PII credentials online. Identity verification must use a multi-layered approach that includes biometrics, liveness detection, and real-time risk assessment.</p> 
 2. Knowledge-Based Authentication is Broken  
<p>Breached data and data aggregated by AI have rendered knowledge-based authentication nearly useless. Organizations must adopt phishing-resistant factors like biometrics and FIDO2 passkeys.</p> 
 3. Call Centers and Helpdesks Are the New Frontline  
<p>The increase in spoofed calls and VoIP abuse increases the fraud risk for both call centers and help desks. Organizations must implement risk-based step-up authentication and use tools that provide more secure identity verification methods.</p> 
 4. Identity Assurance is the New Standard  
<p>The security focus must shift from one-time, static checks to continuous identity assurance across the user journey. Modern IDV solutions must be adaptive and risk-aware to meet the challenges of the current threat landscape.</p>

<p>The crypto world moves fast—but so do regulations. One of the most impactful regulations for crypto businesses today is the FATF Travel Rule. It’s not just another checkbox to tick—it’s a global mandate designed to increase transparency and reduce financial crime in digital assets. If you’re a crypto asset service provider (CASP), understanding and complying with the Travel Rule isn’t optional—it’s essential to staying competitive and credible.</p>



<p>Let’s walk through what the Travel Rule requires and how you can stay compliant without slowing down your operations or alienating your customers.</p>



<p></p>



 What Is the FATF Travel Rule? 



<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule requires that CASPs—such as crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and custodians—collect and share certain information about the originators (senders) and beneficiaries (recipients) of crypto transactions over a specified threshold.</p>



<p>Think of it as the crypto equivalent of wire transfer rules in traditional banking. When funds move between two institutions, basic identifying information must travel with them.</p>



<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>



 
 Threshold Amount: The Travel Rule applies to crypto transactions over USD/EUR 1,000 (or local equivalent). 



 Required Information:
 
 For the Sender (Originator): Full name, wallet address (or unique account ID), physical address or national ID number, and transaction purpose if required by local regulations. 



 For the Recipient (Beneficiary): Full name, wallet address, and additional details if needed. 
 
 



 Cross-Border Compliance: The rule applies across jurisdictions, meaning you need to ensure both sides of the transaction are compliant, even if the recipient CASP is in a different country. 
 



<p></p>



 Why Compliance Matters 



<p>Failing to comply with the Travel Rule can lead to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, or even being cut off from global markets. But it’s not just about avoiding punishment—it’s about building trust. The Travel Rule is designed to make the crypto ecosystem safer by preventing money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. For CASPs that want to thrive, being seen as compliant builds credibility with regulators, partners, and customers.</p>



<p></p>



 The Challenges of Travel Rule Compliance 



<p>Travel Rule compliance isn’t without hurdles:</p>



 
 Data Sharing Complexities: Sharing sensitive customer information across borders requires secure systems that comply with privacy laws like GDPR. 



 Transaction Delays: Manual verification can slow down transactions, frustrating customers and introducing operational inefficiencies. 



 Interoperability Issues: Ensuring compliance across different CASPs and jurisdictions can be tricky, especially if the other party uses different systems. 
 



<p>But these challenges don’t have to hold you back.</p>



<p></p>



 How iComply Simplifies Travel Rule Compliance 



<p>iComply’s end-to-end solution for KYC, KYB, and AML goes beyond basic compliance—it makes Travel Rule compliance smarter and faster with edge computing technology. Here’s how it works:</p>



 
 Seamless Data Collection and Verification<br>Instead of relying on third-party subprocessors that introduce data privacy concerns, iComply verifies and authenticates sender and recipient data locally on the client’s device using edge computing. This ensures that sensitive information is encrypted and verified before it leaves the device—minimizing data exposure risks and ensuring compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA​. 



 Real-Time Screening and Alerts<br>iComply automatically screens transaction participants against global watchlists, PEP databases, and adverse media sources in real-time. Suspicious activity? Immediate alerts are sent to compliance officers to take action without interrupting transaction flow​​. 



 Interoperability and API Integration<br>iComply integrates easily with other CASPs’ compliance systems using its robust API. Whether your counterpart is using a different solution or in another jurisdiction, you can ensure data flows securely and meets FATF standards​​. 



 Automated Reporting and Audit Trails<br>Generate audit-ready reports with one click. Every verification step is logged and time-stamped, making it easy to prove compliance during regulatory inspections​​. 



 Configurable Rules Based on Jurisdiction<br>Compliance isn’t one-size-fits-all. iComply allows you to configure data requirements based on the jurisdiction of the sender and recipient, ensuring you meet local and international requirements. 
 



<p></p>



 Travel Rule Compliance in Action: A Case Study 



<p>Let’s look at how compliance plays out in real life.</p>



<p>Scenario: Alex, a customer of a U.S.-based crypto exchange, sends $5,000 in BTC to a friend’s wallet held at a European exchange.</p>



<p>Without iComply:</p>



 
 The compliance team manually collects Alex’s data, verifies it, and emails it to the European CASP. This takes time and risks data breaches during transmission. 



 If the receiving exchange uses a different system, compatibility issues may arise, delaying the transaction further. 
 



<p>With iComply:</p>



 
 Alex’s data is encrypted and authenticated directly on the exchange’s app using edge computing. No unnecessary data transfers. 



 iComply verifies the transaction participants in real-time and sends a secure compliance packet directly to the European exchange—fast, secure, and compliant. 
 



<p>The result? Faster transactions, stronger security, and a frictionless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Why Choose iComply? 



<p>iComply’s platform doesn’t just help you comply—it optimizes your entire compliance workflow. By using edge computing, automated risk screening, and seamless integration, iComply simplifies Travel Rule compliance without sacrificing security or efficiency.</p>



<p>In the fast-moving world of crypto, compliance isn’t just a necessity—it’s a competitive advantage. Ready to stay ahead of the curve and build trust with your users and regulators? Let’s make compliance work for you.</p>

									  The Case for Crypto Psychoanalysis   <p>Over the past two weeks, we’ve been riding the high and personally writing about what many are calling a “crypto renaissance” — a surge in innovation, cultural momentum, and renewed belief in the decentralized future.</p><p>From institutional adoption to meme coin mania, the energy is palpable. But behind the price action, protocol upgrades, and market narratives lies a more elusive force, one that drives both irrational exuberance and gut-wrenching fear: our minds.</p><p>Enter what we call crypto psychoanalysis — a framework for understanding the emotional, behavioral, and psychological dynamics shaping the crypto market.</p><p>We pulled the term out of thin air, but make no mistake, this isn’t armchair theory. It’s backed by data and increasingly seen as essential to navigating the world of digital assets. According to a 2023 study by Glassnode, nearly 3 in 4 short-term Bitcoin holders panic-sell within three weeks of entering a position during volatile markets. Meanwhile, only 12% of long-term holders react similarly, revealing stark behavioral patterns between experienced participants and newcomers.</p><p>These reactions aren’t just financial. They can be triggered by stress, uncertainty, and crowd psychology. Research from eToro found that nearly 40% of retail crypto investors admit to making impulsive trades based on social media trends. (Shitcoins, anyone?) In the last bull run, Google searches for “crypto anxiety” spiked over 400% between January and May 2021, further illustrating the mental toll of market swings.</p><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) thrives on momentum and identity. Each token’s value goes beyond its conversion rate, cultivating its own ecosystem and culture. From Solana vs. Ethereum to Dogecoin vs. everyone, investors often form emotional attachments to their bags, leading to confirmation bias and herd behavior.</p><p>A University of Cambridge study in 2022 highlighted that emotional attachment to a project — rather than utility or fundamentals — was the #1 driver of long-term holding behavior among retail investors. We hold what we believe in, not always what performs.</p><p>Diving deeper, crypto is powered by storytelling. The success of Ethereum’s merge, the rise of Ordinals on Bitcoin, or even the explosive memecoin season we’re living through — these shifts didn’t happen in a vacuum. They were fueled by emotionally charged narratives, online echo chambers, and the innate human desire to believe.</p><p>A 2024 Binance Insights report showed that projects with strong community narratives outperform purely technical projects by 32% in average token retention over a 6-month period.</p><p>The psychological element of DeFi can take a very real toll too. In a world of 24/7 markets, dopamine hits from green candles, and devastating crashes at 3am, burnout is real. Over 60% of crypto traders reported symptoms of stress or sleep disruption in a 2023 OKX survey, with nearly one-third saying crypto had “negatively impacted their mental health.”</p><p>At <a href="http://www.playhaus.tv">playhaus</a>, we’re equally interested in the external evolution of web3 and the internal transformation happening within its participants. Crypto is changing how we think, feel, connect, and trust. And in that shift lies a profound psychological story waiting to be told.</p><p>So as we celebrate the breakthroughs, let’s not ignore the breakdowns. We urge you to take the time to offset the psycho with the analysis. Because the next frontier of crypto might not just be on-chain — it might be in the mirror.</p>  <p>— Muhammed</p>

									         The Show-Me State Just Showed Up   <p>Missouri just poked the proverbial bear with a cattle prod.</p><p>As of 2025, if you’re a Missouri resident, you won’t pay a single dime in capital gains taxes at the state level on profits from stocks, real estate, or crypto.</p><p>Yep. You read that right. No tax man coming for your investment wins. Just a clean break. How did we get here?</p><p>Before this new law, Missouri taxed capital gains like regular ol’ income — up to 4.7%, depending on your tax bracket. So whether you were flipping homes, selling off that Apple stock you bought during the iPod era, or finally unloading your crypto bag after HODLing since 2017, the state wanted a piece.</p><p>No more.</p><p>A handful of states — think Florida, Texas, Nevada — already don’t tax any personal income, so naturally capital gains are in the clear there. But Missouri? It’s in a different category. This isn’t a no-income-tax state. It’s one that looked at capital gains specifically and said, “Nah, we’re good.”</p><p>That makes this a first-of-its-kind move. It’s targeted, it’s bold, and it’s potentially game-changing.</p><p>Why? Because this could be the beginning of something bigger. By zeroing out capital gains for individuals, Missouri is basically hanging a big, flashing sign that says: “Invest here. Live here. Grow here.”</p><p>Think of it like this:</p>  That real estate developer weighing between Kansas City and Denver? He’s looking real hard at Missouri now.  That startup founder debating when to liquidate shares? She just found a way to save serious cash.  That crypto trader finally ready to cash out? Missouri just rolled out a digital red carpet.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>But who really benefits? Let’s keep it real: 80% of the financial benefit from this bill is expected to go to the top 5% of earners. So yes, it will favor the wealthy. Indeed, critics are already worried about the loss in state revenue — somewhere between $260M and $600M annually. That’s money that funds schools, roads, and public services.</p><p>But here’s the counterpunch: If the move spurs economic growth, pulls in new businesses, and juices up investment in-state, it could pay for itself in the long haul. That’s the bet Missouri’s making.</p><p>There’s also some crucial fine print. Specifically, this exemption is only for individuals, not corporations. At least for now. Businesses might get in on the fun once Missouri’s top individual income tax rate drops to 4.5%. But that won’t happen until at least 2028, if revenue keeps rising.</p><p>So what could/should you actually do with this info? Here are a few options:</p>  Re-think residency: If you’re in a high-tax state and sitting on major gains, moving to Missouri might suddenly look a lot more appealing.  Time your exits: Planning to cash out on an investment? You now have a major incentive to do so while under Missouri’s tax umbrella.  Get your CPA on speed dial: Tax strategies just changed in a big way. Whether a crypto investor or real estate pro, your accountant needs to be looped in.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Big picture. Should you care?</p><p>If you invest, yes.</p><p>If you’re eyeing a real estate flip or a startup exit, double yes.</p><p>If you’re a casual observer wondering how states compete in a post-remote world — definitely.</p><p>Missouri’s trying to build it, attract it, and ride it.</p><p>The question is: Will people show up to the Show-Me State?</p>  <p>— Branden</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>AI tools are getting better at handling tasks—but in most cases, they’re still stuck in “assist” mode. They wait for prompts. They offer suggestions. Maybe they fill in a form or summarize an email. That’s helpful, but it’s not transformational.</p>
<p>The vision for AI is agentic — that it can&nbsp; act autonomously, move across systems, and handle tasks end-to-end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If agentic AI is going to deliver on that vision, agents need to be identifiable —&nbsp;they need digital identities. And so do you — if those agents are going to access your data and solve your problems.</p>
 It’s not enough for an AI to be smart. It has to be trusted. 
<p>An AI agent needs to be able to prove who it belongs to: your bank, a government agency, a train company. This authentication needs to be seamless and it also needs to be verifiable in a way that you can be absolutely sure of its identity.&nbsp; This is where Verifiable Credentials (VCs) come in. Verifiable credentials allow AI agents to prove they’re acting on behalf of a specific, authenticated user—and prove they are who they say they are. That radically simplifies orchestration, trust, and decision-making.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials let us go from basic automation to complex orchestration. From “Alexa, play music” to “Agent, make a reservation at X for Y time and pay with my credit card.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When each agent holds a credentialed identity they can become a coordinated system:</p>
 
 Consent is simple and direct. No need for re-authentication workflows. 
 Transactions are secure and verifiable. The source of the data and action is cryptographically proven. 
 Inter-agent communication is trusted. A digital finance agent can interact with a travel agent because they’re both verified and operating under clear delegation from you. 
 
<p>The result? Your agents become a team. Not just a stack of tools, but a coordinated group of trusted digital representatives—working on your behalf across domains, platforms, and organizations.</p>
<p>They don’t just say “I’m here to help Helen.”</p>
<p>They say “Here’s cryptographic proof I represent Helen, and I’ve got permission to do this.”</p>
<p>The system on the other side instantly verifies this and responds.</p>
<p>This is the leap—from bots that follow commands to agents that represent you.</p>
<p>No back-and-forth. No friction. Just action on your behalf.</p>
<p>So the next time my flight gets canceled, my AI travel agent gets to work by rebooking instantly. Meanwhile, my loyalty program agent negotiates a new hotel reservation. My finance agent checks spending limits and negotiates the price to get me a new rental car. All of it happens securely, seamlessly while I’m sitting at a gate with 1% battery—without needing to open three apps, dig through my inbox, or verify my identity again.</p>
<p>How? Each agent has proof it can act for me. The airline trusts it. The hotel trusts it. My calendar trusts it. I don’t have to touch a thing.</p>
 Why This Matters for Business 
<p>In enterprise environments, this architecture scales. Verified agents can:</p>
 
 Act across departments with audit trails 
 Coordinate approvals and processes faster 
 Trigger smart workflows across platforms 
 Maintain compliance and data minimization with consent baked into every transaction 
 
<p>Think: HR agents issuing employee credentials, finance agents processing invoices, customer service agents accessing secure user profiles—all without the integration headaches or security concerns of today’s fragmented systems.</p>
 The future of AI is personal, trusted, and credentialed 
<p>AI doesn’t have to be a buzzword or a half-functional assistant. It can be a fully credentialed representative, trusted to act on your behalf—across systems, across domains, across the world.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we’re building the identity infrastructure that makes this future possible—today.</p>
<p>Because when AI agents can prove who they are and who they work for, the digital world starts to feel less like a maze… and more like a concierge desk. Come build with us today.</p>

 How you comply with anti-money laundering measures, and conduct identity verification is about to change forever. Are you ready for the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation? 



 



<p>The regulatory landscape for financial services will undergo the biggest change to date, when the <a href="https://accountancyeurope.eu/publications/navigating-the-eu-anti-money-laundering-regulation/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a> replaces the current directive-based approach in 2027.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike previous approaches, where Anti-Money Laundering Directives (the most recent being <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD 6</a>) required national implementation, the AMLR will apply directly across all EU member states, resulting in a more harmonized approach to combating financial crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For financial institutions, AMLR represents both a significant compliance challenge and a strategic opportunity to modernize, and perhaps more importantly, harmonize identity verification processes. With implementation less than two years away, understanding the key changes and beginning preparations now is essential for a smooth transition.</p>



 5 main changes under AMLR: What’s new? 



<p>The AMLR brings several fundamental shifts in how financial institutions must approach customer identification and verification:</p>



 1. From directive to regulation. 



<p>Current approach: The AMLDs require implementation through national legislation, which leads to variations in interpretation and therefore different requirements across EU member states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: AMLR will apply to all member states without national implementation, which, in theory, will create a single, consistent rulebook for AML compliance across the EU.</p>



 2. Enhanced due diligence requirements. 



<p>Current approach: European financial services adhere to a risk-based approach to enhanced due diligence (EDD), with some flexibility in implementation. In practice, this means that EDD is required for high-risk customers, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">politically exposed persons</a> (PEPs) or those from high-risk jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: There will be more prescriptive requirements for customer due diligence, with specific mandates for identification methods and verification processes.</p>



 3. Stricter beneficial ownership rules. 



<p>Current approach: Varied thresholds and requirements for identifying beneficial owners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: Standardized approach with clearer definitions and lower thresholds for beneficial ownership identification.</p>



 4. Expanded scope to include crypto. 



<p>Current approach: Anti-money laundering directives were focused primarily on traditional financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: Broader coverage including crypto-asset service providers and other previously exempted entities.</p>



 5. Stronger enforcement mechanisms. 



<p>Current approach: Varied enforcement penalties, fines and punishments across member states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: More consistent penalties and enforcement mechanisms, with greater coordination through the new <a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en">Anti-Money Laundering Authority.</a> Due to start operations from summer 2025, the AMLA will have a staff of 400 and will centralize AML efforts, coordinate national authorities and conduct cross-border investigations.</p>

 The 3 pillars of AMLR-compliant identification. 



<p>At the heart of AMLR is a fundamental shift in how financial institutions verify customer identities. It’s worth noting that AMLR will not be regulating KYC methods per se but merely adhering to the eIDAS 2.0&nbsp;identity framework. AMLR prescribes three compliant identification methods:<br></p>



 1. EUDI Wallet. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> (EUDIW) represents a significant advancement in digital identity management. This user-controlled mobile application will allow EU citizens to store, and share verified identity credentials securely. The EUDI Wallet must meet either substantial or high assurance levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Customers will be able to prove their identity using government-issued digital credentials&nbsp;  



  Verification can happen remotely in an instant&nbsp;  



  Higher levels of assurance for digital onboarding&nbsp;  



  Reduced manual verification processes<br>  



 2. Notified eID systems. 



<p>Notified <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">Electronic Identification (eID) systems</a> provide secure digital identity verification through nationally recognized schemes. There are more than 27 eID systems across Europe, each with varying levels of assurance. Under the eIDAS 2.0 regulation and the upcoming AMLR, these systems are being brought under a single, interoperable EU framework to support cross-border KYC and customer onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be accepted for KYC purposes, eID systems must meet at least a “substantial” or “high” level of assurance, as defined by EU technical standards. This ensures that financial institutions and other obliged entities can rely on trusted digital identity methods for remote onboarding and customer due diligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Recognition of national eID schemes across borders&nbsp;  



  Standardized levels of assurance&nbsp;  



  Simplified customer onboarding for customers with existing eIDs&nbsp;  



  Reduced document verification requirements<br>  



 3. Trust Services. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">Trust Services</a>, as defined under&nbsp;eIDAS, provide the foundation for secure and authentic digital transactions through&nbsp;Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES),&nbsp;electronic seals,&nbsp;timestamps, and other regulated services. These play a key role in enabling&nbsp;secure identification under AMLR, particularly via&nbsp;QES&nbsp;and&nbsp;Qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes (QEAA), which allow trusted identity and attribute information to be shared digitally across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To enable these services, a&nbsp;Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP)&nbsp;is responsible for verifying the individual’s identity — whether through&nbsp;notified eID, an&nbsp;EUDI Wallet, or traditional documents such as a&nbsp;passport. This identity proofing must comply with&nbsp;high-assurance standards, which may involve&nbsp;video identification,&nbsp;automated verification, or&nbsp;in-person validation, as set out in&nbsp;eIDAS 2.0 implementing acts&nbsp;and&nbsp;ETSI technical standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way, QTSPs offer a legally recognized and privacy-preserving path to AML-compliant digital onboarding — even for users without a national eID or EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Enhanced security for digital transactions&nbsp;  



  Legal recognition equivalent to handwritten signatures&nbsp;  



  Improved document integrity and non-repudiation&nbsp;  



  Streamlined digital processes with legal certainty&nbsp;  



<p>The significance of these three pillars cannot be overstated. Financial institutions that implement as many options as possible will provide customers with maximum flexibility while ensuring full compliance with AMLR requirements. As the majority joint venture partner of IDnow Trust Services AB – a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP), IDnow is uniquely positioned to support all three identification methods as a single vendor, offering a comprehensive solution for full AMLR compliance.</p>



<blockquote><p>By beginning preparations now, organizations can ensure a smooth transition to the new regulatory framework while minimizing disruption to operations and customer experiences. With the right partners and a proactive approach, AMLR compliance can become a catalyst for digital transformation rather than just another regulatory burden.</p>Uwe Pfizenmaier, Product Director at IDnow and Registration Officer at IDnow Trust Services AB.</blockquote>

 How businesses can prepare today for a more compliant tomorrow. 



<p>Although there are still two years until the 2027 deadline, the complexity of AMLR implementation means preparation should begin now. Here are key steps financial institutions should take:</p>



 1. Conduct a gap analysis.&nbsp; 



<p>Assess your current AML processes against AMLR requirements to identify areas needing improvement. This includes:&nbsp;</p>



  Reviewing existing customer identification methods&nbsp;  



  Evaluating beneficial ownership identification processes&nbsp;  



  Assessing risk assessment methodologies&nbsp;  



  Examining transaction monitoring capabilities&nbsp;  



  Reviewing staff training programs<br>  



 2. Budget planning.&nbsp; 



<p>For many financial institutions, AMLR compliance will require investment in new technologies and processes. As such, they need to ensure they:&nbsp;</p>



  Allocate resources for technology upgrades&nbsp;  



  Budget for staff training and potential new hires&nbsp;  



  Consider consulting services for specialized expertise&nbsp;  



  Plan for ongoing compliance costs<br>  



 3. Team training and awareness. 



<p>Begin building internal knowledge and expertise:&nbsp;</p>



  Educate compliance teams on AMLR requirements&nbsp;  



  Raise awareness among executive leadership&nbsp;  



  Develop training programs for customer-facing staff&nbsp;  



  Establish clear ownership of AMLR implementation<br>  



 4. Technology assessment.&nbsp; 



<p>Evaluate your current technology stack against future requirements. Do you have one of three AMLR-compliant ways of verifying identities implemented in your technology stack? Sooner rather than later, businesses should:&nbsp;</p>



  Assess identity verification systems for AMLR compatibility&nbsp;  



  Review customer due diligence technologies&nbsp;  



  Evaluate transaction monitoring capabilities&nbsp;  



  Consider integration requirements for new identification methods  



 IDnow’s unique position: Why being a QTSP matters. 



<p>A QTSP, such as IDnow Trust Services AB, is an organization that has been officially recognized by a national supervisory body to provide trust services that meet the strict requirements of the eIDAS regulation. This qualification involves rigorous assessment of security practices, technical capabilities and organizational reliability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-trust-services-ab-certified-qtsp-eu/">QTSP since 2024,</a> IDnow Trust Services AB holds a privileged position in the AMLR compliance landscape.&nbsp; For financial institutions preparing for AMLR, working with IDnow and its QTSP offers several competitive advantages:</p>



  Comprehensive compliance coverage: IDnow can provide all three prescribed identification methods (EUDI Wallet, eID, and Trust Services)&nbsp;  



  Legal certainty: Qualified trust services are considered critical infrastructure and have the highest level of legal recognition across the EU&nbsp;  



  Reduced compliance risk: Working with a qualified provider reduces the risk of non-compliance&nbsp;  



  Future-proof solutions: As regulations evolve, QTSPs tend to actively drive change and are the first to adapt and ensure continued compliance&nbsp;  



  Simplified vendor management: One single provider for multiple compliance requirements&nbsp;  



<p>With a long history in enabling financial services customers to comply with AML regulations,&nbsp; IDnow is actively preparing to support clients through the AMLR transition, with ongoing development of compliant solutions and close engagement with regulatory authorities.</p>



 Next steps: Your AMLR readiness checklist. 



<p>To begin your AMLR preparation journey, consider this initial checklist:&nbsp;</p>



  Assign responsibility: Designate an AMLR implementation team or leader&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Stay informed: Subscribe to regulatory updates and industry guidance&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Assess current state: Document existing identification processes and technologies&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Identify gaps: Compare current capabilities with AMLR requirements&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Develop a roadmap: Create a phased implementation plan through 2027&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Engage with partners: Begin discussions with technology providers about AMLR solutions&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Budget for change: Ensure financial planning includes AMLR implementation costs&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Monitor developments: Stay alert for regulatory guidance and industry best practices  



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>In the not-too-distant future, only three methods of identity verification will be allowed. Orchestrating each method in order to offer fallbacks and different ways of issuing Trust Services will therefore become key for the future of AML onboarding in EU.</p>Johannes Leser, Chief Executive Officer of IDnow Trust Services AB.</blockquote>



 Prepare today to succeed tomorrow. 



<p>While for many, AMLR will pose a significant compliance challenge, it also offers an opportunity to modernize and future-proof identity verification processes, enhance security and improve customer experiences. Financial institutions that approach AMLR strategically, rather than as a compliance box to check, can gain competitive advantages while strengthening their defences against financial crime and fraud that is becoming more sophisticated by the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Last week, I wrote about how the real innovation is in centralized vs decentralized, it’s in building systems that can move between them. Flexibility and resilience go hand in hand. <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a> if you missed it.</p>



<p>This week, we’re taking that one step further: If flexibility or even malleability is the goal, how much are you willing to pay for it?</p>



<p>Decentralization sounds empowering, and it is, but when you start pricing out the staff, contracts, and duplicated infrastructure required to make it real, it’s enough to light your hair on fire. But if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s this: centralization is comfortable, right up until it isn’t. The question isn’t whether decentralization is an all-or-nothing decision. Instead, you should ask how much of it you actually need, and whether you are building toward that, or are you hoping you’ll never be put to the test?</p>



 The Control We Live Without (Until We Can’t) 



<p>Most enterprise stacks are built on convenient centralization because it works. Until it doesn’t.</p>



<p>And to be fair, many centralized platforms aren’t fragile at all. Cloud providers like AWS or Azure, DNS services like Cloudflare, and global CDNs like Akamai offer incredible built-in resilience, failover, and distributed design, and for many organizations, that’s more than enough.</p>



<p>So when I talk about decentralization, I’m not saying “don’t use centralized platforms.” I’m asking:</p>



 
 Where does your dependency go beyond what the platform guarantees? 



 Where are you relying on a single identity flow, a proprietary API, or a vendor relationship that isn’t as durable or visible as you’d like? 
 



<p>Here are just a few common areas where centralization is accepted, sometimes wisely, sometimes dangerously.</p>



 Current Dependencies: What’s Normal (and Risky) 



Stack ComponentTypical Centralized ProviderWhy We Accept ItWhat It Takes to DecentralizeCloud InfrastructureAWS, Azure, GCPCost efficiency, built-in toolingMulti-cloud design, duplicated environmentsDNSCloudflare, Route53Stability, DDoS protectionRedundant providers, failover planningIdentity ProviderOkta, Entra, PingPolicy enforcement, ease of useFederation, verifiable credentials, trust governanceRouting &amp; CDNAkamai, CloudflareSpeed, coverageCustom PoPs, peering strategiesMessaging / CommsTwilio, Zoom, MicrosoftUnified experienceProtocol bridging, diverse vendor integration



<p>The point isn’t to avoid centralization. It’s to understand where you’re exposed, and whether you can live with that. I can’t answer that for you, but you can and should start answering it for your org.</p>



 The Real Cost of Optionality 



<p>There’s no shame in being centralized; there is shame in not being able to recover from locked-in choices. The value of decentralization shows up when:</p>



 
 A vendor outage takes down your login page 



 A change in platform policy breaks your consent flows 



 A new law forces you to isolate systems by country 



 A key provider is acquired, and your roadmap disappears overnight 
 



<p>Decentralization can offer you a way out or at least a way forward. But you only get that if you build for it. And yes, that comes with a cost. TANSTAFL.</p>



<p>Some of those costs include:</p>



 
 Financial: Redundancy means paying for parallel paths, including multiple vendors, more complex SLAs, and sometimes a few features you don’t use every day. 



 Operational: Diverse systems mean more moving parts. Teams need more discipline. More observability. Less “set and forget.” 



 Strategic: Procurement has to prioritize flexibility over feature count. Architecture has to balance performance with fallback. 
 



<p>And let’s not forget the cost of interoperability. The cost of decentralization isn’t just financial. You also need systems that can communicate across platforms, formats, and protocols.</p>



<p>Decentralization means maintaining systems that can work across different environments, many of which weren’t built with each other in mind. Your <a href="https://openobserve.ai/articles/observability-stack-understanding/">observability stack</a> needs to normalize across cloud regions. Your CI/CD pipelines need to deploy to more than one provider. And of course, your auth system needs to handle more than one flavor of token.</p>



<p>You’re not just buying a second system, you’re buying the glue. That glue, however, can be expensive. But it’s what turns “Plan B” into an actual option.</p>





 This Is Achievable, But Only If You Know What You’re Buying 



<p>The good news? You don’t need to decentralize everything. In fact, you probably shouldn’t. But you should know what you’re trading off.</p>



<p>Think of decentralization as buying protection against:</p>



 
 Lock-in: pricing hikes, roadmap divergence, license changes 



 Regulatory shifts: data residency rules, cross-border controls 



 Platform instability: outage, acquisition, end-of-life surprises 



 Geopolitical risk: sanction-driven service denial, regional throttling 



 Value misalignment: privacy erosion, surveillance, ethical conflicts 
 



<p>That’s not FUD. It’s a checklist that helps you determine where decentralization is a strategic safeguard and where centralization is still worth the risk.</p>



 Choose Your Investment Level 



<p>There’s a spectrum here. Not every organization needs multi-cloud failover, decentralized identity, and DNS across five providers. But every organization needs to ask:</p>



 
 Where are we so centralized that a single point of failure becomes an existential risk? 



 And what would it take to make that risk optional rather than inevitable? 
 



<p>You shouldn’t be looking for decentralization for its own sake. You’re looking for just enough optionality to survive a change in vendor policy, regulation, or business direction without rebuilding your stack from scratch. Ultimately, every team needs to decide how much of the cost of decentralization is justified by the control they gain.</p>



<p>Every small investment buys you breathing room. And breathing room is what makes resilience possible.</p>



 Closing Thought: Buy Control Before You Need It 



<p>You don’t have to decentralize everything. You probably can’t.</p>



<p>But if your entire digital operation depends on a single cloud region, vendor, or IdP that no one knows how to replace, then you’re not buying control; you’re borrowing it and hoping nothing goes wrong.</p>



<p>So, how much of the cost of decentralization are you willing to pay before you’re forced to?</p>



<p>Because waiting until you have to pay is rarely the cheapest option.</p>



<p>Bonne chance, mon ami!</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it. Welcome back! If you caught the last episode, you’ll remember that we talked about how the real innovation isn’t choosing between centralized or decentralized identity systems—it’s about the ability to shift between the two.</p>



<p>[00:00:44]<br>If you didn’t hear that episode, no worries. Here’s the short version:</p>



 
 When I talk about centralization, I’m not just talking about infrastructure, but also controls. 
 



<p>[00:00:56]<br>A centralized identity system relies on one authority—one identity provider, one source of truth, one way to enforce access. Everything flows through a single control point.</p>



<p>[00:01:06]<br>In decentralized models, control is distributed.</p>



 
 You might issue credentials that can be independently verified and used. 



 You might support federation or allow for local policy decisions. 



 All of that isn’t chaos—it’s coordination across more than one authority. 
 



<p>[00:01:24]<br>Most enterprise systems fall somewhere in the middle. It’s not a question of which is better, but how much flexibility you’ve built into your dependencies and whether you’re ready to shift between centralized and decentralized models when needed.</p>



<p>[00:01:39]<br>And just to clarify, if your mind jumps straight to blockchain when I say “decentralized identity,” you can let that go. That’s not what we’re talking about here.</p>



 



 The Cost of Flexibility 



<p>[00:01:51]<br>Today, we’re building on that story, because flexibility to shift between these two models isn’t free.</p>



<p>[00:01:58]<br>In enterprise identity systems especially, the cost of decentralization can sneak up on you—until one day, it’s the only thing you can do.</p>



<p>[00:02:09]<br>Centralization absolutely works—right up until it doesn’t. Most enterprise systems are mostly centralized by design because:</p>



 
 It scales 



 It’s familiar 



 It’s easier to manage and deploy 
 



<p>[00:02:27]<br>You pick a cloud provider, configure your identity flows, and build tools that make daily life easier for your teams. All reasonable decisions.</p>



<p>[00:02:37]<br>But centralization comes with trade-offs that don’t always show up on your architecture diagram.</p>



 
 They show up when your vendor changes policies 



 When a regulator demands regional data isolation 



 When the company that owns your login page gets acquired and suddenly nothing is where it used to be 
 



<p>[00:02:56]<br>That’s when the invoice for centralization shows up. If you’ve prepared for it, great. If not, keep listening.</p>



 



 Trade-Offs and Hidden Costs 



<p>[00:03:09]<br>Let’s talk about those trade-offs and where they show up.</p>



<p>[00:03:15]<br>Most organizations don’t decide to centralize everything all at once. It usually happens gradually—through tool choices, vendor decisions, and policies that favor simplicity.</p>



<p>[00:03:36]<br>You pick AWS or Microsoft Azure because they offer global infrastructure and built-in security.<br>You standardize on a single identity provider for simplified access control and audit logging.<br>You rely on a CDN, DNS service, or messaging platform—not because you want lock-in, but because it works and provides redundancy.</p>



<p>[00:04:09]<br>Those normal decisions can quietly create dependencies that are hard to unwind.</p>



<p>[00:04:18]<br>Centralization feels efficient, but it means you’re betting on your vendors never changing, your regulators staying predictable, and your systems remaining static.</p>



<p>[00:04:44]<br>The real question isn’t “Did we centralize too much?” It’s “Do we know which parts of our systems are built around a trust that hasn’t been stress-tested yet?”<br>That’s where decentralization—or even just having a plan for it—starts to pay off.</p>



 



 What Does Decentralization Actually Cost? 



<p>[00:04:52]<br>Decentralization isn’t just a design pattern or a configuration flag.<br>It shows up in:</p>



 
 How you hire teams 



 How you build systems 



 How you buy SaaS applications 



 How you plan for the future 
 



<p>[00:05:06]<br>Let’s talk about three kinds of cost:</p>



 Financial Cost 



<p>[00:05:09]<br>Redundancy means paying for more than one way to do something—running services in two cloud regions, contracting with two vendors for the same function.<br>This can look inefficient on a spreadsheet, but it’s really trading short-term inefficiency for long-term adaptability.</p>



 2. Operational Cost 



<p>[00:05:38]<br>Decentralized systems require discipline.</p>



 
 You have more services to coordinate 



 You need more observability 



 You need standardized policy enforcement<br>It’s not just a technical tax—it’s a cultural shift. 
 



<p>[00:06:06]<br>Assume failures will happen and design recovery plans before they do.</p>



 3. Strategic Cost 



<p>[00:06:11]<br>This is the hardest to measure.<br>Decentralization forces you to ask:</p>



 
 Do we want flexibility or feature velocity? 



 Are we optimizing for today’s comfort or tomorrow’s resilience? 



 Are we willing to make architectural choices that look less efficient but give us options when it counts? 
 



<p>[00:06:44]<br>If this sounds like tomorrow’s problem, you’re not alone—but chances are, you’ve already run into some version of this.</p>



 



 Real-World Scenarios 



<p>[00:06:59]<br>If you’ve ever had to “duct tape” your way out of a dependency, you’ve already felt the cost of not being flexible between centralization and decentralization.</p>



<p>[00:07:33]<br>This isn’t about building redundant systems for fun—it’s about investing in flexibility before you need it.</p>



<p>[00:07:39]<br>If the cost feels high now, ask: What will it cost to do it later, under pressure?</p>



 



 The Value of Optionality 



<p>[00:07:47]<br>Optionality is where decentralization pays off.</p>



 
 It’s not about building a parallel universe 



 It’s about designing systems with room to move 
 



<p>[00:07:53]<br>Examples include:</p>



 
 Backup login methods that don’t rely on a single provider 



 The ability to issue credentials even when your main service is down 



 Flexibility to shift data storage between jurisdictions without breaking compliance 
 



<p>[00:08:14]<br>If you’ve built in flexibility, you can adapt when something breaks. But it doesn’t come for free—it costs more planning, more conversations with legal and compliance, and more thoughtful procurement.</p>



<p>[00:08:32]<br>Sometimes, it means building things twice or building the glue that holds them together. But it gives you control before you need it.</p>



<p>[00:08:51]<br>It’s not overengineering—it’s building systems that don’t panic when the default plan fails. Because the default plan will fail.</p>



 



 A Personal Example 



<p>[00:09:03]<br>Let’s make this personal.<br>If you’ve worked in a high-security enterprise, you know the drill:</p>



 
 Company-managed device 



 Lockdown browser 



 VPN required for everything 
 



<p>[00:09:28]<br>It works—until you need to join a Google Meet with an external standards body and Google is blocked, or you need to access a shared document on a non-whitelisted domain.</p>



<p>[00:09:40]<br>Suddenly, your secure device becomes a wall—not because the technology failed, but because the policies are too rigid.</p>



<p>[00:10:06]<br>Imagine if you could submit for an exception—pre-modeled, well-governed, and aligned with business risk—without endless meetings and exceptions.<br>That’s what optionality would look like: not chaos, but structured flexibility.</p>



<p>[00:10:29]<br>Decentralization isn’t about removing control. It’s about creating trusted, intentional ways to shift it around when necessary.</p>



 



 Final Takeaway 



<p>[00:10:37]<br>Buy the control you need before you need it.</p>



 
 You don’t need to decentralize everything 



 You probably can’t and shouldn’t 



 But you do need to know where your dependencies live 
 



<p>[00:10:54]<br>When something goes sideways—a vendor acquisition, regulatory shift, or trust breakdown—you’ll want options.<br>And options must be built ahead of time.</p>



<p>[00:11:06]<br>Ask yourself:</p>



 
 Where are we so centralized that a single point of failure is an existential risk? 



 What would it take to make that risk optional instead of inevitable? 
 



<p>[00:11:15]<br>Even a small investment in flexibility buys you more breathing room—and breathing room is what makes resilience possible, not just technically but also operationally and strategically.</p>

			 Is the UAE Taking the Lead in the Tokenization Race? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>As you know, the U.S. is now pushing to become the crypto nation. It has capital, advanced bitcoin mining infrastructure, and some of the largest crypto-companies, but regulatory and political uncertainties continues to slow institutional adoption.</p>
<p>The EU has legal frameworks in place, but not simplicity. The complicated regulation works well for large financial players, however, it is proving a challenge for the next generation of blockchain innovators.</p>
<p>The UAE is taking a different approach, and it might just win the race. Rather than over-regulating or under-defining, it’s applying simple rules but selective authorizations, welcoming builders, and creating an environment where innovation can scale, fast.</p>
 A competitive edge built on openness and infrastructure. 
<p>We’ve just returned from Token2049 and RWAfi Live in Dubai, and one message is clear: The UAE is building the future of blockchain, faster, bolder, and more business-friendly than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>With 72 free zones, including DIFC, ADGM, and VARA, the UAE has created a system where local chambers of commerce and rulers compete to attract innovators. This friendly competition is pushing real-world asset tokenization forward. Project owners select the best place depending on their needs, and get access to a new blockchain-powered “American dream”.</p>
<p>Here are some recent innovation examples:</p>
 
 The <a href="https://dubailand.gov.ae/en/news-media/dubai-land-department-and-dubai-virtual-assets-regulatory-authority-collaborate-to-enhance-leadership-in-the-real-estate-sector-and-virtual-assets-regulation?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG#/">Dubai Land Department and VARA</a> are integrating real estate registries with blockchain. That means compliant, onchain property title transfers are now possible. 
 The <a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/innovation/tokenisation-regulatory-sandbox?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG">DFSA</a> has launched a dedicated regulatory environment to test tokenized securities like real estate shares, sukuk, and fund units, all under full overview. 
 <a href="https://www.ihcuae.com/media-centre/press-releases/ihc-adq-and-fab-pioneer-uae-dirham-backed-stablecoin-for-the-digital-economy?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG#:~:text=Abu%20Dhabi%2C%20UAE%2C%2028%20April,(subject%20to%20regulatory%20approval).">AE Coin</a>, a UAE Dirham backed stablecoin launched by FAB, ADQ, and IHC, is now live. This lays the foundation for compliant onchain payments at scale. 
 
<p>These aren’t isolated pilot projects. They are live infrastructure built to attract capital, global talent, and institutional adoption, and it’s working. From crypto startups to major financial institutions, builders are relocating to the UAE to benefit from its simple, selective, and scalable regulatory environment.</p>
 RWA: From trend to reality 
<p>At Tokeny, we are proud to help power this transition. Our infrastructure built on the ERC-3643 standard, enables institutions to:</p>
 
 Launch compliant RWA tokens with embedded control logic. 
 Execute atomic swaps between tokenized assets and regulated stablecoins. 
 Scale distribution across jurisdictions while enforcing compliance at every step. 
 
<p>At RWAfi Live during Token2049 Dubai, leaders from the DFSA, FSRA and MESA regulators shared a panel to discuss the future of onchain finance. The main takeaway? Regulation is not a blocker if you use the right tech. It’s the foundation for compliant onchain adoption.</p>
<p>This shift is happening faster than many expected, and the UAE is leading it.</p>
<p>For those of you who have missed this incredible panel, and the demos of the ERC3643 Association, <a href="https://youtu.be/viLyPOjuQRU?t=9760&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG">watch the livestream here</a>.</p>

  <p>As part of <a href="https://www.okta.com/secure-identity-commitment/">Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment</a> (OSIC) to lead the industry in the fight against identity attacks, we are making changes to improve our architecture related to developer organizations.</p>

<p>On May 22, 2025, our new Integrator Free Plan will become the default organization type when you sign up on developer.okta.com. If you are actively using an Okta Developer Edition org, please create an Integrator organization and migrate to it. The Okta Developer Edition <a href="https://developer.okta.com/terms/">terms of service</a> will also be updated to clarify: neither your old Developer Edition organization nor your new Integrator organization is meant for production use cases.</p>

 New Okta developer organization types tailored for you 

<p>We’ve redesigned our developer orgs to better fit how you build. Whether you’re testing app integrations, validating identity flows, or preparing for OIN submission, the new Integrator Free Plan is purpose-built for iterative development—not production deployment.</p>

<p>This new structure reflects real-world developer needs:</p>

 
   A clean, focused environment optimized for building and validating integrations 
   Terms that match typical pre-production use cases 
   Streamlined signup and org management aligned with how developers work today 
 

<p>By moving to an Integrator organization, you’ll get an environment that’s aligned with modern dev workflows—simpler, more relevant, and built to support how you build.</p>

 Integrator organization benefits 

<p>This new organization structure will come with a number of benefits, such as improving integrator access to Okta support resources and expanding developer access to Okta product offerings for testing purposes.</p>

<p>The features available in the Integrator Free Plan are listed in <a>our reference docs</a>.</p>

 Deprecating Okta Developer Edition organizations 

<p>In July 2025, existing Okta Developer Edition organization will be deactivated. At this time, you will lose access to your old Okta Developer Edition organization and all resources in it.</p>

 How to tell whether your organization is affected 

<p>To check whether an organization is in Okta Developer Edition, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications in the Okta Admin Console. If you’re on Developer Edition, large text will inform you that “Developer Edition provides a limited number of apps”. This message appears below the Applications heading and above the Create App Integration button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Organizations in which this banner is absent from the Applications list are not part of Developer Edition, and are unaffected by the Developer Edition deprecation.</p>

 How to migrate your resources from Okta Developer Edition to Integrator Free Plan 

<p>Creating an Integrator Free Plan organization will give you a clean slate to test and develop in. However, you might want to replicate setup steps that you’ve performed in your Okta Developer Edition organization to continue work in progress. Several options are available for migrating your configuration from your Okta Developer Edition organization to your Integrator Free Plan  organization.</p>

<p></p>

 Migrating data is optional 

<p>If you want to discard the configuration and data from your Okta Developer Edition organization and start fresh in a new Integrator Free Plan organization, create a new Integrator Free Plan organization and begin using it. Your Developer Edition resources and configuration will be deleted when old organization are deactivated in July..</p>

 Re-create resources by re-running automation 

<p>If you automated the creation of resources in your Okta Developer Edition organization that you’d like to continue using in your Integrator Free Plan organization, your environment setup will be simple. Create an Integrator Free Plan organization, provide credentials to your setup tooling, and re-run that tooling.</p>

 Add automation for long-term management 

<p>If you created resources in your Okta Developer Edition organization by hand and you want to automate management of those resources going forward, this is a great time to build the tooling you want using  <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Terraform</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">PowerShell</a>. <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer/blob/master/docs/okta.md">Terraformer</a> can help you generate Terraform configurations based on existing resources in your old organization.</p>

 Use our migration tool for one-off organization backup 

<p>If you’d like to capture a snapshot of your current Okta Developer Edition configuration, try <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dev-account-migration-tool">our EnvSync migration tool</a>. It wraps the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> to create files representing all supported objects in your Developer Edition organization, and can use these backup files to automatically re-create many of the objects in your new Integrator Free Plan organization.</p>

 Migrate your public OIN Integration 

<p>If you have an integration in the <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/">Okta Integration Network</a> associated with your Okta Developer Edition organization, sign up for a new Integrator Free Plan organization and contact Developer Support to request that your integration be migrated to your new organization. Developer Support will link your new organization to your integration so that you can easily update it as needed.</p>

<p>If you have been working on an integration for the Okta Integration Network but it has not yet been accepted, you are responsible for migrating your work in progress from your Developer Edition organization to an Integrator Free plan organization.</p>

 Cutoff dates for OIN submissions 

<p>As of May 22, 2025, no new OIN integration submissions will be accepted from developer orgs.  After May 22, you must use an Integrator Free Plan organization to submit OIN integrations.</p>

<p>Holochain Core &amp; Networking: Since the last Dev Pulse, we’ve published the first three releases of Holochain 0.5 with our new networking engine <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>. While the focus of this release was network reliability, the improvements we’ve made will mostly be felt as dramatically better DHT performance. In our tests, and tests in the field, it shows shorter and more consistent syncing times for DHT data. CPU usage appears to have decreased significantly as well. One of the team is calling it “a good step forward for Holochain”.</p><p>There is a new behavior with Kitsune2 and performance enhancement. When a new node joins a network, there’ll be a time of initial DHT synchronization, during which they won’t immediately get any new data published by their peers since they joined. This is because they haven’t advertised themselves as full-arc nodes yet and so won’t be targeted for publishing to. But once they’ve synchronized with the other peers, it “goes like blazes and data just appears like it was authored locally”, in the words of a team member. So new users should still expect data to sync slowly for the first few minutes; this is normal.</p><p>It’ll still be a bit before we recommend that app developers update their projects to Holochain 0.5 — we’re seeing some connectivity issues which we believe we’ve identified as a simple misconfiguration which we’ll correct, test, and hopefully release soon. We also still need to update the scaffolding tool. If you’re brave and want to get a head start on an existing app, you can read the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.5/?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.5 upgrade guide</a>.</p><p>In the Holochain 0.6 development line, the team is investigating bottlenecks in the conductor runtime. They’ve already addressed one long-standing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org">issue</a> of degrading performance as source chains grow — we’re now seeing a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org#issuecomment-2863047641">30-40% improvement</a> in ad-hoc dev testing, with possibly more improvements to come.</p><p>Testing: All of the test scenarios in Holochain 0.4 have been converted from our older TryCP-based scale testing framework to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/wind-tunnel?ref=blog.holochain.org">Wind Tunnel</a> , and we’re now in the process of updating them for Holochain 0.5, as well as streamlining the process for deploying Wind Tunnel client nodes with <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nomad</a>. Dev team members are setting up test machines all around the world, and we’re looking at options for increasing the number of test machines.</p><p>Dev Docs: Lastly, we’ve published some new documentation in the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Build Guide</a>:</p>  Working With Data: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/validation-receipts/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Validation Receipts</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/using-the-host-api/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Host API</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/cell-introspection/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Cell Introspection</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/cryptography-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Cryptography Functions</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/miscellaneous-host-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Miscellaneous Host Functions</a>  Validation: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/must-get-host-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">must_get_* Host Functions</a>  Validation: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/dht-operations/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT Operations</a> (an advanced guide)

<p>In the first release of 2025 we have improved log correlation, adding&nbsp;both a Session and Correlation identifier. These additions enable more effective log correlation, making it easier to trace the full flow of authentication and related events across both audit and diagnostic logs.&nbsp;Links to specific documentation for this logging improvement can be found in the release notes. As always, we aim to improve a wide array of items and make corrections to simplify the use of the Identity Platform. These are shown in detail from the release notes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For our long-standing customers, we are working to release updates to a number of SSO service modules. &nbsp;These are external elements which ease configuration or use of SSO within Identity Platform. Our IDaaS service naturally receives these updates as they are available, however, if you have a premises-based installation, we would ask you to open a Service Desk ticket to request the updated code for these external to SSO modules. We would also like to point out that the modules&nbsp;have only been tested on SSO 9.6.0 found within this IDS 2025.1 release of Identity Platform, so would encourage you to update your Identity Platform prior to updating the modules. If you have any questions, Operations is happy to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across private conversations with CISOs, CIOs, and heads of HR and identity, one issue continues to emerge as both urgent and unresolved:&nbsp;fake IT workers infiltrating enterprise environments&nbsp;under false or stolen identities.</p> 
<p>In many of these discussions, leaders admitted they’ve seen this problem up close, or know someone who has. Fake hires can linger undetected for months, perform well enough to avoid scrutiny, and quietly gain access to sensitive systems. Whether the goal is financial fraud, IP theft, or funding a foreign regime, the result is always dangerous: critical systems are compromised, trust is shattered, and the organization is left exposed.</p> 
<p>One of the most pressing challenges isn’t just how these bad actors get in, but&nbsp;who is responsible for stopping them. HR teams oversee hiring, but often lack the tools for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/candidate-verification-onboarding">candidate verification</a> beyond background checks. Security and IT teams are concerned about post-hire access and risk, but don’t own the onboarding funnel. The result? Confusion, finger-pointing, and growing vulnerability.</p> 
<p>Below I unpack four key insights from ongoing conversations with enterprise leaders who are trying to get ahead of this threat. If you’re in HR, IT, or security, these perspectives may sound familiar, and they offer a path toward better collaboration and stronger safeguards.</p> 
<p></p> 
 1. Employee Impersonation Has Become a Board-Level Concern  
<p>Executive leadership teams and boards of directors are no longer in the dark, directors are now demanding identity verification. High-profile media coverage in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/north-korean-spies-are-infiltrating-u-s-companies-through-it-jobs-e45a1be8">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/north-korean-it-workers-infiltrating-fortune-500-companies/">Fortune</a>, and other outlets has accelerated awareness and pressure. Directors are asking CIOs, CISOs, and HR leaders direct questions:</p> 
  
  Could this happen to us?  
  Have we already been compromised?  
  What safeguards are in place?  
  
<p>For companies in highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and defense, the scrutiny is even more intense. While some board members have suggested drastic measures, like requiring all new hires to verify their identity in person, most executives acknowledge that this alone won’t solve the problem. A more sustainable, digital-first strategy is needed.</p> 
 2.&nbsp;Who Owns Employee Identity Verification? Solving Accountability Gaps Across HR, IT, and Security  
<p>One of the most persistent issues? Nobody agrees on who owns the employee impersonation problem.</p> 
  
  Is it HR, responsible for hiring and onboarding?  
  Is it IT, responsible for managing account access?  
  Is it Security, who typically handles insider threats?  
  Or is it Legal or Compliance, given the regulatory exposure?  
  
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bojansimic/"></a></p> 
<p>The result is organizational paralysis, with each department assuming someone else is responsible, no one takes ownership, and the risk continues to grow unchecked. Some companies assign ownership to HR ops, only to discover their background check tools aren’t built for identity verification at scale. Others lean on security or insider threat teams, who are already overwhelmed and reluctant to take on additional responsibility without a clear mandate.</p> 
<p>The most successful organizations tackling this issue have one thing in common: collaborative, cross-functional alignment across HR, IT, and security, often driven by a central <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/identity-security-guide">identity security</a> program.</p> 
 3. Manual Identity Checks Can’t Stop Fake IT Workers: Why Traditional Onboarding Is Failing  
<p>When detection fails, prevention becomes a guessing game. Unfortunately, many companies are relying on labor-intensive, manual processes that don’t scale and are easy to bypass:</p> 
  
  Video-based interviews and onboarding: Helpful, but increasingly vulnerable to deepfakes.  
  In-person onboarding: Logistically difficult and only effective if the individual remains in the role.  
  Laptop shipping verification: Foiled when attackers use “mules” or remote access post-delivery.  
  Always-on video during virtual meetings: Easy to fake, hard to enforce.  
  Behavior-based 2FA triggers: Ineffective if the attacker already has valid credentials.  
  
<p>Worse still, many adversaries are using stolen identities purchased on the dark web or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ai-forgery-epidemic">leveraging GenAI to create fraudulent documents</a> that pass background checks. The impersonation problem is outpacing traditional onboarding controls.</p> 
 4. How Global Worker Impersonation Goes Undetected  
<p>While North Korean infiltration garners headlines due to FBI intervention, similar incidents are happening globally. Attackers from Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and other regions are using identical playbooks.</p> 
<p>There’s also a related phenomenon gaining steam: job stacking, where one person holds multiple jobs under a single identity, often outsourcing tasks to others for profit. These schemes can fly under the radar for months and result in confidential data being shared with unauthorized third parties.</p> 
<p>Many security teams remain reactive, addressing these issues only after something suspicious surfaces. Given that some experts estimate over 500,000 impersonators may be employed by U.S. organizations today, this approach is no longer tenable.</p> 
 6 Actions CIOs and CISOs Can Take to Prevent Employee Impersonation  
  
  Reverify All Identities Using Multi-Factor Signals&nbsp;<br>Conduct a phased identity verification process using device checks, location data, government ID scans, and manager attestation. Move beyond one-time checks.  
  Make Identity Security an Ongoing Priority<br><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity assurance</a> isn’t a one-and-done task. Apply Zero Trust principles to continuously verify the human behind the login.  
  Scrutinize Third Parties and Contractors<br>Treat contractors and gig workers with the same rigor as full-time staff. Consider biweekly or monthly identity reverification cadences.  
  Bridge the Gap Between HR, IT, and Security<br>Establish shared KPIs and workflows across departments to ensure no gaps in accountability exist.  
  Leverage Existing Security Tools for Continuous Verification<br>Correlate identity assurance signals from IDPs, EDR tools, and network monitoring systems to flag suspicious behavior.  
  Report Incidents and Collaborate with Industry Peers<br>Engage with communities like FS-ISAC and share learnings. Open dialogue is critical to closing industry-wide gaps.  
  
 Why Continuous Employee Verification Is Now Essential  
<p>Impersonation-based attacks are no longer rare, and they’re not going away. These threats are stealthy, scalable, and extremely difficult to detect using traditional HR or IT processes alone.</p> 
<p>The only path forward is one built on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">continuous identity verification</a>, from day zero through every access point of the employee lifecycle. At HYPR, we believe trust must be earned continuously, not just at the time of hire.</p>

 Open House: A Conversation with Blocko’s CEO on the Future of Enterprise Blockchain with Aergo &amp;&nbsp;HPP <p>This time, we sat down with Won Kim, CEO of Blocko, to discuss Blocko's critical role as a key partner in the Aergo ecosystem and explore how Aergo’s future, powered by the House Party Protocol (HPP) and Layer 2 innovation, will create new opportunities for enterprises. In this conversation, Won outlines how enterprise clients will transition through Aergo’s evolution, how the dual-layer approach strengthens the ecosystem, and how Blocko continues to drive real-world adoption of blockchain technology.</p> Q1: How would you describe the relationship between Blocko and&nbsp;Aergo? <p>Won Kim: The combination of Blocko and Aergo is quite rare in the blockchain industry. Blocko provides the full spectrum of services enterprise clients need — from architecture design to system customization and long-term maintenance.</p><p>In a way, you could compare it to the relationship between Ethereum and ConsenSys, but there’s a key difference: Blocko is much more hands-on in the actual building and deployment process.</p><p>This deep collaboration benefits both parties. Aergo can continuously enhance and advance Aergo Enterprise based on direct client feedback gathered through Blocko’s projects. At the same time, Blocko can focus purely as a Managed Service Provider (MSP), delivering end-to-end blockchain solutions. It creates a virtuous cycle of innovation and execution between the platform and the service&nbsp;layer.</p> Q2: How does Blocko’s role fit Aergo’s evolution with HPP and&nbsp;L2? <p>Won Kim: Blocko has always been focused on driving real-world adoption of blockchain technology. As Aergo evolves with the launch of HPP ETH Layer 2, our role remains critical: to penetrate the enterprise blockchain market by transitioning past Aergo Enterprise use cases into the AI-driven HPP ecosystem, while continuing to deliver enterprise-grade solutions built on Aergo Mainnet. While HPP ETH L2 will lead broader Web3 innovation, Aergo Mainnet will continue to serve as the trusted foundation for enterprises requiring security, compliance, and private deployments. Our clients rely on us to provide stability and continuity as the ecosystem continues to&nbsp;evolve.</p> Q3: How will enterprise clients be affected by the introduction of HPP ETH Layer&nbsp;2? <p>Won Kim: There will be no disruption for our enterprise clients. Aergo Mainnet will continue to operate as it has always, providing a stable and high-performance private blockchain infrastructure. Clients using Aergo Enterprise will not need to make any technical changes. However, for enterprises seeking AI-driven capabilities, the broader ecosystem of HPP will be available as an option through Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>The launch of HPP ETH L2 is an expansion, not a replacement. It introduces a two-track strategy for the Aergo ecosystem: one track focused on public innovation (L2) and another anchored in private, enterprise-grade reliability (L1).</p> Q4: What are the benefits of maintaining both Aergo L1 and introducing HPP&nbsp;L2? <p>Won Kim: We offer flexibility that few ecosystems can match by maintaining both layers. Aergo Mainnet provides long-term support for enterprise solutions, including compliance, data protection, and custom deployments. At the same time, HPP ETH L2 opens the door for innovation with AI-native smart contracts, decentralized identity, and broader Web3 use cases. Together, they create a full-stack ecosystem that can scale with both corporate and Web3 ecosystem needs.</p> Q5: From an enterprise perspective, what excites you most about Aergo’s&nbsp;future? <p>Won Kim: What excites me most is the convergence between AI and blockchain. HPP ETH L2 introduces concepts like AI oracles, enabling smart contracts to dynamically process and respond to real-world data. This unlocks opportunities in areas such as automated compliance, supply chain verification, and real-time risk management, where enterprises seek blockchain to add real value, not just theoretical potential.</p> Q6: How is Blocko supporting this transition alongside Aergo? <p>Won Kim: Blocko is actively working with Aergo to ensure a smooth transition through close technical collaboration, client communication, and long-term roadmap alignment. We are expanding our solution stack to bridge traditional enterprise systems with the new opportunities presented by HPP ETH L2, particularly for clients seeking to integrate AI-driven data flows and smarter automation into their blockchain operations.</p><p>We view Aergo’s evolution not as a pivot, but as a natural expansion of what we started: making blockchain real, usable, and transformative for enterprises.</p> Q7: How is Blocko approaching overseas markets with less restrictive regulatory environments? <p>Won Kim: In the past, we saw significant growth internationally, securing projects with Bank of Singapore, Credit Suisse, and the Seed Group in Dubai. We even established a local branch in the UK to support global expansion. Our projects included building a Sharia-compliant distribution platform in Dubai and conducting successful STO-related PoC projects with Credit&nbsp;Suisse.</p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted us, prompting us to wind down our overseas operations. This experience prompted a strategic shift, moving from a solution-based delivery model to a fully cloud-based SaaS approach. Instead of deploying teams on-site, we now host our services on the cloud, enabling enterprises and consumers to access them remotely.</p><p>As a result, approximately 40% of the current inbound demand now comes from international customers. With Korea’s blockchain-related regulations becoming more defined, we believe the time is right to expand aggressively. Blocko is well-positioned to lead the way with our technology and operational experience.</p> Q8: Is there anything you would like to&nbsp;add? <p>Won Kim: Blocko has been committed to the potential of general-purpose blockchain technology even before the birth of Ethereum. For over a decade, we have focused on integrating blockchain into complex enterprise environments, consistently addressing real-world challenges and operational demands.</p><p>Now, as the rapid advancement of AI technology reshapes industries, it has become increasingly clear that enterprises need a foundational layer to fully harness the power of AI innovations. Recognizing this shift, Blocko fully aligns with the vision that the evolution of Aergo’s technology into the House Party Protocol (HPP) is not just necessary, but critical for leading the next era of enterprise blockchain and Web3 innovation.</p><p>We are proud to stand alongside Aergo as we move into this next chapter, building a blockchain infrastructure ready for an AI-driven future.</p><blockquote>“Blocko has been committed to advancing blockchain technology even before the birth of Ethereum, integrating it into complex enterprise environments for over a decade. As AI reshapes industries, we believe a robust blockchain foundation is essential — and the evolution of Aergo into the House Party Protocol (HPP) is critical for leading the next era of enterprise and Web3 innovation.”<br> — Won Kim, CEO of&nbsp;Blocko</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-a-conversation-with-blockos-ceo-on-the-future-of-enterprise-blockchain-with-aergo-aaf9f46e29f7">Open House: A Conversation with Blocko’s CEO on the Future of Enterprise Blockchain with Aergo &amp;…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the increasingly modular world of Web3, crypto bridges have emerged as vital infrastructure, allowing not just digital assets but also data to flow across otherwise siloed blockchains. As decentralized applications and user bases grow across chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, and others, bridges enable cross-chain functionality, improve liquidity distribution, and facilitate multi-chain user experiences.</p><p>But how do these bridges work, what risks do they carry, and how are projects like HPP (House Party Protocol) approaching them in a more secure and purpose-driven way?</p> What Is a Crypto&nbsp;Bridge? <p>A crypto bridge is a set of smart contracts and messaging infrastructure that allows users to move tokens or data from one blockchain to another. Users commonly “lock” assets on a source chain and receive a “wrapped” version on the destination chain. When they want to move back, the wrapped asset is burned, and the original is released.</p><p>Importantly, modern bridges are evolving to support not just tokens, but cross-chain data validation, state updates, and messaging, enabling a broader spectrum of interoperable applications.</p> Why Bridges&nbsp;Matter <p>Without bridges, liquidity and utility are locked within individual chains. That leads to fragmentation, inefficiency, and user friction. Crypto bridges solve this&nbsp;by:</p>  Enabling users to move assets freely across ecosystems  Allowing developers to tap into liquidity from other&nbsp;chains  Supporting cross-chain DeFi, gaming, NFT, and data-sharing applications  Reducing reliance on centralized exchanges  Facilitating cross-chain communication and AI agent orchestration  <p>Bridges are especially crucial in the Layer 2 and modular blockchain landscape, where chains are built for specialized functions (e.g., speed, privacy, compliance) but still need to interoperate.</p> HPP’s Approach to&nbsp;Bridging <p>As Aergo transitions to HPP, a Layer 2 network built on either Arbitrum Orbit or OP Stack depending on strategic and technical considerations, bridging becomes a central component of the roadmap. Aergo tokens exist on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum (ERC-20). In the future, HPP tokens will be launched on the selected Layer 2 platform, and official bridges will be established to support a secure transition and enable seamless cross-chain interactions.</p><p>In the initial stage, the bridge will serve primarily as a secure and convenient method for converting assets between chains. However, as development progresses, this infrastructure will evolve into the core of HPP’s cross-chain architecture, enabling interaction between the Aergo mainnet (L1) and HPP ETH (L2). It will also serve as the foundation for AI-related features, facilitating the orchestration of agents, datasets, and verified compute across multiple environments.</p><p>While the initial focus is on the Aergo-ETH-HPP triad, the team will continue developing additional bridge features based on demand and the evolution of the ecosystem.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Crypto bridges are essential as they represent the frontier of blockchain scalability, data coordination, and user access. Bridges are not just a ‘token swapper’ — they will be the conductor of an AI-purpose network, orchestrating AI agents, datasets, and more. Let’s see how bridges will evolve in the coming age of&nbsp;AI.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-4-understanding-crypto-bridges-6c78937fe5f1">BC 101 #4: Understanding Crypto Bridges</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On May 8th, 2025, we held our sixth weekly AMA. And for the first time, we hosted it on <a href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1OyJALokBMNGb">X/Twitter Spaces.</a> The session with hosts Ben and Raph covered everything from HPP’s roadmap and token migration to AI, ecosystem partnerships, and more. Here’s a numbered recap of the key questions and insights&nbsp;shared:</p>  Can you give us a clear elevator pitch for HPP?<br>HPP (House Party Protocol) is the next evolution of the Aergo public blockchain. Backed by a team with over a decade in Web3, HPP represents a pivot to an AI-first Layer 2 chain. It builds on Aergo’s strong enterprise foundation to support more adaptive, intelligent, and data-driven applications.  When will HPP launch?<br>HPP is targeting a launch in Q3 2025, which is when the current Aergo chain will transition into the HPP network. Until then, users can follow the project through its living roadmap and community channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Medium. Development updates, branding efforts, and offline appearances are ongoing in preparation for the official&nbsp;launch.  How will the token swap from AERGO to HPP work?<br>The AERGO to HPP token swap will happen at a 1:1 ratio. The process will depend on where the tokens are held. Most exchanges are expected to handle the swap automatically. A bridge may be required for self-custodied tokens. Official instructions will be provided ahead of the swap. Users are advised to stay vigilant and only trust verified channels.  Are there any Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains like BNB or Solana?<br>No. AERGO currently exists only on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. If anyone is offering Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains (e.g., BNB or Solana), it is a scam. The only safe way to move tokens is through the official bridge provided by the&nbsp;project.  Is staking available for AERGO tokens?<br>Yes. AERGO staking is available on the Aergo mainnet. Community members regularly share updated staking options in the Telegram chat, which is the best place to learn more and get involved.  What is the relationship between Aergo and Blocko?<br>Aergo and Blocko are separate entities, although they share early founders. Blocko serves as a long-term technology partner and contributes development and infrastructure support to the Aergo ecosystem. Blocko also works with major enterprise clients and remains a trusted blockchain solution provider.  Why is HPP focused on AI?<br>AI is no longer just a trend; it is becoming a foundational layer of modern digital applications. HPP is designed to address AI accountability, data validation, and agent verification. The goal is to support both innovative AI use cases and safeguards against misuse by providing a secure blockchain environment for data and agent integrity.  What is VaaSBlock’s role in the HPP ecosystem?<br>VaasBlock is an independent company that focuses on Web3 accountability tools. It is closely aligned with Aergo and contributes to the HPP ecosystem through W3DB — a decentralized registry for datasets and AI agents. While separate, the collaboration is strong, and team members often work side-by-side.  Any updates on Binance spot listing?<br>Currently, Aergo is listed on Binance Futures. The team would like to see a Binance Spot listing but has no control over Binance’s listing decisions. The focus remains on building real products and delivering value through the HPP ecosystem in hopes of earning broader listings over&nbsp;time.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/hpp-ama-6-recap-from-aergo-to-hpp-ai-and-whats-coming-next-3f9f865549a2">HPP AMA #6 Recap: From Aergo to HPP, AI, and What’s Coming Next</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
