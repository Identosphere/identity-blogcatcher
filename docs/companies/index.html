<p>Artificial Intelligence is no longer science fiction. From unlocking your phone to passing through airport security, AI face recognition has become part of daily life. It is powerful, practical, and sometimes a little controversial. But how does it actually work, and where is it headed? Let’s break it down in simple terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is AI Face Recognition 
<p>At its core, AI and face recognition is a technology that identifies or verifies a person using their facial features. Think of it as a digital detective. It looks at your face the same way you look at a fingerprint, comparing unique details like the distance between your eyes or the curve of your jaw.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about matching a selfie to your phone. The technology is also applied in banking apps, airports, healthcare, and even retail stores. It is driven by facial AI models trained on massive datasets, allowing systems to quickly learn the differences and similarities between millions of faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How AI Face Recognition Works 
<p>The process might sound complex, but let’s simplify it. The system works in three big steps:</p>
 
 Face Detection AI<br>
The camera identifies that a human face is present. It locates key landmarks such as eyes, nose, and mouth.<p></p>
<p></p> 
 Face Encoding<br>
The software converts the face into a unique numerical code. This code is like a fingerprint for your face.<p></p>
<p></p> 
 Face Match AI<br>
The system compares this code with stored data to verify identity or find a match.<p></p>
<p></p> 
 



Step
Action
Real-Life Example


Detection
Identifies a face
Phone camera sees your face


Encoding
Converts to unique code
Creates a “faceprint”


Matching
Compares with database
Unlocks your device



<p>These steps are powered by artificial intelligence face recognition algorithms that become more accurate over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Accuracy and Global Benchmarks 
<p>Not all systems are created equal. Some are lightning fast with near-perfect accuracy, while others struggle in low light or with diverse facial features. The NIST Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) has become the gold standard for measuring how well different systems perform.</p>
 
 Visit<a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt/"> NIST FRVT</a> for performance data.
<p></p> 
 Explore detailed evaluation results on<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html"> FRVT 1:1 tests</a>.
<p></p> 
 
<p>These benchmarks give businesses and governments confidence before deploying large-scale projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Everyday Uses of Facial AI 
<p>You may not notice it, but facial AI is everywhere. Here are some real-world applications:</p>
 
 Smartphones: Unlocking devices without passwords.
<p></p> 
 Airports: Quicker boarding with automated gates.
<p></p> 
 Healthcare: Patient verification for secure records.
<p></p> 
 E-commerce: AI face search for trying products virtually.
<p></p> 
 Banking: Identity checks for fraud prevention.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Fun fact: Some retailers even use AI facial systems to analyze customer demographics and improve shopping experiences.</p>
<p></p>
 Privacy Concerns and Regulations 
<p>With great power comes great responsibility. While the technology is convenient, it also raises concerns about surveillance and misuse. Governments are stepping in with data protection laws like the<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"> GDPR</a> to ensure individuals have control over their biometric data.</p>
<p>Companies using AI face recognition must follow strict compliance rules such as:</p>
 
 Informing users how their data will be used.
<p></p> 
 Allowing opt-outs where possible.
<p></p> 
 Storing encrypted biometric data securely.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Failure to follow these rules can lead to massive fines and public backlash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges Facing Face Detection AI 
<p>Even with rapid progress, the technology isn’t flawless. Common challenges include:</p>
 
 Bias in datasets: Some systems perform better on certain skin tones.
<p></p> 
 Spoofing attempts: Photos or videos tricking the system.
<p></p> 
 Environmental issues: Poor lighting or extreme angles can reduce accuracy.
<p></p> 
 
<p>To tackle spoofing, researchers are exploring liveness detection techniques, making sure the system knows the difference between a real human face and a photo.</p>
<p></p>
 The Future of AI and Face Recognition 
<p>Looking ahead, experts believe ai and face recognition will only get smarter. Here are a few trends shaping the future:</p>
 
 Edge computing: Processing done on local devices for speed and privacy.
<p></p> 
 Cross-industry adoption: From gaming to education, new uses are emerging.
<p></p> 
 Open-source innovation: Platforms like<a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision"> Recognito GitHub</a> encourage collaboration and transparency.
<p></p> 
 
<p>As systems improve, the balance between convenience and privacy will continue to dominate the conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final Thoughts 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">AI face recognition</a> is changing the way the world verifies identity. It simplifies daily tasks, strengthens security, and opens doors to new possibilities. Yet, it also comes with challenges like privacy risks and the need for unbiased data. With organizations such as NIST setting global benchmarks and strict regulations like GDPR shaping policy, the future looks promising but carefully monitored.</p>

 Frequently Asked Questions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. What is AI face recognition used for 
<p>AI face recognition is used for unlocking smartphones, airport security checks, banking identity verification, and even retail experiences like virtual try-ons.</p>
 2. How accurate is face detection AI 
<p>Accuracy depends on the system. Some advanced tools tested by NIST FRVT report accuracy rates above 99 percent, especially in controlled environments.</p>
 3. Can AI face search find someone online 
<p>AI face search can match faces within specific databases or platforms, but it cannot scan the entire internet. Accuracy depends on the size and quality of the database.</p>
 4. Is AI facial recognition safe to use 
<p>Yes, when regulated properly. Systems that follow privacy rules like GDPR and use encryption keep user data protected.</p>
 5. What is the difference between face match AI and face detection AI 
<p>Face detection AI only spots if a face is present. Face match AI goes further by verifying if the detected face matches an existing one in the database.</p>

    Thales’s Ground Fire air surveillance and air defence radar has been in full series production since the start of 2025, further to successful conclusion of factory acceptance tests (FAT) in the presence of representatives from the French Armament General Directorate (DGA).  Intended for the French version of the new franco-italian SAMP/T NG system - the European Medium- and Long-range air defence-based ground system, the Ground Fire is a real game changer with a surveillance range of 400 km and 360° azimuth coverage, and a full 90° elevation coverage.  Eight Ground Fire air defence radars will be delivered to French armed forces from 2026 , demonstrating Thales’ capacity to support France and Europe in their airspace protection and sovereignty needs through reliable production.  Thales tripled its production of surveillance and air defence radars in 2024 and continues to grow in order to be ready to meet the challenges of protecting the skies.

  <p>These factory acceptance test is the culmination of a long series of tests conducted at Thales' Limours site (Paris region), aimed at ensuring the highest level of performance for the new standalone radar. </p><p>Based on fully digital multiple beamforming Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology in S-band, the Ground Fire radar delivers high performance in the detection, tracking, and classification of numerous targets, even in challenging environments such as mountainous regions and densely crowded airspaces. It offers a unique one-second refresh rate, with a surveillance range of 400 km, 360° azimuth coverage, and a full 90° elevation coverage, capable of detecting drones as well as ballistic missiles, while maintaining the mobility of a tactical radar. The Ground Fire’s 360° full elevation performance detection meets forces’ needs to stay alert on all fronts with a full recognised air picture.</p><p>The open architecture of the system facilitates its integration and interoperability with other European systems, enhancing Europe's air defence capabilities. It ensures strategic autonomy and rapid availability. Its design allows for high mobility with reduced encamp / decamp times and compact dimensions, equivalent to an ISO container for transport.</p><p>The Ground Fire radar will serve the SAMP/T NG, replacing the Arabel radar in the SAMP/T system already in service to secure the airspace in various European countries. The Ground Fire maximises the performance of the next-generation ASTER 30 missiles, positioning France among the leaders in medium- and long-range air and missile defence.</p><p>This programme is supervised by Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) for the French Armed Forces Ministry and the DGA. The prime contractor is Eurosam for the overall system, with Thales providing several components, including the fire control unit based on the Ground Fire radar.</p><blockquote>“The Ground Fire, designed and produced in Europe, will contribute to a robust European air defence system. ​ We have implemented all the necessary processes to accelerate industrial production, tripling radar production in our factory in Limours from 2022 to 2024 and increasing the robustness of our supply chain and partner eco-system, to ensure swift on-time delivery to contribute to air surveillance and air defence of European nations.,” declared Eric HUBER , Vice-President, Surface Radars at Thales.</blockquote><p>About Thales</p><p>Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies for the Defence, Aerospace, and Cyber &amp; Digital sectors. Its portfolio of innovative products and services addresses several major challenges: sovereignty, security, sustainability and inclusion.</p><p>The Group invests more than €4 billion per year in Research &amp; Development in key areas, particularly for critical environments, such as Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, quantum and cloud technologies. Thales has more than 83,000 employees in 68 countries. In 2024, the Group generated sales of €20.6 billion.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>I want to share the Holochain Foundation’s evolving strategic approach to our subsidiary organizations, <a href="https://holo.host/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holo</a>, and <a href="https://unyt.co/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Unyt</a>.</p><p>Strategic work always involves paying attention to the match between your efforts, and where the world is ready to receive those efforts. Since our inception there has always been a small group of supporters who have understood the potential and need for the kind of deep p2p infrastructure that we are building, which allows for all kinds of un-intermediated direct interactions and transactions of all types. But at this moment in time we are seeing a new convergence.</p><p>As Holochain is maturing significantly, the main-stream world is also maturing into understanding the need for p2p networks and processes. As my colleague Madelynn Martiniere says: “we are meeting the moment and the moment is meeting us.”</p><p>And there’s a key domain in which this is happening: the domain of value transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> The Unyt Opportunity <p>As you know, the foundation created a subsidiary, Unyt, to focus on building HoloFuel, the accounting system for Holo to use for its Hosting platform. But it turns out that the tooling Unyt built has a far broader application than we had initially realized. This is part of the convergence, and also a huge opportunity.</p><p>Unyt’s tooling turns out to be what people are calling “payment-rails”: generalized tooling for value tracking, and because it’s built on Holochain, it’s already fully p2p.&nbsp; This is part of the convergence. There is a huge opportunity for this technology to bring the deep qualitative value that p2p provides: increased transparency, agency, reduced cost, &amp; privacy. And also in huge volumes: when talking about digital payments and transactions you count in the trillions.&nbsp;</p><p>The implications are huge, and they need and deserve the focus of the Foundation and our resources so we can fully develop the opportunity ahead of us.</p> Interactions with Integrity: Powered by Holochain <p>Our original mission was to provide the underlying cryptographic fabric to make decentralized computing both easy and real - and ultimately, at a scale that could have a global impact.</p><p>That mission remains intact. The evolution we’re sharing today is not only directly connected to our original strategy, and a logical extension of it, but are ones that we believe will - over time - substantially increase the scale of and opportunities for anyone and everyone within the Holochain ecosystem.</p><p>When we introduced the idea of Holochain and Holo to the world in December of 2017, our goal was to provide a technology infrastructure that allowed people to own their own data, control their identities, choose how they connect themselves and their applications to the online world, and intrinsic to all of the above, interact and transact directly with each other as producers and consumers of value.</p><p>The foundation of the Holochain ecosystem has thus always required establishing a payment system where every transaction is an interaction with integrity: value is supported by productive capacity, validated on local chains (vs. global ledgers) by a unit of accounting - in our case, HoloFuel - and value and supply is grounded by a real-world service with practical value.&nbsp;</p><p>The Holochain Foundation entity charged with developing and delivering the technology infrastructure for this payment system is Unyt Accounting.&nbsp;</p><p>For almost a year now, the team at Unyt has been quietly working hard to develop the payment rails software that will permit users to build and deploy unique currencies (including HoloFuel), allow those currencies to circulate and interact, and ensure the integrity of every transaction. As it turns out, we got more than we bargained for, in the best possible way.</p><p>Meaning: in Unyt, we have software that not only enables HoloFuel, but we can see a brilliant way to link into both the blockchain and crypto world, and also the non-crypto world. As Holochain matures, with the application of Unyt technology, we see a major opportunity in the peer-to-peer payments space, and a chance to lead the non-financial transaction space.&nbsp;</p><p>These are, objectively, huge markets, as Unyt products and tools are not only aimed squarely at solving real-world crypto accounting and payment challenges, but will combine to create the infrastructure needed to launch HoloFuel, and additionally address multiple real-world use cases for anyone interested in high-integrity, decentralized, digital interactions.</p><p>Given Unyt’s progress, we arrived at a point where it became clear to everyone on our leadership team that it was time to make an important strategic decision about where to best devote our focus, time, and resources.&nbsp;</p> Strategic Decisions and Our Path Forward <p>Here’s where we landed:</p><p>When we reorganized Holo Ltd. last year, it was because we wanted to spur growth, and felt having a focus on a commercial application could expand the number of end users. But, it also put us into competition with some of the largest and best-capitalized tech companies on the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>We haven’t gotten enough traction yet for this to be our sole strategy. As part of our ongoing evaluation over the last months, the Holo dev team pursued an exploration of a very different approach - both technical and structural - to deploying Holochain always-on nodes.</p><p>Holo is calling it Edge Node, an open-source, <a href="https://opencontainers.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">OCI-compliant</a> container image that can be run on any device, physical or virtual, to serve as an always-on-node for any hApp .</p><p>Today, Edge Node is <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/edgenode?ref=blog.holochain.org">available on GitHub</a> for technically savvy folks to use. You can run the Docker container image or opt to install via the ISO onto HoloPorts or any other hardware</p><p>What’s different about this experiment is that it appeals to a much wider audience - those familiar with running docker containers, rather than the smaller audience who know Nix. And we’re releasing it now, as open-source, and actively seeking immediate feedback from the community on how this might evolve and contribute to Holo’s goals.</p><p>Second, it is equally clear we need to accelerate the timeline for Unyt. Unyt’s software underpins the accounting infrastructure necessary to create and launch HoloFuel, and subsequently allow owners of HOT to swap into it. More broadly, the multiple types of connectivity Unyt can foster have enormous potential to influence the size, growth, and overall value of Holochain - it is the substrate of peer-to-peer local currencies, and the foundation for future DePIN alliances.&nbsp;</p><p>This acceleration is already under way - in fact, Unyt has <a href="https://unyt.co/blog/unyt:-opening-the-floodgates/?ref=blog.holochain.org">released</a> its first community currency app, Circulo, which is meant for real-world use but also acts as proof-of-concept for the broader Unyt ecosystem.</p><p>Third, and finally, the Holochain Foundation will continue to focus on the stability and resilience of the Holochain codebase, prioritize key technical features required for the currency swap execution, and remain at the center of all our entities to ensure cohesion and coordination.</p> Leadership Transition <p>As part of the next stage of Holo’s evolution, I want to share an important leadership update.</p><p>Mary Camacho, who has served as Executive Director of Holo since 2018, will be stepping down from that role, and I will be stepping in. Mary will continue to support Holo during this transition, particularly in guiding financial and strategic planning. We are deeply grateful for her years of leadership, steady guidance, and dedication to Holo’s vision.</p><p>At the same time, we also thank Alastair Ong, who has served as a Director of Holo, for his contributions on the board. We wish him the very best in his next endeavors.</p><p>These transitions mark a natural shift in leadership that allows Holo to move forward with renewed focus, alongside ongoing collaboration with Unyt and the wider Holochain ecosystem.</p> Looking Ahead <p>From the outset, we knew we were undertaking an extraordinary challenge. In conceiving of and developing Holochain, we set out to compete with some of the largest, best-resourced, and most powerful companies in the world. No part of what we have done, or intend to do, has been easy.&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways Holochain has always been a future-looking technology that users had difficulty fully appreciating and adopting at scale. Now, the world seems to have caught up to us, and is interested in implementing peer-to-peer networks and processes away from centralized structures.&nbsp;</p><p>When we formed Unyt to build the software infrastructure to permit the creation and accounting for HoloFuel, we also caught up to the world: A Major Opportunity Emerges(the volume of digital payments and transactions last year alone are measurable in the trillions).</p><p>We’ve spent a long time working to deliver on our commitments to our community, and there is much still to do.</p><p>As challenging as it is not to have crossed the finish line yet, it’s exciting to see it appearing on the horizon. We continue to experiment with how to best expand the potential for Holo hosting. And with Unyt, what we’re proposing to do here - if we are successful - is significantly grow the scale, potential, optionality, and value of every aspect of the Holochain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>For those interested, please take the time to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CT5Q6TFETA&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">our most recent livestream</a>, where we talk about this evolution and the opportunities it represents for all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a lot to look forward to, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with our most valuable, and reliable, resource: you, the members of the Holochain community.</p>

 A Newsletter for Builders, Marketers, and&nbsp;Thinkers <p>Over the past year, I kept running into the same&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Whenever I tried to learn something about Tech, Marketing, or Product Building, I found myself ten different sources with AI’ish content. One article would skim the surface, another would drown me in jargon, and yet another would feel more like a sales pitch than real&nbsp;insight.</p><p>I realised I wasn’t alone. Many people in our community felt the same — the content was out there, but it was fragmented with little value and inconsistent.</p><p>That is when the idea of CWN Collective (ClubWritter New Collective) took&nbsp;shape.</p> Why This Newsletter Exists <p>CWN Collective is not just another newsletter. It is meant to be a focused space for anyone who cares about three&nbsp;things:</p>  Tech — the tools and trends that are changing the way we live and&nbsp;work  Marketing — We will cover everything from Positioning to distribution  Product Building — the lessons, stories, and failures that go into making something useful  <p>Now, a fair question&nbsp;is</p><blockquote>why even start a newsletter when AI&nbsp;exists?</blockquote><p>Today, you can ask ChatGPT or any AI tool and get an instant answer. But what AI cannot replace is curation, context, and consistency.</p><p>A newsletter gives you something AI does not — a trusted voice that filters the noise, human analytical ability, and presents it in a way that fits a community’s shared interests. Instead of generic post every week, you get a thoughtful package delivered to you, built with care and perspective.</p><p>The goal is not to compete with AI but to add the human layer — to combine insights, lived experiences, and patterns that AI alone cannot fully&nbsp;capture.</p><p>The aim of CWN Collective is simple: to give you clarity every week — insights you can actually use, in a language that makes&nbsp;sense.</p> Why We Start with&nbsp;10 <p>Every community has its own symbols. For us, the number 10 carries meaning. It is about discipline, rhythm, and setting a foundation.</p><p>So instead of simply sending one email and calling it a launch, we are beginning with a 10-day special&nbsp;series.</p><p>Starting tomorrow, you will receive a newsletter every single day for 10 days. Think of it as an intensive — a way to get into the flow together.</p><p>After these 10 days, CWN Collective will settle into its long-term format: one newsletter every week, 4 editions a&nbsp;month.</p> What You Will Take&nbsp;Away <p>If you subscribe, here is what you can expect to&nbsp;gain:</p>  A way to stay updated on Tech without chasing 20 different sources  Marketing strategies broken down into practical steps, not&nbsp;theory  Real stories of product building — both successes and mistakes — that can inform your own&nbsp;work  <p>It is not about reading for the sake of it. It is about getting value that you can carry into your own projects, startups, or&nbsp;careers.</p> Built With the Community <p>I don’t want CWN Collective to be a solo effort. I want it to grow with voices from within the community.</p><p>If you enjoy writing and have something to share on Tech, Marketing, or Product Building, I would love for you to contribute. You can reach me at pr.clubwritter@gmail.com.</p><p>We are also open to sponsorships from people and brands that align with what we are building. We are not chasing revenue, it is for partnering with those who want to support value-driven content.</p> Join Us From Day&nbsp;One <p>Tomorrow is the beginning. The first issue will land in inboxes, and from there, the 10-day launch series will&nbsp;unfold.</p><p>If you haven’t subscribed yet, this is the moment. Being part of CWN Collective from the start means you will see it grow, shape its voice, and maybe even contribute to it yourself.</p><p>This is not just a newsletter. It is an experiment in building something consistent and meaningful — for all of us who are passionate about Tech, Marketing, and Product Building.</p><p>Subscribe today and be part of CWN Collective from day&nbsp;one.</p><p><a href="https://clubwritter.medium.com/subscribe">📬Upgrade Your Inbox with Exclusive Content!</a></p>

 Thales Alenia Space will develop Europe’s first space-based system for generating secure cryptographic keys to protect the European Union’s future communications. 
 

 
 ESA’s SAGA project aims to deploy quantum technologies in space to ensure resilient communications in order to face emerging quantum threats. 
 

 
 Leveraging its expertise and recent advancement on Quantum space-based projects, Thales Alenia Space will contribute to Europe’s technological sovereignty in secure connectivity, supporting the deployment of the European Quantum Communications Infrastructure (EuroQCI). 
 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brussels, October 1, 2025 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) concerning SAGA (Secure And cryptoGrAphic) mission. The contract covers the system definition and preliminary design of a fully European end-to-end Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system for governmental use.</p>

<p>ESA’s SAGA Mission, first introduced during the 2019 edition of ESA’s Ministerial Council Conference and the refined in 2022, has been developed in close collaboration with the European Commission as the space-based element of the EuroQCI initiative. Progress on the EuroQCI implementation continues, with the European Commission’s upcoming Union Secure Connectivity program regulation to oversee its operational rollout.</p>

<p>The project is supported by multiple space agencies, including the Italian Space Agency (ASI), the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Austrian Space Agency (ASA), the Spanish Space Agency (AEE), the Netherlands Space Office (NSO), the French space agency (CNES), as well as the Swiss Space Agency (SSO). Additional agencies are expected to join as the mission advances, expanding its objectives. The mission is funded under ESA’s Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES), part of the Directorate of Connectivity and Secure Communications.</p>

<p>The contract signature took place during the 2025 Quantum Europe Conference, which brought together policymakers, industry leaders, national authorities, and experts from civil society to discuss ways to enhance Europe’s already vibrant quantum technology ecosystem and cement its position as a global leader in quantum innovation and excellence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thales Alenia Space’s role in SAGA project </p>

<p>Thales Alenia Space, with its extensive experience in secure space communications and expertise in quantum and optical telecommunications systems, has been coordinating the previous phases of the SAGA Mission since 2020, starting with SAGA Phase A and continuing to the present day.</p>

<p>SAGA mission aims to demonstrate a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) service that will enable secure QKD provision via a Space Segment consisting of a single Low Earth Orbit (LEO) QKD satellite; an Access Segment made up of four SpaceQCI Access Nodes strategically distributed across Europe; and a Control Segment responsible for system operation and its integration with the terrestrial EuroQCI infrastructure.</p>

<p>SAGA plays a pivotal role within the overall EuroQCI development roadmap, targeting the readiness of SpaceQCI, preparing ESA and its industrial partners for EuroQCI developments under the EU Secure Connectivity regulation, and laying the groundwork for the future certification of SpaceQCI.</p>

<p>Thales Alenia Space in Italy leads a highly skilled consortium that includes leading industries, SMEs, universities, and research centers, bringing together Europe’s top competencies in the design and development of satellite systems, QKD technologies, and security solutions. Thales Alenia Space in France is in charge of SAGA Access Segment, including SpaceQCI Access Nodes and their specific subsystems, while Thales Alenia Space in Switzerland is responsible for the design, development and qualification of the Optical Space Terminal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paving the way to quantum space-based communications projects</p>

<p>Since 2018, Thales Alenia Space has been pursuing an ambitious roadmap, establishing itself a key player in the quantum communications field. The company is leveraging its expertise in satellite telecommunication systems, optical terminals and over 25+ years of quantum technology experience within Thales to develop a fully integrated approach spanning both the space and ground segments of quantum communications systems.</p>

<p>The challenge for quantum communications is to prepare the Quantum Information Networks that will connect quantum computers and quantum sensors to endow them with increased performance, resilience, accessibility. In parallel, new ways to secure communications will be available.</p>

<p>Space takes this ambition one step further: satellites allow quantum signals to travel over vast distances, overcoming the limits of fiber-optic networks and making global-scale quantum communication possible.</p>

<p>In addition to SAGA, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of several groundbreaking projects including:</p>

 
 QKD-GEO, the world’s first quantum key distribution system from geostationary orbit. This initiative will allow secure intercontinental communications and help shape Europe’s role in the future quantum internet. 
 QINSAT, a mission developed to demonstrate space-based quantum information networks. 
 TeQuants, developing satellite technologies for quantum communication links. 
 

<p>The company is also taking part to EuroQCI and its many projects (FranceQCI, Quantum Italy Deployment, Nostradamus, Petrus, etc..,), contributing to Europe’s future quantum communication infrastructure, including its space segment.<br>

    Thales celebrates the order of its 100th CAPTAS variable immersion towed sonar system, a significant milestone in naval defence.  Thales consolidates its status as a world leader in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) solutions. The CAPTAS range equips a wide spectrum of ships: from platforms under 1000 tons to frigate and destroyer-type vessels, 17 different platforms are equipped with Thales variable immersion sonar.  The result of more than 30 years of continuous innovation, and originally developed in close partnership with the British, French and Italian navies, the CAPTAS system is now being tested at sea by 17 navies around the world.

<p>Last week marked our sixth Demo Day, this one focused on <a href="https://liminal.co/demo-day/fighting-third-party-fraud/">Fighting Third-Party Fraud</a>. Ten vendors stepped up to show how their solutions tackle account takeover (ATO), business email compromise (BEC), and synthetic identity fraud. Each had 15 minutes to prove their case, followed by a live Q&amp;A with an audience of fraud, risk, and security leaders.</p>



<p>Across the sessions, a consistent theme emerged: the biggest shift in the fraud prevention market isn’t in the tactics fraudsters use, but how enterprises are buying solutions. Detection is expected; what matters now is whether a tool can keep the business running without stalling growth or turning away good customers. Buyers want assurance that fraud prevention supports stability by keeping customers moving, revenue intact, and trust unbroken when fraud inevitably spikes.</p>



 







 



 What is third-party fraud? 



<p>For readers outside the space, <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03LKv4C0">third-party fraud</a> happens when criminals exploit someone else’s identity to gain access. Unlike first-party fraud, where the individual misrepresents themselves, third-party fraud relies on stolen or fabricated credentials to impersonate a trusted user.</p>



<p>Classic examples include:</p>



 
 Account takeover (ATO): hijacking legitimate accounts, often through phishing or stolen credentials 



 Business email compromise (BEC): impersonating executives or vendors to redirect payments 



 Synthetic identity fraud: blending real and fake data to create convincing personas<br> 
 



<p>In 2024, consumers reported losing <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024">$12.5 billion to fraud</a>, a 25% jump year-over-year and the highest on record. Account takeover attacks alone rose nearly 67% in the past two years as fraudsters leaned on <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03LKvx80">phishing, social engineering, and increasingly AI-driven methods</a>.</p>



<p>As Miguel Navarro, Head of Applied Emerging Technologies at KeyBank, put it: “Think about deepfakes like carbon monoxide — you may think you can detect it, but honestly, it’s untraceable without tools.” That risk is no longer theoretical; it’s already showing up in contact centers and HR pipelines.</p>



 Walking the friction tightrope 



<p>Every fraud solution has to walk a tightrope: protect the business without slowing customers down. In this Demo Day, that balance was explored in the Q&amp;A, with audience questions focusing on onboarding delays, false positives, and manual review trade-offs. What happens when onboarding drags? How are false positives handled? Where do manual reviews fit?</p>



<p>Miguel also added:“…a tool might be a thousand times more effective, but if it’s too complex for teams to adopt, it’s effectively useless.”</p>



<p>Providers responded with different approaches. Several leaned on behavioral and device-based analytics to make authentication seamless, layering signals <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mastercard-ai-credit-card-fraud-detection-protects-consumers-2025-5">like keystroke patterns and device intelligence</a> so genuine users pass in the background. Others showed <a href="https://datos-insights.com/reports/beyond-point-solutions-orchestrating-the-future-of-fraud-prevention/">risk-based orchestration</a>, combining machine learning models and workflows so only high-risk activity triggers extra checks.</p>



 Protecting customers from themselves 



<p>One theme that stood out was how solutions are evolving to address social engineering. As Mzu Rusi, VP of Product Development at Entersekt, explained: “It’s not enough to protect customers from outsiders — sometimes we have to protect them from themselves when they’re being socially engineered to approve fraud.”</p>



<p>That means fraud platforms are no longer judged only on blocking malicious logins. They’re also expected to intervene in context, analyzing signals like whether the user is on a call while approving a transfer, or whether a new recipient account shows signs of mule activity.</p>



 Human touch as a deterrent 



<p>Technology was the backbone of every demo, but Proof emphasized how human interaction remains a powerful fraud defense. Lauren Furey, Principal Product Manager, shared how stepping up to a live identity verification can shut down takeover attempts while preserving trust: “The deterrence of getting a fraudster in front of a human with these tools is enormous. Strong proofing doesn’t have to feel heavy, and customers leave reassured rather than abandoned.”</p>



<p>This balance — minimal friction for real customers, targeted intervention for fraudsters — ran through the day.</p>



 From fraud loss to balance sheet risk 



<p>Fraud was reframed as a balance sheet problem, not just a technology one. As Sunil Madhu, CEO &amp; Founder of Instnt, put it: “Fraud is inevitable. Fraud loss is not. For the first time, businesses can transfer that risk off their balance sheet through fraud loss insurance.”</p>



<p>That comment landed because it spoke to CFO and board-level concerns. Fraud is no longer just an operational hit; it’s a financial exposure that can be shifted, managed, and priced. But shifting fraud into financial terms doesn’t reduce the pressure on prevention teams — it only raises the bar for the technology that keeps fraud within acceptable limits.</p>



 How detection is evolving 



<p>On stage, several demos highlighted identity and device scoring as the new baseline, layering biometrics, transaction history, and tokenization to judge risk in milliseconds. Others pushed detection even earlier in the journey, using pre-submit screening to catch bad actors before they hit submit.</p>



<p>Machine learning also played a central role in the demos. Several providers showed how adaptive models can cut down false positives while continuously improving through feedback loops. Phil Gordon, Head of Solution Consulting at Callsign, described it as creating a kind of “digital DNA”: “Every customer develops a digital DNA — how they type, swipe, or move through a session. That lets us tell genuine users apart from bots, malware, or account takeover attempts in milliseconds.”</p>



<p>That theme carried into the fight against synthetic identities. Alex Tonello, SVP Global Partnerships at Trustfull, explained how fraudsters engineer personas to slip through traditional checks: “Synthetic fraudsters build identities with new emails, new phone numbers, no history. By checking hundreds of open-source signals at scale, we see right through that façade.”</p>



<p>Others extended the conversation to fraud at the network level. Artem Popov, Solutions Engineer at Sumsub, noted: “Fraudsters reuse documents, devices, and identities across hundreds of attempts. By linking those together, you expose entire networks — not just single bad actors.”</p>



 The boardroom shift 



<p>Fraud used to be a line item in operations, managed quietly by fraud prevention teams and written off as the cost of doing business. That’s no longer the case. The scale of losses, reputational damage, and operational disruption means fraud has moved up the agenda and onto boardrooms.</p>



<p>Executives now face a harder challenge: choosing tools that don’t just stop fraud, but that protect business continuity. They want proof that investments in prevention will keep revenue flowing when attacks spike, not just reduce fraud losses on a spreadsheet. Boards are asking whether controls are strong enough to protect customer trust, whether onboarding processes can scale without breaking, and whether the business can keep moving if a wave of account takeovers hits overnight.</p>



<p>They are right to pay attention. Fraud and continuity now rank among the top five enterprise risks. Technology shifts like <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/the-app-store-prevented-more-than-9-billion-usd-in-fraudulent-transactions/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/google-ip-protection-fraud-detection-shift">Google</a> restricting access to device data are making established defenses less reliable, reframing fraud not only as a security issue but as a continuity problem.</p>

 Key Takeaways 



 
 Liminal’s sixth Demo Day spotlighted 10 vendors tackling third-party fraud. 



 Global fraud losses are nearing $1 trillion annually, with ATO alone costing banks $6,000–$13,000 per incident. 



 Audience Q&amp;A revealed that the hardest problems are manual reviews, onboarding delays, and false positives. 



 Leading vendors balance speed, scale, and user experience, reducing both fraud losses and abandonment. 



 Fraud prevention has shifted from a back-office function to a board-level resilience strategy.<br>

<p>The call comes in at 4:55 PM on a Friday. It’s the CFO, and she’s frantic. She’s locked out of her account, needs to approve payroll, and her flight is boarding in ten minutes. She can’t remember the name of her first pet, and the code sent to her phone isn’t working. The pressure is immense. What does your help desk agent do? Do they bypass security to help the executive, or do they hold the line, potentially disrupting a critical business function?</p> 
<p>This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it's a daily, high-stakes gamble for support teams everywhere. And it’s a gamble that attackers are counting on. They know your help desk is staffed by humans who are measured on their ability to resolve problems quickly. They exploit this pressure, turning your most helpful employees into unwitting accomplices in major security breaches. It's time to stop gambling.</p>  
 Why Is Your Help Desk a Prime Target for Social Engineering?  
<p>The modern IT help desk is the enterprise's nerve center. It’s also its most vulnerable entry point. According to industry research, over 40% of all help desk tickets are for password resets and account lockouts (Gartner), each costing up to $70 to resolve (Forrester). This makes the help desk an incredibly attractive and cost-effective target for attackers.</p> 
<p>Why? Because social engineers don't hack systems; they hack people. They thrive in environments where security relies on outdated, easily compromised data points:</p> 
  
  Knowledge-Based Questions (KBA): The name of your first pet or the street you grew up on isn't a secret. It's public information, easily found on social media or purchased for pennies on the dark web.  
  SMS &amp; Email OTPs: Once considered secure, one-time passcodes are now routinely intercepted via SIM swapping attacks and sophisticated phishing campaigns.  
  Employee ID Numbers &amp; Manager Names: This information is often exposed in data breaches and is useless for proving real-time identity.  
  
<p>Relying on this phishable data forces your agents to become human lie detectors, a role they were never trained for and a battle they are destined to lose. The result is a massive, unmitigated risk of help desk-driven account takeover.</p> 
 Shifting from Guesswork to Certainty with HYPR's Help Desk App  
<p>Today, we're fundamentally changing this dynamic. To secure the help desk, you must move beyond verifying what someone knows and instead verify who someone is. That's why we're proud to introduce the HYPR Affirm Help Desk Application.</p> 
<p>This purpose-built application empowers agents by integrating phishing-resistant, multi-factor identity verification directly into their workflow. Instead of asking agents to make high-pressure judgment calls, we give them the tools to verify identity with NIST IAL 2 assurance fast. This transforms your help desk from a primary target into a powerful line of defense against fraud.</p> 
 How Can You Unify Identity Verification for Every Help Desk Scenario?  
<p>The core of the solution is the HYPR Affirm Help Desk App, a command center for agents that integrates seamlessly with your existing support portals (like ServiceNow or Zendesk) and ticketing systems. This provides multiple, flexible paths to resolution, ensuring security and speed no matter how an interaction begins.</p> 
  
  Initiate Verification from Anywhere: 
    
    Self-Service: Empower users to resolve their own issues by launching a secure verification flow directly from your company's support portal.  
    Agent-Assisted: For live calls or chats, an agent can use the HYPR Help Desk App to instantly send a secure, one-time verification link via email or SMS.  
    User-Initiated (with PIN): A user can start the verification process on their own and receive a unique PIN. They provide this PIN to a support agent, who uses it to look up the verified session, ensuring a fast and secure handoff without sharing any PII.  
      
  Verify with Biometric Certainty:<br>The user is guided to scan their government-issued photo ID with their device's camera, followed by a quick, certified liveness-detecting selfie. This isn't just a photo match; the liveness check actively prevents spoofing and deepfake attacks, proving with certainty that the legitimate user is physically present and in control of their ID.  
  Resolve with an Immutable Audit Trail:<br>Once verification is complete, the result is instantly reflected in the agent's Help Desk App. The agent can now confidently proceed with the sensitive task – whether it's a password reset, MFA device recovery, or access escalation. Every step is logged, creating a tamper-proof, auditable record that satisfies the strictest compliance and governance requirements.  
  
 HYPR vs. Legacy Methods: A New Reality for Help Desk Security  
<p>The gap between traditional methods and modern identity assurance is staggering. One relies on luck, the other on proof.</p> 
<p></p> 
 End the Gamble: Stop Account Takeover at the Help Desk  
<p>Your organization can't afford to keep rolling the dice. Every interaction at your help desk is a potential entry point for a catastrophic breach. The pressure on your agents is immense, the methods they've been given are broken, and the attackers are relentless.</p> 
<p>But there is a different path. A path where certainty replaces guesswork. Where your support team is empowered, not exposed. Where your help desk transforms from a cost center and a risk vector into a secure, efficient enabler of the business. By removing the impossible burden of being human lie detectors, you free your agents to do what they do best: help people. Securely.&nbsp;</p>

 Frequently Asked Questions about HYPR Affirm’s Help Desk App (FAQ)  
<p>Q. What is NIST IAL 2 and why is it important for help desk verification?<br>A: NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL 2) is a standard from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. It requires high-confidence identity proofing, including the verification of a government-issued photo ID. For help desk scenarios, meeting this standard ensures you are protected against sophisticated attacks, including deepfakes and social engineering, and is crucial for preventing fraud.<br><br>Q. How long does the verification process actually take for the user?<br>A: The entire user-facing process, from receiving the link to scanning an ID and taking a selfie, is designed for speed and simplicity. A typical full verification is completed in under 2 minutes, and the process is completely configurable.<br><br>Q. What happens if a user doesn't have their physical ID available?<br>A: HYPR Affirm's policy engine is fully configurable. While ID-based verification is the most secure method, organizations can define alternative escalation paths and workflows to securely handle exceptions based on their specific risk tolerance and needs.<br><br>Q. Is this solution just for large enterprises?<br>A: HYPR Affirm for Help Desk is for any organization that needs to eliminate the significant risk of account takeover fraud originating from support interactions. It scales from mid-sized companies to the world's largest enterprises, securing sensitive tasks like password resets, MFA recovery, and access escalations.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our ongoing reflections on the Many-to-Many project. In our last three posts, we’ve taken you through the journey of building our digital platform — from initial concepts and wrestling with complexity to creating our first tangible outputs like the Field Guide and Website. We’ve shared how the project’s tools have emerged from a living, iterative process.</p><p>Today, we’re taking a step back to look at the foundational methodology behind this entire initiative. How do you go about creating new models for collaboration when no blueprint exists? Our approach has been a “proof of possibility” — a live experiment where we, along with our ecosystem of partners, served as the primary test subjects.</p><p>In this post, the initiative’s co-stewards, Michelle and Annette, discuss the profound challenges and unique learnings that come from trying to build the plane while flying&nbsp;it.</p>How the Proof of Possibility fits within a wider context of predecessor work, and flows into other initiatives and partial testing in live&nbsp;contexts<p>Michelle: We wanted to reflect on the “proof of possibility” we ran, where we essentially decided to live prototype on ourselves with a small group of partners in a Learning Network. While it sounds simple, we learned it’s incredibly complex. You’re making decisions and sense-making within a specific prototype, but you’re also constantly trying to translate those learnings into something more generalised and applicable for others. In many ways, it’s a cool, experimental way of working, but it was also a bit of a nightmare.</p>The prototype, test, learn loop that we started to develop in the Proof of Possibility<p>Annette: It was very meta. In this proof of possibility, one of the things we were testing was a learning infrastructure for the ecosystem itself. So you’re testing learning within the experiment, while also prototyping the experiment, and then you have to step back and ask: what did we learn from this specific context versus what is context-agnostic and applicable elsewhere? Then there’s another layer: what did we learn about the wider external landscape and its readiness for this work? And finally, what did we learn about the process of learning about all of that? There’s this feeling of learning about learning about learning.</p><p>It’s representative of the fractal nature of this work. For instance, we were a core team working on our own governance while simultaneously orchestrating and supporting the ecosystem’s governance. The ecosystem itself was then focused on building capabilities of the system for many-to-many governance. It was navigating so many layers. On one hand, this has immense value because you’re looking at one question from multiple angles at once. On the other hand, it has been incredibly cognitively challenging.</p><p>Michelle: It’s that old adage of trying to build the plane whilst flying it — except there are no blueprints for the plane. I think the complexity we bumped into is probably present for anyone trying to do this kind of work, because everyone has to work at fractals all the time. So I was thinking, what are some things we bumped into, and how did we overcome them? The first breakthrough that comes to my mind was when we started to explicitly ask, “Are we talking about this specific prototype right now, or are we talking about the generalised model?” Just having that clear distinction, a shared vocabulary that the whole learning network could use, was a huge moment of alignment for us. It gave people a way to see we were working on at least two layers at the same&nbsp;time.</p>The draft “Layers of the Project” which was created during the project as a visual representation and description of the different spaces we were trying to hold and build all at once. We note that the thinking has evolved and this image has been superseded, but share it here as a point in time&nbsp;image.<p>Annette: Yes and we found that the difference in thinking required for each of those layers was huge. Thinking through the specifics of what we did in one context versus pulling out principles applicable across all/any contexts was such a massive gear shift. Turning a specific example — “here’s something we tried” — into a generalised tool — “here’s something useful for others” — was probably a five-fold increase in workload, if not more. The amount of planning and thinking required was significantly different.</p><p>Michelle: What else comes up for you from this experience of prototyping on ourselves?</p><p>If nothing comes to mind, I can jump in. For me it was the dynamic of being the initiators. We were the ones who convened the group and set the mission. In these complex collaborations, the initiator tends to hold a lot of relational capital, power, and responsibility. This was exacerbated because we were managing all these different layers of learning. It centralised the knowledge and the relational dynamics back to us. If one of us was missing from a budget conversation, for example, it was difficult for others to proceed. For me, the bigger point is that to do good demonstration work, it has to be experimental and emergent. But that doesn’t come for free; it has downsides. This re-centralisation was one of them, and it was a lot for us to&nbsp;hold.</p><p>Annette: That makes me wonder if a certain degree of that centralisation is inevitable in organising for these kind of ‘proof of possibilities’. When something is this complex and emergent, you can only distribute so much, so early. To meet the real-time needs of the collaboration, you need an agile core team. This is where it gets interesting — we were operating in the thin space between a sandbox environment and a live context. It had to be a genuine live context for people to want to participate, but it was also a sandbox for testing the general model. You have to meet the timelines of the live context; you can’t just pause for six months to work out team dynamics, or the collaboration collapses. So you almost need a team providing strong leadership to hold both realities at&nbsp;once.</p><p>Michelle: So, would you do it the same way&nbsp;again?</p><p>Annette: I think if we did it again, the things we’ve learned would make it smoother. We’d be more explicit from the start about which layer we’re discussing. We’d have a better sense of how to capture live learning and translate it into a model as we go. When we started, most of our attention was on hosting the live context, and a lot of the synthesis happened afterwards. Having done it once, I’d be more conscious of doing that synthesis in real-time — though the cognitive lift to switch between those modes is still&nbsp;immense.</p><p>Michelle: I agree, I would do it again with those additions. The other thing is that when we started, we didn’t even really have the process that we wanted to go through. Now we do. We’ve learned more about what works. Starting fresh, we would have a decent sketch of a process to begin with. Not perfect, and you still have to wing it, but it’s a good start. I’d be interested to do it again and see what&nbsp;happens.</p><p>This meta-reflective process — learning about learning while doing — has been a central part of the Many-to-Many initiative creating a ‘Proof of Possibility’ as a way to learn about what’s possible at a system level. While navigating these fractal layers is cognitively demanding, it’s what allows for true emergence, distinguishing this deep, systemic work from simple chaos. It is a messy, challenging, and ultimately fruitful way to discover what’s possible.</p><p>In the Many-to-Many website [coming soon] you will find some resources based on what we did in the Proof of Possibility (Experimenter’s Logs and example methods and artefacts like the Contract) and some based on what might be applicable across contexts (a Field Guide, some tools and an overview of System Blockers we’ve encountered) along with case studies and top tips from other contexts in the learning&nbsp;network.</p><p>Thanks for following our journey.

 Verifiable Credentials are the foundation for faster, safer, and more cost-effective digital strategy. In this new report from Indicio we look at&nbsp; examples of successful deployments, the benefits to business, and explain the risks of waiting too long to adopt this technology. We also explain how to eliminate the cost and uncertainty of developing from scratch, laying out a blueprint for making adoption simple. 
 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Every 2026 budget decision will come down to a simple question: does this investment deliver measurable value. Leaders are expected to cut costs, reduce risk, and still deliver growth. In that environment, the way you handle digital identity can no longer be an afterthought—it has to be a priority.</p>
<p>This is especially true as identity fraud accelerates across all fronts, driven by generative AI brute force attacks, deepfakes, and social media scams. Legacy technology isn’t just failing to keep up, it’s the root cause of these problems.</p>
<p>That is why we wrote&nbsp; <a href="https://indicio.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Indicio-2026-Budget-Recommendations-99.pdf">Decentralized Identity: The Superpower Every 2026 Budget Needs</a>. It explains why Verifiable Credentials are&nbsp; a transformational new technology that combines authentication and fraud prevention in one, simple, and cost effective solution that you can easily inject into your systems and operations.</p>
<p>Can you inoculate your IAM processes against deepfakes?</p>
<p>Yes you can — by incorporating authenticated biometrics into Verifiable Credentials. We explain how organizations are already doing just that to cut fraud and costs, and how you can too, by showing a practical path for adoption.</p>
<p>Now is the time to act. As 2026 budgets are finalized, the organizations that plan for Verifiable Credentials today will be the ones that are positioned to lead their markets. Get an in-depth knowledge and actionable insights that you can turn into immediate savings.</p>

  Bluesky develops open protocols. We're taking a short and simple patent non-aggression pledge to ensure that everybody feels confident building on them.

<p>Bluesky develops open protocols, and we want everybody to feel confident building on them. We have released our software SDKs and reference implementations under Open Source licenses, but those licenses don’t cover everything. To provide additional assurance around patent rights, we are making a non-aggression pledge.</p>
<p>This commitment builds on our recent announcement that we’re <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/taking-at-to-ietf">taking parts of AT to the IETF</a> in an effort to establish long-term governance for the protocol.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are adopting the short and simple <a href="https://github.com/protocol/permissive-license-stack/blob/master/PLEDGE.md">Protocol Labs Patent Non-Aggression Pledge</a>:</p>
 
    <p>
        Bluesky Social will not enforce any of the patents on any software invention Bluesky Social owns now or in the future, except against a party who files, threatens, or voluntarily participates in a claim for patent infringement against (i) Bluesky Social or (ii) any third party based on that party's use or distribution of technologies created by Bluesky Social.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pledge is intended to be a legally binding statement. However, we may still enter into license agreements under individually negotiated terms for those who wish to use Bluesky Social technology but cannot or do not wish to rely on this pledge alone.
    </p>
 
<p>We are grateful to Protocol Labs for the research and legal review they undertook when developing this pledge text, as part of their <a href="https://www.protocol.ai/blog/announcing-the-permissive-license-stack/">permissive intellectual property strategy</a>.</p>

<p>“When not distracted by AI (which, you have to admit, is very distracting), I’ve been thinking a lot about delegation in digital identity. We have the tools that allow administrators or individuals to grant specific permissions to applications and services.”&nbsp; </p>



<p>In theory, it’s a clean model: you delegate only what’s necessary to the right party, for the right time. Consent screens, checkboxes, and admin approvals are supposed to embody that intent.</p>



<p>That said, the incentive structures around delegation don’t actually encourage restraint. They encourage permission grabs and reward broader access, not narrower. And when that happens, what was supposed to be a trust-building mechanism—delegation with informed consent—turns into a trust-eroding practice.</p>

 Delegation’s design intent versus product incentives 



<p>Delegation protocols like <a href="https://fusionauth.io/articles/oauth/modern-guide-to-oauth">OAuth</a> were designed to solve a simple problem: how can an application act on your behalf without you handing over your password? Instead of giving a third-party app your full login, OAuth lets you grant that app a limited token, scoped to specific actions, like “read my calendar” or “post to my timeline.” In enterprise settings, administrators can approve apps at scale, effectively saying, “this tool can access certain company data on behalf of all our employees.”</p>



<p>The intent is least privilege: give just enough access to accomplish the task, nothing more. Tokens should be narrowly scoped, time-bound, and transparent.</p>



<p>But the product incentives push in the opposite direction. If you’re a developer or growth team, every extra permission opens new doors: richer analytics, better personalization, and potentially more revenue. Why ask for the bare minimum when you can ask for a lot more, especially if you can get away with it?</p>



<p>And so the pattern of permission creep emerges. There is an <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2624-800X/5/3/58">interesting study</a> of Android apps, for example, shows that popular apps tend to add more permissions over time, not fewer. The reason isn’t technical necessity; it’s incentive alignment. More access means more opportunities, even if it slowly undermines the trust that delegation was supposed to build.</p>



<p>This is scope inflation: when “read metadata from one folder” somehow balloons into “read and write all files in your entire cloud drive.” From a delegation perspective, it looks absurd. From an incentive perspective, it looks entirely rational.</p>



 Consent as a manufactured outcome 



<p>Let’s talk about “consent.” It’s the shiny wrapper that’s supposed to make delegation safe. The idea is simple: a user sees what’s being requested, makes an informed choice, and either agrees or doesn’t. That’s the theory. In practice, consent is manufactured.</p>



<p>Consent screens are optimized like landing pages. The language is written to minimize friction. The buttons are designed to maximize acceptance. Companies treat “consent rates” the same way they treat sign-up conversions or click-through rates: a metric to push upward.</p>



<p>And the tactics aren’t subtle:</p>



 
 Dark patterns in consent UIs. Regulators in the EU have formally <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-02/edpb_03-2022_guidelines_on_deceptive_design_patterns_in_social_media_platform_interfaces_v2_en_0.pdf">called out</a> manipulative design in cookie banners and social media interfaces; tricks like highlighting the “accept” button in bright colors while burying “reject” in a subtle link. That’s not neutral presentation. That’s steering. 



 Consent-or-pay models. The latest battleground is whether “pay or accept tracking” constitutes valid consent. European regulators <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-04/edpb_opinion_202408_consentorpay_en.pdf">have said</a> that if refusal carries a cost, then consent may not be “freely given.” Yet many sites lean into exactly this model: you can either hand over your data or hand over your credit card. 



 Consent fatigue. When users see banners, pop-ups, and consent prompts multiple times a day, they stop reading. They click whatever gets them through fastest. At that point, it’s no longer informed consent, it’s consent theater. 
 



<p>Delegation without trust is already fragile. Delegation wrapped in manufactured consent is worse: it’s a contract of adhesion where one party has all the power and the other clicks “accept” because they have no real choice.</p>



<p>If you’d like to dive into the consent debate further, I HIGHLY recommend you follow Eve Maler’s <a href="https://workshop.vennfactory.com/">The Venn Factory</a>. She has a great blog series on consent (example <a href="https://workshop.vennfactory.com/p/from-chance-to-control">here</a>) and an even greater <a href="https://learning.vennfactory.com/products/digital_downloads/consent-is-dead">whitepaper</a> (for a fee but totally worth it).</p>



 Enterprise delegation and the admin consent problem 



<p>It’s tempting to think this is just a consumer problem involving cookie banners and mobile apps. But enterprise delegation has its own set of perverse incentives.</p>



<p>Take Microsoft 365 and Entra ID as an example (though let’s be clear that this is absolutely a common scenario). Enterprises can allow third-party apps to request access to user or organizational data through OAuth. To reduce noise, Microsoft lets administrators “consent on behalf of the organization.” Sounds efficient, right? Fewer pop-ups, fewer interruptions for the workforce, saving time (and time = money, right?).</p>



<p>But that efficiency comes at a cost. Attackers exploit this very model through “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/protect-against-consent-phishing">consent phishing</a>”: tricking a user or admin into approving a malicious app that requests broad API scopes. Once granted, those permissions are durable and hard to detect. Microsoft now publishes <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/investigate-risky-oauth">guidance</a> on identifying and remediating risky OAuth apps precisely because the model’s incentives tilt toward convenience over caution.</p>



<p>For administrators, the path of least resistance is to click “Approve for the organization” once and move on. That makes life incrementally easier for everybody: administrators, their users, and the attackers.</p>



 Enforcement as a belated correction 



<p>If the incentives reward broad access, who actually keeps things in check? Increasingly, it’s regulators and courts.</p>



 
 In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has penalized companies like <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/disney-pay-10-million-settle-ftc-allegations-company-enabled-unlawful-collection-childrens-personal">Disney</a> and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-finalizes-order-banning-mobilewalla-selling-sensitive-location-data">Mobilewalla</a> for collecting data under misleading labels or without meaningful consent. The penalties aren’t just financial; they force changes in how products are designed and how defaults are set. 



 In Europe, the IAB’s <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/">Transparency and Consent Framework</a>—the standard that underpins much of adtech—has faced repeated rulings (see examples <a href="https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/citizen/iab-europe-held-responsible-for-a-mechanism-that-infringes-the-gdpr">here</a> and <a href="https://privacymatters.dlapiper.com/2025/06/eu-brussels-court-of-appeal-rules-on-iab-europe-and-the-tc-string-implications-for-gdpr-compliance/">here</a>) that its consent strings are personal data, that aspects of the framework violate GDPR, and that “consent at scale” is not a free pass. Legal battles continue, but I think the message being sent is pretty obvious: broad, opaque consent mechanisms don’t hold up under scrutiny. 



 Regulators have also zeroed in on “<a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2024/edpb-consent-or-pay-models-should-offer-real-choice_en">consent-or-pay</a>” and dark pattern interfaces, explicitly saying that these undermine the principle of freely given consent. 
 



<p>What’s happening is essentially a regulatory realignment of incentives. If the market rewards permission grabs, fines, and rulings change the cost-benefit equation. In some markets, but not all, the cheapest path is shifting to grabbing less data, not more.</p>



 Why this erodes trust 



<p>From the individual’s point of view, none of this is subtle. They notice when an app requests more permissions than it should. They notice when every website they visit demands cookie consent in confusing ways (it is SO ANNOYING). They notice when their IT department approves a sketchy app and they’re the ones who end up phished.</p>



<p>The result is trust erosion. Individuals stop believing that “consent” means choice and assume that every request for access is a data grab in disguise. They are probably not wrong.</p>



<p>And once trust is gone, it’s not easily rebuilt. Every new protocol, every new delegation model, has to fight against that backdrop of suspicion.</p>



 What good looks like 



<p>If delegation and consent are to survive as trust-building mechanisms, they have to look different from how they look today. Here are a few ways to realign the incentives:</p>



 
 Purpose-bound scopes. Tokens should be tied to specific actions, not broad categories. “Read file metadata for this folder” is a very different ask than “Read all your files.” 



 Time-boxed tokens. Access should expire quickly unless explicitly renewed. Long-lived tokens are an incentive to attackers and a liability for providers. 



 Refusal symmetry. The “reject” button should be as prominent and easy to click as the “accept” button. Anything less is manipulation. 



 Transparent change logs. Apps should publish what scopes they request and why, with a clear history of when those scopes changed. If permissions creep is inevitable, at least make it visible. 



 Admin consent boards. In enterprises, app approval should involve more than a single overworked admin. Formal review processes—similar to change advisory boards—can slow down risky delegation without grinding everything to a halt. 



 Trust reports. Companies could publish regular “trust reports” that show how delegation and consent are actually being managed. Which apps request what? How often are tokens revoked? How many requests are denied? Turning these into KPIs re-aligns incentives toward trust, not just conversion. 
 



 Who actually benefits? 



<p>So, back to the original question: who actually benefits from delegation and consent as practiced today?</p>



 
 Companies benefit from broader access because it feeds product features, analytics, and monetization. 



 Attackers benefit when that broad access is abused, because consent tokens and admin approvals often outlive user awareness. 



 Regulators benefit politically when they enforce, because they’re seen as protecting consumer rights. 



 Users? Users benefit in theory, but in practice, they’re the least likely to see real advantage. Their consent is optimized against, their delegation scopes are inflated, and their trust is constantly eroded. 
 



<p>Delegation and consent were supposed to empower users. Right now, they mostly empower everyone else.</p>



 The path forward 



<p>Delegation is too valuable to discard; it is definitely <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/03/delegation-part-one/">having its moment</a> given the complexities of doing it correctly. Consent is too foundational to abandon; the alternative of not asking at all is at least as bad as asking too much. But both need to be reclaimed from the incentive structures that have warped them.</p>



<p>That means treating trust as the KPI, not just consent click-through rates. It means designing delegation flows that prioritize least privilege, not maximum access. It means regulators continuing to push back against manipulative practices, and companies recognizing that the long game is trust, not just data.</p>



<p>If the only people who benefit from delegation and consent are companies and attackers, then the rest of us have been sold a story. And the longer that story holds, the harder it will be to convince users that their “yes” actually means something. If your bosses are having a hard time understanding that, feel free to print out this post and slide it under their office door. They might think a bit more deeply about their decisions going forward.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:30] Welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. Today’s episode is called Delegation and Who Actually Benefits?</p>



<p>[00:00:37] This piece builds on earlier conversations and writing about delegation and digital identity.</p>



<p>[00:00:44] Today, we’ll explore how incentive structures push companies to grab broader permissions than they really need—and how that erodes trust.</p>



 



 The Clean Model of Delegation 



<p>[00:00:53] When not distracted by all the AI news—which you have to admit is very distracting—I’ve been thinking a lot about delegation and digital identity.</p>



<p>We have tools that allow administrators or individuals to grant specific permissions to applications and services. In theory, this is a very clean model:</p>



 
 Delegate only what’s necessary 



 To the right party 



 For the right time 
 



<p>[00:01:18] Consent screens, checkboxes, and admin approvals are all supposed to embody this principle.</p>



<p>[00:01:24] Unfortunately, incentives don’t encourage restraint. They encourage permission grabs. That reward system favors broader access, not narrower. What should be a trust-building mechanism often turns into a trust-eroding practice.</p>



 



 OAuth and the Design of Least Privilege 



<p>[00:01:40] Delegation protocols like OAuth were created to solve a practical problem:</p>



<p>[00:01:47] How can an application act on your behalf without requiring your password?</p>



<p>Instead of handing over login credentials, OAuth allows granting a limited token. Ideally, that token is:</p>



 
 Scoped to a specific action (e.g., read my calendar) 



 Time-bound 



 Transparent 
 



<p>[00:02:17] In enterprise settings, administrators can approve apps at scale. That way, employees aren’t asked to answer the same questions repeatedly.</p>



<p>[00:02:28] But here’s the issue: incentives push in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>[00:02:32] Service builders want broader access because:</p>



 
 More permissions unlock richer analytics 



 Data enables personalization 



 Extra information can be monetized 
 



<p>[00:02:42] Growth teams treat every consent screen as a conversion funnel to optimize. Why ask for less when asking for more is easier?</p>



<p>[00:02:59] The result is permission creep. Studies of Android apps show that popular apps add permissions over time—not fewer.</p>



 



 Consent in Theory vs. Consent in Practice 



<p>[00:03:34] On paper, consent is the safeguard. Users see what’s requested and make an informed choice.</p>



<p>[00:03:48] In practice, consent is manufactured. Consent screens are optimized like landing pages.</p>



 
 Language minimizes friction 



 Buttons maximize acceptance 



 Consent rates are tracked as key metrics 
 



<p>[00:04:00] Dark patterns dominate: cookie banners where “Accept All” is bright and obvious, while “Reject” hides as a faint gray link.</p>



<p>[00:04:15] Regulators in Europe have called this out as manipulative.</p>



<p>[00:04:20] Then there are “consent or pay” models: accept tracking or pay for access. Regulators argue this undermines freely given consent.</p>



<p>[00:04:33] And, of course, there’s consent fatigue. Repeated banners train users to click without thinking. What’s left isn’t informed consent—it’s consent theater.</p>



<p>[00:04:46] Delegation without trust is fragile. Delegation wrapped in manufactured consent is worse.</p>



 



 Enterprise Risks and Consent Phishing 



<p>[00:05:01] This isn’t just a consumer problem. Enterprise environments like Microsoft 365 and Entra ID carry their own risks.</p>



<p>[00:05:13] Enterprises can let third-party apps request organizational data. To reduce friction, admins can consent on behalf of the entire company.</p>



<p>[00:05:22] Efficient, yes. Dangerous, absolutely.</p>



<p>[00:05:24] Attackers exploit this through consent phishing—tricking admins into approving malicious apps with broad permissions. Once granted, this access is durable and hard to detect.</p>



<p>[00:05:39] Microsoft even publishes playbooks to spot risky OAuth apps, acknowledging the problem.</p>



<p>[00:05:44] But incentives still tilt toward convenience. For overworked admins, approving once feels easier than vetting thoroughly.</p>



 



 Regulatory Realignment of Incentives 



<p>[00:06:03] If incentives reward broad access, who reins it in? Increasingly, regulators.</p>



<p>[00:06:11] In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has penalized companies for misleading consent practices.</p>



 
 Disney and Mobilewalla paid fines 



 Companies were required to change product design, not just pay penalties 
 



<p>[00:06:26] In Europe, the IAB’s Transparency and Consent Framework has been ruled non-compliant with GDPR. Courts held that consent at scale does not equal valid consent.</p>



<p>[00:06:46] Regulators are also challenging “consent or pay” models, stating they undermine freely given consent.</p>



<p>[00:06:59] This is a regulatory re-alignment of incentives. If the market rewards permission grabs, fines and rulings push companies in the opposite direction—toward less data collection.</p>



 



 The User’s Perspective and Erosion of Trust 



<p>[00:07:14] From the user’s point of view, the problem is visible:</p>



 
 Apps request more permissions than needed 



 Cookie banners are confusing 



 IT teams approve apps that later lead to phishing 
 



<p>[00:07:46] The result is erosion of trust. Users stop believing that:</p>



 
 Consent equals choice 



 Delegation equals least privilege 
 



<p>[00:07:56] Once trust is lost, it’s hard to rebuild. Every new product must fight against this backdrop of suspicion.</p>



 



 How Do We Fix This? 



<p>[00:07:58] So how can delegation and consent become real trust-building mechanisms instead of hollow rituals?</p>



<p>[00:08:04] Here’s a list:</p>



 
 Purpose-bound scopes: tokens tied to specific actions, not broad categories 



 Time-boxed tokens: access that expires quickly unless renewed 



 Refusal symmetry: reject buttons as visible and easy as accept buttons 



 Transparent change logs: apps publishing history of permission requests 



 Admin consent boards: enterprise review panels instead of one pressured approver 



 Trust reports: companies disclosing how often requests are denied, access revoked, and policies enforced 
 



<p>[00:09:05] Each of these shifts incentives toward making trust the key performance indicator.</p>



 



 Who Actually Benefits? 



<p>[00:09:16] Returning to the original question: who benefits from delegation and consent today?</p>



 
 Companies: more permissions, more data, more revenue 



 Regulators: political capital when stepping in 



 Attackers: durable, broad tokens for persistence 



 People: benefit mostly in theory, but often remain the least protected 
 



<p>[00:09:57] Delegation and consent were meant to empower users. Today, they mostly empower everyone else.</p>



<p>[00:10:04] But both are too important to discard. They must be reclaimed from warped incentives.</p>



<p>[00:10:18] That means:</p>



 
 Treating trust as the KPI 



 Designing delegation for least privilege, not maximum access 



 Regulators continuing to push back against manipulation 
 



<p>[00:10:30] Because if only companies and attackers benefit, we’ve lost the plot.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>[00:10:44] If you want to dive deeper, explore the work of Eve Maler at the Venn Factory. Her white paper on consent is a fantastic resource worth reading.</p>

They were introduced in Ethereum’s earliest days, designed around a single principle: one private key controls one account. That design is elegant in its simplicity and still unmatched when it comes to long-term security.</p><p>But as Web3 evolves into a world of portable, reputation-based, and privacy-first identity, it’s worth asking: where do EOAs fit&nbsp;in?</p> What Are EOAs in&nbsp;Web3? <p>An EOA is the most basic account type in Ethereum and many other blockchains. Unlike smart contracts, EOAs have no internal code or logic. They exist to send and receive assets, secured entirely by a private&nbsp;key.</p><p>If you control the key, you control the account.

Pair one with a hardware wallet and you have one of the most secure setups in all of&nbsp;crypto.</p>  Staking: EOAs work perfectly for locking up assets in staking positions.  Governance tokens: If you plan to hold voting power for years, an EOA keeps it&nbsp;safe.  NFT collections: For high-value NFTs meant for long-term ownership, EOAs are the best&nbsp;option.  Institutional custody: Funds and DAOs often rely on EOAs for their simplicity and auditability.  <p>The lack of flexibility is what makes them secure. No extra logic means fewer attack vectors. No recovery flows means fewer trust assumptions. Just a private key, a wallet, and assets locked away until you decide to move&nbsp;them.</p> Why EOAs Struggle as Daily Web3&nbsp;Identity <p>The problem comes when EOAs are forced into a role they weren’t designed for: identity.</p><p>Daily Web3 identity requires accounts that&nbsp;are:</p>  Recoverable if a key is lost or a device&nbsp;breaks  Readable with human-friendly identifiers instead of 42-character hex&nbsp;strings  Portable across chains, dApps, and platforms  Flexible enough to hold credentials, permissions, and reputation  <p>EOAs can’t do any of this. They’re silent vaults. They don’t carry context or history. They can’t evolve as your needs change. And they put every bit of risk onto one fragile&nbsp;key.</p><p>This is where smart wallets and Account Abstraction take&nbsp;over.</p> EOAs vs Smart Wallets: Dividing the&nbsp;Labor <p>It’s easy to frame EOAs and smart wallets as competitors, but that’s the wrong way to look at it. They’re complements. Each plays a specific role in the Web3&nbsp;stack.</p>  EOAs are vaults: best for long-term asset storage, cold custody, and high-value holdings.  Smart wallets are identity: built for daily use, recovery, credentials, cross-chain logic, and compliance.  <p>Instead of replacing EOAs, smart wallets expand Web3 identity beyond them. The vaults still exist, but identity moves into programmable, human-friendly infrastructure.</p> Why EOAs Still Matter for the Future of&nbsp;Web3 <p>Even as smart wallets gain adoption, EOAs will remain essential for three&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Security: The simplicity of EOAs makes them the most secure baseline for&nbsp;storage.  Reliability: They are battle-tested and widely supported across every major blockchain.  Foundation: Many smart wallets ultimately anchor to EOAs under the hood, ensuring that the vault layer remains&nbsp;intact.  <p>In other words, EOAs aren’t going away. They are the bedrock of Web3. But they can’t carry the entire weight of identity.</p> The Balance&nbsp;Ahead <p>The future of Web3 identity is not either-or. It’s&nbsp;both.</p>  Use EOAs for vaults: keep long-term assets locked down in their simplest, most secure&nbsp;form.  Use smart wallets for identity: manage recovery, credentials, and interactions across chains and applications.  <p>Together they cover the full spectrum of what Web3 demands: immovable security on one end, human usability on the&nbsp;other.</p> Try It Yourself: EOAs with ONT ID in ONTO&nbsp;Wallet <p>EOAs are the backbone of long-term Web3 security. With ONT ID, you can anchor an EOA to your decentralized identity and keep assets safe while still unlocking future-ready features like staking and verifiable credentials.</p><p>Download <a href="https://onto.app/">ONTO Wallet</a>&nbsp;to:</p>  Manage EOAs for secure asset&nbsp;storage  Stake directly from your&nbsp;vaults  Connect your EOA to <a href="https://ont.id/">ONT ID</a> for portable&nbsp;identity  Explore verifiable credentials while keeping full self&nbsp;custody  <p>Whether you’re holding tokens, securing NFTs, or preparing for the next phase of Web3 identity, ONTO Wallet gives you the flexibility of smart features with the permanence of&nbsp;EOAs.</p> Learn More: How Smart Wallets Complete the&nbsp;Picture <p>EOAs may be the vaults of Web3, but they’re only half the story.

<p>In 2025, our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital footprints</a> are vast and vulnerable— and online privacy is an urgent issue.</p>



<p>This guide covers everything you need to know about online privacy:</p>



 
 What are personal data and your digital footprint? 



 Who’s collecting your personal information and why? 



 What happens when your information gets into the wrong hands? 



 What is data privacy? 



 Are there data privacy laws? 



 What you can do to protect yourself 
 



<p></p>



 What are personal data and your digital footprint? 



<p>Your digital footprint is all the information about you that exists on the internet because of your online activity. It’s sometimes called your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a> because, just as&nbsp;engine&nbsp;exhaust is residue from using&nbsp;a car, digital exhaust&nbsp;is residue from using the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your data is collected from:</p>



 
 Websites (cookies, tracking pixels, session recording) 



 Mobile apps (permissions, background data sharing) 



 Social media (likes, shares, behaviour analysis in social graphs and interest graphs) 



 Smart devices 



 Artificial intelligence (AI) tools 



 Public WiFi and location tracking 
 



<p></p>



<p>Your digital footprint contains what’s called your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-personal-data/">personal data</a>. Data is information, and &nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal data</a> (or personal information or (to get technical) <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>) is <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/PII">officially defined</a> as any data that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity and any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf">Examples</a>&nbsp;of PII are:</p>



 
 your full name, maiden name, mother‘s maiden name, and alias 



 your date of birth, place of birth, race, religion, weight, activities, geographical indicators 



 employment information, medical information, education information, financial information 



 personal ID numbers such as your SSN and passport and driver license numbers 



 your addresses 



 your telephone numbers 



 IP or MAC address 



 personal characteristics, including photographic images, x-rays, fingerprints, or other biometric image 



 your vehicle registration number or title number 
 



<p></p>



 Who’s collecting your personal information and why? 



<p>Our digital world is now so reliant on user data it’s described as <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">surveillance capitalism</a> and the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>. Loads of players have their fingers in this “personal data pie”, including:</p>



 Big tech 



<p>Tech companies like Alphabet (Google), Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft are giving you “free” access to their platforms and products in return for your personal information, time, and attention. Have you heard the saying, “If you’re not paying for the product, you ARE the product?”</p>



<p>Part of your digital footprint is also what’s known as your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">social graph</a> and your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">interest graph</a>. A <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">social graph</a> is a digital map of who you know—your relationships within a social network including your friends, family, coworkers, etc., while an <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">interest graph</a> maps what you like—it connects you to other people based on shared interests, hobbies and topics, rather than personal relationships.</p>



<p>Big tech uses all this personal data to:</p>



 
 Sell ads to third-party advertisers that serve you personalized ads (those scarily coincidental ads that pop up within seconds of your search for a product) 



 Control the content you see, including news feeds and social media posts 



 Set higher prices (you search for something high risk like “motor racing” and suddenly your insurance premium goes up) 



 Influence your political decisions (read up on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election">Cambridge Analytica</a>&nbsp;for a famous example).&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>And here’s another thing: most users never consent to their information being used in these ways. Most privacy policies are long, vague, and unreadable, and <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-mismanagement-of-user-consent-data-and-its-consequences">user consent is complex</a>. What’s more, many apps use <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>—design tricks that pressure users to share more information and buy more products than they want to.</p>



 Data brokers 



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">Data brokers</a>, which are about 4000 legitimate but unregulated organizations worldwide, are gathering and collating your lucrative data to sell profiles to advertisers, insurers, and political groups. These profiles can include:</p>



 
 your age 



 marital status 



 where you live 



 your email address 



 employer 



 how much money you make 



 how many children you have 



 where you shop 



 what you buy 



 your medical conditions and health issues 



 who you vote for and support 
 



<p></p>



<p>Data brokers usually sell user information to brands in list form. Your email address&nbsp;on a list of people with a particular medical condition&nbsp;such as diabetes would be worth about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">$79</a>&nbsp;and on&nbsp;a list of&nbsp;a particular class of&nbsp;traveller about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">$251</a>.&nbsp;And that’s another thing: A lot of your personal data online isn’t stuff you’d want to share around. While data brokers say the data is anonymized, it’s scarily simple to&nbsp;re-identify so-called “anonymous” data.&nbsp;In fact, some researchers say anonymous data <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/">is a lie</a>, and that unless all aspects of de-identifying data are done right, it is incredibly easy to re-identify the subjects.</p>



 Governments 



<p>Worldwide, governments use citizens’ personal data for surveillance under the guise of national security, public safety, and crime prevention. For example, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/02/27/us-govt-demands-millions-of-google-apple-and-meta-user-accounts/">Proton recently reported</a> that Google, Apple and Meta have handed over data on 3.1 million accounts to the US authorities over the last decade (regardless of which political party was in the White House), providing information such as emails, files, messages, and other highly personal information.</p>



<p>“In the past, the government relied on massive, complex and legally questionable surveillance apparatus run by organizations like the NSA. But thanks to the advent of surveillance capitalism, this is no longer necessary,” said Raphael Auphan, Proton’s chief operating officer. </p>



<p>“All that’s required for the government to find out just about everything it could ever need is a request message to big tech in California. And as long as big tech refuses to implement widespread end-to-end encryption, these massive, private data reserves will remain open to abuse,” Auphan added.</p>



 Hackers and scammers 



<p>Criminals exploit stolen data in many <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">different ways</a>, which brings us to the next point …</p>



 What happens when your personal information gets into the wrong hands? 



<p>We’ve covered what brands and governments do with your <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a>. Bad actors can also do a lot of <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">damage with your data</a>:</p>



 
 Identity theft: Using your stolen information to impersonate you for financial gain or to commit crimes 



 Financial fraud: Accessing your bank accounts, credit card information, or other financial accounts to make unauthorized transactions 



 Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be from legitimate organizations to trick you into revealing more information or clicking on malicious links 



 Social engineering: Manipulating you into divulging confidential information, often by posing as someone you trust or using your stolen information to build credibility 



 Account takeover: Gaining unauthorized access to your online accounts (email, social media, etc.) using your stolen usernames and passwords 



 Tax fraud: Using stolen personal information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds 



 Medical identity theft: Using your stolen information to get medical services and prescriptions, or to fraudulently file insurance claims 



 Employment fraud: Using your stolen information to illegally gain employment or benefits 



 Blackmail or extortion: Threatening to expose your sensitive information unless you pay a ransom 



 Creating fake identities: Using your stolen information to create new identities for various fraudulent purposes. 
 



<p></p>



 Data breaches are the new normal 



<p>One way bad actors get your information is through <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>. A data breach is a security event where highly sensitive, confidential or protected information is accessed or disclosed without permission or is lost.</p>



<p>We’ve almost come to expect massive, damaging data breaches. The year <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">2024 had the most data breaches</a> on record, and 2025 has already seen the largest data breach of all time: the leaking of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/16-billion-passwords-leaked-in-largest-data-breach-ever-check-tips-to-protect-your-facebook-instagram-accounts/articleshow/121975530.cms?from=mdr">more than 16 billion usernames and passwords</a> to user accounts with Apple, Facebook, Google, other social media accounts, and government services.</p>



 AI is making data privacy worse 



<p>AI is connecting just about everything in our lives, from our vehicles to eyewear, and we’re using it in all sorts of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/14/upshot/up-ai-uses.html">everyday ways</a>. But AI presents privacy risks not only in what we share but also in how AI can analyze, infer, and act on that information without our permission (think: <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/beware-ai-generated-deepfake-texts-emails-and-websites-this-holiday-season/">deep fakes</a>, for example).</p>



<p><a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">Academics</a> have already identified at least <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">12 privacy risks from AI</a>, and safe and ethical <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-governance">AI governance</a> is a priority.</p>



 What is online privacy? 



<p>You might say, “I have nothing to hide”, “Privacy tools are only for criminals” or “Social media is harmless fun,” but against this backdrop of risks and damage, you can see the urgent need to protect your online privacy (or <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-privacy/">data privacy</a>). This is about your rights to control your personal information and how it’s used. </p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/9-reasons-why-data-privacy-matters/">Data privacy matters</a> because it protects our fundamental right to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and <a href="https://teachprivacy.com/10-reasons-privacy-matters/">means we can</a>:</p>



 
 Limit others’ control over us to know about us and to cause us harm 



 Better manage our professional and personal reputations&nbsp; 



 Put in place boundaries and encourage respect 



 Maintain trust in relationships and interactions with others 



 Protect our right to free speech and thought 



 Pursue&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-sudos-can-give-you-a-second-chance-at-digital-privacy/">second chances</a>&nbsp;for regaining our privacy 



 Feel empowered that we’re in control of our life.&nbsp; 
 



 Are there data privacy laws? 



<p>Data privacy laws are designed to give users more control over their personal data by regulating how organizations can collect, store, and use that information.</p>



<p>As at 2024, <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/identifying-global-privacy-laws-relevant-dpas">137 countries</a> have national data privacy <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/global-privacy-directory/">laws</a>, which means <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/global-privacy-directory/">70%</a> of nations worldwide, <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/global-privacy-directory/">6.3 billion</a> people, or <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/global-privacy-directory/">79.3%</a> of the world’s population is covered by some form of national data privacy law.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/us-lawmakers-try-again-for-federal-data-privacy-bill">many attempts</a>, the United States is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;a strong&nbsp;national privacy law&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">similar to the European Union’s GDPR</a>—the gold standard for consumer data privacy protections and with regulatory impact around the world. Instead, the US has a patchwork of <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">state-based privacy laws</a>. A dedicated working group was recently formed to try again on a US federal privacy law, so watch this space.</p>



 What you can do to protect your personal information and online privacy 



<p>Regardless of the laws, you can do a lot to protect yourself. First, you need to cover some basics:</p>



 
 Use strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. Store them securely in a password manager. 



 Enable two-factor authentication (2FA). 



 Don’t share sensitive details on public platforms or unsecured websites. 



 Keep your software and devices updated. 



 Be cautious of phishing emails and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/fbi-says-secure-your-texts-beware-toll-smishing-get-mysudo-now/">smishing</a> texts, links, and attachments. 



 Know&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">what to do</a>&nbsp;in the event of a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>. 



 Switch to a private browser that stops ads and tracking. 



 Use end-to-end encrypted messaging and calling, wherever possible. 



 Regularly review your privacy settings&nbsp;on platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, and LinkedIn to limit data collection. 



 Limit app permissions&nbsp;to stop third-party services from accessing your data. 



 Regularly audit your online activity&nbsp;to remove old or inactive connections, unfollow accounts, and mute topics you’re not interested in. 



 Unsubscribe from unnecessary services. 



 Clear browsing history and cookies regularly

<p>Imagine walking into an airport and breezing through security just because a camera recognized your face. That’s not science fiction anymore. This is the power of face recognition software, a technology that maps your unique facial features and matches them against stored data.</p>
<p>From unlocking smartphones to catching criminals, this software is shaping our everyday lives. But along with convenience come questions about accuracy, privacy, and trust. Let’s break it down in simple words so you know what’s happening behind the lens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Face Recognition Software 
<p>Face recognition software is a type of biometric technology that identifies or verifies a person by analyzing facial features. Think of it as a digital fingerprint, but for your face.</p>
<p>The process usually starts with face matching software, which compares a captured image to existing images in a database. This allows systems to confirm if two faces belong to the same individual.</p>
<p>For everyday people, the most relatable example is your smartphone. Every time you unlock it by looking at the screen, the phone uses a form of this software to confirm your identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Face Recognition Software Works Behind the Scenes 
<p>At first glance, it feels magical. But under the hood, face recognition is powered by math, algorithms, and a whole lot of data crunching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Data Capture and Photo Face Detection Software 
<p>It starts when a camera captures your face. The photo face detection software identifies the position of your eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. These landmarks form the foundation of your facial “map.”</p>
<p></p>
 2. Feature Extraction with Algorithms 
<p>Next, the software measures distances between facial features, like the space between your eyes or the curve of your jawline. These measurements are converted into numerical data known as a faceprint.</p>
<p></p>
 3. Matching Process with Databases 
<p>Finally, the system compares this faceprint against a database of known faces. If there’s a match within the confidence threshold, the system identifies the individual.</p>
<p></p>
 Best Face Recognition Software Applications in Real Life 
<p>This technology is not limited to spy movies. It’s deeply integrated into industries we interact with daily.</p>
<p>Here are the most common applications:</p>
 
 Smartphones and gadgets – Unlocking phones, securing payments, and managing app access.
<p></p> 
 Airports and border control – Faster identity checks, reducing wait times for travelers.
<p></p> 
 Healthcare – Identifying patients and protecting medical records.
<p></p> 
 Banking – Preventing fraud with stronger security measures.
<p></p> 
 Retail – Recognizing VIP customers or preventing theft.
<p></p> 
 Law enforcement – Finding missing persons or identifying suspects in crowds.
<p></p> 
 
<p>A growing use is facial recognition software for photos, where apps automatically tag friends or group images. Social media platforms rely heavily on this feature, which has made photo management much easier for users worldwide.</p>
<p></p>
 Comparing the Top Facial Recognition Software Options 
<p>With so many tools available, how do you know which one stands out? Independent evaluations, like the<a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt/"> NIST Face Recognition Vendor Test</a>, provide objective data on performance. You can also check the<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html"> FRVT 1:1 performance reports</a> for in-depth benchmarking.</p>
<p>Here’s a simplified comparison table of criteria that matter most:</p>



Criteria
Why It Matters
What to Look For


Accuracy
Correctly identifying or verifying faces
High true positive rate


Speed
How quickly results are delivered
Real-time or near real-time


Scalability
Handling millions of faces
Cloud or distributed systems


Compliance
Following laws like GDPR
Transparent privacy policies


Cost
Fits your business budget
Flexible pricing models



<p>This breakdown helps businesses pick the top facial recognition software for their specific needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Privacy and Legal Concerns with Face Recognition 
<p>Now comes the elephant in the room. As powerful as this technology is, it raises eyebrows when it comes to personal freedom.</p>
 
 Data storage – Where are your facial scans stored, and for how long?
<p></p> 
 Consent – Are you being recognized without agreeing to it?
<p></p> 
 Misuse – Could governments or companies abuse this technology for surveillance?
<p></p> 
 
<p>In Europe, these questions tie directly into<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"> GDPR compliance</a>. The rules emphasize transparency, data minimization, and user rights. If an organization mishandles face data, the penalties can be steep.</p>
<p>A 2021 study found that 56 percent of people worry about misuse of facial recognition by authorities. This shows that while the tech is impressive, trust remains fragile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Open Source Face Recognition Options for Developers 
<p>Not all solutions are locked behind expensive paywalls. Developers and small businesses often turn to face recognition opensource tools. These options allow for flexibility, customization, and cost savings.</p>
<p>Advantages of open-source tools include:</p>
 
 Free or low-cost access to powerful libraries.
<p></p> 
 Large communities that support development.
<p></p> 
 Ability to customize for unique projects.
<p></p> 
 Faster innovation through collaboration.
<p></p> 
 
<p>One notable resource is the<a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision"> Recognito Vision GitHub</a>, where developers can explore codebases, contribute, and experiment with new applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Future Trends in Face Recognition Technology 
<p>The pace of innovation isn’t slowing down. Researchers are refining algorithms to improve speed and reduce bias.</p>
<p>Future trends to watch:</p>
 
 Ethical AI – Systems that reduce bias across race and gender.
<p></p> 
 Edge computing – Processing data on devices instead of servers for faster results.
<p></p> 
 Integration with IoT – Smart cities that use recognition for traffic, safety, and efficiency.
<p></p> 
 Privacy-first models – More tools will adopt privacy-by-design frameworks.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Experts predict that within the next decade, face recognition will be as common as passwords are today, though hopefully far more secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">Face recognition software</a> is no longer futuristic tech, it’s a reality shaping security, convenience, and even social interactions. From photo face detection software to face matching software, its reach is growing rapidly. Yet, the real challenge is balancing innovation with privacy. Companies that master this balance will win trust in the long run.</p>
<p>And speaking of innovation, <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> is one brand pushing these boundaries with responsible and practical applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Why are identity and data critical in healthcare? 
<p>Healthcare —both public and private— faces a structural challenge: managing massive volumes of sensitive data from patients, professionals, and institutions while ensuring accuracy, security, and transparency. So, how Extrimian Drives Digital Trust in Healthcare?</p>
<p>Today’s systems are fragmented. Patient admissions, authorizations, professional validations, or organ transplant waiting lists still rely on manual processes or disconnected databases. The consequences are severe:</p>
 
 
<p>Excessive bureaucracy → long delays for authorizations, transplants, or referrals.</p>
 
 
<p>Hidden costs → thousands of hours in manual administrative work.</p>
 
 
<p>Fraud risks → falsified medical degrees or manipulated patient records.</p>
 
 
<p>Social distrust → patients unsure if they are on the correct waiting list; doctors lacking visibility into processes.</p>
 
 
<p>In a sector where every minute can make the difference between life and death, the question becomes urgent: How can healthcare systems modernize identity and data management without sacrificing security or trust?</p>
 
 What does Extrimian propose to solve these challenges? 
<p>Extrimian provides an ecosystem of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and digital identity tools enabling hospitals, clinics, insurers, and public agencies to:</p>
 
 
<p>Issue and validate credentials in seconds, instead of manual processes taking days.</p>
 
 
<p>Guarantee advanced security, with tamper-proof, instantly verifiable records.</p>
 
 
<p>Ensure compliance with international standards (W3C, DIF, GDPR, HIPAA).</p>
 
 
<p>Optimize costs and resources, cutting bureaucracy and human errors.</p>
 
 
<p>Improve patient and professional experience, simplifying access and workflows.</p>
 
 
<p>All built on principles of privacy by design, interoperability, and open standards.</p>
 
 How does self-sovereign identity (SSI) apply to healthcare? 
<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) places individuals at the center of control over their personal data.</p>
 
 
<p>For patients: medical history, diagnoses, or lab results can be issued as portable, verifiable credentials.</p>
 
 
<p>For medical professionals: degrees, licenses, and certifications are turned into tamper-proof VCs that any hospital can instantly verify.</p>
 
 
<p>For institutions: each credential is validated without intermediaries and easily integrated into existing hospital systems.</p>
 
 
<p>SSI does not replace health systems; it strengthens them with a new layer of trust.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/salud/incucai">Instituto Nacional Central Único Coordinador de Ablación e Implante (INCUCAI) </a>faced a long-standing challenge: managing the national emergency transplant waiting list.</p>
 The problem

 Reflections from the DWeb Seminar <p>In August I had the privilege of participating in the <a href="https://dwebseminar.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Seminar 2025</a>, an intimate gathering designed to “map the current DWeb technological landscape, learn from each other, and define the challenges ahead”.&nbsp; For those unfamiliar with the event, Wendy Hanamura’s excellent recap captures <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/09/03/the-adjacent-possible-in-the-decentralized-web/?ref=blog.holochain.org">the spirit and outcomes beautifully.</a> As part of the event we were invited to offer a 15 minute “input talk” to the other participants. &nbsp; I chose to share a fundamental question that has driven Holochain from its inception – and explore how this question shapes not just our technology, but our entire approach to building decentralized systems.</p> The Core Question: How Does Desirable Social Coherence Evolve? <p>Everything we do at Holochain (and the projects that I've been nurturing through Lightningrod Labs, like Moss and Acorn) stems from this central inquiry. But what do I mean by “desirable social coherence” and why does it matter?&nbsp;</p><p>You can think of social coherence as a group’s long-term stability. Like most things this property exists along a gradient: some social bodies have more coherence than others, which depends on their capacity to respond and adapt to environmental changes as a result of the patterns, practices and organizing principles that they operate by.&nbsp; But therein lies the rub.&nbsp; Some of&nbsp; these patterns provide lots of coherence, but they may not be desirable or pleasant for the individuals taking part in them!&nbsp; It’s no fun for almost everybody involved in an authoritarian regime, but it does have a real degree of stability. &nbsp; My fundamental belief, however,&nbsp; is that not only is it possible to evolve these patterns and processes in directions that participants will find pleasant and desirable, but that doing so actually yields the most long term stability because they will by that fact not contribute to destabilizing it.</p><p>The Challenge: Current digital systems scale through centralization and intermediation of critical social functions. Unfortunately, this creates undesirable forms of social coherence – power imbalances that enable both intentional and unintentional abuse. When a few entities control the platforms where billions interact, we may get coherence, but it's often extractive rather than generative. Furthermore our current systems are difficult to evolve because of their very centralization and the interests that want to keep them that way to maintain power.</p><p>The Opportunity: Decentralized technology can create substrates for evolvable social coherence – essentially, DNA for social organisms. Instead of rigid, centralized structures, we can build infrastructure that enables new forms of social fabric to emerge and multiple scales, yielding increasing collective intelligence</p><p>A key insight here is that there is no single “correct” form of social coherence. What works is contextual, diverse across time, space, and scale. What we need is infrastructure that enables continuous evolution and discovery – balancing stability with emergence.&nbsp;</p> How This Shapes Our Work at Holochain <p>This framework isn’t abstract philosophy - it directly informs every architectural decision we make. When building technology to support evolvable social coherence, several principles become essential:</p><p>Engagement Spaces as Building Blocks</p><p>Human social fabric is built out of layers of interacting and layered “engagement spaces” – essentially social contracts with defined rules. We need infrastructure that makes it easy to create, use, and compose these spaces. The current web may have “solved for” decentralization of publishing - anyone can create a website or blog without permission. But the places where people actually interact and engage with each other (social media platforms, forums, collaborative tools, even finance and accounting tools) remain under intermediary controlled web-servers. Our approach requires protocols where neither the data nor the rules of the group interaction are held by intermediaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Agency AND Accountability, Mutually Interwoven</p><p>Individuals need genuine agency through their technology - the ability to participate in multiple spaces, move between them, and take their data with them. But this autonomy must be paired with accountability within the contexts where they participate. This tension between empowerment and responsibility is productive, not problematic.</p><p>Uncapturable/Unenclosable Carriers: The infrastructure itself must be immune to capture - meaning no single entity can gain enough control to dictate rules, extract value, or shut down the system. We’ve seen far too many examples of infrastructure capture” governments shutting down internet services during protests, platform owners changing terms to benefit their shareholders, or cloud providers being pressured to deplatform users. Even when specific engagement spaces have their own defined rules, the underlying “carrier” of those interactions must remain decentralized. This enables autonomous group formation without intermediation - groups can organize however they choose without worrying that their technological foundation can be pulled out from under them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Local State, Global Visibility: Rather than forcing artificial global consensus (like blockchains do), we recognize that state is inherently local but can achieve consistent global visibility if nodes share data.&nbsp; Operating this way eliminates unnecessary coordination bottlenecks while maintaining system coherence.&nbsp;</p> Architectural and Design Consequences <p>The principles stated above have very concrete design and implementation consequences.&nbsp; For those technically familiar with Holochain you already know how they show up in <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts?ref=blog.holochain.org">the design</a>, but here I list some of the key aspects along with pointers to documentation that describe each consequence in more detail.</p>  Start with a capacity to define &amp; create a known “engagement space”.&nbsp; The “rules of a game”.&nbsp; This consists of the hash of a set of data-types &amp; relations and deterministic validation rules for creation of that data. In Holochain we call this the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/?ref=blog.holochain.org#dna">DNA</a>  Allow agents to be the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/?ref=blog.holochain.org#agent-centricity">authoritative source of all data</a>, i.e. agents “make plays” according to the rules of the DNA.&nbsp;  Ensure that when this data is shared, it has intrinsic data integrity, i.e. it’s a cryptographically signed append-only ledger for that source (in Holochain we call this the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Source Chain</a>), and ensure that it is identifiable as being part of an engagement space by having the first entry in the chain being an agent’s signing of the space’s hash.&nbsp; This is also “I consent to play this game”.  Share data to an eventually consistent <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Graphing Distributed Hash Table</a> (DHT), in which other agents validate that all shared data follows the rules of the game.  Ensure that agents <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org#a-cloud-of-witnesses">who don’t follow the rules can be blocked/ignored</a>.&nbsp; This prevents capture.  Allow for<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/?ref=blog.holochain.org"> “bridge” calls between</a> engagement spaces at the agentic locus (i.e. not at the group level) for composability of spaces.&nbsp; This ensures composibility, autonomy, and accountability  <p>There are of course more details in the design, but these are some of the key ones that fall out of the principles.</p> Resonance at the DWeb Seminar <p>What struck me most about the seminar was how much of our framework resonated with challenges other participants were grappling with, even when they approached them from different angles.&nbsp; I would even say that the Seminar itself was fundamentally an example of this thinking.&nbsp; It was a carefully designed set of patterns and processes&nbsp; for a literal engagement space (this time physical instead of digital) whose purpose was to increase the social coherence of players in the p2p domain.&nbsp; These patterns not only included the processes of the input-talks, the unconference sessions, and commitment to production of a collaborative write-up, but also the relational parts of cooking together and sharing non-work time together.&nbsp; All of this together created desirable social coherence. &nbsp; And it’s this pattern that we are all trying to create powerful affordances for in the digital world.</p><p>Some further examples: During the unconference sessions, conversations kept circling back to fundamental questions about coordination, autonomy, and accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>When we discussed "UI Patterns for Peer-to-peer," I saw it as asking: how do we make decentralized engagement spaces feel natural and empowering to users? When we debated collaborative data model requirements, I saw it as exploring: how do we maintain coherence across distributed participants without sacrificing agency?</p><p>When Rae McKelvey shared her focus on "purpose-built apps" that solve real social problems to me that aligned perfectly with the engagement space concept—recognizing that different contexts require different rules and structures.&nbsp;</p><p>At the technical level David Thompson's work on object capabilities and Duke Dorje’s work on recryption and identity both live into the same autonomy-with-accountability tension we see as central to social coherence.&nbsp; The ever-present discussions about how best to implement CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types, of which Holochain’s DHT is an example) revealed the shared underlying assumption: that meaningful coordination really is possible without central control, that local autonomy and global coherence can coexist, and most profoundly that the infrastructure we build shapes the social possibilities it enables.</p><p>But if everything resonated so well, what’s the big deal?</p> Why This Matters for the Decentralized Ecosystem <p>Probably the most common complaint I’ve heard over the years from folks who see the astounding potential of decentralized infrastructure goes something like this:&nbsp; “There are so many different p2p solutions, and teams that seem to be working in isolation, why can’t you just agree on a single solution and work together?”&nbsp; On the surface, this sounds like a reasonable complaint, but the lens of coherence helps understand why “working together” is actually such a hard problem to solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Recalling from the start of this article: what creates coherence are the patterns, practices and organizing principles of a group.&nbsp; Just because groups have the same goals and want the same outcomes, does not mean that they start their patterns, processes and organizing principles are similar and compatible.&nbsp; In fact, almost always, they aren’t.&nbsp; But this relates to why the DWeb Seminar was so important.&nbsp; It successfully operated according to a higher order organization principle that created an engagement space precisely for the purpose of getting at what patterns, practices and organizing principles folks in the broad DWeb community were operating by, and making them visible and .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So to me this was an example of exactly the underlying principles that we’ve been embedding in Holochain’s architecture from the start.</p><p>So, while the decentralized web movement often focuses on technical capabilities – faster consensus, better cryptography, more efficient protocols, we are now seeing the community beginning to seriously see these as means, not ends. The higher level question remains: what kinds of social possibilities can these technologies enable?&nbsp;</p><p>This approach enables us to build towards greater “commons enabling infrastructure” - technology that strengthens shared resources and collective capacity rather than extracting value. The creation of digital, unenclosable fabric of engagement spaces is central to this goal. Instead of platforms that capture value from user interactions, we can build infrastructure that enables communities to create and govern their own spaces, according to their own values.&nbsp;</p><p>When the decentralized ecosystem embraces this approach, many new possibilities emerge:</p>  Interoperability with Purpose: We can more easily build bridges between systems that share compatible social intentions. A climate action network could seamlessly share data and coordinate with a local food co-op using a different protocol, supporting community resilience initiatives that address both environmental and food security challenges, while using mutual-credit currencies backed by the productive capacity of the local farms supplying the co-op.   Governance that Evolves: We can build infrastructure that enables continuous governance innovation rather than trying to solve governance once and for all. A neighborhood mutual aid group could start with simple coordination tools, then gradually evolve more sophisticated decision-making processes as their needs change, without having to migrate to entirely new platforms.   Network Effects that Serve Users: We can create composable ecosystems where network effects benefit participants rather than extracting from them. As more people join a decentralized social network, the benefits – better content discovery, richer discussions, stronger community bonds - flow to the participants themselves rather than to a platform owner’s advertising revenue.&nbsp;   The Path Forward <p>The grand challenge of decentralized software is ensuring it actually delivers on evolvable social coherence. This means building infrastructure that serves the flourishing of people and planet rather than extracting from it.&nbsp;</p><p>At Holochain, we’re committed to this path, not just in our technology choices, but in how we organize ourselves, engage with our community, and collaborate with other projects. The conversations at the DWeb Seminar reinforced that we’re not alone in this commitment.&nbsp;</p><p>The adjacent possibility that Wendy described in her recap isn’t just about new technical capabilities – it’s about new forms of social organization that those capabilities make possible. That’s both a tremendous responsibility and an extraordinary opportunity for all who choose to walk to this path.&nbsp;</p>

 The hidden risks behind vendor relationships 



<p>It starts innocently enough. A supplier begins missing deadlines. A long-trusted partner suddenly resists contract changes. Payments arrive late, documentation lags, and small deviations creep into everyday interactions. These aren’t just operational hiccups—they’re behavioral red flags.</p>



<p>For years, third-party risk management (TPRM) relied on static compliance checklists: audits, certifications, and one-off questionnaires. But today’s risk environment has outpaced that model. Subtle engagement shifts often signal vendor instability—or even fraud—well before a failed audit or regulatory breach brings it to light.The stakes are growing. A single vendor misstep can trigger multimillion-dollar losses, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational fallout. In 2025, the risk that matters most isn’t what the audit catches—it’s what it misses.</p>



 What Is Third-Party Risk Management? 



<p>Third-party risk management (TPRM) is the discipline of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that arise from vendors, suppliers, and business partners. It goes beyond contract compliance to cover financial, cybersecurity, operational, and reputational exposures.</p>



 Why compliance checklists fall short 



<p>Traditional compliance frameworks provide assurance, but they’re backward-looking. By the time an issue surfaces in an audit, the damage may already be done.</p>



 
 Complex risks are growing: According to Liminal’s <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03KQLTT0">Market &amp; Buyer’s Guide for TPRM, </a>33% of organizations cite complexity of risks as the top barrier to effectiveness—outranking resources or legacy systems. 



 Budgets are shifting: The <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/market-buyers-guides/third-party-risk-management/">same research</a> shows that two years ago, 77% of businesses devoted 10% or less of their budgets to TPRM. Today, 84% say funding is sufficient—a 42% improvement. 



 Maturity remains low: Despite rising investment, only 9% of organizations have achieved “advanced” TPRM maturity, underscoring how far the market still has to go. 
 



<p>Static compliance isn’t enough when risk signals emerge daily in behavior, process, and relationships.</p>



 The market is moving fast 



<p>The risk isn’t just theoretical—the <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03KQLTT0">market for third-party risk management</a> is expanding quickly. Liminal’s research shows that while sentiment on budget sufficiency has improved by 42% in two years, only 9% of organizations have achieved advanced maturity.</p>



<p>It’s a sign that boards and executives see TPRM as too important to ignore—but most are still playing catch-up. As <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/legal-compliance/topics/third-party-risk-management-tprm">Gartner notes</a>, organizations that fail to modernize vendor risk programs face increasing exposure across cybersecurity, compliance, and operational resilience.</p>



 



<a href="https://hubs.la/Q03KQLTT0">Market &amp; Buyer’s Guide for Third-Party Risk Management 2025, p.19</a>



 



 From checklists to behavioral red flags 



<p>Behavioral red flags—missed SLAs, contract resistance, data delivery delays, unusual communication shifts—are leading indicators of risk. Unlike static compliance, they reveal real-time vulnerabilities and allow earlier intervention. Behavioral risk monitoring is the practice of tracking deviations in how vendors operate and interact that can signal early signs of instability or misconduct.</p>



<p>The most effective programs are:</p>



 
 Embedding continuous monitoring rather than point-in-time reviews. 



 Integrating behavioral insights into enterprise-wide dashboards. 



 Automating alerts when engagement patterns deviate from norms. 
 



<p>This shift mirrors risk management trends across Data Access Control and AI Data Governance—executives no longer want box-checking. They want predictive visibility into the risks that can derail operations, undermine vendor resilience, and erode supplier trust.</p>



 



<a href="https://hubs.la/Q03KQLTT0">Market &amp; Buyer’s Guide for Third-Party Risk Management 2025, p.18</a>



 



 What executives are demanding now 



<p>For boards and CISOs, vendor risk has become strategic infrastructure: as vital to credibility as financial reporting or data security. The new priorities are clear:</p>



 
 Continuous monitoring: Liminal’s <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/68027eb8e1fe225ee0bd74c7">Regulatory TPRM Link Index</a> shows that 63% of buyers rank this as their top priority. 



 Automation at scale: 42% cite automation of TPRM activities as their top optimization goal. 



 Data quality: <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03KQMKz0">Cybersecurity TPRM buyers</a> emphasize accuracy (89%) and monitoring (85%) as table stakes, guided by emerging frameworks such as<a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework"> NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework</a>. 



 Cross-functional orchestration: <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03KQNHQ0">Operational buyers</a> demand interoperability across compliance, procurement, and security. 
 



<p>These shifts signal the end of siloed vendor risk teams. The winners will be those who connect behavioral risk detection into broader enterprise resilience strategies.</p>



 The executive reality check 



<p>Boards no longer accept “checklist compliance” as proof of safety. Regulators and investors expect real-time assurance. Yet with only 9% of organizations achieving advanced TPRM maturity, most enterprises remain exposed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/supply-chain-reaction-reframes-third-party-risk-01606852935?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhV_CzxHd64z-O33siCnNsfvPmKl4Xf4H3mbmXiLEQOeoaNvKVu1w3eyAYNp_E%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68aca7ef&amp;gaa_sig=0H0ZXD6QjJAqo0nE6PsBkFWEUgkYEZsrh64o7HsmtEYJKbHNO5xS458wsFAE27dOfJgkKcdnmk0ikQu4hc9HcA%3D%3D">Wall Street Journal</a> recently reported on how supply chain disruptions and vendor failures are forcing boards to elevate TPRM to a core resilience strategy—not just a compliance function. It’s a signal that the market is moving fast, and expectations are rising. Regulatory frameworks are evolving in parallel. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">SEC</a> now requires detailed cyber disclosures, the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">EU GDPR</a> continues to impose significant fines, and<a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework"> NIST</a> provides baseline guidance for organizations modernizing their risk programs.</p>



<p>By acting on behavioral red flags, enterprises strengthen resilience and trust. Ignoring them leaves blind spots that regulators and investors won’t overlook.</p>



 Turning behavioral insight into advantage 



<p>Behavioral risk monitoring isn’t just a compliance upgrade. It’s a competitive advantage. By weaving continuous monitoring and behavioral insights into third-party risk management, executives can:</p>



 
 Protect against operational and financial losses. 



 Demonstrate resilience to regulators. 



 Build stronger trust signals with investors, customers, and suppliers.

With Indicio Proven, you get authentication and fraud prevention in a single, affordable, globally interoperable platform.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The new report by Liminal — <a href="https://hs.liminal.co/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cpsS404/VVGZxd2k8DCnW8TW0Jf3d7dsxW3NdgT55CCDYcN4qMxL43qgz0W7lCdLW6lZ3lgW963Hp_84sxYzW2014ZK3rLH93W7BSfzf60MP3PVFTYBX3GZN5dVpnZLJ7dPxH9W1-L-506Zbw9YW6Jh2r81QCVvPW7ZHhRc3w8-JcW5GM7JN5KZ_zdW4DdfBP3CG1s9W8rJxpK4P0jWDVc4Fz92TTRyNW3qK4Ky3ty6TPW29PcQ486yVMqW43J_CS39hwkpW99j5mS6ZHGNWW47KBW44WJ3vnW3CPM1n7k1FJRW8FFw2x2rkH4_W8RrW7f3YxZzbW1g32G_1xv_gQV7Zdlr2QNGdFW5_xHRl6pznKQW1pN5xn9jDxvDf7y2wl804">The Convergence of Authentication and Fraud Prevention</a> — makes for stark reading.</p>
<p>Fraud losses in the U.S. alone are projected to double in just three years to $63.9 billion, with account takeover fraud accounting for half. Seventy-one percent of respondents to their survey of 200 buyers in retail, ecommerce, financial services and tech believe current methods of authentication may be insufficient to thwart generative-AI social engineering attacks. And almost two-thirds worry that additional security layers will add unacceptable friction to customer and user experience.</p>
<p>One could say the problem is that the technology powering fraud is more powerful than the technology powering authentication and fraud prevention. And the latter’s weakness is compounded by authentication and fraud prevention being two separate processes, often managed by multiple different vendors.</p>
<p>The solution is more of everything —&nbsp;more layers of defense, multi-level signals analysis, more authentication factors, and good AI to battle the bad AI. All of which translates into more complexity, friction, and cost. No surprise, Liminal also reports increasing budgets for authentication, account takeover protection, and social engineering scam prevention, and it projects these budgets will continue increasing year-on-year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, customers and consumers — many of whom are digital natives — expect seamless, frictionless interaction and not painful multifactor authentication. As a result, organizations face brutal tradeoffs: cater to digital behavior and increase risk, or decrease risk but make customers pay in friction and risk losing them.</p>
 Fix the fundamental problem<br>
 
<p>There’s a reason the technology powering fraud has the upper hand: The legacy systems organizations rely on — username/password,&nbsp; stored biometrics, centralized databases filled with personal data — are all vulnerabilities easily exploited by brute-force AI attacks, synthetic identity fraud, and deepfakes.</p>
<p>Remove these vulnerabilities and you remove these problems. That’s what decentralized identity does. It removes the need for usernames, passwords, and the centralized storage of personal data needed to manage identity and access.</p>
<p>That’s what Indicio’s customers are doing — sweeping away the digital structures and processes that are the cause of all these problems.</p>
<p>We replace this with Verifiable Credentials. They’re a simple way for each party in a digital interaction — customers, organizations, employees, devices, virtual assistants — to authenticate the other in a way that can’t be phished, hacked, or faked; and we do this authentication before any data is shared.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials reduce fraud by enabling digital credentials to be bound to individuals in a way that is cryptographically tamper-proof, and which can incorporate biometrics that have been authenticated. This closes off attack vectors like phishing, synthetic identities, and — with an authenticated biometric in a Verifiable Credential — deepfakes.</p>
<p>A person with an authenticated biometric in a Verifiable Credential has a portable digital proof of themselves that can be instantly corroborated against a liveness check.</p>
<p>A decentralized identity architecture changes everything. It integrates authentication and fraud prevention, creates unified digital identities, and enables data to be fully portable, trusted and acted on immediately — without friction to businesses or customers.</p>
<p>Just as important, it’s significantly less expensive than legacy or alternative solutions; it can be layered into existing systems, meaning that it’s a solution that, depending on the scope, can be implemented in days or weeks.</p>
 Don’t take our word, see what our customers are doing 
<p>Indicio and its customers — enterprises, financial services,&nbsp; governments — have had enough of the same old same old. We and they are using Verifiable Credentials to cross borders, onboard customers, and authenticate account access — all seamlessly with the highest level of digital identity assurance.</p>
<p>It might be hard to believe that a solution could be that simple — that you can just remove the core vulnerabilities fueling the surge in identity-related fraud and not have to rip and replace your entire authentication infrastructure.</p>

 We sat down with Carlo Maragliano from digital platform Finologee to explore how financial institutions are getting ready for the evolving regulatory landscape and how they use technology to accelerate their go-to-market while staying audit-ready and resilient.&nbsp; 



 



<p>As new regulations such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/idnow-becomes-first-to-achieve-etsi/">eIDAS 2.0</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/future-of-amlr-identification-2027/">AMLR</a> and DORA reshape the compliance landscape across Europe, financial institutions are under pressure to future-proof their onboarding and KYC processes.</p>



<p>Luxembourg-based Finologee, a leading digital platform operator for the financial industry, is helping banks and payment institutions meet regulatory challenges through its KYC Manager, an orchestration layer that combines flexibility with embedded regulatory readiness. By integrating IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification technology</a>, Finologee enables its clients to accelerate go-to-market, simplify compliance and tailor onboarding journeys across regions. With Carlo Maragliano, Head of Delivery and Customer Success at Finologee, we discussed how technology, automation and orchestration are transforming digital identity at scale.</p>



 Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape 



 Regulations such as eIDAS 2.0, AMLD6 and DORA are coming into force soon. How are the changes brought about by these regulations influencing you and your banking clients’ KYC and digital onboarding priorities? 



<p>Heightened regulatory complexity is pushing banks to adopt more modular and future-proof KYC solutions. These upcoming regulations are significantly reshaping compliance priorities for financial institutions. For example, eIDAS 2.0 introduces Qualified Electronic Identity (QeID), which makes interoperability and eID support essential. AMLD6 expands criminal liability and due diligence obligations, which increases the need for granular audit trails and automated, risk-based workflows. And with DORA, operational resilience becomes a key focus, requiring stronger vendor oversight, digital continuity and secure third-party integrations. Finologee’s orchestration layer, combined with IDnow’s embedded identity verification, equips institutions to meet these regulatory shifts without having to re-engineer their core systems.&nbsp;</p>



 



 



 
 
 IDnow’s Automated Identity Verification&nbsp; 



<p>IDnow provides a fully automated identity verification solution that integrates seamlessly with Finologee’s KYC Manager. It supports document authentication from more than 215 international issuing authorities, uses AI-driven checks and biometric liveness detection and helps banks and other regulated industries to reduce onboarding times while ensuring full regulatory compliance. This technology enables companies to verify the identities of their users seamlessly and securely.</p>
 



 

 
 



 



 



 Ensuring adaptability in a dynamic regulatory environment 



 How do you ensure that your solutions remain adaptable as regulations and customer expectations continue to evolve? 



<p>We’ve built everything on an API-first modular architecture that enables quick adaptation to regulatory shifts. On top of that, Finologee continuously engages with clients to align roadmap priorities with industry changes. The platform is also fully customisable and configurable, so institutions can tailor onboarding flows, verification steps and compliance logic to specific regulatory requirements, customer segments and regional markets without extensive development effort.</p>



 



 



<p>Did you know? <a href="https://blog.finexer.com/reduce-customer-onboarding-time/">Over 55% of consumers are more likely</a> to apply for services if the onboarding process is entirely digital, including online identity verification.</p>



 



 



 The role of automation in scaling operations 



 What role does automation play in helping banks scale their operations without sacrificing security or compliance? 



<p>Automation is really important for all businesses. It reduces dependency on manual reviews, thus lowering both cost and error rates. Automated decisioning also helps apply consistent compliance logic. With real-time workflows, customers can be onboarded faster without sacrificing auditability, while compliance teams gain transparency and control through dashboards and exception handling flows.&nbsp;</p>



 What challenges do financial institutions face when trying to scale their compliance and onboarding processes across multiple markets and how does KYC Manager help overcome these hurdles? 



<p>Scaling across markets brings several hurdles. Institutions face varying regulatory requirements across countries, different acceptable ID document types and verification standards, and operational silos that slow down onboarding harmonisation. With KYC Manager, we address these challenges through a centralised orchestration layer with localised compliance modules, document coverage across 157 countries enabled by IDnow and a flexible flow builder that allows journeys to be adapted by region or customer type.</p>



 



 



 Did you know? <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/five-actions-to-build-next-generation-know-your-customer-capabilities?">Banks that increased end-to-end KYC-process automation by 20% </a>saw a triple benefit effect : increased quality-assurance scores by 13%;  improved customer experience by reducing the number of customer outreaches per case by 18% and enhanced productivity by increasing the number of cases processed per month by 48%. 



 



 



 In what ways does the integration between Finologee’s KYC Manager and IDnow’s automated identity verification technology enable faster go-to-market for banks and other financial institutions? Can you share a concrete example? 



<p>Because identity verification is pre-integrated, deployment timelines are shortened considerably. This means clients such as banks or other financial institutions can launch new services or expand to new markets faster thanks to embedded regulatory readiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A concrete example: the IDnow verification flow is especially useful when identifying ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) and persons with significant control (PSCs), so people who ultimately own or control their company and are legally required to identify during onboarding. If the person responsible for their dossier doesn’t have their IDs, they can trigger an SMS to the phone number of the UBO or PSC to complete the verification directly.&nbsp;</p>



 Scaling across markets and customization 



 How do you support financial institutions in customizing onboarding journeys for different regions or customer segments? 



<p>The Finologee KYC platform enables journey segmentation by geography, product line or a risk profile. For instance, workflow logic can automatically route high-risk users to manual review or enhanced due diligence paths.</p>



 Looking ahead, what trends do you anticipate will most impact the way banks approach digital identity and compliance at scale? 



<p>We see AI and biometrics becoming standard components of fraud prevention. There will also be greater emphasis on accessibility, inclusivity and cross-device onboarding. And more broadly, banks and other financial institutions will be looking to reduce fragmentation through orchestration platforms.</p>



 On a personal level, what excites you most about working at the intersection of technology, compliance and financial services? Is there a particular moment or project that made you feel especially proud of the impact you’re making? 



<p>For me, it’s seeing how all the pieces come together in practice. One moment that really stood out was supporting a client launch in Luxembourg under tight regulatory deadlines they needed to comply with. It was a great example of how the platform can unlock speed, compliance, and user experience all at once – we successfully implemented KYC Manager within just three months, enabling a fully digital account opening process with no paper or printing requirements. On average, our clients see the submission process reduced to under 10 minutes and conversion rates doubled compared to traditional KYC remediation processes, while substantially lowering human error and workload.</p>

  <p>Initially designed to handle the Aster family’s ammunition (A30 B1 and A30 B1NT), for which Thales provides the seeker, a key element in missile guidance, each Danish section of the SAMP/T NG will rely on Thales's Ground Fire radar, as well as on the Command and Control (Engagement Module New Generation), for which Thales is the design authority, and which is produced by Thales in cooperation with MBDA.</p><p>Based on fully digital active electronically scanned antennas (AESA) technology, the Ground Fire radar offers a high level of performance to detect, track and classify numerous targets, including in the most complex environments such as mountainous regions and high-traffic airspace. This radar offers a refresh rate of only 1 second and a surveillance capacity up to 400 km, with panoramic coverage at 360° and 90° elevation. It is capable of detecting drones, as well as ballistic missiles, taking advantage of the mobility of a tactical radar.</p><p>The open architecture of the SAMP/T NG system, designed by Thales, facilitates its integration and interoperability with other European systems, thus enhancing the air defence capabilities of the continent. The Ground Fire ensures strategic autonomy, with high operational readiness. Its design allows a high level of mobility, with reduced installation and dismantling times and compact dimensions equivalent to those of an ISO transport container.</p><p>The Ground Fire maximizes the performance of the new generation ASTER 30 and positions France among the leaders in air defence and medium-range antimissile defence.</p><p>The SAMP/T NG programme is overseen by the Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement (OCCAR). Eurosam, a joint-venture between Thales and MBDA, is the lead contractor for the entire system.</p><blockquote>“Thales is honoured by the choice made by the Danish authorities. With Eurosam and MBDA, we sincerely thank our client for their trust. The Danish armed forces will benefit from a state-of-the-art system to guarantee the protection of their airspace and contribute to the defence of European countries and NATO.” said Hervé Dammann, Executive Vice-President, Land and Air Systems, Thales. </blockquote><p>Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies for the Defence, Aerospace, and Cyber &amp; Digital sectors. Its portfolio of innovative products and services addresses several major challenges: sovereignty, security, sustainability and inclusion.</p><p>The Group invests more than €4 billion per year in Research &amp; Development in key areas, particularly for critical environments, such as Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, quantum and cloud technologies. Thales has more than 83,000 employees in 68 countries. In 2024, the Group generated sales of €20.6 billion.</p><p> </p>

<p>(If you can’t have fun when writing, what’s the point?)</p>



<p>I’m sure you all want to know what on earth THAT conversation was about. It started with the desire to assign vanity titles to friends. One friend was assigned “Intrepid bass-playing sailor cyber warrior” (though that one is possibly still a work in progress). So, of course, I had to ask what my title would be.</p>



<p>She thought something pirate-based. I thought maybe mob boss was more appropriate. But, no: “Nah, you don’t rule through fear. You set rules, and then people come to learn that obeying the rules brings progress while disobeying the rules brings a walk down the plank. Very impersonal, no bloodshed, just terminal disapproval.” Which I read not so much as Pirate as Librarian, and in either case, reminds both of us of what the standards development process is like.</p>



<p>In a way, this builds on a post I wrote a few weeks ago about needing all kinds of people and skills to develop good standards.</p>

 Librarians and pirates: unlikely comparisons 



<p>On the surface, librarians and pirates couldn’t be more different. One rules a quiet, organized room full of catalogues and classification systems. The other shouts orders across a storm-tossed deck, treasure map in hand.</p>



<p>But scratch at the stereotypes, and the similarities pop up:</p>



 
 Both guard treasure — knowledge or gold. 



 Both rely on codes that aren’t strictly laws, but that everyone learns to respect. 



 Both lead crews (or patrons) who don’t always agree but who need to move in the same direction. 



 And both know that without discipline, the whole ship — or library — quickly sinks. 
 



<p>Standards development, in its own way, needs a bit of both. Librarians bring order, taxonomies, metadata, and interoperability. Pirates bring the consequences: if you won’t play along with the standard, good luck finding allies or charting your course without a map.</p>



 Leadership characteristics 



<p>So what’s actually useful, whether you’re wrangling sailors, cataloguing a collection, or chairing a standards meeting?</p>



 
 Ability to engage people so they pay attention. Whether it’s a weary deckhand, a confused student, or a standards group at the two-hour mark, keeping attention is half the battle. 



 Ability to raise one eyebrow sternly. Every ship, library, or working group needs That Person. The person who has one eyebrow that says: “Are you sure you want to keep going down that path?” Sometimes it’s more effective than three paragraphs of meeting minutes. 



 Ability to lead people to their own conclusions. Neither pirate captains nor librarians hand you the final answer. The captain points at the map and lets you realize the treasure’s yours to dig up. The librarian nudges you toward the right catalogue entry. In standards, this is the art of facilitation — nudging until consensus emerges. 
 



 What doesn’t work 



 
 Leading purely through fear. Fear doesn’t build commitment — it drives people away. Pirates who rule by terror end up facing mutiny, and librarians who inspire only dread will find books mysteriously mis-shelved out of spite (I hate it when that happens). In standards, disengagement is fatal: if people only show up to avoid backlash, the work stalls and the draft sinks. 



 Letting others set the tone of fear. A crew ruled by grudges goes nowhere, and a library ruled by petty turf wars becomes unusable. The same is true in standards: if flame wars and side agendas become scarier than the actual process, people stop showing up; without participation, no standard survives. 
 



 Romance, intrigue, and life 



<p>Obviously, this is a very romanticized version of a pirate (and of a librarian, for that matter). Real librarians don’t spend their time swashbuckling, and real pirates were often violent criminals (also without the swashbuckling). But when I’m not writing, editing, researching, or running meetings, I’m reading trashy romance novels. Romanticized life in my spare time is my idea of entertainment.</p>



<p>And maybe that’s the point: we bring our own metaphors and stories to how we think about leadership and collaboration. Whether you fancy yourself the stern-eyebrowed librarian or the captain with a plank, the truth is that standards need both. Someone to keep the ship steady, someone to keep the records straight, and all of us learning when to raise an eyebrow at just the right time.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this post made you smile. And if it didn’t, I have a Very Stern Look at the ready for you.</p>

 Transcript 



 Introduction 



<p>00:00:31 Hello and welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest.</p>



<p>00:00:35 Today’s episode comes from a dare. And honestly, if you know me, you’ll understand that’s a very dangerous way to start anything.</p>



<p>The dare was simple: write a post about what librarians and pirate captains have in common and why that matters to standards.</p>



<p>How could I say no to that?</p>



<p>00:00:52 Because let’s be honest—if you can’t have fun with your writing, what’s the point?</p>



 



 Pirates and Librarians: Not So Different 



<p>00:00:57 At first glance, pirates and librarians couldn’t be more different.</p>



 
 Pirates live on the high seas, sword in hand, shouting orders across storm-tossed decks. 



 Librarians work in hushed halls, surrounded by catalogs and metadata, raising an eyebrow when needed. 
 



<p>And yet, if you look closely, there’s surprising overlap.</p>



<p>00:01:25 This all started with a conversation about vanity titles—those fun, unofficial roles we give each other.</p>



 
 A friend was dubbed the Intrepid Bass-Playing Cyber Sailor Warrior. 



 Mine was harder: pirate? mob boss? librarian? 
 



<p>00:02:06 The final suggestion landed: I don’t rule through fear—I set rules. And when followed, they bring progress. Ignore them, and… well, it’s a walk down the plank.</p>



<p>That sounded far less like a pirate and far more like a librarian—which is fitting, since I have a degree in library science.</p>



 



 Shared Treasures and Shared Codes 



<p>00:02:24 So, what do pirates and librarians actually do?</p>



 
 Pirates guard treasure: gold, jewels, captured loot. 



 Librarians guard knowledge: books, archives, collections, and digital resources. 
 



<p>00:02:42 Both operate according to a code.</p>



 
 Pirates had their Pirate Code—rules about dividing loot, settling disputes, and running the ship. 



 Librarians have cataloging standards, metadata schemas, and classification systems. 
 



<p>00:03:08 Neither set of rules carries the weight of law, but ignoring them leads to chaos.</p>



<p>00:03:19 And both depend on their crews. Pirates don’t sail alone; librarians don’t run libraries without staff, volunteers, and community support.</p>



<p>This is the essence of standards development:</p>



 
 Gathering crews 



 Establishing codes 



 Protecting shared treasure (protocols, specifications, best practices) 
 



<p>Ignore the structure, and everything sinks fast.</p>



 



 The Keys to Leadership 



<p>00:03:39 So, what makes leadership work—whether on a ship, in a library, or in a standards group?</p>



<p>00:03:53 First: the ability to engage people.</p>



 
 Pirates had to keep their crews motivated. 



 Librarians help people navigate information overload. 



 Standards leaders cut through noise and keep focus. 
 



<p>00:04:02 Second: the power of the raised eyebrow.<br>Every community has that one look that says: “Are you sure you want to go down that path?” Subtle signals can be powerful leadership tools.</p>



<p>00:04:22 Third: leading people to their own conclusions.</p>



 
 Pirates pointed to treasure maps. 



 Librarians point to catalogs and shelves. 



 Standards leaders facilitate consensus rather than forcing agreement. 
 



 



 What Doesn’t Work 



<p>00:04:41 Now, let’s talk about what doesn’t work.</p>



 
 Leading through fear. Fear breeds disengagement.
 
 Pirates who ruled by terror faced mutiny. 



 Librarians who ruled by dread found books deliberately mis-shelved. 



 In standards, disengagement kills progress. 
 
 



 Letting others set the tone of fear.
 
 If grudges rule the ship, it goes nowhere. 



 If turf wars rule a library, the whole community suffers. 



 If flame wars dominate standards groups, the work halts. 
 
 
 



<p>Leaders must set the tone. If fear takes over, participation drops—and without participation, nothing survives.</p>



 



 Romanticizing the Metaphor 



<p>00:05:43 If you’ve stayed with me this long, you’re probably either giggling or dismayed.</p>



<p>Yes, this is a romanticized version of pirates and librarians.</p>



 
 Real pirates were often violent criminals. 



 Real librarians are not criminals—and do far more than raise their eyebrows. 
 



<p>00:06:13 But that’s exactly what makes the metaphor fun. We all bring our own stories into how we think about leadership and collaboration.</p>



 



 The Balance We Need 



<p>00:06:24 Whether you see yourself as a pirate captain, a librarian, or something in between, the truth is: standards need both.</p>



 
 Someone to keep the ship steady. 



 Someone to keep the record straight. 



 And all of us knowing when to raise that well-timed eyebrow. 
 



<p>00:06:41 This episode was short—part reflection, part fun—but with a reminder: standards are made by people. People with quirks, with stories, and sometimes with pirate hats or card catalogs.</p>

Its seamless design makes it easy to switch between game guides and other resources, ensuring you can quickly master any game and get straight to the fun.</p>



 How to Choose the Best Board Game 



<p>Player Count &amp; Age Range</p>



<p>Think about who you’re playing with. Some games are designed for two, while others need a larger group. Check the recommended age to ensure it’s a good fit for everyone.</p>



<p>Game Length &amp; Complexity</p>



<p>Consider how much time you have and how much effort you want to put in. Choose a light, fast-paced game for a quick session or a complex, long-form strategy game for an all-day event.</p>









<p>Genre &amp; Theme</p>



<p>What kind of experience are you looking for? Pick a genre that appeals to your group, whether it’s cooperative, competitive, party-style, or a deep, story-driven adventure.</p>



 Tips for an Enjoyable Board Game Experience 



<p>Here are some tips to help you and your group have the best board game night possible.</p>



<p>Understand the Rules Before You Start</p>



<p>Nothing slows down a game more than trying to learn the rules as you go. Before game night, have one person read the rulebook and watch a video tutorial. They can then teach others, making the setup much smoother.</p>



<p>Create the Right Atmosphere</p>



<p>Set the mood for your game. If it’s a long, strategic game, make sure everyone has comfortable seating and good lighting. For a party game, put on some background music and have snacks and drinks ready.</p>









<p>Manage Expectations</p>



<p>Be upfront with your group about what kind of game you’re playing. If it’s a competitive game, remind everyone to keep it friendly. If it’s a long one, let people know how long it might take so they can plan accordingly.</p>



<p>Put Away Distractions</p>



<p>Encourage everyone to put their phones away. This helps players stay focused on the game, makes for better conversation, and ensures everyone is engaged in the experience.</p>



 Where to Buy or Play These Board Games Online 



<p>You have a couple of great options for getting your hands on these games, whether you prefer the physical version or want to play digitally.</p>



 Where to Buy Physical Board Games 



<p>Specialty Board Game Stores</p>



<p>For the best selection and expert advice, visit local or online hobby stores. These shops often have knowledgeable staff and a curated collection of both classic and new games.</p>



<p>Large Online Retailers</p>



<p>Major online marketplaces like Amazon offer a <a href="https://blog.herond.org/nfts-for-gamers-a-game-changer/">huge variety of games</a>, often with competitive prices and fast shipping. Just be sure to check the seller’s reviews to ensure you’re getting a genuine product.</p>









 Where to Play Board Games Online 



<p>Board Game Arena</p>



<p>This is one of the most popular platforms for playing a wide range of board games in your browser. It’s user-friendly, automates the rules for you, and offers a large community for real-time and turn-based play.</p>



<p>Tabletop Simulator</p>



<p>If you prefer a more realistic, sandbox-style experience, this is a great choice. Available on Steam, it’s a digital physics sandbox where you can move pieces and interact with games just like you would on a real table.</p>



<p>Dedicated Game Apps</p>



<p>Many popular board games, like Catan or Wingspan, have their own official digital apps available on platforms like Steam, iOS, or Android. These apps often feature polished graphics and a streamlined interface.</p>

<p>If you love travelling, you know the value of unlimited possibilities. That’s why you’re going to want to travel with <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo app</a>.</p>



<p>MySudo is the original all-in-one privacy app that lets you protect your identity and your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">information</a> with <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-get-9-second-phone-numbers-on-one-device/">second phone numbers</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/4-ways-mysudo-email-is-better-than-masked-email/">secure email</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browsers</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual cards</a> – all wrapped into secure digital profiles called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>.</p>



<p>Every MySudo feature is handy for international travel, but it’s using the phone numbers for free international calls that will really save you money while you’re away.</p>



<p>But even if you’re not about to hop on a plane, MySudo is still your go-to for free international calls to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">family and friends</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s how to use MySudo for free international calls whether you’re travelling overseas or calling loved ones from home:</p>



 Overseas traveller 



<p>If you’re travelling overseas, MySudo gives you free international calling in a choice of regions and area codes. That means no fees and no need for an international roaming plan. Here’s how to set it up:</p>



 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/#mysudo-dl">Download MySudo</a> for iOS or Android. 



 Choose <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">Sudo Max</a> plan for unlimited minutes and messages for up to 9 separate Sudo phone numbers. (Read: <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-do-i-get-with-the-sudomax-plan/">What do I get with SudoMax?</a>) 



 Choose a phone number and area code in the region you want to travel. MySudo numbers are currently available in the US, UK*, and Canada. 



 Call and message anyone for free within the region under your SudoMax plan. 



 Give your Sudo number to locals and they can call you as if it’s a local call (and you can avoid high inbound charges). 
 



<p></p>



<p>So long as you’ve got access to hotel or public wi-fi you can use MySudo for free calls. If you think you’ll be out of WiFi range sometimes, you can get an e-sim or international data roaming plan to use local data and MySudo will also work with those.</p>



 Calling loved ones from home 



<p>MySudo lets you call anyone anywhere in the world for free so long as the person you’re calling is using <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>. Calls between users are <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>, so you can talk privately and securely. Here’s how to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">Invite your friends to MySudo</a>:</p>



 
 Tap the menu in the top left corner. 



 Tap Invite your friends. 



 Choose to invite your friends from your device via another app or from your MySudo account.&nbsp; 



 Select the Sudo you want to invite from (if you have more than one Sudo). 



 Follow the prompts. 
 



<p></p>



<p>After you’ve invited a friend, they will receive a link with your MySudo contact information (email, handle and phone number if you have one), which will prompt them to install MySudo. Once they have the app installed, they can instantly start communicating with you. Remember, all video and voice calls, texts and email between MySudo users are&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more …</p>



 7 more facts about MySudo phone numbers 



 
 MySudo numbers are real, unique, working phone numbers. 



 Each phone number has customizable voicemail, ringtones, and contacts list. You can also mute notifications and block unwanted callers. 



 MySudo numbers are fully functional for messaging, and voice, video and group calling.&nbsp; 



 Calls and messages with other MySudo users are&nbsp;end-to-end encrypted. Calls and messages out of network are standard. 



 MySudo phone numbers don’t expire. Your phone numbers will auto-renew so long as you maintain your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">paid plan</a>. 



 Calling with MySudo works like WhatsApp or Signal, but with the privacy advantage that you’re not handing over your real number to sign up. 



 You can manage multiple numbers all in one app (read: <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-get-9-second-phone-numbers-on-one-device/">How to Get 9 “Second Phone Numbers” on One Device</a>). Under <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020179513-What-do-I-get-with-my-SudoGo-paid-subscription-">SudoGo</a>&nbsp;plan, you get 1 included phone number; under&nbsp;<a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019979314-What-do-I-get-with-my-SudoPro-paid-subscription-">SudoPro</a>&nbsp;plan, you get 3 included phone numbers; and under&nbsp;<a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019979294-What-do-I-get-with-my-SudoMax-paid-subscription-">SudoMax</a>&nbsp;plan, you get 9 included phone numbers. If you need additional phone number resets, you can purchase them within the app for a small fee.&nbsp;You can always check your plans screen to see how many phone numbers you have remaining before you’ll be prompted to purchase one. 
 



<p></p>



<p>So, to recap how to use MySudo for free international calls:</p>



 
 To make free calls while travelling overseas, choose a Sudo number and area code in your region of travel and get unlimited minutes and messages under <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">SudoMax</a> plan. Available regions are the United States, United Kingdom*, and Canada. 



 To make free, end-to-end encrypted calls anywhere in the world, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">invite your friends to the app</a>. 



 To call or message regular numbers abroad, use a Sudo number in their region, but sign up to <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">SudoMax</a> so there’s no limit on minutes or messages.

  <p>As AI agents and AI threats proliferate at an unprecedented rate, it becomes imperative to enable them to communicate safely with the backend systems that matter the most.</p>

<p>A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server acts as the bridge between an LLM and an external system. It translates natural language intent into structured API calls, enabling agents to perform tasks like provisioning users, managing groups, or pulling reports, all while respecting the system’s security model.  Establishing a universal protocol eliminates the need to build custom integrations. Enterprises can now easily connect their AI agents with Okta’s backend systems to achieve automation of complex chains of activities, quick resolution of issues, and increased performance throughput.</p>

 What the Okta MCP Server brings 

<p>The Okta MCP Server brings this capability to your identity and access management workflows. It connects directly to Okta’s Admin Management APIs, giving your LLM agents the ability to safely automate organization management.</p>

<p>Think of it as unlocking a new interface for Okta, one where you can ask an agent:</p>

 
   “Add this new employee to the engineering group.” 
   “Generate a report of inactive users in the last 90 days.” 
   “Deactivate all users who tried to log in within the last 30 minutes.” 
 

 Tools and capabilities 

<p>In its current form, the server allows the following actions:</p>

 
   User Management: Create, list, retrieve, update, and deactivate users. 
   Group Management: Create, list, retrieve, update, and delete groups. 
   Group Operations: View assigned members, view assigned applications, add, and remove users. 
   System Information: Retrieve Okta system logs. 
 

<p>And many more actions with application and policies APIs as well.</p>

<p>Using the above operations as a base, complex real-life actions can also be performed. For example, you can ask the MCP server to generate a security audit report for the last 30 days and highlight all changes to user and group memberships according to your desired report template.</p>

 Highlights at a glance 

 
   Flexible Authentication: The server supports both interactive login (via Device Authorization Grant) and fully automated, browserless login (via Private Key JWT). Whether you’re experimenting in development or running a headless agent in production, you can authenticate in the way that fits your workflow. 
   More Secure Credential Handling: Your authentication details are managed through scoped API access and environment variables, keeping secrets out of code. Tokens are issued only with the permissions you explicitly grant, following least-privilege best practices. 
   Seamless Integration with Okta APIs: Built on Okta’s official SDK, the server is tightly integrated with Okta’s Admin Management APIs. That means reliable performance, support for a wide range of identity management tasks, and an extensible foundation for adding more endpoints over time. 
 

 Getting started with the Okta MCP Server 

<p>Now that you know what the Okta MCP server is and why it’s useful, let’s dive into how to set it up and run it. Before you proceed, you will need VS Code, Python environment (Python 3.9 or above), and uv.</p>

 Initializing the project 

<p>The Okta MCP server comes packaged for quick setup so you can clone and run it. We use <code>uv</code> (a fast Python package manager) to help ensure your environment is reproducible and lightweight.</p>

 
   
    <p>Install <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/">uv</a></p>
   
   Clone the repository:
       <code>git clone https://github.com/okta/okta-mcp-server.git
</code>       
   
   Install dependencies and set up the project:
       <code>cd okta-mcp-server &amp;&amp; uv sync
</code>       
   
 

<p>At this point, you have a working copy of the server. Next, we’ll connect it to your Okta org.</p>

 Authentication and authorization 

<p>Every MCP server needs a way to prove its identity and access your Okta APIs more securely. We support two authentication modes, and your choice depends on your use case.</p>

 Option A: Device authorization grant (recommended for interactive use) 

<p>This flow is best if you’re running the MCP server locally and want a quick, user-friendly login. After you start the server, it triggers a prompt to log in via your browser. Here, the server exchanges your browser login for a secure token that it can use to communicate with Okta APIs.</p>

<p>Use this if you’re experimenting, developing, or want the simplest way to authenticate.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Native Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Redirect URI: <code>com.oktapreview.java-oie-sdk:/callback</code> 
       Post Logout Redirect URI: <code>http://com.oktapreview.java-oie-sdk/</code> 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Native App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

   <code>Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Note: While creating the app integration, make sure to select the Device Authorization in the Grant type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the app is created, follow these steps:</p>

 
   
    <p>Grant API scopes (for example: <code>okta.users.read</code>, <code>okta.groups.manage</code>).</p>

    <p>
<br></p>
   
   
    <p>Copy the Client ID for later use.</p>

    <p></p>
   
 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Why “Native App” and not “Service”?<br>
Device Auth is designed for user-driven flows, so it assumes someone is present to open the browser.</p>
</blockquote>

 Option B: Private key JWT (best for automation, CI/CD, and “headless” environments) 

<p>This flow is perfect if your MCP server needs to run without human intervention, for example, inside a CI/CD pipeline or as part of a backend service. Instead of prompting a person to log in, the server authenticates using a cryptographic key pair.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

 
   You generate or upload a public/private key pair to Okta. 
   The server uses the private key locally to sign authentication requests. 
   Okta validates the signature against the public key you registered, ensuring that only your authorized server can act on behalf of that client. 
 

<p>Use this if you’re automating, scheduling jobs, or integrating into infrastructure.</p>

 
   
    <p>In your Okta org, create a new API Services App Integration.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>
<br></p>
   
   
    <p>Under Client Authentication, select Public Key / Private Key.</p>

    <p>
<br></p>
   
   
    <p>Add a public key: either generate it in Okta (recommended) and copy it in PEM format, or upload your own keys.</p>

    <p>
<br></p>
   
   
    <p>Copy the Client ID and Key ID (KID).</p>

    <p>
<br></p>
   
   
    <p>Grant the necessary API scopes (e.g., <code>okta.users.read</code>, <code>okta.groups.manage</code>) and provide Super Administrator access.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p></p>
   
 

 Configuring your client 

<p>You can use Okta’s MCP server with any MCP-compatible client. Whether running a lightweight desktop agent, experimenting in a local environment, or wiring it into a production workflow, the setup pattern is the same.</p>

<p>For this guide, we’ll walk through the setup in Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot - one of the most popular environments for developers. The steps will be similar if you use another client like Claude Desktop or AWS Bedrock.</p>

 Using the Okta MCP Server with VS Code 

 Enable agent mode in GitHub Copilot 

<p>The Okta MCP server integrates with VS Code through Copilot’s agent mode.</p>

 
   
    <p>Install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot">GitHub Copilot extension</a> Open the Copilot Chat view in VS Code.</p>
   
   
    <p>To enable the Agent mode, checkout the steps mentioned in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_enable-agent-mode-in-vs-code"> VS Code docs</a>.</p>
   
 

 Update your VS Code settings 

<p>Next, you’ll tell VS Code how to start and communicate with the Okta MCP server. This is done in your <code>settings.json</code>. You can also create your own <code>mcp.json</code> and set this up.</p>

   <code>{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "description": "Okta Organization URL (e.g., https://trial-123456.okta.com)",
        "id": "OKTA_ORG_URL"
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "description": "Okta Client ID",
        "id": "OKTA_CLIENT_ID",
        "password": true
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "description": "Okta Scopes (separated by whitespace, e.g., 'okta.users.read okta.groups.manage')",
        "id": "OKTA_SCOPES"
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "description": "Okta Private Key. Required for 'browserless' auth.",
        "id": "OKTA_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "password": true
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "description": "Okta Key ID (KID) for the private key. Required for 'browserless' auth.",
        "id": "OKTA_KEY_ID",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "okta-mcp-server": {
        "command": "uv",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--directory",
          "/path/to/the/okta-mcp-server",
          "okta-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "OKTA_ORG_URL": "${input:OKTA_ORG_URL}",
          "OKTA_CLIENT_ID": "${input:OKTA_CLIENT_ID}",
          "OKTA_SCOPES": "${input:OKTA_SCOPES}",
          "OKTA_PRIVATE_KEY": "${input:OKTA_PRIVATE_KEY}",
          "OKTA_KEY_ID": "${input:OKTA_KEY_ID}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Running the server for the first time prompts you to enter the following information:</p>

 
   Okta Organization URL: Your Okta tenant URL. 
   Okta Client ID: The client ID of the application you created in your Okta organization. 
   Okta Scopes: The scopes you want to grant to the application, separated by spaces. For example:
       <code>  "OKTA_SCOPES": "${input:OKTA_SCOPES = okta.users.read okta.users.manage okta.groups.read okta.groups.manage okta.logs.read okta.policies.read okta.policies.manage okta.apps.read okta.apps.manage}"
</code>       
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: Add scopes only for the APIs that you will be using.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Okta Private Key and Key ID: You only need to enter this key when using browserless authentication. If you’re not using that method, just press Enter to skip this step and use the Device Authorization flow instead. 
 

 Start the server 

<p>When you open VS Code, you’ll now see okta-mcp-server as an option to start.</p>

 
   
    <p>Click Start to launch the server in your <code>mcp.json</code> file.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   The server will check your authentication method:
     
       
        <p>If using Device Authorization, it triggers a prompt to log in via your browser.</p>

        <p></p>
       
       
        <p>If using Private Key JWT, it will authenticate silently using your key.</p>
       
     
   
   Once connected, Copilot will automatically recognize the Okta commands you can use. 
 

<p>At this point, the MCP server has established a connection between VS Code and your Okta organization.You can now manage your organization using natural language commands directly in your editor.</p>

<p>Facial recognition is no longer just a sci-fi plot twist. It is now a part of daily life, from unlocking smartphones to airport security checks. A face recognition system uses advanced algorithms to scan, analyze, and verify identities in seconds. Businesses, schools, and governments are rapidly adopting it, but it’s worth digging deeper into how it works, its benefits, and what challenges still exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Facial Recognition System 
<p>At its core, a facial recognition system relies on biometric technology. It captures a person’s facial features, converts them into a digital template, and compares that data with stored profiles to confirm identity. Unlike fingerprints or ID cards, you don’t need to touch anything. Just look at the camera, and the system does the rest.</p>
<p>This technology uses complex neural networks trained on thousands of images. The system maps out key points like the distance between eyes, nose shape, and jawline. The result is a unique faceprint that is nearly impossible to duplicate. Accuracy levels are improving quickly thanks to evaluations like the<a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt/"> NIST Face Recognition Vendor Test</a>, which tracks the performance of leading algorithms worldwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Face Recognition Technology Works 
<p>Understanding the process makes it clear why it is so widely trusted. Here’s a simple breakdown:</p>
 
 Image Capture – A camera captures a person’s face in real time.
<p></p> 
 Face Detection – The system locates the face in the image and isolates it from the background.
<p></p> 
 Feature Extraction – Algorithms analyze facial features such as cheekbones, chin curves, and lip contours.
<p></p> 
 Template Creation – The extracted data is turned into a digital faceprint.
<p></p> 
 Comparison and Match – The faceprint is compared with existing records to confirm identity.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Accuracy rates are consistently improving. According to<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html"> NIST FRVT 1:1 testing</a>, leading systems now achieve over 99% verification success under ideal conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Face Anti-Spoofing and Its Role in Security 
<p>Every great lock needs a strong defense. This is where face anti spoofing comes in. Without it, someone could trick the system using a photo, video, or even a 3D mask. Spoofing attempts are surprisingly common in fraud-heavy industries like finance.</p>
<p>Modern systems fight this using liveness detection. The camera checks for natural movements such as blinking, skin texture changes, and depth. Some solutions even shine light on the face and measure reflections to confirm the presence of a real person. These layers of defense ensure that recognition remains both fast and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Face Recognition Attendance System 
<p>Schools, offices, and even factories are adopting a face recognition attendance system. No more long queues at biometric scanners or manual sign-in sheets. Employees just walk in, glance at a camera, and their presence is automatically logged.</p>
<p>The benefits are clear:</p>
 
 No contact required which keeps it hygienic.
<p></p> 
 Faster processing compared to manual punching.
<p></p> 
 Reduced buddy punching where one employee marks attendance for another.
<p></p> 
 Accurate reporting that syncs directly with payroll systems.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Organizations save time and prevent fraud while employees enjoy a hassle-free experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Face Scanning Attendance System in Education 
<p>Schools and universities are also experimenting with a face scanning attendance system. Teachers can focus on teaching instead of wasting class time marking attendance. Parents get real-time updates if their child is present, while administrators gain detailed records for compliance.</p>
<p>Though promising, it does raise questions about student privacy. Educational institutes must handle such systems responsibly and align with global data protection standards like<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"> GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Face Recognition in Real-World Applications 
<p>Let’s talk numbers and impact. The global facial recognition market is projected to reach over $16 billion by 2030. Here’s why it’s growing so fast:</p>
 
 Security – Airports use it to screen passengers quickly.
<p></p> 
 Fraud Prevention – Banks use it to stop identity theft.
<p></p> 
 Convenience – Smartphones unlock instantly with a glance.
<p></p> 
 Efficiency – Attendance and access control become effortless.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Quick Fact Table:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Privacy and Ethical Concerns 
<p>As powerful as the technology is, it sparks serious debates. Who owns the face data? How securely is it stored? What if it gets misused? Regulations are starting to catch up. In Europe,<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"> GDPR rules</a> require companies to get clear consent before storing or using biometric data.</p>
<p>Transparency and user control are key. People need to know how their face data is being used and have the right to opt out. Striking a balance between security and privacy remains one of the biggest challenges for the industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Case Studies: Where It Works Best 
 
 Airports – The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency reported that facial recognition has caught thousands of identity fraud attempts since its rollout.
<p></p> 
 Corporate Offices – Large firms in Asia have reduced payroll fraud by adopting face-based attendance.
<p></p> 
 Healthcare – Hospitals use it to secure patient data and restrict access to sensitive areas.
<p></p> 
 
<p>These case studies highlight how versatile and impactful the technology can be when used responsibly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future of Face Recognition 
<p>Imagine walking into a store, picking items, and leaving without waiting in line. Payment is automatically processed after the system confirms your face. This futuristic scenario is closer than you think. Retailers are already piloting systems where face recognition replaces credit cards.</p>
<p>At the same time, research is focusing on reducing bias. Early systems struggled with accuracy across different ethnicities. Today, continuous improvements are making recognition fairer and more reliable. Open-source contributions on platforms like<a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision"> GitHub</a> are accelerating innovation by giving developers direct access to tools and data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>A <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition system</a> is more than just a tech buzzword. It is reshaping industries by offering speed, security, and convenience. From attendance tracking to fraud prevention, its applications are only expanding. But with great power comes great responsibility, and balancing innovation with privacy will decide how widely it gets adopted in the future. For organizations exploring the technology, brands like <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> are paving the way with practical, secure, and developer-friendly solutions.</p>

<p>The Middle East’s crypto scene is no longer a playground for bold experiments. By September 2025, the region is laying down the law, transforming from a sandbox of ideas into a powerhouse of regulated innovation. Dubai’s regulators are cracking the whip, Bahrain’s rolling out bold new laws, and the UAE’s dirham is staking its claim as the backbone of digital payments. This isn’t just a shift — it’s a seismic leap toward a future where compliance fuels growth. Let’s dive into the forces reshaping the region’s crypto landscape.</p> Dubai: Where Stablecoins Meet Serious Oversight <p>Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) isn’t messing around. Gone are the days of loose guidelines and “let’s see what sticks.” VARA’s 2025 rulebook is a masterclass in clarity, dictating how stablecoins (Fiat-Referenced Virtual Assets) and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) must be issued, backed, and disclosed. Want to launch a stablecoin or tokenize a skyscraper? You’d better have your paperwork in order.The real game-changer? Enforcement. VARA recently slapped a fine on a licensed firm, sending a crystal-clear message: licenses aren’t just badges of honor — they’re contracts with accountability. Dubai’s saying loud and clear: innovate, but play by our rules. This isn’t just regulation; it’s a blueprint for trust in a digital&nbsp;age.</p> Abu Dhabi: The Institutional Crypto&nbsp;Haven <p>While Dubai swings the regulatory hammer, Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is crafting a different narrative. Its Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) has fine-tuned its crypto framework to welcome institutional heavyweights. From custody to payment services, ADGM’s rules for fiat-referenced tokens are a magnet for serious players. Yet, privacy tokens and algorithmic stablecoins? Still persona non&nbsp;grata.</p><p>ADGM’s approach is a tightrope walk: embrace cutting-edge innovation while ensuring every move can withstand the scrutiny of global finance. It’s less about flashy pilots and more about building a crypto hub that&nbsp;lasts.</p> UAE’s Central Bank: Dirham Takes the Digital&nbsp;Crown <p>The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) is drawing a line in the sand. As of September 2025, only dirham-pegged stablecoins can power onshore payments. Foreign tokens? Relegated to niche corners. This isn’t just policy — it’s a bold bet on the dirham as the anchor of the UAE’s digital economy. By prioritizing local currency, the CBUAE is ensuring the UAE doesn’t just participate in the crypto revolution — it leads&nbsp;it.</p> Dubai’s Real Estate Revolution: Tokenization Goes&nbsp;Big <p>Remember when Dubai’s tokenized real estate pilots were just a cool idea? Those days are gone. Recent sales, run with the Dubai Land Department, vanished in minutes, pulling in investors from every corner of the globe. The DIFC PropTech Hub is doubling down, turning these pilots into a full-blown movement. Tokenized property isn’t a gimmick anymore — it’s a market poised to redefine how we invest in real&nbsp;estate.</p> Bahrain and Beyond: The GCC’s Crypto Patchwork <p>Bahrain’s not sitting on the sidelines. Its new laws for Bitcoin and stablecoins are designed to make trading safer and more attractive to institutions. Meanwhile, Kuwait and Qatar are playing it cautious, keeping their crypto gates tightly shut. The GCC isn’t moving in unison, but the UAE and Bahrain are sprinting ahead, setting the pace for a region-wide crypto renaissance.</p> The Privacy Puzzle: Navigating the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Behind the headlines lies a thornier challenge: the FATF Travel Rule. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) now have to share user data across borders, stirring up privacy and operational headaches. Enter Shyft Veriscope, a peer-to-peer platform that lets firms comply without exposing sensitive customer data to centralized risks. In a region obsessed with trust and growth, tools like these are the unsung heroes of crypto’s next&nbsp;chapter.</p> Why 2025 Is the Year to&nbsp;Watch <p>The Middle East isn’t just dabbling in crypto anymore — it’s rewriting the rules of the game. From dirham-backed stablecoins to tokenized skyscrapers, the region is building a digital asset economy where compliance isn’t a burden but a springboard. For founders, investors, and innovators, the message is clear: get on board, align with the rules, and seize the opportunity to shape a future where crypto isn’t just a buzzword — it’s a&nbsp;legacy.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule. Enhanced by User Signing, it enables VASPs to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, streamlining the compliance process.</p><p>For more information, visit our<a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope"> website</a> and<a href="https://www.shyft.network/contact"> contact</a> our team for a discussion.

<p>Regulated entities – including PSPs, VASPs, investment platforms, and trust companies – must meet rising KYB and AML expectations. This article highlights emerging requirements across the UAE, UK, EU, Singapore, and U.S.</p>
 
 Regulated entities operate in complex environments where KYB and AML compliance are non-negotiable. Whether your firm is a payment service provider (PSP), virtual asset service provider (VASP), investment platform, corporate services provider, a real estate agent, a mortgage broker, regulators are tightening standards. 
<p>In 2025 and beyond, firms must demonstrate robust KYB controls, real-time screening, and jurisdictional audit readiness – especially as rules evolve in key markets like the UK, UAE, and EU.</p>
 
 Emerging Global AML Requirements for Regulated Entities 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulators: Companies House, FCA 
 Shifts: Mandatory KYB and identity verification for directors and PSCs; AML registration and sanctions screening under MLR 2017

<p>Public discourse on social media has grown toxic and divisive. Traditional social platforms drive polarization and outrage because they feed users content through a single, centralized algorithm that is optimized for ad revenue and engagement. Unlike those platforms, Bluesky is building a social web that empowers people instead of exploiting them.</p>
<p>Bluesky started as a project within Twitter in 2019 to reimagine social from the ground up — to be an example of “bluesky” thinking that could reinvent how social worked. With the goal of building a healthier, less toxic social media ecosystem, we spun out as a public benefit corporation in 2022 to develop technologies for open and decentralized conversation. We built Authenticated Transfer so Twitter could interoperate with other social platforms, but when Twitter decided not to use it, we built an app to showcase the protocol.</p>
<p>When we built the app, we first gave users control over their feed: In the Bluesky app, users have algorithmic choice — you can choose from a marketplace of over 100k algorithms, built by other users, giving you full control over what you see. There is also stackable moderation, allowing people to spin up independent moderation services, and giving users a choice in what moderation middleware they subscribe to. And of course there is the open protocol, which lets you migrate between apps with your data and identity, creating a social ecosystem with full data portability. Just today, we announced that we are taking <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/plc-directory-org">the next step in decentralization</a>.</p>
<p>Although we focused on building these solutions to empower users, we still inherited many of the problems of traditional social platforms. We’ve seen how harassment, vitriol, and bad-faith behavior can degrade overall conversation quality. But innovating on how social works is in our DNA. We’ve been continuously working towards creating healthier conversations. The quote-post used to let harassers take a post out of context, so we gave users the ability to disable them. The reply section often filled up with unwanted replies, so we gave users the ability to control their interaction settings.</p>
<p>Our upcoming product changes are designed to strengthen the quality of discourse on the network, give communities more customized spaces for conversation, and improve the average user’s experience. One of the features we are workshopping is a “zen mode” that sets new defaults for how you experience the network and interact with people. Another is including prompts for how to engage in more constructive conversations. We see this as part of our goal to make social more authentic, informative, and human again.</p>
<p>We’ve also been working on a new version of our Community Guidelines for over six months, and in the process of updating them, we’ve asked for community feedback. We looked at all of the feedback you gave and incorporated some of your suggestions into the new version. Most significantly, we added details so everyone understands what we do and do not allow. We also better organized the rules by putting them into categories. We chose an approach that respects the human rights and fundamental freedoms outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The new Guidelines take effect on October 15.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’re going to adjust how we enforce our moderation policies to better cultivate a space for healthy conversations. Posts that degrade the quality of conversations and violate our guidelines are a small percentage of the network, but they draw a lot of attention and negatively impact the community. Going forward, we will more quickly escalate enforcement actions towards account restrictions. We will also be making product changes that clarify when content is likely to violate our community guidelines.</p>
<p>We were built to reimagine social from the ground up by opening up the freedom to experiment and letting users choose. Social media has been dominated by a few platforms that have closed off their social graph and squashed competition, leaving users few alternatives. Bluesky is the first platform in a decade to challenge these incumbents. Every day, more people set up small businesses and create new apps and feeds on the protocol. We are continuing to invest in the broader protocol ecosystem, laying a foundation for the next generation of social media developers to build upon.</p>
 
<p>Today’s Community Guidelines Updates</p>
<p>In January, we <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-17-2025-moderation-2024">started down the path</a> of updating our rules. Part of that process was to ask for your thoughts on our updated Community Guidelines. More than 14,000 of you shared feedback, suggestions, and examples of how these rules might affect your communities. We especially heard from community members who shared concerns about how the guidelines could impact creative expression and traditionally marginalized voices.</p>
<p>After considering this feedback, and in a return to our experimental roots, we are going to bring a greater focus to encouraging constructive dialogue and enforcing our rules against harassment and toxic content. For starters, we are going to increase our enforcement efforts. Here is more information about our updated <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>What Changed Based on Your Feedback</p>
 
 Better Structure: We organized individual policies according to our four principles – Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. Each section now better explains what's not allowed and consolidated related policies that were previously scattered across different sections. 
 More Specific Language: Where you told us terms were too vague or confusing, we added more detail about what these policies cover. 
 Protected Expression: We added a new section for journalism, education, advocacy, and mental health content that aims to reduce uncertainty about enforcement in those areas. 
 
<p>Our Approach: Foundation and Choice</p>
<p>We maintain baseline protections against serious harms like violence, exploitation, and fraud. These foundational Community Guidelines are designed to keep Bluesky safe for everyone.</p>
<p>Within these protections, our architecture lets communities layer on different labeling services and moderation tools that reflect their specific values. This gives users choice and control while maintaining essential safety standards.</p>
<p>People will always disagree about whether baseline policies should be tighter or more flexible. Our goal is to provide more detail about where we draw these boundaries. Our approach respects human rights and fundamental freedoms as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, while recognizing we must follow laws in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Looking Forward</p>
<p>Adding clarity to our Guidelines and improving our enforcement efforts is just the beginning. We also plan to experiment with changes to the app that will improve the quality of your experience by reducing rage bait and toxicity. We may not get it right with every experiment but we will continue to stay true to our purpose and to listen to our community as we go.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">updated guidelines</a> take effect on October 15, and will continue to evolve as we learn from implementation and feedback. Thank you for sharing your perspectives and helping us build better policies for our community.</p>

					 How Mobility Leaders Turn Idle Ride Time into Opportunity 				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Mobility leaders across the globe are searching for a constant communication channel with their end customers. For transit leaders, there are three main touchpoints with their end consumers: Ticketing (Boarding), In-Transit, and Exit (Disembarkation). Most mobility leaders perfect one of the three, leaving possible revenue channels and ideal rider experiences on the table.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
					 What communication channel can be capitalized across all three consumer journey touchpoints within mobility?  				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>The Problem: Current proximity modalities are limited by one of the following: distance, throughput, hardware limitations, and interoperability. </p><p>The Solution: LISNR Radius offers a unique proximity modality that changes the way consumers interact throughout the rider journey. Our Radius SDK relies on ultrasonic communication between standard speakers (already installed in transit vehicles and stations) and microphones found in everyday devices like smartphones. By establishing a communication channel directly between the consumer device and the vehicle or station, transit operators can reduce wait times, improve accessibility, capitalize on idle time in transit, and segment their riders for variable pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, LISNR offers Quest, our loyalty and gamification portal, which allows mobility leaders to keep a unified record of key customer interactions. With Quest, mobility leaders can incentivize off-peak rides and partner with nearby shops to offer advertisements directly to a rider in transit.</p>

									 The Proliferation of LISNR-Enabled Digital Touchpoints in Mobility <p>LISNR empowers businesses to capitalize on the digital touchpoints found in everyday transit experiences. By enabling the delivery of speedy ticketing and personalized offers directly to consumers’ devices, transit operators can engage their riders during all three stages of transit. </p> Ticketing <p>Legacy ticketing infrastructure creates long queues, is easy to bypass, and simply doesn’t work without a stable internet connection. Radius redefines this process with our ultrasonic SDK by working at longer ranges than NFC, with more pinpoint precision than BLE, and without a network connection at the time of transaction. Radius is already gaining major traction as a ticketing alternative in the mobility space. With our recent partnership with S-Cube, LISNR has expanded to provide a mass ticketing solution to the busiest transit stations in India.</p>								 
				 
		 
				 
				 
									<p>S-Cube needed a faster and more secure way to enable ticketing for millions of riders. Moreover, S-Cube needed ticketing technology that could perform without a reliable network connection. Radius was able to achieve all of these and more. In testing, S-Cube saw a dramatic increase in rider throughput by switching from QR codes to Radius for ticketed gate access. They moved from processing 35 riders per minute to 60 riders per minute, representing an over 70% improvement.</p>								 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									<p>&nbsp;</p><p>S-Cube uses a Zone 66 broadcast at entry allowing consumers to identify themselves and validate their ticket as they approach the turnstile. Once at the turnstile, consumers can broadcast their account-based ticket information to the ticketing machine (Point1000 on Channel 0 from their device’s speaker). Since they have already been identified and validated, their passengers can breeze through the ticketing process.</p>

									 In-Transit Promotion <p>In-transit promotions are not a new concept, with buses and trains already filled with billboard-like advertising. More recently, rideshare applications have started showing ad space on the home page and key active pages. Unfortunately, these advertisements often go unnoticed, are rarely relevant to the end customer, and for rideshares, are only presented to the paying device. LISNR solves these problems with Radius and Quest.</p><p>Using Radius, transit operators can capitalize on idle time in transit by sending promotional offerings directly to all consumers’ devices that are present in the vehicle. For example, businesses at certain stops can target specific riders based on their commute patterns. Furthermore, food/grocery delivery platforms can focus on a tired passenger coming home from work.</p><p>By establishing this additional communication channel to their riders, the transit operator can send promotional messages from their partners directly to the most important audiences. By communicating at the device level, promotional offerings can be sent with the preferences of the end customer. Radius’s ultrasonic SDK operates above audible frequencies, meaning that even in noisy conditions, riders are still able to receive their promotions.</p><p>By incorporating Quest, transit operators (or their marketing partners) can keep a unified record of customers and the promotions they interact with. Over time, this leads to more relevant promotions and a better experience for marketers and riders alike. With Quest and Radius, transit operators can capitalize on riders’ idle time in transit while establishing a positive connection with them.</p>

									 Identify the Exit Point <p>In some modes of transit it’s easy to identify when the consumer exits the vehicle (planes, rideshares), however, most modes of public transit are left in the dark. This lack of visibility into rider disembarkation makes certain variable pricing nearly impossible. With Radius, transit operators can leverage the rider’s microphone when in-app to detect and confirm the presence of the device. With Radius enabled, mobility operators can begin to charge based on a “Be-In-Be-Out” pricing model. These seamless transit experiences are gaining traction with the global contactless transit market projected to grow to $33.5B by 2030 (CAGR ~15%). This major shift is driven by account-based ticketing and distance/usage-based fares (<a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/contactless-payments-market">Source: Allied Market Research, 2023</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>LISNR is here to enable transit ecosystem leaders with the technology to support a near-frictionless be-in/be-out user flow for consumers. Our long-range (Zone) ultrasonic tones can broadcast in-vehicle to detect the presence of devices. As riders exit the vehicle, the tones will no longer be detected and the app backend will end the variable pricing model for their trip. </p>								 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
									 Conclusion <p>LISNR’s contactless solutions help support the mobility and transit ecosystems across all major digital touchpoints in the consumer journey, from ticketing to exit. With these contactless touchpoints optimized for speed and security, ecosystem leaders can capitalize on variable pricing and answer the growing demand for frictionless experiences; all while establishing new revenue streams with in-transit promotions.&nbsp;</p><p>Our customer loyalty and gamification portal, Quest, can support and optimize consumer touchpoints across the journey. Riders can be incentivized to travel in off-peak hours, receive bonuses for promotions that they convert on, and be rewarded for their achievements such as lifetime rides.</p><p>We’ve put together a comprehensive PDF that outlines where LISNR outperforms other contactless technologies commonly found in mobility.

 We spoke with Florian Werner, CEO of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Glücksspiel (DGGS), the operator behind the JackpotPiraten and BingBong brands, to understand how strict regulatory requirements under the Interstate Treaty on Gambling (GlüStV 2021) are shaping iGaming in Germany. 



 



<p>From the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">country’s strong focus on player protection</a> to navigating compliance challenges Werner explains how DGGS balances regulation with player experience – and why trusted partners like IDnow are essential for building a sustainable, responsible iGaming market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of Germany’s earliest licensed iGaming operators, DGGS has taken on both the pride and responsibility of setting industry standards. With its JackpotPiraten and BingBong brands, the company is committed to combining entertainment with strong compliance and social responsibility. In this interview, CEO Florian Werner shares how DGGS works with regulators, leverages technology to protect players and adapts to the challenges of one of Europe’s most tightly regulated markets.&nbsp;</p>



 Why being first in Germany came with pride – and responsibility&nbsp; 



 In 2022, DGGS’ JackpotPiraten and BingBong became the first brands to receive a national slot licence from the German regulator, GGL. What did that milestone mean for you as an operator – especially in terms of your responsibility to lead in compliance and player protection? 



<p>We were delighted and proud to be the first operator to meet the necessary requirements for entering the German market. At the same time, we are fully aware of the responsibility this entails. That is why we are committed to acting responsibly and have deliberately chosen such an experienced partner as IDnow to stand by our side, supporting us actively in key areas such as player protection, account verification, and the safety of our players.</p>



 How does IDnow help you protect your players? 



<p>IDnow helps us reliably verify the identity of our players, making sure that no one can play under a false name. At the same time, the solution provides a secure and compliant identity check that effectively prevents underage gaming and fraud. This way, we create a trustworthy and protected environment for all our players.</p>



 Why regulation in Germany creates both challenges and opportunities&nbsp; 



 What were the most significant regulatory and operational challenges you faced in those first months?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The biggest challenges in the regulated German market have remained unchanged since legalization. These primarily include the high tax burdens in Germany, which have a negative impact on payout ratios and the overall gaming experience of virtual slot machines. In addition, requirements such as a €1 stake limit and the mandatory delay between game rounds (the ‘5-second rule’) pose significant challenges. Since many of these regulations were newly introduced under the 2021 Interstate Treaty on Gambling (GlüStV 2021), a meaningful exchange of experiences was initially difficult. However, we are in contact with various industry representatives and remain hopeful for a more attractive offering for German players in the future.</p>



 How does the DGGS work with GGL and other regulators to protect players and combat fraud and how does it stay up to date with any regulatory changes to ensure continuous compliance?&nbsp; 



<p>We are engaged in regular dialogue on multiple levels, collaborating closely with both industry associations and regulatory representatives. In particular our compliance team maintains an ongoing exchange that we experience as collegial, constructive, and open.</p>



 Why technology and trusted partners are the backbone of compliance&nbsp; 



 What role do trusted technology or identity verification partners play in maintaining your compliance and risk posture?&nbsp; 



<p>Verification and identity-check technologies are of vital importance. In Germany, strict regulations rightly govern the handling of personal data. To meet these standards effectively, we rely on experienced external providers whose expertise ensures secure, efficient, and reliable processes at a scale that would not be possible manually.</p>



 Why responsible gambling is more than a legal requirement&nbsp; 



 The German GGL regulation is centred on social responsibility and player protection. What specific measures do you have in place to identify and assist players at risk of gambling harm?&nbsp; 



<p>At our online casinos JackpotPiraten and BingBong, we analyze player behavior and ensure a safe gaming experience. If signs of problematic gambling emerge, we are able to reach out directly to the player and if necessary, exclude them from play. As part of the regulated market, we see this consistent and responsible approach as one of our core duties in protecting players.</p>



 How do you ensure that your responsible gambling tools are actually effective? Do you measure outcomes or make improvements based on player feedback or behavioral data?&nbsp; 



<p>We take responsible gambling very seriously and therefore conduct ongoing monitoring of player activity. If signs of problematic gambling behavior are detected and cannot be changed, we can take a range of measures, including the closure of the player’s account.</p>



 Can you describe how the OASIS self-exclusion system is integrated into your platform and how you handle self-excluded or returning players?&nbsp; 



<p>Players can exclude themselves at any time directly on our platforms through the OASIS self-exclusion system. In addition, a ‘panic button’ is available, enabling an immediate 24-hour break from play. Once registered with OASIS, players are automatically blocked from accessing our platforms and are prevented from receiving any form of personalized advertising. These measures reflect our strong commitment to responsible gambling and player protection.</p>



 What trends are you seeing in player behavior since the introduction of the new regulatory framework?&nbsp; 



<p>In international comparison, German legislation for virtual slot games is very strict. Tax rates are set at a high level, which negatively impacts the payout ratios of the games. In addition, there are stake restrictions and a requirement for a minimum game round duration of five seconds. Players view these measures very critically and often turn to the less restrictive and more attractive offerings of the black market. As a result, tax revenues in Germany from virtual slot games have been continuously declining, an unfortunate negative trend.</p>



 Transparency is key in regulated markets. How do you communicate responsible gambling features and policy updates to your players in a clear and proactive way?&nbsp; 



<p>At Deutsche Gesellschaft für Glücksspiel, raising awareness among players about responsible gaming is a core priority. We follow a dual strategy that goes well beyond legal requirements. In line with regulations, we provide a dedicated information section on our platforms that explains how to use gambling products safely. Clear warnings about potential risks are displayed transparently, and players can access support organizations directly through the links we provide.</p>



<p>Going further, we actively engage our players through a regular newsletter and our innovative Slot Academy. Here, education takes place via live video sessions that continuously address the risks of virtual slot games and promote responsible, informed play.</p>



 Why entertainment and responsibility can go hand in hand&nbsp; 



 Looking ahead, what’s next for DGGS? Are there upcoming developments, features, or goals you’re particularly excited about?&nbsp; 



<p>This year we are celebrating the Jackpot Video Awards 2025. The idea for an event together with our players came directly from the community. The Jackpot Video Awards combine entertainment with player protection and are eagerly anticipated by both our team and the players.</p>

    This EIB financing will support Thales' investments in research and development for aeronautics and radars.   The large-scale project will have a significant impact on the European security and defence industry.   It is the EIB’s first corporate loan to France’s security and defence sector.   The project also aligns with the EIB’s TechEU programme, which aims to foster innovation and the development of new technologies.   <p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) has granted a €450 million loan to Thales to finance its research and development investment programme in aeronautics and radar technologies. This programme is set to run until the end of 2027 and aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of both civil and military flights, while those in radar will make it possible to modernise current equipment and develop a new generation of civil and military software and radar systems.</p><p>As well as being Thales’ first EIB loan, it is also one of the biggest corporate loans the EIB has ever granted in the security and defence sector. The loan is part of <a href="https://www.eib.org/projects/topics/innovation-digital-and-human-capital/techeu/index">TechEU</a>, the EIB’s innovation programme launched in June with €70 billion in funding available until 2027.</p><blockquote>EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle said: “In the security and defence sector, innovation is key. The EIB is therefore pleased to help Thales, global leader in technologies for defence, aerospace and cyber security, to remain at the forefront of technological development. This initial operation with Thales also shows the EIB Group’s strong commitment to financing the security and defence sector, which is central to European sovereignty.”</blockquote><blockquote>Thales Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer Pascal Bouchiat said: “We are very pleased with this support from the European Investment Bank, which reinforces the Group’s technological leadership and its contribution to European sovereignty. With 3,000 researchers and 30,000 engineers involved in Research and Development, and €4.2 billion invested each year in R&amp;D, Thales is recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world.”</blockquote> EIB Group support for European security and defence <p>Since 2024, the EIB Group has significantly stepped up its support for the development of European security and defence capabilities. Its activities in this area are a cross-cutting and permanent public policy objective of the Group, as well as being part of its eight <a href="https://www.eib.org/publications/20240198-eib-group-2024-2027-strategic-roadmap">strategic priorities for the period 2024-2027</a>.</p><p>The EIB Group has revised its lending policy to broaden the eligibility criteria and the range of security and defence projects it can finance. It has also set up a Security and Defence Office to ensure a rapid and effective response to project proposals.The EIB Group’s objective is to allocate <a href="https://www.eib.org/press/all/2025-247-eib-group-increases-2025-financing-ceiling-to-record-eur100-billion-to-step-up-investments-in-security-and-defence-energy-grids-and-europe-s-tech-leadership">3.5% of its total financing planned for 2025 (approximately €3.5 billion) to security and defence-related projects</a>.</p><p>As a result of its ongoing and productive dialogue with industry and financial intermediaries, defence ministries and key institutions such as the European Commission, the European Defence Agency and NATO, the EIB Group has a solid portfolio of 80 projects under review that contribute to the European Union’s security and defence capabilities.</p><p>You can find out more about the EIB’s support for the European security and defence sector <a href="https://www.eib.org/projects/topics/security-defence/index">here</a>.</p>

 Where to next? Five pathways for a regenerative built environment  Possibilities for the Built Environment, part 2 of&nbsp;3 <p>This is the second in a series of three provocations, which mark the cumulation of a collaborative effort between Dark Matter Labs and Bauhaus Earth to consider a regenerative future for the built environment as part of the <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/projects/rebuilt-transformation-pathways">ReBuilt</a>&nbsp;project.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/whats-guiding-our-regenerative-futures-e34e0ab21c06">the first piece</a>, we suggested how six guiding principles for a regenerative built environment could redirect our focus. In this piece, we lay out six pathways toward regeneration, with suggested benchmarks and possible demonstrators, as a means of starting conversations, and identifying allies and tensions. The final piece in the series uses the configuration of the cement industry to explore the idea of nested economies and possible regenerative indicators.</p> Toward a process-based definition of regeneration <p>This piece leans into the friction between today’s extractive norms and the regenerative futures we have yet to&nbsp;realise.</p><p>We propose five pathways to establish regenerative practices throughout the built environment: these will span scales and sectors while driving change aligned with the principles laid out in the previous provocation. These pathways represent five modes for developing a multiplicity of new metrics, as well as creating the conditions for further progress to be taken on by future generations. Embedded in this logic are multiple and diverse systemic entry points for various actors to engage along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>These pathways are directions of travel that can be launched within the current economic system, without adopting a solution mindset. However, there are still real challenges to progress because of today’s political economy and scale of the polycrisis. While these pathways can be initiated within the current economic system, to be fully realised they must transform the system itself along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>One aspiration for these pathways is that they can capture the imagination and energies of a range of stakeholders, by creating containers for the changes it will take to bring us to a regenerative built environment. If we assume that to reach this future we will need both paradigm-shifting ‘impossible’ ideas and real demonstrations of best practices within our current contexts, then these pathways can hold together the different strands of effort, from the more feasible to the boundary-pushing, in one directional container. In each pathway, we ourselves look toward collaborators across geographies and disciplines to imagine, visualise and orient ourselves toward where these shifts could take us, in 2030, 2050 and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>On a pragmatic level, structures to support initiation and governance of these pathways already exist and can be further fostered. Ownership for pathways can sit at the city or municipal level, supported by city networks such as Net Zero Cities, C40 cities and others, and further enabled through multi-municipal or regional coalitions to reach national scales. This type of multi-scalar, integrated approaches to the pathways can create the conditions for bottom-up schemes and ideas in communities and allow these to grow. The scale and pace of the transition we need requires governing decision-makers to have visibility over exceptional ideas that can push at the edges of the Overton&nbsp;window.</p><p>These pathways are not wholesale solutions to the problem, but rather provocative visions to incite discussion, draw out coalitions, grow a sense of responsibility and build momentum. It’s not that if we do these five things that a regenerative future will be reached. Rather, these are components of a re-envisioning.</p> Pathway 1: Maximising utilisation <p>Maximising the utilisation of our existing resources, spaces and infrastructures is one of the most transformative actions we can undertake in a context of resource shortage, carbon emissions crisis and labour crisis. That is especially relevant in the European context where our resource and space use inefficiencies are massive. Unlocking this latent capacity promises significant advancements in social justice and decoupling space and use creation from extraction and pollution. This develops a range of strategies from full utilisation of existing building stock, sharing models, flexible space use, with instruments such as open digital registries, smart space use platforms, smart contracts, and the&nbsp;like.</p>Image: Ivana Stancic, Dark Matter Labs, ‘A New Economy for Europe’s Built Environment’ white paper, for New European Bauhaus lighthouse project Desire: An Irresistible Circular Society,&nbsp;2024.<p>Deep structural changes in mechanisms to challenge speculative land markets and reform regulatory frameworks will be needed to embed redistributive and democratic principles into the governance of urban&nbsp;space.</p> Potential challenges: <p>The implementation of maximal utilisation is severely constrained by today’s profit-driven development logic, which prioritises profit through new development and property speculation over efficient or shared use. Institutional inertia, entrenched ownership regimes and the financialisation of housing all work against such a shift, while digital tools like registries and smart contracts risk reinforcing existing inequalities if not democratically governed.</p><blockquote>System demonstrator: reprogramming office buildings from 35% to a 90% use, increasing financial flows of the&nbsp;building</blockquote> What could this look like in&nbsp;2050?   Multi-actor spatial governance frameworks and use-based permissions  Dynamic pricing structures for building use based on occupancy and social value&nbsp;creation  Highly durable building structures with adaptable multi-use internal&nbsp;spaces  Outcomes-based financing models tied to social and ecological impacts  Mixed use public-private-NGO partnerships  Public digital booking platforms for maximised utilisation of&nbsp;spaces   Pathway 2: Next-generation typologies <p>Next typologies are no longer governed by the principle that form follows function. Instead, they transcend traditional asset classes based on programmatic use, as a new asset class valued for the optionality, flexibility, use efficiency and value creation they provide. Decoupling value creation from extraction, systemic inefficiencies and carbon emissions here happens through focusing on social capital–for instance, radical sharing and cooperation models, as well as intellectual capital–as new innovation models and new design typologies.</p>Image: Ivana Stancic, Dark Matter Labs, ‘A New Economy for Europe’s Built Environment’ white paper, for New European Bauhaus lighthouse project Desire: An Irresistible Circular Society,&nbsp;2024.<p>Without directly challenging speculative land markets, financialisation, and the classed and racialised histories embedded in built form, next-generation typologies may risk becoming a greenwashed evolution of the status quo rather than a transformative departure from&nbsp;it.</p> Potential challenges: <p>In capitalist urban systems, typologies and asset classes are produced through financial logics, property relations and commodification. Reframing buildings as flexible, innovation-driven assets may simply reproduce these dynamics in a new guise, reinforcing speculative value creation and market discipline under the banner of sustainability.</p><blockquote>System demonstrator: Community living rooms–lightweight extensions on existing buildings, providing amenities with the right to&nbsp;use</blockquote> What could this look like in&nbsp;2050?   Building public awareness in benefits of social time in relation to mental&nbsp;health  New standards and codes for shared spaces and&nbsp;assets  Tax reductions linked to carbon reduction impact of maximising efficiency  Shared kitchens, living rooms, laundry rooms, appliances, tools and workshops  Policy innovation enabling categorisation of shared&nbsp;spaces  Increased cross-generational support, decreased loneliness, depression, stress&nbsp;levels   Pathway 3: Systems for full circularity <p>Even though we have comprehensive knowledge on circularity, current levels in Europe are extremely low, and globally its rate is declining, thus this work focuses on the systems unlocking it and instruments driving its advancement on the ground. Apart from a comprehensive understanding of the craft (design for disassembly, development of city-scale material components networks, use of non-composite materials), we need the institutional economy and systems enabling circularity. That includes instruments such as material registries, material passports, financing mechanisms, design regulations, all developed simultaneously to unlock the new systems for circularity.</p>Image: Ivana Stancic, Dark Matter Labs, ‘A New Economy for Europe’s Built Environment’ white paper, for New European Bauhaus lighthouse project Desire: An Irresistible Circular Society,&nbsp;2024.<p>For circularity to be genuinely transformative, it must be accompanied by political and economic restructuring — challenging the growth imperative, redistributing material control, and embedding democratic governance into how urban resources are managed and&nbsp;reused.</p> Potential challenges <p>Structural barriers hinder circularity. Extraction, planned obsolescence and short-term profit maximisation, which are the main imperatives in the current system, actively disincentivise long-term material stewardship. Circular practices often require slower, more localised and collaborative modes of production, which clash with the logics of global supply chains, speculative development and financialised real&nbsp;estate.</p><p>Moreover, without addressing issues of ownership, labour relations and uneven access to materials and technologies, circular systems risk being implemented in ways that benefit private actors while offloading costs onto public bodies or marginalised communities.</p><blockquote>System demonstrator: City-scale architectural components bank, with developers’ right-to-use models</blockquote> What could this look like in&nbsp;2050?   Material data registries and warranties for secondary materials  Lightweight extensions, maximising utilisation and reuse of existing buildings  City-scale material balance sheets and data registries for localised material&nbsp;cycles  Civic material hubs for storage and distribution, zero carbon transport and logistics networks  Demountable and highly adaptable building&nbsp;design  Sinking funds for facilitating material reuse during deconstruction   Pathway 4: Biogenerative material&nbsp;economy <p>The long-term future of our material economy must be bioregenerative. This transition needs deep understanding of systems impacts, avoiding further global biodiversity and land degeneration through green growth. This shift requires a transformation in land use for materials, moving from “green belts’’ to permaculture and regenerative methods, from supply chains to local supply loops. This requires developing new local material forests, zero-carbon local transport, non-polluting construction methods, as well as the policy, operational and financial innovation for a successful implementation of a fully biocompatible material&nbsp;economy.</p>Image: Ivana Stancic, Dark Matter Labs, ‘A New Economy for Europe’s Built Environment’ white paper, for New European Bauhaus lighthouse project Desire: An Irresistible Circular Society,&nbsp;2024.<p>True transformation will involve challenging capitalist land markets, redistributing land and decision-making power and centering indigenous and community-led stewardship practices within the material&nbsp;economy.</p> Potential challenges: <p>We must not underestimate how global capitalism — through land commodification, agribusiness and extractive supply chains — actively undermines regenerative potential. Transforming green belts into permaculture zones, or establishing local material forests, requires not just technical and policy innovation, but a fundamental shift in land ownership, governance and power relations. Without addressing who controls land and resources, and whose interests are served by current material economies, there is a danger that biogenerative strategies become niche or elite enclaves, rather than systemic solutions.</p><blockquote>System demonstrator: Neighbourhood gardens of biomaterials for insulation panels components for on site retrofitting</blockquote> What could this look like in&nbsp;2050?   Regenerative agriculture &amp; forestry practices and open education programs  Certification for regenerative agriculture &amp; carbon&nbsp;storage  Macro-investments in bioregional forests &amp; urban&nbsp;farms  Civic biomaterial experimentation workshops &amp; micro-factories  Land restoration &amp; rewilding sinking&nbsp;funds  Regional, regenerative biomaterial supply chains, zero-carbon logistics networks   Pathway 5: Shifting comfort, increasing contact <p>The ways we live in buildings today alienates us from our environmental and earthly context. Today’s built environment is designed to optimise for sterilisation through conditioned environments, separating us from the biomatter that is both input and output to our livelihoods. In providing comfort, we have been depending on extraction of resources, other species, biodiversity and ironically ourselves. We need to decouple the economy of comfort, which is here a shorthand for human-optimised environmental conditions, from extraction and externalisation. Pathways in driving this shift include participation and care models, increasing social values, shifting human relation to nature, a shift from technological to ecological services providing comfort, an increase in social and physical activity, a shift from the building scale to other scales, such as city-scale nature-based infrastructures and micro-scale furniture or clothing.</p>Image: Ivana Stancic, Dark Matter Labs, ‘A New Economy for Europe’s Built Environment’ white paper, for New European Bauhaus lighthouse project Desire: An Irresistible Circular Society,&nbsp;2024.<p>Real progress will involve confronting the socio-economic systems that produce uneven access to comfort, land and energy, and reconfiguring them through justice-oriented redistribution, democratic urban governance and decommodified approaches to housing and&nbsp;care.</p> Potential challenges: <p>In this pathway, we must not romanticise behavioural or cultural change without sufficiently addressing the structural conditions that produce and maintain the current ‘economy of comfort’. The alienation it describes is not simply the result of misplaced design priorities or cultural habits, but of a capitalist system that commodifies comfort, standardises it through global construction norms, and externalises its costs onto ecosystems and marginalised communities. Some people experience the comfort constructed by today’s systems much more than&nbsp;others.</p><p>Shifting toward ecological and participatory models of comfort is valuable, but without challenging the political economy that privileges resource-intensive, climate-controlled lifestyles for some while denying basic shelter or agency to others, such shifts may remain symbolic or limited in&nbsp;scope.</p><blockquote>System demonstrator: Retrofitting a neighbourhood to new comfort standards to increase this area’s economic resilience to changing energy landscape.</blockquote> What could this look like in&nbsp;2050?   New standards and codes for&nbsp;comfort  Tax reductions linked to shifts in investments from mechanical towards ecological services  Curriculum rethinking lifestyles in relation to health&nbsp;impacts  Investments in extending ecological services and permeable surfaces for flood mitigation, indoor and outdoor comfort through passive climatisation  Infrastructures for integral value accounting  Capturing and measuring physical and mental health&nbsp;impacts  More community and individual knowledge about how to deal with the material world, ranging from biomatter to biodegradable consumer&nbsp;goods  Local biowaste sorting and utilisation in industry/agriculture   From a static to a process-based definition of a regenerative future <p>In viewing our transition to a regenerative built environment through these core shifts, we look toward a process-based definition of what is regenerative. A process-based definition would be an understanding of the regenerative that is calculated not by fixed, profit-driven metrics, determined on the basis of isolated data-points, or tied to particular policy benchmarks, but rather something dynamic, intuitive, and assembled from across knowledge-spheres and perspectives, with their associated means of measurement.</p><p>A process-based definition might adapt to the changing data landscape, material reality, technopolitical ground conditions and Overton windows of different contexts. Whereas absolute metrics like embodied carbon are difficult to attain with accuracy, and fail to capture the whole picture, targets pegged to individual points in time and specific standards can quickly become obsolete. A process-based approach is inspired by DML’s <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-587c48ef16a0">Cornerstone Indicators</a> [more information at this <a href="https://cornerstoneindicators.com/">link</a>], a methodology which creates composite, intuitive indicators for assessing change over time, co-developed and governed in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Originally co-designed with Dr Katherine Trebeck, the Cornerstone Indicators were initiated in the city of Västerås in Sweden to support citizens to co-design simple, intuitively understandable indicators that encapsulate what thriving means to the people of the Skultana district. The indicators, which align with overall goals like ‘health &amp; wellbeing’ and ‘strong future opportunities’, can facilitate greater understanding of a place, enable further conversation, and guide future decisions. The initial 9-month workshop process to design this first iteration of the Cornerstone Indicators, resulted in indicators such as ‘the number of households who enjoy not owning a car’, and ‘regularly doing a leisure activity with people you don’t cohabit with’ which were analysed and offered to local policymakers. The success of this process has led to explorations of the Cornerstone Indicator process across Europe and North America. Initiatives like the Cornerstone Indicators present a model of how momentum toward a regenerative future for the built environment can be built. It’s urgent that we begin using process-based definitions and practices to bring more people to the table and increase the potential for transition pathways to gain traction.</p> Conclusion <p>In the first two pieces in this series, we have explored the idea of a regenerative future in the built environment by examining how our current frameworks for regeneration fall short of meeting the demands of the present moment. We outline principles and pathways for charting a course toward genuine transformation.</p><p>In providing examples of leading-edge organisations making progress toward a regenerative future, these pieces are intended to invite conversation, feelings of agency and reflection, even in the face of prevailing systemic constraints. Rather than offering neat solutions, this piece seeks to open doors to new possibilities.</p><p>The context and projections offered here raise a number of questions. For a wholesale transition, it will be important to understand what will indicate progress toward regeneration, as well as how decisions will be made in order to resist the co-opting of regenerative principles into status quo ways of operating.</p><p>The remaining piece in this series will&nbsp;explore:</p>  How configurations of material extraction, labour and monetary capital entrench nested economies and particular power relations, using the example of the cement&nbsp;industry  Possible indicators of progress toward a regenerative built environment, and of the limitations encountered  <p>Together these pieces aspire to introduce the idea of a regenerative built environment and associated promises and challenges, to inspire a sense of direction and to sketch the broader systemic shifts to which we must&nbsp;commit.</p><p>This publication is part of the project <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/projects/rebuilt-transformation-pathways">ReBuilt “Transformation Pathways Toward a Regenerative Built Environment</a> — Übergangspfade zu einer regenerativen gebauten Umwelt” and is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) on the basis of a resolution of the German Bundestag.</p><p>This piece represents the views of its authors, including, from Bauhaus Earth, Gediminas Lesutis and Georg Hubmann, and from Dark Matter Labs, Emma Pfeiffer and Aleksander Nowak.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/where-to-five-pathways-for-a-regenerative-built-environment-831e400f705c">Where to?

<p>Cartoons aren’t just for kids; they are a timeless form of entertainment that spans genres from lighthearted comedy to deep, serialized dramas. With so many streaming services and platforms available today, finding where to watch your favorite animated shows can be a challenge. This guide simplifies the search by providing a comprehensive overview of the best sites to watch cartoons online. Whether you’re looking for classic Saturday morning nostalgia, the latest anime hits, or cutting-edge adult animation.</p>



 What to Look for in Watch Cartoons Online Streaming Sites 



 Content Variety 



<p>The best platforms offer a diverse and regularly updated library. Look for a mix of classic cartoons, new releases, and a range of genres, including kids’ animation, anime, and shows for adults.</p>



 User Experience 



<p>A good streaming site should have a clean, easy-to-use interface, high-quality video (HD or 4K), and reliable playback. Useful features like parental controls, watchlists, and an ad-free option are also major pluses.</p>









 Legality and Safety 



<p>To ensure your security and support content creators, stick to reputable services. Look for platforms that have a clear business model, whether through subscriptions or authorized, ad-supported content. Avoid sites with excessive pop-ups or suspicious download prompts.</p>



 Top Sites to Watch Cartoons Online by Genre 



 Netflix 



<p>A global streaming giant with a vast library of animated content. This site includes a growing number of original series for both kids (e.g., The Dragon Prince) and adults (e.g., BoJack Horseman, Arcane).</p>









 Hulu 



<p>Known for its mix of classic and modern cartoons. Hulu offers a wide range of content from networks like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, as well as a strong lineup of adult animated hits like Family Guy and Bob’s Burgers.</p>









 Max (formerly HBO Max) 



<p>The hub for Warner Bros.’ extensive catalog. Max is a go-to for many of the most popular cartoons from Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, including Adventure Time, Rick and Morty, and The Powerpuff Girls.</p>









 Disney+ 



<p>The ultimate destination for Disney and Pixar fans. Disney+ provides access to nearly every animated movie and series from these studios, along with content from Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic.</p>









 Crunchyroll 



<p>For anime enthusiasts, Crunchyroll is the premier service. It offers the world’s largest library of Japanese animation, with new episodes often streaming just an hour after they air in Japan. They also have a limited free section for non-subscribers.</p>









 Tubi 



<p>A completely free, ad-supported streaming service. Tubi has an impressive and diverse collection of cartoons, from nostalgic classics like Scooby-Doo to popular anime and adult animated series.</p>









 YouTube 



<p>A massive repository of animation. You can find official channels from studios (like Warner Bros. and PBS Kids). The full episodes of shows that are in the public domain, and a huge community of independent animators sharing their work.</p>



 Pluto TV 



<p>Another free streaming service that operates like a mix between traditional television and on-demand streaming. It has dedicated channels for various cartoons, including classics and anime, as well as a selection of on-demand content.</p>


 
 


 Hoopla &amp; Libby 



<p>If you have a public library card, these apps are fantastic, completely legal, and free options. They allow you to borrow and stream digital comics, animated shows, and movies from your local library’s collection.</p>









 Common Mistakes to Avoid When You Watch Cartoons Online 



 Using Illegal Streaming Sites 



<p>The biggest mistake is using unofficial sites that host pirated content. These platforms are a major source of malware, viruses, and endless pop-up ads, which can compromise your computer and personal data.</p>



 Falling for Phishing Scams 



<p>Be cautious of sites that ask for your personal information, credit card details, or require you to “log in” to another service. Always double-check the URL and never enter sensitive information on a site that seems suspicious.</p>



 Disabling Security Software 



<p>Some unreliable sites might trick you into disabling your antivirus or ad-blocker to watch a show. This is a red flag and should never be done, as it leaves your device vulnerable to a variety of threats.</p>









 Ignoring Parental Controls 



<p>For families, a common oversight is not using the parental control features available on most major streaming services. These tools are essential for ensuring that children only have access to age-appropriate content.</p>



 Clicking on Suspicious Ads 



<p>Even on legal, ad-supported sites, be careful where you click. Avoid engaging with pop-ups or banners that promise free prizes, downloads, or “miracle” products, as they can lead to malicious websites.</p>



 Forgetting VPNs for Regional Content 



<p>Some shows might be restricted to certain countries. A common mistake is not using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to access legally available content from another region where you have a subscription.</p>



 Tips for Safe and High-Quality Cartoon Streaming 



 Using Reputable Platforms 



<p>The most important tip is to stick to legal and well-known streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Max, and Disney+. These platforms have official partnerships with content creators, guaranteeing that the shows are authorized and free of malware.</p>



 Enable Parental Control 



<p>For families, it is crucial to set up and use parental controls. Most major streaming services offer robust tools that allow you to create profiles for children and restrict content based on age ratings, preventing them from accessing inappropriate material.</p>









 Be Wary of Free Sites 



<p>While some free, ad-supported services like Tubi and Pluto TV are legitimate, you should be extremely cautious of obscure sites. If a site offers a massive, brand-new library for free with no subscriptions or ads, it is likely illegal and could be a source of viruses and malware.</p>



 Using a VPN 



<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be a great tool for secure streaming. It encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address, adding a layer of privacy and security. It can also be used to access content that is legally available in other regions.</p>



 Avoid Suspicious Ads and Downloads 



<p>On ad-supported sites, never click on pop-up ads, download buttons, or links that seem out of place. These are often phishing attempts or malicious software disguised as something else.</p>

  <p> </p>  New 11-year maintenance support contract for IndiGo’s current Airbus A320 fleet and future order of A32X aircraft includes Thales’s avionics ‘By The Hour’ and ‘Repair By The Hour’ programmes.  Repairs will be managed at Thales’ <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/aerospace/press_release/thales-celebrates-opening-new-avionics-mro-centre-gurugram-india">recently opened</a> MRO (Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul) facility in Gurugram, India.  The AvioBook contract extends usage of the AvioBook Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) solution to the entire IndiGo fleet (650,000 flights per year to date) for five years.   <p> </p><p>Thales and IndiGo, India’s largest airline, have signed a strategic maintenance contract for the airline’s current fleet of 430 Airbus A320 aircraft and future order of over 800 A32X aircraft. </p><p>As part of this 11-year contract, Thales will provide IndiGo with expert repair services for avionics components, coupled with Thales’s ‘Avionics-By-The-Hour’ (ABTH) programme - a comprehensive spares management solution that ensures the availability of critical components to minimise aircraft downtime. This, together with Thales’s ‘Repair-By-The-Hour’ (RBTH), guarantees timely maintenance for avionics, allowing IndiGo to increase the availability of its fleet and expedite repairs.</p><p>Repairs will be managed notably at Thales’s new state-of-the-art avionics MRO facility in Gurugram, India, located near the Delhi airport, which is designed to handle the increasing demand for avionics support, featuring advanced technology to streamline repair processes and ensure high levels of fleet availability. Thales’s skilled technicians specialise in maintaining complex avionics systems with repairs that meet stringent safety and regulatory standards.</p><p>IndiGo has also extended a 5-year contract with AvioBook, a Thales company, for <a href="https://aviobook.aero/products/flight">AvioBook Flight</a> —the only Electronic Flight Bag solution currently authorised for paperless operations by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). In use across the entire IndiGo fleet for over a year, AvioBook Flight has already helped significantly reduce consumption of paper usage annually thereby advancing environmental sustainability goals and streamlining flight operations on over 2,000 flights every day. </p><p> </p><blockquote>“We are pleased to partner with Thales, a leading aerospace company trusted worldwide for its expertise in avionics support, to augment IndiGo’s maintenance and repairs capabilities. With IndiGo’s growing scale and fleet, this association aligns with our commitment to offer a hassle-free and safe flying experience to our customers, while ensuring operational excellence and reliability.” Parichay Datta, Senior Vice-president, Engineering, IndiGo. </blockquote><blockquote>“This strategic partnership with IndiGo underscores our commitment to delivering airline world-class avionics support and services. Our new MRO facility in India increases Thales’s ability to provide a swift, reliable service, backed by the power of our global organisation, to meet the evolving demands of the Indian aviation industry.” Thomas Got, Vice President, Aviation Global Services, Thales. </blockquote><p> </p>

 Why Extrimian’s AI‑First Approach Improves Digital Credential Solutions 
<p>Let’s start explaining why Extrimian is an AI-First company. Our goal is to give universities and other startups, a faster, more reliable way to issue, manage, and verify credentials—while ensuring our own teams work smarter behind the scenes. This post explains how our AI‑first ethos (via the internal agent Micelya) makes Extrimian more efficient, and how our University Portal product solves the very real problems of diploma fraud, identity theft and manual verifications.</p>
 TL;DR 
 
 Extrimian’s AI‑first philosophy refers to how we work internally, not how we verify credentials. Our agent Micelya organises knowledge and speeds up development and support. 
 Self‑Sovereign Identity (SSI) and cryptographic signatures secure the credentials; AI is not used in the verification flow. 
 By using AI internally and SSI externally, Extrimian delivers more complete features, faster updates and a calmer verification process for universities and students. 
 
 
 What does “AI‑first” really mean in Extrimian? 
AI – Artificial intelligence, future technology innovation. Extrimian AI-First Company
<p>–</p>
<p>When Extrimian says we are AI‑first, we’re talking about our own processes, not the product’s cryptographic core. We have an internal agent called Micelya that acts like a living knowledge hub for our teams. It stores and organises product specifications, SOPs, design decisions and customer insights, making them easy to find and apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we use Micelya internally? Agile and interdisciplinary processes</p>
<p>To keep Micelya truly useful, our product and engineering teams continually feed it with the latest internal documentation, release notes, process playbooks and step‑by‑step guidelines for every product. This curated knowledge helps the agent surface the right answers, recommend the correct templates and shorten hand‑offs across the organisation.</p>
<p>When engineers or product managers work on a new release, Micelya suggests the right protocol or template and reminds us of past decisions. This means we iterate more quickly, avoid duplication, and keep every improvement in play. The agent doesn’t handle your credentials; it powers how we build and support the product.</p>
 How does Micelya make Extrimian faster and more consistent? 
<p>Micelya’s role is to optimize Extrimian’s internal processes. It automatically flags related resources—SOPs, integration steps, templates—at the moment a team member needs them. It nudges us when something requires approval or when a template must be updated. It also stores lessons learned from support tickets and feature requests, so improvements become part of our future releases. This means we respond to universities more quickly, address issues more consistently, and ship updates faster. Because the agent streamlines our internal workflow, you receive a product that evolves continuously without long delays.</p>
 Why does AI‑first matter for universities if it’s only internal? 
<p>You might wonder why our internal AI should matter to you. Simply put, Micelya makes Extrimian more efficient, which reflects in our product and support. Faster iteration cycles mean new features and fixes arrive sooner. A shared knowledge hub ensures you receive consistent advice regardless of who answers your call. When updates roll out, they’re informed by a complete history of past decisions and user feedback. Although AI never touches your credentials or verification flow, our AI‑first culture ensures we deliver a more refined, dependable product.</p>
 Why is it good to be an AI‑first company? 
<p>Being AI‑first has benefits that extend beyond Extrimian; companies in many sectors adopt AI to become more responsive, innovative, and resilient. Here’s a concise summary of key advantages and how they play out in our case:</p>



Benefit of being AI‑first
Impact on operations
Extrimian example


Efficiency
Faster decisions &amp; shorter release cycles
Micelya surfaces the right SOPs and templates so teams ship updates quicker


Knowledge retention
Shared, up‑to‑date repository of policies &amp; best practices
Our knowledge hub prevents repeated mistakes and speeds new‑hire onboarding


Cross‑team alignment
Consistent workflows and communication across departments
Product, engineering &amp; support teams work from the same playbook


Continuous improvement
AI highlights patterns &amp; informs roadmaps
Micelya captures feedback loops so each release builds on lessons learned


Better customer experience
Quicker responses &amp; higher‑quality products
Universities see faster support, smoother updates and less rework



<p>This table illustrates why an AI‑first mindset isn’t just a buzzword—it underpins real gains in speed, quality and alignment. For Extrimian, those gains help us deliver a stable verification product more rapidly and consistently.</p>
 What do students and verifiers experience? 
<p>From a student’s perspective, digital credentials mean convenience and control. They receive tamper‑proof proofs right in their ID Wallet and share them through a link or QR code. They aren’t forced to disclose their entire transcript when only enrollment status is needed. For verifiers, checking credentials is just as straightforward: visit the university’s verification page, scan the QR code or paste the link, and see an immediate result with clear guidance. No waiting for emails, no guesswork, and no reliance on appearance. This streamlined experience increases trust and speeds up decision‑making for everyone.</p>
 AI for process, cryptography for trust 
<p>Extrimian’s approach balances two forces: cryptographic security for credentials and AI‑driven efficiency for internal work. SSI and digital signatures make diplomas and enrolment proofs tamper‑proof, while the AI‑first mindset (through Micelya) reduces friction in our development and support processes. The two realms remain separate; AI does not verify credentials, but it helps us build better products and respond faster. For universities, this means a reliable, ready‑to‑use product backed by a company that continuously improves without sacrificing trust.</p>

<p>We released Holochain 0.5.5 on 19 August and all tooling and libraries are now up to date.</p> Holochain 0.5.5 and 0.5.6 released <p>With these releases, we’re continuing to work on network performance for the Holochain 0.5.x series. There’s been a bunch of bug fixes and improvements:</p>  New: At build time, Holochain can be switched between <a href="https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel?ref=blog.holochain.org">libdatachannel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc?ref=blog.holochain.org">go-pion</a> WebRTC libraries, with libdatachannel currently the default in the Holochain conductor binary release and go-pion the default in Kangaroo-built hApps. go-pion is potentially free from an unwanted behaviour in libdatachannel, in which the connection is occasionally force-closed after a period of time. If you’ve seen this behaviour, consider trying your hApp in a Kangaroo-built binary to see if it’s resolved.  Changed: Some tracing messages are downgraded from info to debug in Kitsune2 to reduce log noise.  Bugfix: Make sure the transport layer has a chance to fall back to relay before timing out a connection attempt.  Bugfix: When Holochain received too many requests for op data, it would start closing connections with the peers making the requests it couldn't handle. This caused unnecessary churn to reconnect, rediscover what ops need fetching, and send new requests. Instead, the requests that can't be handled are dropped and have to be retried. The retry mechanism was already in place, so that part just works. When joining a network with a lot of existing data, the sync process is now a lot smoother.  Bugfix: Established WebRTC connections would fall back to relay mode when they failed; now the connection is dropped, and peers will try to establish a new WebRTC session.  Bugfix: If a WebRTC connection could not be established, the connection would sometimes be left in an invalid state where it could not be used to send messages and Holochain wouldn't know to replace the connection to that peer.  Bugfix: Holochain was using the wrong value for DHT locations. This was leading to differences being observed in the DHT model between peers, who would then issue requests for the missing data. The data couldn't be found because the requested locations didn't match what was stored in the database. This led to DHT sync failing to proceed after some period of time. Note: updating a hApp from Holochain 0.5.4 or earlier might cause a first-run startup delay of a few seconds as the chunk hashes are recalculated.  Bugfix: Kitsune2 contains a fix for an out-of-bounds array access bug in the DHT model.   Shifted priorities for 0.6 <p>We’d originally planned to start the groundwork for <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/27?filterQuery=-epic%3A%22Epic%3A+Epic%22&amp;sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Coordinator+Updates&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">coordinator updates</a> (allowing a cell’s coordinator zomes to be updated) and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/27?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Membrane+proofs&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT read access gating via membrane proofs</a> in Holochain 0.6. We’re now going to push those to a later release in favour of focusing on warrants and other features that offer functionality that considers the strategically critical priorities of our partners.</p><p>These are the major themes of our work on 0.6:</p>  Resolving incomplete implementations of the unstable warrants feature, writing more tests, and marking the feature stable for all app and sys validation except chain forks.  Finishing the work that allows Holochain to block peers at the network level if they publish invalid data.  Making sure that the peer connection infrastructure is production-ready.  Continuing to build out the Wind Tunnel infrastructure and test suite.  <p>There are a few smaller themes; check out the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/27?filterQuery=-epic%3A%22Epic%3A+Epic%22+roadmap%3A%22Holochain+0.6%22&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">0.6 milestone on GitHub</a> for the full story.</p> Wind Tunnel updates <p>With many of the big gains in network performance and reliability realised in the 0.5 line and two new developers joining our team, we’ve freed up developer hours to focus on the Wind Tunnel test runner once again. Our big goal is: make it more usable and used. To this end, here are our plans:</p>  We want to run the tests on a regular, automated schedule to gather lots of data and track changes over Holochain’s development.  Rather than it being a requirement that a conductor is running alongside Wind Tunnel, Wind Tunnel itself will run and manage the Holochain conductor, allowing us to test conductors with different configs or feature flags within a scenario.  Wind Tunnel already collects metrics defined in each scenario, but we are expanding on this to collect metrics from the host OS, such as CPU usage, and from the conductor itself. This will give us insight into system load and how the conductor is performing during the scenarios.  More scenarios will be written, including complex ones involving malfunctioning agents and conductors with different configurations.  More dashboards are being created to display the new metrics and give us insight into how the scenarios perform from version to version. These will then make it easy for us to track how Holochain's performance envelope changes as new features are added, and also to make it easier to prioritize where to focus our optimization efforts.  We plan to run multiple scenarios on a single runner in parallel to make better use of the compute resources we have in our network. Along with adding more runners to the network, this will reduce the time it takes to run all of the tests, which will let us run the tests more often.  We’re creating an OS installation image for Wind Tunnel runners, allowing any spare computer to be used for Wind Tunnel testing. This will let people support Holochain by adding their compute power to our own network.   Holochain Horizon livestream <p>If you’re reading this, you probably care about more than just the state of Holochain development. We’re starting a series of livestreams that talk about things like where the Holochain Foundation is headed and what’s happening in the Holochain ecosystem.</p><p>The first one, a fireside chat between Eric Harris-Braun, the executive director of the Foundation, and Madelynn Martiniere, the Foundation’s newest council member and ecosystem lead, was on Wed 30 Jul at 15:00 UTC. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZZWCSzhYxA&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Watch the replay on YouTube</a>.</p> Next Dev Office Hours call: Wed 17 Sept <p>Join us at the next Dev Office Hours on Wednesday 17 Sept at 16:00 UTC — it’s the best place to hear the most up-to-date info about what we’ve been working on and ask your burning questions. We have these calls every two weeks on the <a href="https://discord.com/events/919686143581253632/1397611160949231719?ref=blog.holochain.org">DEV.HC Discord</a>, and the last one was full of great questions and conversations.

				  The shift to digital identity is accelerating and 2026 will be a critical year for the security printing and paper businesses. Now is the time to prepare.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>For decades, trust has been printed. Passports, ID cards, certificates, and other official, government-issued, and securitized documents have been how people prove who they are.&nbsp; The <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/destination-europe-unlock-markets-create-seamless-services-with-indicio-provens-eudi-wallet-integration/">European Digital Identity (EUDI)</a> wallet signals the end of the era for exclusive use of paper and plastic-based identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation, set to be mandated with new technologies rolled out within the next year, introduces a way for citizens, residents, and businesses to securely share digital identity data in the form of&nbsp; Verifiable Credentials across all EU member states; <a href="https://indicio.tech/banking-and-finance/">banking</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/digital-travel-credential/">travel</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/employee-access-management/">enterprises</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/governments-can-now-directly-issue-digital-passport-credentials-using-indicio-proven/">government</a> services are already piloting credential implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with many transformative technologies, change happens slowly and then very fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies that adapt quickly will stay relevant and leverage digital identity to deliver better products and services and innovate around seamless authentication and digital trust. Those that delay risk being left behind.</p>
<p>The question for companies in the secure document printing market is: how to not become obsolete when cryptography can make digital credentials every bit as trustworthy as the most secure physical document?</p>
<p>Just because the EUDI wallet framework architecture describes Verifiable Credentials, a digital identity technology that is interoperable, secure, and easy to use, the shift to digital identity doesn’t spell the end of physical documents.</p>
 Position for the great transition 
<p>The next few years will see a transition to verifiable digital identity and verifiable digital data and identity documents are the on-ramp. A key example: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specifications for Digital Travel Credentials start with self-derived credentials (DTC-1), which means people are able to extract the data in the passport’s RFID chip then comparing the image in the chip with a real-time liveness check of the person scanning the passport and issuing a digital credential version of the passport. The passport can then be validated to confirm the data came from an official government source. They’ll still need their physical passport when they travel but it will only be for backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step will be governments directly issuing digital passport credentials (following DTC-2 specifications) along with a person’s physical passport. The person will still need this physical passport when they travel.</p>
<p>In both cases, the digital passport credential will do all the heavy lifting in terms of identity authentication that enables the passenger to seamlessly check-in, access a lounge, cross a border, pick up a rental car, and check into their hotel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After these have been successfully implemented, we’ll move to a DTC-3 type credential —&nbsp;a fully digital passport where no physical back up is required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where are we in the transition process? Well, with Indicio Proven,<a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/governments-can-now-directly-issue-digital-passport-credentials-using-indicio-proven/"> governments are able to issue DTC-2 type credentials</a>. Expect to see them soon.</p>
 Driver’s licenses, diplomas 
<p>It’s not just passports that are being digitalized. The same liveness check and face-mapping that happens with DTCs can be done with government-issued documents, such as driver’s licences and Optical Character Recognition can read the data in the absence of the RFID chip. More US states are adopting Mobile Driver’s Licenses (mdoc/mDL), while the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en">European Union expects this standard to be implemented in Europe by 2030</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One bug in this rollout is that many mDL implementations don’t include the verification software businesses need to validate digital versions. These businesses still rely on physical driver’s licenses for customer identity authentication. If you want an mDL with simple, mobile, scalable verification <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/make-mobile-drivers-licenses-work-everywhere-easily-with-indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven has you covered</a>.</p>
<p>Diplomas, degrees, course transcripts and certificates are also being rendered as tamper-proof digital credentials through the <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges 3.0 specification</a>. While their physical counterparts are not secured in the same way as government-issued identity, the Open Badges 3.0 standard makes these documents impossible to fake, binds them to their rightful holders, and renders them instantly verifiable.</p>
<p>The key to managing the transition to digital identity documents is to enable transition to these documents. And this is where Indicio Proven is unique in the marketplace.</p>
 Indicio Proven: your bridge from the physical to digital 
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a> gives printing companies a direct path into the digital era by transforming secure physical documents into Verifiable Credentials, the same technology outlined in the EUDI specification. </p>
<p>With Proven, your physical products become anchors, on-ramps, or companions to digital credentials. Passports can be turned into DTCs, and more than 15,000 types of identity documents from 250+ countries and territories can be credentialized. Driver’s licenses and other official documents can also be validated, bound with biometrics, and issued as tamper-proof digital Verifiable Credentials that are:</p>
 
 Fraud-resistant and cryptographically secure 
 Combine with biometrics and stored on individual’s own device 
 Portable across borders 
 Instantly verifiable without complex checks 
 
<p>Proven is a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to extend your role in the EUDI realm today that helps your customers:</p>
 
 Save costs by reducing manual checks 
 Protect against fraud with secure digital credentials 
 Unlock new revenue by offering digital trust services alongside physical products 
 
<p>This technology also opens the door to offering new services in identity verification. When passports become Digital Passport Credentials and driver’s licenses become mobile driver’s licenses, organizations like financial institutions, airlines, and government agencies can verify and trust the information. Processes that were once inefficient and cumbersome—such as age verification, KYC, and cross-border travel—become seamless, premium services that create value and potential revenue streams every time they’re issued and verified.</p>
 The next chapter for printing and paper 
<p>Physical cards and certificates will not disappear overnight, but their primary value will shift. And that doesn’t mean paper-based industries are left out—your expertise in trust, security, and document integrity is more valuable than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proven makes this transition easy, enabling your business to grow as identity goes digital. With Indicio, you can carry that expertise into the digital age and position your company at the center of the EUDI wallet revolution.</p>
<p>The world is moving from paper to Proven. The opportunity is here—are you ready to take it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used a crypto wallet like MetaMask, you’ve used an externally owned account (EOA). It’s a simple pair of keys: a public address that acts as your identity and a private key that proves you own it. This model is powerful but rigid, putting the entire burden of security and complexity on the user. Lose your seed phrase? Your funds are gone forever. Find transactions confusing? The ecosystem has little flexibility to&nbsp;help.</p><p>A new standard is emerging to solve these problems, moving us from rigid key-based wallets to programmable, user-friendly interfaces. The answer is smart accounts.</p> What is a smart&nbsp;account? <p>A smart account (or smart wallet) is not controlled by a single private key. Instead, it is a smart contract that acts as your wallet. This shift from a key-based account to a contract-based account is revolutionary because smart contracts are programmable. They can be designed to manage assets and execute transactions based on customizable logic, enabling features that were previously impossible.</p><p>This transition is powered by account abstraction (AA), a concept that “abstracts away” the rigid requirements of EOAs, allowing smart contracts to initiate transactions. While the idea isn’t new, it recently gained mainstream traction thanks to a pivotal Ethereum standard: EIP-4337.</p> EIP-4337 (the game&nbsp;changer) <p>EIP-4337: Account Abstraction via Entry Point Contract achieved something critical: it brought native smart account capabilities to Ethereum without requiring changes to the core protocol. Instead of a hard fork, it introduced a higher-layer system that operates alongside the main&nbsp;network.</p> Here’s how it&nbsp;works:   UserOperations: You don’t send a traditional transaction. Instead, your smart account creates a UserOperation — a structured message that expresses your&nbsp;intent.  Bundlers: These network participants (such as block builders or validators) collect UserOperation objects, verify their validity, and bundle them into a single transaction.  Entry Point Contract: A single, standardized smart contract acts as a gatekeeper. It validates and executes these bundled operations according to the rules defined in each user’s smart&nbsp;account.  <p>This system is secure, decentralized, and incredibly flexible.</p> Other key proposals (EIP-3074 and EIP-7702) <p>The journey to account abstraction has involved other proposals, each with different approaches.</p>  EIP-3074: This proposal aimed to allow existing EOAs to delegate control to smart contracts (called invokers). While simpler in some ways, it raised security concerns due to the power given to invoker contracts. It has since been&nbsp;paused.  EIP-7702: Proposed by Vitalik Buterin, this upgrade would allow an EOA to temporarily grant transaction permissions to a smart contract. It offers a more elegant and secure model than EIP-3074 and may complement — rather than replace — the infrastructure built around EIP-4337.  <p>For now, EIP-4337 is the live standard that developers and wallets are adopting.</p> Why smart accounts&nbsp;matter <p>The real value of smart accounts lies in the user experience and security improvements they&nbsp;enable.</p>  Gas abstraction: Apps can pay transaction fees for their users or allow payment via credit card, removing a major barrier to&nbsp;entry.  Social recovery: Lose your device? Instead of a single seed phrase, you can assign “guardians” — other devices or trusted contacts — to help you recover&nbsp;access.  Batch transactions: Perform multiple actions in one click. For example, approve a token and swap it in a single transaction instead of&nbsp;two.  Session keys: Grant limited permissions to dApps. A game could perform actions on your behalf without being able to withdraw your&nbsp;assets.  Multi-factor security: Require multiple confirmations for high-value transactions, just like in traditional banking.   The future is programmable <p>Smart accounts represent a fundamental shift in how we interact with blockchains. They replace the “all-or-nothing” key model with programmable, flexible, and user-focused design. Major wallets like Safe, Argent, and Braavos are already leading the way, and infrastructure from providers like Stackup and Biconomy is making it easier for developers to integrate these features.</p><p>We’re moving beyond the era of the seed phrase. The future of Web3 wallets is smart, secure, and designed for everyone.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/how-smart-accounts-are-reinventing-the-web3-wallet-174364b1f038">How Smart Accounts Are Reinventing The Web3 Wallet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Why competitive intelligence often fails in messaging 



<p>I’ve seen it firsthand: competitor battlecards stacking up in shared drives, analyst PDFs collecting dust, and persona research tucked into charts that never see daylight. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the noise and unsure where to even start. I’ve been there more times than I’d like to admit. The problem isn’t a lack of data; it’s the ability to digest it and translate it into messaging that actually differentiates. Without that step, teams fall back on the same empty claims: “innovative,” “customer-first,” “the most trusted.” Buyers tune it out. Competitive intelligence only works when it becomes narrative. The raw material exists: persona insights, competitor positioning, feature data – but without the right framework, it collapses into noise. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2025/04/01/the-evolution-of-b2b-buying-behavior-and-how-the-experience-must-adapt/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">83% of B2B buyers now expect personalization on par with consumer experiences</a>, which means vague promises no longer earn attention.</p>



 The three pillars of messaging that stand out 



 Buyer persona insights 



<p>Great messaging doesn’t start with features; it starts with people. Early on, I wrote messaging as if “the buyer” was a monolith. It fell flat. A CMO trying to differentiate a brand doesn’t think like a sales leader trying to speed up onboarding. Persona-based marketing insights can surface those distinctions, but the job of messaging is to speak to those specific goals and pain points, not to the broadest common denominator.</p>



 Competitor messaging &amp; positioning 



<p>Copycat messaging is the silent killer of differentiation. Throw the first stone if you’ve never obsessed over a competitor’s launch while paying too little attention to how they positioned their value. Competitive benchmarking is useful, but not if it leads you to recycle the same message with a “we do it better” twist. The real win comes from understanding where you truly differentiate and telling the story of why that matters in the first place.</p>



 Feature differentiation that resonates 



<p>I used to think listing every capability would convince buyers, but it never did. Features only matter when they connect to buyer outcomes that feel tangible. In fraud prevention, that might mean reducing chargeback losses by 40%. In cybersecurity, it might mean cutting breach detection time in half. The point is not to list what your product does but to anchor why it matters in the buyer’s world, and only nerd about the specifics once you have their undivided attention.</p>



 Generic vs persona-informed messaging 



<p>To show the difference, here’s a snapshot of how messaging shifts when intelligence is applied. Generic copy focuses on features and broad claims, while persona-informed messaging uses ICP data and persona pain points to connect with specific buyers.</p>



 



DomainGeneric MessagePersona-Informed MessagePersona ExampleFraud Prevention“We help enterprises stop fraud before it happens by detecting suspicious activity, flagging risky transactions, and protecting customer accounts. Our platform is designed to keep your business safe and secure.”<br>“You’re responsible for revenue protection across global sales flows, which means chargebacks and payment fraud land on your desk. Teams like yours cut chargeback losses by 40% with real-time fraud alerts that protect revenue without slowing deals. Buyers expect both outcomes: silent protection and measurable margin impact.”<br>VP of Sales, BDR LeaderFinancial Crimes Compliance (AML/KYC)“We help compliance teams stay audit-ready with AML and KYC tools that reduce risk, cut down on false positives, and keep your business aligned with evolving regulations.”“As Chief Compliance Officer, you know false positives are the hidden tax on your team. Cutting them by 50 percent means analysts focus on true risk while you stay audit-ready against FATF and DOJ scrutiny. Clients report faster SAR filing cycles and stronger exam outcomes that regulators can see.”Chief Compliance OfficerCybersecurity / Threat IntelligenceWe help enterprises stay ahead of account takeover, session hijacking, and phishing attacks with advanced detection and monitoring that safeguard sensitive data and protect customer accounts.”“Your bottleneck probably isn’t a lack of MFA; it’s gaps in mobile session integrity and weak recovery bindings. Leading platforms now combine FIDO2 passkeys, device certificates, runtime attestation, and behavioral biometrics into a single API. Results often show 90–99% reductions in ATO flows and deployments measured in weeks, not quarters, while fitting directly into CI/CD pipelines.”CISOTrust &amp; Safety (Age Assurance, Platform Integrity)“We help platforms create safe online spaces by stopping fake accounts, preventing underage sign-ups, and protecting users from harmful activity. Our solution builds trust across your community.”“You’ve grown marketplaces quickly, but fake accounts and underage signups erode trust as fast as growth builds it. Trust &amp; Safety leaders block fraudulent accounts at scale, improving conversion while lifting NPS. Clients see measurable drops in fake account creation alongside sustained growth.”<br>Head of Trust &amp; Safety<br>Risk Management“We help companies manage third-party risk by identifying potential vulnerabilities, monitoring vendor compliance, and providing visibility across your supply chain.”“Your mandate is to catch vendor risk before it turns into tomorrow’s crisis. Risk leaders using continuous monitoring spot supplier red flags weeks earlier. That foresight prevents compliance failures and costly breaches that would otherwise reach the boardroom.”<br>CRO, Risk Manager



 



<p>This table turns the theory into practice: with competitive intelligence in play, messaging shifts from broad and forgettable to precise and compelling.</p>



<p>The challenge, of course, is scale. Tailoring a handful of persona-informed messages is one thing. Refreshing them continuously across dozens of campaigns, competitors, and markets is another. That’s where <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03Jw8LW0">AI-enhanced intelligence platforms</a> become indispensable. By monitoring live market signals, competitor narratives, and persona insights, AI can help us surface fresh message updates, stress-test positioning, and keep playbooks aligned with the market, so teams never slip back into generic messaging.</p>



 A framework for refreshing messaging without reinventing the wheel 



<p>High-performing teams do not wait for annual off-sites to rethink their messaging. They run refreshes as an ongoing discipline. So, how do we actually keep messaging fresh without burning cycles? Here is a practical process that has worked for us:</p>



 
 Collect signals continuously – competitor launches, persona survey data, market shifts. 



 Map signals to differentiation – identify where buyer priorities intersect with unique strengths. 



 Stress-test narratives – run them through sales conversations, campaign pilots, and post-call analytics. 



 Refresh, don’t rewrite – evolve messaging every few weeks, not every few quarters.<br> 
 



<p>The result is messaging that stays alive, tuned to the market, and sharper than the competition.</p>



 How leading teams operationalize competitive intelligence 



<p>It’s one thing to know the process, another to make it work at scale. The best GTM teams operationalize competitive intelligence through three capabilities:</p>



 1. Always-on market signals 



<p>Static PDFs cannot keep up with dynamic markets. Teams that win track real-time signals like funding rounds, regulatory shifts, competitor campaigns, and feed them straight into campaign planning.</p>



 2. Persona-level insights at scale 



<p>Instead of treating personas as theater, leading teams embed real-time buyer insights into campaigns and sales workflows. Every refresh reflects what buyers are actually thinking now, not last year.</p>



 3. Embedded intelligence in workflows 



<p>Intelligence only works if it lives where teams work: Slack alerts pushing industry shifts in real time, SEO content built on market truth, email campaigns aligned with buyer signals, and sales calls armed with live AI intelligence. Intelligence becomes actionable in the moment, not theoretical.</p>



 The challenge of messaging in niche markets 



<p>As adoption grows, so does the data: companies using competitive intelligence report a 15% boost in revenue growth. Platforms like <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03Jw8LW0">Link</a> are built to deliver these capabilities, from event monitoring and perpetual surveys to dynamic playbooks and post-call analytics. The real challenge is not more data, but the right data — intelligence that is specific enough to your market to make messaging credible and differentiated.</p>



<p>And this is where it gets tricky in niche markets. Sure, we can create a neat competitive battlecard, but what do we actually put on it if I don’t understand how the ICP is behaving in the real world? We can send a well-designed email, but if the target is a cybersecurity leader, they might care more about an upcoming TPRM webinar than a case study from the banking sector. The reality is that without specific, contextual intelligence, even polished campaigns miss the mark without the right segmentation.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, buyers don’t want platitudes; they want proof. In specialized markets, the cost of undifferentiated messaging isn’t just lost deals, it’s lost trust and stalled growth.</p>



 Key Takeaways 



 
 Competitive intelligence fails when it sits in decks and PDFs. It only creates value when it fuels differentiated narratives buyers actually hear. 



 Messaging that stands out comes from three things: persona insights, competitor positioning, and outcomes buyers can measure. 



 Refreshing messaging is not a one-off exercise. The teams that win treat it as an ongoing discipline. 



 Intelligence has to live where teams work: in Slack alerts, sales calls, campaigns, and content, so it becomes actionable in the moment. 



 In niche markets, buyers don’t want platitudes, they want proof. Miss that, and you lose both deals and trust.

<p>Searching for a great story to dive into without spending a dime? You’re in luck! There are numerous legal and high-quality platforms where you can read comics online for free, from classic superheroes to indie webcomics. This guide will help you discover the best websites and apps, providing a gateway to a world of endless adventures right at your fingertips.</p>



 What to Look for in Sites for Read Comics Online For Free 



<p>When seeking out the best sites to read comics online for free, you should prioritize legality, content variety, and user experience. A reputable site will either offer comics that are in the public domain or have clear partnerships with publishers, like Marvel, DC, or VIZ Media. Look for a wide range of genres, from superhero to indie and manga, and a clean, easy-to-navigate interface. Features like a smooth reader, infinite scroll, and mobile-friendly design enhance the reading experience. Avoid sites with excessive pop-ups or suspicious download prompts, as they are often a sign of illegal content.</p>

 Free vs. Paid Read Comics Online for Free Sites: What’s the Difference? 



FeatureFree comic sitesPaid Comic Sites (e.g., Marvel Unlimited)Content LibraryOften a limited or rotating selection of free issues, public domain comics, or new chapters.Access to a vast, deep back catalog of thousands of comics from a specific publisher or across multiple publishers.New ReleasesNew chapters are often released on a delay or as part of a limited-time promotional offer.Subscribers get access to new issues much faster, sometimes as soon as 30 days after their physical release.User ExperienceCan be ad-supported, with pop-ups and a less refined reading interface.Generally ad-free with a clean, user-friendly interface and advanced reader features.LegalityLegal sites offer public domain works or content with publisher partnerships (e.g., Webtoon, VIZ Media). Other sites may host unauthorized content.Typically fully legal platforms with licenses from publishers, ensuring creators are compensated.CostCompletely free, making it an excellent option for casual readers or those on a budget.Requires a monthly or annual subscription fee, offering a “buffet” model for avid readers.OwnershipYou do not “own” the content and your access is tied to the platform’s availability.You have access as long as your subscription is active, but you typically don’t own digital files.



 Tips for Safe and Enjoyable Read Comics Online for Free 



<p>For a safe and enjoyable comic reading experience, it’s crucial to be mindful of both digital security and your personal reading habits.</p>



 
 Stick to Legal and Reputable Sites: Always use well-known platforms like those listed previously. These sites have the proper licenses and ensure that creators are compensated. Avoid sites that feel suspicious, have a large number of pop-up ads, or offer a huge library of copyrighted material for free without a clear business model. 



 Be Cautious of Phishing and Malware: Illegal streaming or download sites can expose you to security risks. Watch out for suspicious download buttons or prompts to install an app. Always be skeptical of any site that asks for personal information, credit card details, or a log-in to a third-party service without a clear, trustworthy reason. 
 









 
 Optimize Your Reading Environment: A comfortable reading experience can make a huge difference. Use a device with a screen large enough to view the art clearly, and adjust the brightness to prevent eye strain. Many apps and websites have a “dark mode” or “night mode” setting that can be helpful for reading in low light. 



 Understand Reading Order: Some comic series, especially from major publishers like Marvel and DC, can have complex reading orders that jump between different series and events. If you’re reading a major title, a quick search for a “reading guide” for that specific storyline can help you follow the narrative without getting lost. 



 Explore Different Genres and Art Styles: Don’t limit yourself to just one type of comic. The world of comics is incredibly diverse, from superhero adventures to slice-of-life, horror, and historical fiction. Try different genres and explore works by various artists to find what resonates with you. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Thanks to the internet, accessing a vast universe of stories is easier than ever. Whether you’re a fan of superheroes, manga, or indie tales, you have plenty of legal and free options to choose from. By sticking to reputable platforms like Webtoon and Hoopla, you can enjoy a safe and high-quality reading experience while supporting the creative industry. So, go ahead – pick a site from our list and start your next comic book adventure today.</p>

 A history lesson from the cloud 



<p>To understand how incentives can blindside us, let’s revisit the cloud computing boom. You remember that, right? “Save all the money! Get rid of your datacenter! Cloud computing ftw!”</p>



<p>In 2021, Sarah Wang and Martin Casado of Andreessen Horowitz published “<a href="https://a16z.com/the-cost-of-cloud-a-trillion-dollar-paradox/">The Cost of Cloud: A Trillion-Dollar Paradox</a>.” They showed how cloud services, while indispensable for speed and agility, became a drag on profitability at scale. Dropbox famously repatriated workloads back from public cloud and saved $75 million over two years — a shift that doubled their gross margins from 33% to 67%. CrowdStrike and Zscaler adopted hybrid approaches for similar reasons.</p>



<p>The takeaway: Early incentives reward adoption. But when the bills grow large enough, cost discipline suddenly becomes a board-level issue. By then, inefficiency is already baked into operations.</p>



<p>AI energy use is following the same arc. Vendors and enterprises alike are celebrating adoption, but the hidden costs are waiting to surface.</p>



 The incentives for vendors 



<p>AI vendors want mass adoption, and their incentives reflect that. They’ll emphasize efficiency gains — like Gemini’s 33-fold reduction in energy per query from 2024 to 2025, according to their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/measuring-the-environmental-impact-of-ai-inference">recent report</a> — but those are selective disclosures.</p>



<p>As the MIT Tech Review story “In a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses” pointed out, disclosures become marketing tools without standardized metrics. Vendors reveal what flatters them, not necessarily what helps customers make better choices.</p>



<p>And the race to ship bigger, more capable models only deepens this misalignment. Scale brings revenue. The energy, water, and carbon costs? Those are someone else’s problem.</p>



 The incentives for enterprises 



<p>Enterprises often don’t see the full picture either. A cloud invoice hides the per-prompt costs. IAM and security teams grant permissions to agents, but they don’t own the sustainability budget. Sustainability teams, meanwhile, don’t have visibility into permissions and entitlements.</p>



<p>The result: over-provisioning goes unnoticed. AI agents are allowed to “just run,” and every permissioned action quietly consumes resources. Those costs add up, but they land in someone else’s ledger, often long after the decisions were made.</p>



<p>This is the same organizational mismatch cloud adoption created: IT ops pays the bill, developers get the flexibility, and the CFO finds out later. AI is just the next chapter.</p>



 Incentives and regulation 



<p>Here’s where things start to change. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting isn’t optional anymore; regulators are giving incentives real teeth.</p>



 
 United States: The SEC’s new climate disclosure rule requires large public companies to report greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to comply has already resulted in multimillion-dollar fines for ESG misstatements, like <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/dws-fined-19m-by-sec-over-esg-mis-statements-20230925">Deutsche Bank’s $19M settlement</a>. 



 Europe: The EU’s <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive_en">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive</a> (CSRD) sets steep penalties. In Germany, fines can reach €10 million or 5% of turnover. In France, executives risk prison time for obstructing disclosures. 



 Australia: Directors must certify sustainability data as part of <a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/companies/company-financial-reports/">financial filings</a>. Failure to comply can trigger civil penalties in the hundreds of millions, with individuals personally liable for up to AUD 1.565 million. 
 



<p>None of this is about fearmongering. (OK, maybe it’s a little bit of fearmongering in the hope of catching your attention.) It’s also a reality. Boards are now directly accountable for climate and resource disclosures. AI usage may feel “small” at the per-prompt level, but at enterprise scale, it becomes part of that regulatory picture.</p>



 Where identity comes in 



<p>So where does identity fit?</p>



<p>Every AI-agent action isn’t just a governance event; it’s also a consumption event. Permissions are no longer just about who can do what. They’re also about what we’re willing to pay, financially and environmentally, for them to do it.</p>



<p>Standing access matters here, too. A human user with unused entitlements is a risk; an AI with broad entitlements is a resource leak. It will happily keep churning until someone tells it to stop — and by then the costs have already piled up.</p>



<p>Imagine if your audit logs evolved to show not just “who accessed what,” but “how much energy and water those actions consumed.” It sounds futuristic, but sustainability reporting is heading in that direction. IAM teams may find themselves pulled into ESG conversations whether they want to be or not.</p>



 Runtime governance as sustainability 



<p>Earlier, I argued that runtime governance is essential when AIs can act faster than human oversight cycles. Here’s the sustainability angle: runtime checks can throttle not just security risks, but waste.</p>



 
 Deny agents the ability to hammer a system with brute-force permutations. 



 Flag actions that consume far more resources than typical queries. 



 Revoke unnecessary entitlements before they become both a risk and an expense. 
 



<p>Governance is shifting from “is this allowed?” to “is this worth it?”</p>



 Bridging past lessons with today’s challenges 



<p>The hidden costs of the cloud were supposed to teach us that efficiency ignored eventually becomes inefficiency entrenched. I’m not convinced people and organizations have learned that lesson, but regardless, AI is repeating that story, with energy, water, and carbon as the currencies.</p>



<p>Like cloud spend, AI resource usage may start small, but it scales faster than oversight cycles. And when regulations demand transparency, boards will want answers.</p>



<p>Identity leaders are uniquely positioned here. Permissions are the gate between an agent’s intent and its actions. Expanding the governance lens to include consumption could help organizations stay ahead of both the bills and the regulators.</p>



 Putting it together 



<p>So let’s put this together:</p>



 
 Vendors are incentivized by adoption and scale, not efficiency. 



 Enterprises have silos that hide true costs. 



 Regulators are introducing real penalties for climate and resource misstatements. 



 Identity teams are sitting at the chokepoint, granting permissions that double as consumption choices. 
 



<p>The shift isn’t about turning identity professionals into sustainability officers. It’s about recognizing that incentives travel with permissions. And when permissions scale through AI, the hidden costs travel with them.</p>



<p>So here’s my question for you: have you seen incentives around AI use in your organization, good or bad? And if so, how did those incentives shape the choices your teams made?</p>



<p>Because incentives aren’t just a policy issue or a compliance box. They’re the difference between governance, which you can explain to your board, and governance, which you only notice when the bill or the fine arrives.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:29] Hi everyone, and welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. I’m Heather Flanagan, and today we’re going to talk about something that’s only just starting to make the headlines: what happens when AI agents run wild—and who actually ends up footing the bill.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: it’s probably not the vendors themselves, and it’s probably not who you think inside your own organizations either.</p>



<p>[00:00:53] In this episode, we’ll explore:</p>



 
 The incentives driving AI adoption 



 The role of identity in hidden costs 



 The growing regulatory landscape around sustainability 
 



 



 Setting the Stage 



<p>[00:01:04] What inspired today’s conversation is a recent Google report that finally revealed some long-awaited data: how much energy a single AI prompt consumes.</p>



<p>[00:01:20] Their findings? The median Gemini prompt uses about 0.24 watt hours of electricity.</p>



<p>[00:01:28] To put it in perspective:</p>



 
 That’s like running your microwave for one second, plus a few drops of water for cooling. 



 At first glance, it seems tiny. But at scale, millions of these “drops in the ocean” can eventually flood entire continents. 
 



<p>[00:01:46] The real story isn’t about that single number. Instead, it’s about the incentives behind those numbers—who benefits, who pays, and how those dynamics shape AI deployment.</p>



 



 Lessons from the Cloud 



<p>[00:01:57] To understand today’s AI landscape, let’s rewind to the early days of cloud computing. Remember the pitch? “Save money, get rid of your data center—cloud computing for the win.”</p>



<p>[00:02:20] But by 2021, Sarah Wang and Martin Casado at Andreessen Horowitz highlighted the Trillion Dollar Paradox:</p>



 
 Cloud was amazing for speed and agility. 



 Yet at scale, it dragged on profitability. 
 



<p>[00:02:30] Dropbox learned this firsthand, repatriating workloads from the public cloud and saving $75 million over two years—doubling their margins in the process.</p>



<p>[00:02:51] The key lesson? Early incentives reward adoption. But once costs balloon, discipline becomes a board-level issue.</p>



<p>[00:03:10] AI is following the same arc. We’re in the “woohoo adoption” phase now, but hidden costs are waiting to catch up.</p>



 



 Vendor Incentives 



<p>[00:03:24] Let’s start with the incentives for LLM vendors. These are crystal clear: encourage mass adoption.</p>



<p>[00:03:33] Vendors emphasize efficiency gains. Google bragged about a 33-fold reduction in energy per query between 2024 and 2025.</p>



<p>[00:03:43] Sounds impressive. But disclosures are:</p>



 
 Not standardized 



 Highly selective 



 Designed to flatter the vendor, not inform customers 
 



<p>[00:03:53] Meanwhile, the race for bigger, flashier, more capable models continues. The revenue comes in, but the energy, water, and carbon costs are left as someone else’s problem.</p>



 



 Enterprise Incentives 



<p>[00:04:09] For enterprises, the picture is murkier. Why? Because:</p>



 
 Cloud invoices hide the per prompt cost. 



 IAM and security teams grant permissions but don’t own the sustainability budget. 



 Sustainability teams lack visibility into entitlements. 
 



<p>[00:04:34] The result?</p>



 
 Over-provisioning goes unnoticed. 



 AI agents run unchecked. 



 Bills land on someone’s desk long after the fact—often someone who had no say in granting permissions. 
 



<p>[00:04:58] This is déjà vu from the cloud era. Ops pays the bill, developers enjoy flexibility, and the CFO discovers the hit too late.</p>



 



 Regulators Enter the Chat 



<p>[00:05:03] Unlike the early cloud days, regulators are already watching. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting is now mandatory in many regions.</p>



<p>[00:05:15] Examples include:</p>



 
 United States: SEC Climate Disclosure Rule, with fines already issued (e.g., Deutsche Bank’s $19M settlement). 



 Europe: Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), with penalties up to €10 million or 5% of turnover. 



 France: Executives can face prison time for obstructing disclosures. 



 Australia: Civil penalties can reach hundreds of millions, with directors personally liable. 
 



<p>[00:06:20] This isn’t fearmongering—it’s reality. Boards are accountable, and one AI prompt may seem trivial, but multiplied across millions of queries, it becomes a regulatory reporting item.</p>



 



 Where Identity Comes In 



<p>[00:06:38] Every AI agent action is more than a governance event—it’s also a consumption event.</p>



 
 Permissions = not just who can do what, but what we’re willing to pay financially and environmentally. 



 An unused human entitlement is a risk. An AI with broad entitlements is a resource leak that runs until stopped. 
 



<p>[00:07:15] Imagine if audit logs didn’t just say who accessed what, but also recorded how much energy and water were consumed.</p>



<p>[00:07:24] That may sound futuristic, but sustainability reporting is moving that way. IAM teams could soon be pulled into ESG discussions—whether they feel it’s their role or not.</p>



 



 Governance Shifts 



<p>[00:07:37] Governance isn’t just about security anymore. With AI, it’s about balancing risk and resource consumption.</p>



 
 Runtime checks can throttle wasteful AI actions. 



 Agents can be denied brute-force or high-cost queries. 



 Entitlements can be revoked before they pile up into risks—or expenses. 
 



<p>[00:08:07] Governance now asks not only “Is this allowed?” but also “Is this worth it?”</p>



 



 History Repeats Itself 



<p>[00:08:14] Cloud should have taught us that ignored inefficiency becomes entrenched inefficiency. Once it’s embedded in infrastructure, it’s painfully hard to extract.</p>



<p>[00:08:38] AI is repeating that story—with water, energy, and carbon as the new currencies.</p>



<p>[00:08:54] When regulators demand transparency, boards will expect clear, defensible answers. And that’s where identity leaders can step up.</p>



<p>[00:09:01] Permissions sit at the choke point between agent intent and agent action. Expanding governance to include consumption metrics gives organizations a head start on both the bills and regulatory scrutiny.</p>



 



 Bringing It All Together 



<p>[00:09:16] To recap:</p>



 
 Vendors chase adoption and scale, not efficiency. 



 Enterprises operate in silos that hide true costs. 



 Regulators are introducing significant penalties for ESG misstatements. 



 Identity teams control permissions, which now double as consumption risks. 
 



<p>[00:09:41] IAM professionals don’t need to become sustainability officers. But they must recognize that incentives travel with permissions—and when AI scales, costs scale too.</p>



<p>[00:09:57] So here’s the key question:<br>Have you seen incentives around AI use in your organization—good or bad? And how are those incentives shaping your team’s decisions?</p>



<p>Because incentives aren’t just about compliance checkboxes. They’re the difference between proactive governance, you can explain to your board, and reactive governance, you only notice when the bill—or the fine—lands on your desk.</p>

<p>Thinking about adding Quarden Token to your crypto portfolio? You’re in the right place. This guide is designed for beginners, breaking down the process of buying Quarden Token into simple, manageable steps. We’ll cover everything you need to know, from setting up a secure crypto wallet to making your first purchase, so you can start your journey with confidence.</p>



 What Is Quarden Token? 



<p>Quarden Token (QDT) is the native cryptocurrency of the Quarden platform, an innovative digital marketplace that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate secure and accessible trading for both individuals and businesses. The token plays a central role in the platform’s ecosystem, enabling a range of functionalities, from streamlined transactions to reduced fees. By using the Quarden Token, users can engage in a new era of digital commerce that is efficient, transparent, and secure.</p>









 Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Quarden Token 



<p>Acquiring Quarden Token (QDT) can be done through a few different methods, but the most common for beginners is via a centralized exchange (CEX) or a decentralized exchange (DEX). Here is a general step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process.</p>



 Step 1: Choose a Crypto Exchange 



<p>The first step is to decide where you will buy the token.</p>



 
 Centralized Exchanges (CEXs): These are platforms like Binance or KuCoin. They are user-friendly, offer a simple interface, and typically allow you to buy crypto with fiat currency (like USD or EUR) via credit/debit card or bank transfer. Check if Quarden Token (QDT) is listed on your preferred exchange. 



 Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): These exchanges, like Uniswap, allow you to trade directly from your crypto wallet without an intermediary. This method offers greater privacy but can be more complex for beginners and requires you to first own a base cryptocurrency (like Ethereum or another token on the same blockchain). 
 



 Step 2: Create an account and verify Your Identity 



<p>If you choose a CEX, you’ll need to create an account. This usually involves:</p>



 
 Providing an email address and creating a secure password. 



 Completing a “Know Your Customer” (KYC) verification process, which often requires you to upload a photo of your ID. This is a standard security measure. 
 









 Step 3: Fund Your Account 



<p>Once your account is set up and verified, you need to add funds.</p>



 
 CEX: You can deposit fiat currency using a credit/debit card or a bank transfer. 



 DEX: You will need to first purchase a base cryptocurrency (like ETH) from a CEX or another source and then send it to your crypto wallet. 
 



 Step 4: Buy Quarden Token (QDT) 



<p>Now you’re ready to make your purchase.</p>



 
 On a CEX: Navigate to the trading section of the exchange. Search for the Quarden Token (QDT) trading pair (e.g., QDT/USDT or QDT/ETH). Enter the amount you wish to buy and execute the trade. 



 On a DEX: Connect your crypto wallet to the DEX. Select your base currency and the Quarden Token (QDT). You may need to manually add the token’s contract address to the DEX if it’s not listed by default. Be extremely cautious and always get the official contract address from the Quarden website or a reliable source like CoinMarketCap to avoid scams. Once selected, confirm the swap. 
 



 Step 5: Store Your Quarden Token Securely 



<p>After purchasing, it’s highly recommended to transfer your Quarden Token to a secure, self-custody crypto wallet (like Trust Wallet or MetaMask). Leaving your tokens on an exchange exposes them to potential security risks. “Not your keys, not your coins” is a well-known adage in the crypto world, emphasizing the importance of holding your own private keys.</p>



 Tools and Platforms for Buying Quarden Token 



<p>To buy Quarden Token (QDT), you will need to use a crypto exchange and a secure wallet.() Here are some common platforms and tools you might use in the process:</p>



 Crypto Exchanges 



 
 Centralized Exchanges (CEXs): These are platforms that facilitate trading and are often the most straightforward option for beginners. They act as an intermediary, holding your funds in an account. Some of the most popular CEXs that may support Quarden Token (QDT) or other tokens you can use to buy them include: 



 Binance: One of the world’s largest exchanges, known for a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and a user-friendly interface. 



 KuCoin: A popular exchange with a large selection of altcoins, including new or less-common tokens. 



 Gate.io: A robust platform that often lists new projects and has a wide range of trading pairs. 



 Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): These platforms allow for direct peer-to-peer trading without an intermediary. You connect your personal wallet and swap tokens. DEXs are a key part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. 



 Uniswap: A leading DEX on the Ethereum network, often in the first place new tokens are available for trading. 
 









 Crypto Wallets 



<p>A crypto wallet is essential for securely storing your Quarden Token after you purchase it. Wallets can be categorized as “hot” (connected to the internet) or “cold” (offline).</p>



 
 Software Wallets (Hot Wallets): These are applications you can install on your computer or smartphone. They are convenient for frequent trading. 



 MetaMask: A widely used wallet, particularly for the Ethereum network and its tokens. 



 Trust Wallet: A popular mobile-first wallet known for its security and support for a vast number of cryptocurrencies. 



 Coinbase Wallet: A self-custody wallet that is a separate product from the Coinbase exchange, allowing you to manage your own private keys. 



 Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallets): These are physical devices that store your private keys offline, providing the highest level of security against hacks and malware. 



 Ledger Nano X: A highly-rated hardware wallet that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies. 



 Trezor Model T: Another top-tier hardware wallet known for its security features. 
 









<p>Always verify that the wallet you choose is compatible with the blockchain on which Quarden Token (QDT) operates and that you are downloading the official app or software from a trusted source.</p>



 Tips for Safe Quarden Token Purchases 



<p>As with any cryptocurrency, exercising caution and following best practices is essential for securing your investment in Quarden Token. Crypto space, while full of innovation, is also a target for scams and fraudulent activities.</p>



 
 Verify the Official Contract Address 
 



<p>Before making any transaction on a decentralized exchange (DEX), double-check that you have the correct and official contract address for Quarden Token (QDT). Scammers often create fake tokens with similar names to trick users. Always get the address from the official Quarden website or a trusted, reputable source like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.</p>



 
 Use Secure Wallets 
 



<p>After purchasing your tokens, it is strongly recommended to move them off the exchange and into a secure, self-custody wallet. For long-term storage, a hardware wallet (cold storage) offers the highest level of security as it keeps your private keys offline.</p>



 
 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 
 



<p>Always enable 2FA on any exchange account or platform you use. This adds an extra layer of security, making it much more difficult for an unauthorized person to access your account, even if they have your password.</p>









 
 Beware of Phishing and Scams 
 



<p>Be skeptical of unsolicited messages, emails, or social media posts promising giveaways or special investment opportunities related to Quarden Token. These are almost always scams. Never share your private keys, seed phrases, or passwords with anyone.</p>



 
 Do Your Own Research (DYOR) 
 



<p>The most important tip is to conduct thorough research. Understand the project’s whitepaper, its use case, and the team behind it. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose, and be aware of the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Buying Quarden Token (QDT) can be a straightforward process once you understand the key steps involved. By following this guide, from selecting a secure exchange to storing your tokens safely in a crypto wallet, you can confidently add QDT to your portfolio. As with any investment, always prioritize security and conduct your own research to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Real estate professionals face rising AML scrutiny across markets. This article breaks down identity verification, source of funds, and beneficial ownership rules in the U.S., Canada, UK, EU, and Australia – and shows how iComply helps automate compliance across agents, lawyers, and lenders.</p>
 
 Real estate is a prime target for financial crime. High-value transactions, opaque ownership structures, and limited oversight have made the sector vulnerable to money laundering worldwide. 
<p>From regulators to investigative journalists, scrutiny is intensifying, compliance expectations are evolving. Brokers, lawyers, developers, mortgage professionals, and title companies all have a role to play.</p>
 
 Shifting AML Expectations in Real Estate 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, state real estate commissions 
 Requirements: Geographic targeting orders (GTOs), beneficial ownership reporting (CTA), SARs, and KYC for buyers and entities 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulators: FINTRAC, provincial real estate councils 
 Requirements: KYC, source of funds verification, PEP/sanctions screening, STRs, and compliance program requirements (as reinforced by the Cullen Commission) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulators: HMRC, FCA (for lenders), SRA (for law firms) 
 Requirements: Client due diligence, UBO checks, transaction monitoring, and compliance under MLR 2017 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National AML authorities under AMLD6 
 Requirements: Risk-based customer due diligence, UBO transparency, STRs, and GDPR-aligned reporting 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC (legislation pending for real estate-specific coverage) 
 Requirements: AML risk management for law firms, lenders, and trust accounts; expected expansion to include property professionals 
 
 
 Real Estate-Specific Risk Factors 
<p>1. Complex Ownership Structures<br>
Use of shell companies, nominees, and trusts can obscure true buyers.</p>
<p>2. Source of Funds Obscurity<br>
Large cash deposits or offshore funding require enhanced scrutiny.</p>
<p>3. Multi-Party Transactions<br>
Buyers, sellers, agents, lawyers, lenders, and developers often use disconnected systems.</p>
<p>4. Regulatory Patchwork<br>
Requirements vary by jurisdiction and professional role.</p>
 
 How iComply Helps Real Estate Professionals Stay Compliant 
<p>iComply enables unified compliance across real estate workflows—from individual onboarding to multi-party coordination.</p>
 1. Identity and Entity Verification 
 
 KYC/KYB onboarding via secure, white-labeled portals 
 Support for 14,000+ ID types in 195 countries 
 UBO discovery and documentation 
 
 2. Source of Funds Checks 
 
 Collect and validate financial statements, employment records, or declarations 
 Risk-based automation of EDD triggers 
 Document retention for regulator inspection 
 
 3. Sanctions and Risk Screening 
 
 Real-time screening of all participants (buyers, sellers, brokers, law firms) 
 Automated refresh cycles and trigger alerts 
 
 4. Cross-Party Case Collaboration 
 
 Connect agents, legal counsel, and lenders in a single audit-ready file

<p>Open banking is rapidly becoming a critical plank of digital innovation in the financial services industry across both North and South America. Whether driven by regulation, market innovation, or consumer demand, the financial industry across both continents is increasingly embracing a standards-based, application programming interface (API)-first mindset in a bid to accelerate hyper-personalization, trust-based relationships, and value upsell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While digital challengers continue to capture digitally-savvy customers, incumbent providers are scrambling to meet the increasing demand for seamless and customer-centric experiences in a bid to maintain competitiveness. What might come as a surprise, is this paradigm shift is underpinned by technical standards that govern financial-grade APIs (FAPIs) interacting with enterprise-grade identity and access management (IAM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battle for market share in North and South American banking, and indeed the wider financial services industry, will hinge on the degree to which financial service providers embrace these technologies and industry standards and leverage underlying investments to deliver differentiated customer experiences.</p>

<p>New guidance from the Wolfsberg Group - a collection of twelve major global banks that sets industry guidelines for financial crime risk management - offers a blueprint for banks that wish to offer services to stablecoin issuers in a safe and sound manner.&nbsp;<br><br>The Wolfsberg Group’s <a href="https://wolfsberg-group.org/resources/204/">guidance</a> on the provision of banking services to stablecoin issuers, published on September 8, comes at a time when a growing number of banks are exploring opportunities to innovate through digital assets and stablecoins. In addition to launching their own stablecoins, a growing number of banks are exploring how they can offer services - such as reserve management, operating accounts, and others - to stablecoin issuers.&nbsp;<br><br>New regulatory requirements on stablecoins coming into effect around the world from the US, <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/mica-stablecoin-provisions-live-with-circle-first-issuer-to-obtain-full-approval">European Union</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfsberg-group.org/resources/204/"> Asia-Pacific </a>(APAC), and elsewhere require that stablecoin issuers maintain full backing of their token with adequate reserves held at a supervised financial institution. As such, the banking industry stands to play an important role in the rapidly growing stablecoin ecosystem - and providing services to issuers has the potential to serve as a <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/five-profitable-ways-banks-can-engage-with-stablecoins">new and attractive revenue stream for banks</a> that can do so in a compliant manner.&nbsp;<br><br>Doing so, of course, requires that banks take steps to manage risks associated with stablecoin issuer relationships they establish - and the Wolfsberg Guidance establishes several principles that banks should follow. Importantly, the guidance rests on the notion that banks should be able to leverage existing anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) risk management principles and frameworks that they already apply in their broader compliance and government arrangements, without having to reinvent the wheel.&nbsp;<br><br>In particular, the Wolfsberg guidance encourages banks to draw on correspondent banking standards when conducting AML/CFT due diligence on stablecoin issuers they service. Thus, at onboarding and on an ongoing basis, a bank should apply a risk-based approach to evaluating the risk associated with issuers. This should include taking account of the nature of the relationship, the issuer’s regulatory status, the sufficiency of its own AML/CFT arrangements, and information about the nature and purpose of its underlying stablecoin ecosystem.&nbsp;<br><br>On this last point, Wolfsberg advises that a bank’s compliance team should assess whether the issuer has an understanding of financial crime risks inherent in its stablecoin ecosystem, and the nature of controls - including blockchain analytics solutions - that the issuer uses to ensure that it operates in a manner consistent with its own risk appetite.&nbsp;<br><br>When it comes to monitoring the stablecoin issuer’s banking activity, Wolfsberg further advises that the bank should focus on risk based monitoring arrangements that allow the bank to assess whether the issuer is adhering to its stated risk appetite. Using a risk-based approach, a bank’s compliance team may opt to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/issuer-due-diligence">leverage blockchain analytics solutions</a> that allow the bank to verify its due diligence on the issuer and identify any significant changes to the issuer’s risk profile.&nbsp;<br><br>The Wolfberg Guidance is an important step forward in enabling banks to engage with the stablecoin space in a manner consistent with long-standing AML/CFT risk management principles - and will help to bolster the nascent regulatory regimes that offer a foundation for the growth and increasing adoption of stablecoins.<br><br>To learn more about the Wolfsberg guidance on banking stablecoin issuers and its implications for on-chain monitoring arrangements, read our full analysis <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-wolfsberg-groups-guidance-on-banking-stablecoin-issuers-harnessing-on-chain-insights-to-assess-risk">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>

Expanding our view toward six guiding principles for regenerative practice. Image: Dark Matter Labs. Adapted from <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/insights/insights-blog/moving-beyond-carbon-tunnel-vision-with-a-sustainability-data-strategy-codex7121">Jan Konietzko</a>, ‘Carbon Tunnel&nbsp;Vision’. Possibilities for the Built Environment, part 1 of&nbsp;3 <p>This is the first in a series of three provocations, which mark the cumulation of a collaborative effort between Dark Matter Labs and <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/">Bauhaus Earth</a> to consider a regenerative future for the built environment as part of the <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/projects/rebuilt-transformation-pathways">ReBuilt</a>&nbsp;project.</p><p>In this publication, we lay out the historical, professional and theoretical context for the contemporary push toward regenerative practice, and offer six guiding principles for a regenerative built environment, looking beyond profit tunnel-vision. In the second and third pieces, we propose pathways, configurations and indicators of the transformation our team envisions.</p> What isn’t regenerative? Debunking a misconception <p>When it was completed in 2014, Bosco Verticale, a pair of 40-story residential towers on Milan’s outskirts, was celebrated as an example of leading-edge regenerative building design for the 800 or so trees cascading from its balconies. In describing the project, its architect Stefano Boeri sketches the figure of the “<a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/buildings/bosco-verticale-by-stefano%E2%80%86boeri-architetti">biological architect</a>”, who is driven by biophilia and prizes sustainability above other design concerns. Praise for Bosco Verticale, in the architectural press and beyond, implies that the development’s vegetal adornments represent a meaningful substitution of traditional building materials with bio-based ones, and further that measures supporting biodiversity constitute climate-positive architecture.</p><p>The list of green credentials associated with the project ignores other characteristics of Bosco Verticale that don’t align with this vision. The steel-reinforced concrete structure was designed with unusually substantial <a href="https://store.ctbuh.org/index.php?controller=attachment&amp;id_attachment=32">28cm deep slabs</a> to support the vegetation’s weight (which totals an estimated 675 metric tons) and associated dynamic loads. Considering that this slab depth is about twice that of comparable buildings without the green facade, the embodied carbon associated with the project’s 30,000m² floor slabs alone is approximately double that of a standard building.</p><p>In tandem, an existing workspace for local artists and artisans based in a former industrial building was demolished to make space for the premium residential units accessible only to the few. Although a replacement workspace was eventually built nearby, the structure’s regenerative aspirations are weighed down by profound contradictions beneath the leafy&nbsp;surface.</p><p>Certainly, Bosco Verticale is significant as an exceptional investment in urban greening on the part of the developer, and as a leading-edge demonstration of innovations that enhance the multiple benefits of green infrastructure. Bosco Verticale contributed to the viability of future developments that extend the geographic reach of urban greening discourse into new geographies: copy-cat schemes have been built in East Asia and elsewhere. However, it’s clear that Bosco Verticale fails to stand up to a holistic consideration of what regenerative building looks like. Many voices overlooked the social and material impacts of the project, instead dazzled by the urban greening.</p> Puzzle pieces of the regenerative <p>In recent years, societies worldwide have become familiar with weather events and political shifts that were unprecedented or previously unthinkable. Six of the nine planetary boundaries that demarcate the safe operating space for humanity were crossed as of 2023. There is now a strong case for the idea that our entangled human and planetary systems exist in a state of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/03/polycrisis-adam-tooze-historian-explains/">polycrisis</a>. Bearing this in mind, what do we mean when we refer to a built environment that is regenerative?</p><p>This piece aims to add nuance and system-scale perspective to our working definitions. As examples like Bosco Verticale show, it’s possible to be green in the public eye while counteracting what is regenerative. Perhaps we need new methods to help us understand:</p>  How long a building will&nbsp;last,  How its materials will be stewarded,  Whether it is built in a context that enables low-carbon living,  And what its end of life might&nbsp;involve.  <p>System-scale perspective is needed because the built environment cannot be disentangled from systemic needs like the demand for affordable housing and the reality of physical, material constraints. Although we do need initial demonstrations to spark change, a single, locally-sourced timber building constructed with ethical labour does not define wholly regenerative practice in&nbsp;itself.</p> What is regenerative? <p>Regenerative is the term of the moment, yet it remains loosely defined in public discourse: we rely on examples, implicit understandings, and theoretical frameworks to give it meaning. How, then, is it used in particular contexts?</p> Beyond ‘green’ <p>Regeneration refers to approaches that seek to balance human and natural systems, allowing for coexistence, repair and self-regulation over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The regenerative paradigm seeks to look beyond what’s merely ‘green’, and to do net good. A broader lineage of thinking around the term spans agriculture, biology and ecology, medicine, urbanism and design: disciplines and industries that connect to the health and wellbeing of biomes, bodies and buildings. Variation in definition can be observed in different contexts, sectors and&nbsp;aims.</p><blockquote>‘Regenerative’: a brief history of the&nbsp;term</blockquote><blockquote>The term regenerative began to gain traction in fields including agriculture and development to outline a new paradigm from the 1980s. The US’ <a href="https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/">Rodale Institute</a> popularised the term ‘regenerative agriculture’ to describe farming systems that go beyond sustainability by improving soil, biodiversity and ecosystem health. The practices invoked are ancient, with precedents across the globe, and rooted in Indigenous land management. However, this specific application of the term ‘regenerative’ articulated an emergent attitude in this period that focused on renewal and improvement of ecological and social systems. The Rodale Institute advanced this concept through research, advocacy, farmer training, publications and consumer education geared toward regenerative organic agriculture, laying the groundwork for its integration into mainstream agricultural discourse and integration into other disciplines.</blockquote><blockquote>From the early 2000s, the <a href="https://regenesisgroup.com/resources/">work</a> of Bill Reed and the Regenesis Institute for Regenerative Practice has anchored the application of regeneration to design fields and the built environment in particular. With a focus on ecosystem renewal and coevolution of human and natural systems, Reed’s framework implies that regenerative design goes beyond sustainability by restoring and renewing ecosystems, integrating humans and nature in a symbiotic relationship. Expanding this idea beyond ecology, many architects and urbanists have adapted Reed’s model to their own corners of their fields, looking for design that doesn’t simply do less harm, but does more good. Bauhaus Earth maps Reed’s familiar bowtie-shaped diagram onto four basic categories for the built environment: from conventional, to green, to restorative and finally regenerative–that which has the greatest positive environmental and social&nbsp;impact.</blockquote><blockquote>Across applications, several elements of a core meaning of what is regenerative exist: a focus on supporting systems of different scales to recover from loss, to take on new life, to grow responsively. The evocative nature of this idea, easily applied across different disciplines, has inspired a range of permutations and schools of&nbsp;thought.</blockquote><blockquote>Other key references on the regenerative:</blockquote><blockquote>1 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119149699">Regenerative Development</a>, Regenesis Group,&nbsp;2016.</blockquote><blockquote>2 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273379786_Regenerative_Development_and_Design">Regenerative Development and Design</a>, Bill Reed and Pamela Mang,&nbsp;2012.</blockquote><blockquote>3 <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09613210701475753">Shifting from ‘sustainability’ to regeneration</a>, Bill Reed,&nbsp;2007.</blockquote><blockquote>4 <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.628548">Towards a regenerative paradigm for the built environment</a>, Chrisna du Plessis,&nbsp;2011.</blockquote><blockquote>5 <a href="https://www.home.earth/doughnut">Doughnut for Urban Development</a>, Home.Earth, 2023.</blockquote><blockquote>6 <a href="https://constructivist.co.uk/the-regenerative-design-reading-list/">The Regenerative Design Reading List</a>, Constructivist, 2024.</blockquote>Image: Bauhaus Earth, adapted from Bill Reed’s ‘Trajectory of Ecological Design’<p>The term’s uses have gained traction and proliferated within the particular historical context of the last half-century, during which concepts like the anthropocene and the full extent of human impact on the planet have been evidenced. As technology has enabled our understanding of the ways in which humanity has degraded our environments — at scales from the cellular to whole earth systems — to grow, so too has our desire for models that point to possible ways to repair this damage. Conceptualising the regenerative across scales and disciplines opens the door to alternative futures in which planetary demise at the hands of humans is not inevitable. The application of the core elements of regenerative theory to fields like architecture has spurred a range of generative and planet-benefitting practices. However, these individual actions, and even the rise of the sustainability paradigm across design fields, cannot override the prevailing limitations of capitalism that continue to increase rates of extraction, social inequality and environmental degradation. As it stands, regenerative approaches continue to be exceptions working against the&nbsp;odds.</p> The main limitation: political economy <p>These frameworks were written within academic and industrial contexts, largely from a Western, wealthy nations’ perspective. While regenerative thinking has inspired thinkers across the planet and across fields, attempts to translate these concepts into a global, political economic scale fails to account for deep-seated inequalities. We are limited by the systems and power imbalances in which we’re working. Capitalism, in particular, compounds these blindspots, limiting attempts to translate regenerative thinking into other spaces such as the built environment. As such, while trailblazing organisations, communities and individuals are offering proofs of possibilities in regenerative infrastructure and urbanism, these are currently exceptional cases. It is not yet evident how these ideas can be instantiated at scale to benefit all people and meaningfully address systemic inequalities.</p> The role for and responsibilities of professionals <p>The interconnected challenges of this moment invoke new layers of complexity. But if professionals can’t understand or deploy the idea of regeneration, then it won’t guide their decisions and&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Extractive activities led by the industrialised global North continue to irreversibly alter our planet at pace, while the transition to renewable energy will involve even higher rates of extraction of critical minerals than those of today. As such, the earth’s systems’ ability to regenerate is stressed more than ever. The built environment, with its outsized responsibility for global carbon emissions associated with construction, building operations and demolition, must admit these impacts and face up to its epoch-defining responsibility. So how do we get off the one-way road of identifying problems without solutions?</p><p>There is a separation between perceived responsibility and power in today’s professional landscape. This moment necessitates a shift from individual to collective agency in taking on advocacy for the regenerative potential of the built environment.</p><p>Imagine this: you are an architect today, trying to answer the client’s brief by maximising the use of responsibly-sourced bio-based materials, embedding social justice in your design processes and objectives, and considering carbon-storage potential and place stewardship for future generations, while accepting that your brief is to create market-rate apartments. This is nearly impossible in the context of today’s imperative to maximise profits and commodify housing. Architects in the current professional environment are profoundly limited in means to meaningfully address these intersecting priorities, whether one at a time or in concert. Our current economic system simply does not position architects to be the core innovators, as much as Stefano Boeri’s reflections on the Bosco Verticale boast otherwise.</p><p>These professional limitations are an indirect signal of the political economy of real estate development and the power relations underpinning the construction industry. Only a systemic shift can address the limitations facing individuals operating within a design scope. To genuinely take on the intersections of ecology, social justice and the built environment, architects need to see their work for all its entanglement with the broader political, economic and social forces, using the tools of the profession and connections, bolstered by connections with aligned collaborators, and their collective power to dismantle the systems of power that limit transformation at across&nbsp;scales.</p><p>We’re orienting ourselves toward a future in which there is more latitude for these crucial priorities to be addressed. This future will hold an altered scope for decisions made by architects and other built environment professionals in the course of development processes, and a transition to a regenerative built environment driven by collective commitment.</p> A growing field: precedents and trailblazers <p>A range of contemporary initiatives, programmes and projects aim to establish frameworks to define the idea of a regenerative built environment. Drawing on advancements in <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-is-circular-economy-and-how-it-helps-fight-climate-change">circular economic thinking</a>, increasing recognition of the significance of <a href="https://ukgbc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/operational-and-embodied-carbon-1.pdf">embodied carbon</a> in addition to operational carbon in buildings, and as the industry’s understanding of indicators like biodiversity and water use that are tied to planetary boundaries <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html">grows</a>, these programmes help experts and the general public to move beyond misconceptions.</p><p>Bauhaus Earth emerged in 2021 as an initiative around the use of timber and other bio-based materials for construction and their ability to store carbon. Today, Bauhaus Earth is a research and advocacy organization dedicated to transforming the built environment into a regenerative force for ecological restoration. It brings together experts from architecture, planning, arts, science, governance, and industry to promote systemic change in construction practices.</p><p>Index of aligned enquiries</p><blockquote>A global range of community-led and grassroots organisations focusing on the work and needs of underserved groups receive grant funding from and can be discovered via the <a href="https://www.rearc.institute/grants">Re:arc Institute</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Non-Extractive Architecture(s)’ <a href="https://directory.nonextractivearchitecture.org/directory">directory</a> gathers a global index of projects that rethink the relationship between human and natural landscapes, alongside questions about the role of technology and politics in future material economies. The directory is an ongoing project&nbsp;itself.</blockquote><blockquote>A range of related organisations and initiatives in the working ecosystem of Europe can be found in the table below. The range in types of these enquiries represents the broad coalition of stakeholders and types of activity that will be required to activate transformation toward a regenerative built environment.</blockquote>Index of related initiatives in Europe. For links, see the end of this&nbsp;post.<blockquote>Bio-based building materials are an important nexus of social and material relations. These materials, which bridge human and earth-based capacities for creation, urge an expanded view of stewardship. Understanding this will enable us to move past a paradigmatic dichotomy between the human and the natural, which enables humans to exploit planetary resources. Bio-based building materials were humans’ first building materials, and over millennia the practices, most notably agricultural and indigenous ones, that created the materials we work with today, have developed in concert with human civilisations and material realities. Holding these strands together, it’s evident why a maintained focus upon bioregionally-sourced and bio-based materiality is crucial for a regenerative future.</blockquote><blockquote>For a contemporary design and research practice that focuses on this intersection of agendas, see <a href="https://materialcultures.org/">Material Cultures</a>.</blockquote> Regeneration across time horizons: shortsightedness and the Capitalocene <p>As Reed’s Trajectory of Ecological Design diagram and the examples above indicate, regeneration of ecosystems and societies are continuous, open-ended processes that occur over time, at scales from the cellular, to the neighbourhood, and to the planetary. As the repair and balancing of regenerative processes have occurred in many contexts across eons, we need to understand regeneration across multiple accordant time horizons. Within this complex and extensive landscape, time horizons can act as organising units that help make sense of interconnections and nested scales of&nbsp;action.</p><p>In construction, key processes take place across different timescales. These range from time needed for a regenerative resource such as a forest to grow, to the lifespan of a building, to the longer time periods associated with meaningful carbon sequestration. In each of these cases, regenerative interventions involving acts of maintenance and design directly modulate the temporal register of the built environment. For example, extending a building’s lifespan through processes of care and preventing demolition impacts the future form of its locale and pushes back against the conceptualisation of buildings strictly as sources of profit within capitalist logic–that is, viewing buildings primarily in terms of their capacity to generate immediate economic returns through cycles of development, exploitation and obsolescence. By this means, it is within the medium of time that a regenerative lens on the built environment can be most revealing.</p><p>Regeneration in <a href="https://anthropocene.univie.ac.at/resources/deep-time/">deep time</a> and at the timescale of ecosystems has been disrupted by human processes. We are accustomed to the idea of the Anthropocene, in which an epoch defined by human activity has become the dominant influence on climate and the environment, which was initiated by the industrial revolution. However, recent discussions by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1235036">Jason W Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/135-fossil-capital">Andreas Malm</a> and others offer a critique of this concept in making the case for the Capitalocene as a more precise term. Rather than treating humanity as a homogenous force as Anthropocene theory does, the Capitalocene examines how differences in responsibility, power and agency within societies have been compounded in the context of the capitalist system, and how this system has driven ecological crisis. Rather than humanity as a whole, Moore argues that we should examine how the social, economic and political processes that have shaped recent centuries, and which reach back to the early modern period, provide a better basis for understanding the relationship between human activity and planetary wellbeing, and how this dynamic produces ecological crises. Using this focus on the un-natural and political origins of the crisis we face today, it’s possible to see how shifting senses of responsibility, agency and relationships, operating against capitalist logics, are essential for developing effective pathways toward planetary regeneration. In the predominant logic of the Capitalocene, short-term profits, increases in productivity, and optimisation around flawed ideas of efficiency are necessitated–and regeneration could be mistaken for a loss, an indicator of inefficacy, a concession to the ineffable–and as such, unwarranted. This is the systemic logic that must be resisted.</p><p>The prevalence of demolition today is one example of how this systemic short-sightedness is bad for people and the planet. The UK is now facing the consequences of the prevalent use of <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9917/">reinforced aerated autoclave concrete</a> (‘RAAC’), in municipal buildings nationwide during the 1980s. With a material lifespan of only 30 years, many hospitals and schools built of RAAC are now being demolished. Indeed, the lifespan of many of the structures that are most viable in our current urban development models are steadily decreasing in spite of increasing awareness of the embodied carbon impacts of demolition.</p><p>We would do well, in looking toward a regenerative future for the built environment, to retune our time horizons. This might involve syncing carbon sequestration time with lifecycles for construction that create value over time, taking into account things like municipal land leases and emerging whole life carbon regulations. What if we had a way to see the long-term impact of decisions made&nbsp;today?</p><p>In this effort to hold more timescales in mind when we consider processes of regeneration, we can learn a great deal from indigenous cultures from across the world, many of whom have developed, over the course of millennia, methods and ideologies supporting the human ability to connect with scales of time beyond our species-specific and news-cycle dependent parameters. Some of these examples are evidenced in the above Index of enquiries.</p> Theoretical underpinnings: what constitutes a regenerative built environment? <p>The built environment is both a physical and a social construct: it’s not fitting in this moment of polycrisis to continue to abstract the physical materials that shelter us from the labour that built them, the livelihoods that maintain them, the design processes that make them fit for purpose, and the policies or decisions that keep them standing.</p><p>To identify ways to directly address the injustices to people and the planet engendered by the Capitalocene, we need to look to historical and political decisions that have driven the crises in housing affordability and race-based inequality that are defining features of cities today. In recent years, there has been a greater focus on how the built environment can benefit from the application of lenses that focus on the distribution of power and agency within societies, including critical theory and urban political ecology. These approaches can help us to articulate how the built environment and natural resources can be viewed in the context of human struggles to meet their needs in the context of today’s critical conditions.</p><p>David Harvey, most notably in <a href="https://www.udg.org.uk/publications/udlibrary/social-justice-and-city">Social Justice and the City</a>, points to how a purely quantitative or spatial design-based approach to understanding urban space consistently fails to engage socioeconomic phenomena like inequality and urban poverty, while arguing for the necessity of approaches that integrate the spatial with the social. Harvey’s reading, grounded in radical geography, makes clear how spatial development processes are driven by financial capital, which keeps governments, civil society, communities and individuals in predetermined roles, ill-equipped to resist the calcification of capitalised space. Recently, <a href="https://journal-buildingscities.org/articles/10.5334/bc.65">climate justice movements</a> like the <a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/">Climate Justice Alliance</a> (on the grassroots side) have formed alliances with decision-makers and activists in the built environment around causes like health and buildings, retrofit poverty and feminist approaches to building, under banners like a <a href="https://www.c40.org/what-we-do/building-a-movement/global-green-new-deal/">Global Green New Deal</a>, in which a spatialised social justice lens can be directly&nbsp;applied.</p><p>Harvey’s work is a key influence on urban political ecology approaches, which assist us in understanding of how cities are hybrids of natural and social processes, rejecting a dichotomy between people and nature. Similarly, Marxist political economic thinkers like <a href="https://raymondwilliams.co.uk/2020/09/02/part-three-from-production-to-livelihood-raymond-williams-on-ecosocialism/">Raymond Williams</a> have pointed to how capitalism organises space and produces environmental inequalities, as analysed using multiscalar analysis, among other techniques. Through a political ecology lens, we see that developers and investors, not communities or ecological needs, shape the built environment, often through speculative real estate practices that exploit labour and resources. These critiques of the built environment emphasise that urban development is driven primarily by capitalist interests, prioritising profit over social and environmental well-being, leading to inequality, displacement, and environmental degradation. Theory can support an analysis of exclusion in planning, and advocacy for participatory processes that could support socially regenerative places.</p><p>In sum, focusing exclusively on buildings misses the point that cities are fluid, open, contested multivocal landscapes. At scales from the individual building, to the neighbourhood, including infrastructure like street systems, as well as cities and regions, the built environment is a negotiation between matter, human behaviour and social systems over&nbsp;time.</p><p>As we look to the future, how will our urban environments be produced? Who will benefit from them? And how can we challenge the environmental injustices inherent to the systems we live&nbsp;in?</p> Guiding principles for regenerative practice  Six layered principles for a regenerative built environment <p>Expanding our definition of what’s regenerative in the built environment calls for clear ways to speak to the material, economic and social dimensions of cities. We need ways of accessing and assessing regeneration that cut across disciplinary boundaries, invite broader participation in these conversations, and account for future risks and technological developments.</p><p>What layers and principles might expand and deepen our understanding of systemic interactions as we work toward more holistic indicators? Below are six suggestions to focus our&nbsp;gaze.</p> Time horizons and generational preparedness <p>Future indicators of a regenerative built environment must take a long-term view. If the built environment is to form a matrix in support of human life for generations to come, it should fundamentally be building material preparedness for the future. This means the way we measure and quantify what the built environment does ought to speak to this extended time horizon, for example by considering how much carbon is stored for three generations to come, how much of our timber is sourced in a way that will allow for replanted trees that will mature over decades, or how much of a building’s material stock can be disassembled and reused within the same settlement.</p><p>Today we have standard metrics like Floor Area Ratio (FAR) that are aligned with present development models and profit-driven logics requiring maximum saleable use of space, fundamentally constraining possibilities for the built environment. Foregrounding time horizons for change enables retooling of these ways of measuring cities, focusing not on short-term, singular profits and benefits, but rather on the future generations and our planetary resources.</p> Geopolitical resilience and&nbsp;security <p>Future indicators for a regenerative built environment should address the geopolitical stakes of decisions.This is especially relevant now in Europe, with regard to geopolitical dynamics within and between the US, Russia and China, in light of multipolarity and the EU Strategic Autonomy conversation. Can we refashion the socioeconomic and material dependencies in cities so that they are resilient to the crises that may face future generations, while supporting enhanced responses to geopolitical dangers? We should look to modes of resilience that address the political and economic systems that exacerbate geopolitical precarity, such as the extractive nature of global trade, and the ongoing influence of multinational corporations in shaping environments across scales. The status quo propositions toward resilience often fall short of addressing geopolitical power structures.</p> Place-based and planetary approaches <p>Future policies and indicators should adopt a multiscalar view that takes into account the unique local context to which it’s applied, as well as the transformative potential and influence interventions may leverage across scales (e.g. throughout the value chain). Contextual specificity is associated with direct impact in regenerative efforts, but these must be connected to transformative change that fundamentally alters the properties and functions of&nbsp;systems.</p> Living systems&nbsp;approach <p>Actions should help to shift thinking towards more holistic and ecocentric worldviews, in which non-capitalistic, nature-centred systems of values are given primacy. This layer considers interventions as part of dynamic social-ecological systems rather than isolated components. It is crucial to see these social-ecological systems for their complex adaptive qualities, in which people and nature are inextricably linked.</p><p>A living systems approach supports biogenerative thinking, in which processes, systems, or designs that actively promote, support, and regenerate life — both biological and ecological — create conditions for continuous growth, renewal, and self-sustaining ecosystems.</p> Co-evolutionary and community-led <p>Interventions should structurally empower communities to act and evolve in line with their ecosystems. Structural empowerment means building systems and resources to make communities stronger and self-sufficient and allowing nature to flourish in tandem. This approach foregrounds the utility of feedback mechanisms from nature, like soil health indicators, phenological changes, and biodiversity and species presence, to support the co-evolution and improvement of social-ecological systems.</p> Supporting holistic value&nbsp;creation <p>A regenerative built environment should operate on the basis of a broad definition of value, from economic, to ecological and social. As the theoretical approaches discussed previously indicate, the built environment is a hybrid of natural and social processes occurring in the constraints of systems that thrive on extraction and inequality. A holistic approach that combines material, interpersonal and spatial integrators to consider what is regenerative generates cascading value across multiple&nbsp;scales.</p><blockquote>“Measuring the impact of regenerative practices on living systems must therefore recognise entangled systemic value flows. Current economic approaches fail to account for this complexity.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Dark Matter Labs, <a href="http://A%20New%20Economy%20for%20Europe’s%20Built%20Environment%20White%20paper">A New Economy for Europe’s Built Environment,</a> white paper,&nbsp;2024</blockquote> Conclusion <p>In the context of the polycrisis, we need to move beyond notions of sustainability, toward, as Bill Reed’s diagram suggests, creating healthy, counter-extractive communities and bioregions that can scale from exceptions to define new&nbsp;norms.</p><p>Embracing a broadened definition of regenerative practice — one which is informed by the historical and contemporary context of such practices — will evidence the potential contradictions and tensions in the current system. Deploying multimodal metrics and indicators, of the type that the principles introduced in this piece imply, will enable new thinking for net-regenerative outcomes in our cities. Without redirecting our points of orientation toward these six principles, even motivated actors will be limited by today’s system, which allows only for shifting of blame and incremental, localised improvements in the status quo. We will never reach a regenerative built environment without transformational change.</p><p>Further pieces in this series will explore in more detail the systemic shifts we envision, pathways toward regenerative practice, and possible indicators for recognising progress.</p><p>This publication is part of the project <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/projects/rebuilt-transformation-pathways">ReBuilt “Transformation Pathways Toward a Regenerative Built Environment</a> — Übergangspfade zu einer regenerativen gebauten Umwelt” and is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) on the basis of a resolution of the German Bundestag.</p><p>This piece represents the views of its authors, including, from Bauhaus Earth, Gediminas Lesutis and Georg Hubmann, and from Dark Matter Labs, Emma Pfeiffer and Aleksander Nowak.</p> Additional links:   <a href="https://builtbn.org/">Built By&nbsp;Nature</a>  <a href="https://materialcultures.org/">Material Cultures</a>  <a href="https://ecococon.eu/">Ecococon</a>  <a href="https://www.luma.org/en/arles/about-us/parc-des-ateliers/le-magasin-electrique.html">LUMA Arles / Le Magasin Électrique</a>  <a href="https://www.houseeurope.eu/">HouseEurope!</a>  <a href="https://rotordb.org/en">Rotor</a>  <a href="https://www.miesarch.com/work/4301">Gleis 21</a>  <a href="https://www.uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/lyon-metropole">Home Silk&nbsp;Road</a>  <a href="https://www.kalkbreite.net/en/">Kalkbreite</a>  <a href="https://www.re-dwell.eu/case-library/la-borda">La Borda</a>  <a href="https://www.livingforfuture.org/index.php/ueber-das-wohnprojekt/unsere-vision#wersindwir">Living for&nbsp;Future</a>  <a href="https://habitat.pl/energy-inefficient-housing/">Habitat for Humanity&nbsp;Poland</a>   <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/whats-guiding-our-regenerative-futures-e34e0ab21c06">What’s guiding our Regenerative Futures?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We spoke with Kai Stuebane, Managing Director for DACH at Docusign, to explore how secure digital identity verification is transforming digital signing amid Germany’s evolving regulatory landscape.  



 



<p>From navigating increasing compliance demands to delivering seamless user experiences, we discussed why eID (Electronic Identification) is becoming a strategic priority for faster, more secure, and legally compliant digital signatures – and how Docusign’s partnership with IDnow is empowering enterprises to stay ahead with secure, scalable and user-centric digital workflows.</p>



 Why now: Perfect conditions for eID to scale 



 In today’s rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, particularly in Germany but also across Europe, digital identity is becoming increasingly significant. From Docusign’s perspective, what factors are driving the growing importance of secure digital identity solutions in the enterprise environment?&nbsp; 



<p>First, regulatory compliance is a major driver. Regional laws such as eIDAS, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/eidas-2-0-simple-update-fundamental-change/">the impending eIDAS 2.0 in the EU </a>are enhancing the need for digital authentication solutions across the region by introducing initiatives such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity Wallets</a> (EUDI). In Germany, the focus on digital trust services, enforced by institutions such as BaFin and regulations like GwG, demand robust, verifiable digital identity solutions. Enterprises must meet strict requirements for customer identification and authentication when signing or executing agreements electronically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, security concerns and fraud prevention are top priorities. According to a recent Docusign global survey into the identity verification landscape, 70% of organisations agree that identity fraud attempts are on the rise, as remote and hybrid work models become the norm and businesses continue digitising their operations. As a result, companies require robust authentication solutions that ensure document integrity and signer identity across borders and devices.</p>



<p>A third major driver is that user expectations have shifted. Both customers and employees now expect seamless, secure digital experiences, with 50% of organisations actually prioritising customer experience over fraud prevention, given its perceived importance. Organisations like Docusign enable enterprises to deliver this through a frictionless signing experience while maintaining high standards of security and trust. For example Grenke who, in addition to offering IDnow’s videoident process through Docusign, decided to also add the new eID capability in order to offer more convenience to their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, digital transformation continues to accelerate. Enterprises are modernising legacy workflows at an exponential rate, and secure digital identity is foundational to automating agreement processes end-to-end. Digital-first solutions empower businesses to operate faster, more efficiently, and with greater legal certainty – particularly in highly regulated markets like Germany.</p>



 As Germany advances its digital transformation initiatives, how do you anticipate electronic identification (eID) solutions will reshape document signing processes for both enterprises and consumers in the German market? 



<p>There is an overall shift within the identity verification and authentication landscape&nbsp; where organisations are actively seeking-out solutions that enable them to maintain security and compliance, without impacting the user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For enterprises, eID solutions will help streamline identity verification, enabling faster onboarding, contract execution, and compliance with stringent regulatory requirements such as eIDAS and Germany’s Trust Services Act. Again, take Grenke as an example, the ability to integrate German eID schemes into their existing signing workflow – especially for digital signatures – means they can ensure the highest level of legal validity while reducing manual processes and streamlining the customer experience.</p>



<p>For consumers, eID will offer a more seamless and familiar experience whilst maintaining security – something we pride ourselves on delivering here at Docusign. With familiar national identity methods integrated into digital transactions, users will be able to verify their identity and complete agreements with confidence and ease. This not only enhances trust but also accelerates adoption in regulated sectors like finance, insurance, and real estate.</p>



<p>Through our partnership with IDnow, Docusign is committed to supporting the German market by leaning into evolving regulations and integrating eID solutions into its portfolio, meeting local regulatory needs while delivering the trusted experience that users expect.</p>



 The eID advantage: Seamless UX meets compliance 



 How can Germany unlock and accelerate the full potential of eID? 



<p>Based on our experience, accelerating eID adoption in Germany hinges on three key factors: user experience, awareness, and interoperability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, simplifying the user experience is critical. For individuals to embrace eID for digital agreement completion, the process must be intuitive, fast, and secure. Reducing friction, such as removing lengthy registration steps or complex verification methods, can significantly increase user adoption. By leveraging the familiar eID methods, this will streamline this experience while maintaining high levels of identity assurance.</p>



<p>Second, education and awareness are essential. Many individuals are unaware that their national eID can be used as part of the digital agreement process. Promoting the benefits (legal validity, security, and convenience, etc.) will help build trust and drive usage across different age and user groups.</p>



<p>Third, ensuring broad interoperability with public and private identity schemes is key. Businesses need confidence that the eID solutions they implement will work across sectors and meet local (GwG) and regional (eIDAS) regulatory standards.</p>



 In what ways has Docusign enhanced its signing workflows by incorporating eID with other IDnow-powered verification solutions? 



<p>Docusign has a long-standing partnership with IDnow. The evolution of this partnership to now include IDnow’s eID capabilities enhances the security and user experience of its joint offering in the following ways:</p>



  Automation: Customers can make the most of an Identification method that simply relies on&nbsp; the electronic identification (eID) function of the German national identity card.&nbsp;  



  Security: Two factors of authentication for additional security:&nbsp;  



  PIN entry&nbsp;  Scanning of the near field communication (NFC) chip contained within German eIDs&nbsp;  



  Familiarity and ease of use: not only are eIDs increasingly adopted across Germany, but the fact we leverage new technology such as NFC provides an additional element of ease of use.  



 Real-world application: GRENKE’s eID-first transformation 



 For businesses that already use Docusign but haven’t yet implemented eID-based signing, what are the key benefits they might be missing out on? 



<p>Ultimately, we can distill the key benefits to:&nbsp;</p>



  Increased completion rates, driven through familiarity: enable customers to use their German eID for straightforward, intuitive identity verification that supports compliance obligations.&nbsp;  



  Secure, simplified signing:&nbsp; built-in security enhancements (i.e. use of PIN, scanning of NFC, etc.) mean that SMS re-authentication and live video interactions are no longer required, resulting in an even faster identification process for signers.  



  Storage and centralisation of key identity information: continue to download or easily access required signer identity information through Docusign and IDnow, to demonstrate compliance with BaFin GwG requirements&nbsp;  



 Can you share a real-world example of how a customer of Docusign is using eID to improve efficiency and achieve measurable business outcomes? 



<p>A strong example is our long-standing collaboration with Grenke, a leading provider of leasing and financing services. For several years, Grenke has enabled customers and dealers to digitally sign contracts using Docusign eSignature, with IDnow’s VideoIdent solution supporting identity verification.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/grenkegroup_grenke-eid-activity-7338524460192325633-9QWT/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAuHOgEBAK4x3WS4ifsdWyoRBZ5v0rWuco">Grenke enhanced this process by integrating IDnow’s eID solution</a> as an alternative verification method. The impact has been clear: the introduction of eID has helped Grenke accelerate contract turnaround times, reduce reliance on physical materials, and improve the overall user experience. This has translated into greater operational efficiency, enhanced customer satisfaction, and measurable progress toward the company’s digital and sustainability goals.</p>



 What’s next: Looking beyond legal requirements 



 As we anticipate the implementation of eIDAS 2.0 and the European Digital Identity framework in the coming months, how do you envision these regulatory advancements shaping the evolution of electronic identification and digital signature solutions across Germany and the broader European market? 



<p>These regulatory advancements will establish a unified, interoperable framework for digital identity across EU member states, enabling individuals and businesses to authenticate and complete digital agreements securely and seamlessly across borders. For Germany, this means greater alignment with a pan-European standard that facilitates trust, legal certainty, and smoother cross-border transactions.</p>



<p>eIDAS 2.0 introduces the concept of the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI), which empowers citizens to manage, store and share verified identity attributes as they wish. This will significantly enhance user control, reduce onboarding friction, and boost adoption of high-assurance digital signatures, particularly Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). At Docusign our stated ambition is to become an federator of identities, where all EUDI wallets are available through our platform .&nbsp;</p>



<p>For businesses, these changes will reduce complexity in managing multiple identity systems while improving compliance and scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re excited for what’s to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Face ID search technology has rapidly evolved, becoming a standard feature in smartphones. In 2025, its capabilities are expected to expand even further, offering a seamless, secure, and personalized experience for users. This blog explores the future of Face ID search in smartphones, how it integrates with existing technology, and the potential benefits and challenges of this advancement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Face ID Search? 
<p>It is a technology that uses facial recognition to unlock smartphones and enable various features such as security, payments, and app access. Unlike traditional password systems, it allows users to unlock their devices by simply looking at them, using the unique features of their faces as identification.</p>
<p>This technology has come a long way since its inception and continues to evolve with advancements in 3D facial recognition and other biometrics. By 2025, Face ID will likely be even more accurate, efficient, and secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Facial ID Recognition Works 
<p>It relies on advanced facial recognition algorithms and hardware, such as depth sensors, infrared cameras, and AI-powered software. It captures the unique features of a person’s face, including the distance between their eyes, nose, mouth, and other defining characteristics.</p>
<p>In the case of smartphones, Face ID works by:</p>
 
 Scanning your face using a 3D depth sensor to create a detailed map of your features. 
 Comparing the scanned data to the stored template to confirm your identity. 
 Unlocking the device or allowing access to apps, payment systems, and more once the match is confirmed. 
 
<p>This process is both fast and secure, offering a more convenient method of authentication compared to traditional PIN codes or passwords.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future of Face ID Search in Smartphones (2025) 
<p>As we look toward the future of smartphones, Face recognition is set to play an even more central role. Here are some expected advancements:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Improved Accuracy with 3D Facial Recognition 
<p>Currently, Face ID systems rely on 2D mapping and some 3D depth sensors for better security. However, by 2025, 3D facial recognition will likely become the standard for even more accurate and precise identification. With the integration of advanced 3D facial recognition, your smartphone will be able to detect your face from multiple angles, providing enhanced security and reducing the risk of errors in recognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. More Personalized User Experience 
<p>It will move beyond just unlocking your phone. By 2025, smartphones will likely offer a personalized user experience based on facial recognition. For instance, Face ID search could automatically:</p>
 
 Adjust screen brightness or display settings based on your face. 
 Personalize app suggestions or content based on your past preferences. 
 Unlock specific apps and features automatically when the phone detects that you are looking at it. 
 
<p>This level of personalization can enhance user engagement and make smartphone interactions more intuitive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Facial Recognition for Payments and Secure Transactions 
<p>Already, smartphones with Face ID capabilities allow users to make payments through mobile wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay. By 2025, face unlock for payments will become even more common and secure. We may see Face ID search systems that can perform secure transactions, even without the need for an additional password or PIN. This will make financial transactions quicker and more secure for users.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Integration with Augmented Reality (AR) 
<p>Augmented reality is quickly gaining popularity, and Face ID search will likely integrate seamlessly with AR experiences. Imagine using your smartphone’s facial recognition to control AR experiences unlocking virtual environments, personalizing characters, and interacting with digital content. 3D facial recognition will provide accurate data to ensure a more immersive experience, enabling personalized AR interactions based on your facial features.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Enhanced Privacy and Security Features 
<p>With the growing concern over digital privacy, the future of Face ID search will focus on enhancing security measures. Face unlock technology will be enhanced to ensure that it is more difficult for people to bypass the system. Expect additional layers of security such as liveness detection, where the phone can determine if it’s looking at a real face (not a photo or video), or multi-factor authentication (combining face recognition with voice or fingerprint authentication).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Its Impact on the Smartphone Industry 
<p>The introduction of Face ID is already changing the way we interact with our smartphones. By 2025, it will likely have a profound impact on various industries:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Mobile Payments and E-Commerce 
<p>As smartphones adopt Face ID search technology, mobile payment and e-commerce platforms will see an uptick in secure transactions. Users will no longer need to fumble with passwords, credit cards, or PINs. Just a glance at their phone will be enough to authorize payments, making online shopping and in-store purchases more efficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Smartphone Security 
<p>Smartphone security will continue to evolve. With improved facial recognition technology, phone manufacturers will likely be able to deliver a much higher level of security. This could reduce the likelihood of data theft and unauthorized access, making smartphones much more secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Privacy Concerns 
<p>As Face ID search becomes more widespread, privacy concerns are likely to rise. Many people worry about the potential for their facial data to be stored and misused. The smartphone industry will need to address these concerns by implementing stronger encryption and giving users control over their data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges and Concerns in the Future of Face ID Search 
<p>While Face ID search has many advantages, it does come with its challenges:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Privacy and Security Risks 
<p>Storing and using facial data raises privacy concerns. If this data is hacked or stolen, it could lead to identity theft. To combat these risks, manufacturers will need to adopt robust encryption and make sure that personal data is stored securely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Facial Recognition Accuracy 
<p>While facial recognition technology has improved, it’s still not flawless. Factors such as lighting, aging, or facial hair changes can affect recognition. As we move toward 2025, more accurate 3D facial recognition systems will likely emerge to minimize these issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Increased Dependency on Facial Recognition 
<p>As more tasks are tied to Face ID search, users may become overly reliant on facial recognition for security. This could present issues if the system fails or the user’s facial features change significantly due to injury or surgery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The future of Face ID search in smartphones looks promising. By 2025, it will be more accurate, secure, and integrated with other technologies, enhancing the user experience and providing improved functionality. Whether for security, payments, or personalization, Face ID search will be a key player in how we interact with our smartphones.</p>

 Frequently Asked Questions<p></p>
<p></p> 
 1) What is Face ID search, and how does it work? 
<p>Face ID search uses facial recognition technology to unlock your smartphone by scanning unique facial features and matching them to a stored template.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2) Is Face ID search more secure than traditional passwords? 
<p>Yes, Face ID search is more secure as it uses biometric data, which is harder to guess or steal compared to traditional passwords.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3) Can Face ID search be fooled by photos or videos? 
<p>Modern Face ID systems use liveness detection, making it difficult for photos or videos to fool the system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4) What happens if Face ID search doesn’t recognize my face? 
<p>If Face ID fails, you can unlock your device with an alternative method like a password, PIN, or fingerprint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5) Will Face ID search work if my face changes significantly (e.g., due to aging, makeup, or injury)? 
<p>Face ID can adapt to minor changes but might struggle with significant changes like severe injuries or drastic aging.</p>

<p>Nonprofits are under growing pressure to vet grantees, partners, and donors to meet global AML standards. This article outlines key KYC and KYB expectations in the U.S., UK, EU, Canada, and Australia – and shows how iComply enables automated risk screening without disrupting trust or operations.</p>
 
 Nonprofits and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are mission-driven – but increasingly, they’re also AML-obligated. Regulators, donors, and banking partners now expect them to verify counterparties, conduct due diligence on sub-recipients, and track risk exposure across jurisdictions. 
<p>Global AML rules are expanding—and nonprofits must ensure their programs and funds are not diverted for criminal or terrorist use.</p>
 
 Emerging AML Obligations for Nonprofits 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, IRS, Department of State 
 Requirements: Due diligence on foreign grantees, donor vetting, sanctions screening, and enhanced scrutiny of transactions involving high-risk countries 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulators: Charity Commission, HMRC 
 Requirements: Financial controls, PEP and sanctions screening, and governance reviews for organizations handling overseas grants 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National charity bodies, AML authorities 
 Requirements: UBO transparency, transaction monitoring, GDPR-compliant due diligence, and STR obligations 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: CRA, FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Anti-terrorist financing controls, donor due diligence, reporting obligations, and foreign activity reviews 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: ACNC, AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF compliance for overseas programs, sanctions compliance, and source-of-funds transparency 
 
 
 Challenges Nonprofits Face 
<p>1. Resource Constraints<br>
Small compliance teams, tight budgets, and limited infrastructure</p>
<p>2. Complex Grant Networks<br>
Sub-grantees, international affiliates, and in-country partners with limited transparency</p>
<p>3. Donor Sensitivity<br>
Trust and confidentiality must be preserved during verification</p>
<p>4. High-Risk Regions<br>
Operations often focus on areas with elevated AML or sanctions risk</p>
 
 iComply: Mission-Aligned AML Tools for Nonprofits 
<p>iComply offers a lightweight, privacy-respecting AML platform that supports risk screening and verification across the nonprofit ecosystem.</p>
 1. KYC + KYB for Partners and Grantees 
 
 Verify local nonprofits, vendors, and individuals with document and registry checks 
 Onboard stakeholders using multilingual, mobile-ready portals 
 Collect declarations, signatures, and supporting documentation securely 
 
 2. Sanctions and Risk Screening 
 
 Screen partners and donors against OFAC, EU, UN, and national sanctions lists 
 Apply configurable thresholds and refresh cycles 
 Automate PEP/adverse media checks without storing unnecessary PII 
 
 3. Privacy-First Infrastructure 
 
 Data processed on-device before transmission 
 Full compliance with PIPEDA, GDPR, and local privacy laws 
 Configurable consent workflows and retention schedules 
 
 4. Case Management and Reporting 
 
 Assign compliance reviews and track escalations 
 Export audit logs for internal governance or third-party funders 
 Maintain a defensible trail of due diligence 
 
 
 Case Insight: Charitable Gifting Platform 
<p>A Canadian-registered charitable gifting platform operating across North America adopted iComply to manage grantee and partner due diligence. Results:</p>
 
 Screened 60+ partners in under 4 weeks 
 Flagged one entity with prior sanction exposure 
 Increased trust with a major foundation through automated compliance 
 
 
 The Bottom Line 
<p>Doing good doesn’t exempt you from doing due diligence. Nonprofits that integrate smart, mission-aligned compliance tools can:</p>
 
 Meet funder and regulatory expectations 
 Maintain operational focus 
 Build donor and partner trust 
 
<p>Talk to iComply to learn how we help nonprofits automate global AML screening – without sacrificing impact or transparency.</p>

<p>Crypto exchanges are no longer content with just being marketplaces. Increasingly, they are launching their own networks. On the surface, this appears to be a bid to reduce costs or capture transaction fees. But the real agenda is bigger: to become the&nbsp;gateway.</p> The Strategic Position of Exchanges <p>Exchanges already sit at the most valuable chokepoints in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  They own the user&nbsp;funnels.  They aggregate liquidity.  They provide fiat on/off&nbsp;ramps.  They hold the keys to KYC and AML compliance, giving them regulatory leverage and privileged access to the intersection of traditional finance and&nbsp;crypto.  <p>By creating their own blockchains, exchanges extend this power. They no longer just host trading. They design the rails on which trading, applications, and interactions take place. In doing so, they secure the single sign-on (SSO) layer for Web3 and&nbsp;dApps.</p> A Familiar Playbook: Enterprises and Stablecoins <p>This strategy mirrors what is happening in traditional finance. Top enterprises and financial institutions are increasingly launching their own stablecoins, not because they want to compete with Bitcoin or Ethereum directly, but because they see stablecoins as the gateway to the digital financial system. Whoever owns the stablecoin rails owns the access point to payments, settlements, and capital&nbsp;flows.</p><p>In both cases — exchanges with blockchains and enterprises with stablecoins — the logic is the same: secure the gateway, and you secure the&nbsp;market.</p> Lessons from the&nbsp;Internet <p>We’ve seen this dynamic before. In the early days of the web, Facebook dominated single sign-on (SSO) by making “Login with Facebook” the default across apps and websites. Today, that role has largely shifted to Google, which owns identity and access at internet&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Exchanges are now attempting to replicate this playbook for Web3. By pushing users and developers onto their own chains, they position themselves as the default login layer of the crypto economy. Meanwhile, enterprises aim to achieve the same goal in finance through stablecoins, thereby creating a default settlement layer for the digital&nbsp;economy.</p> The Bigger&nbsp;Picture <p>What looks like fragmented innovation is in fact the same strategic move: to own the gateway layer of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Exchanges are building a crypto SSO for decentralized apps.<br>Enterprises are building a financial SSO for digital payments.</p><p>Both are racing to become the indispensable entry point to their respective domains.</p><p>And yet, there is a third frontier emerging: the gateway for AI-native infrastructure. That story belongs to HPP, and it’s one we’ll explore in the next&nbsp;article.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-6-why-exchanges-are-building-their-own-blockchains-6b6f56e23670">BC 101 #6: Why Exchanges Are Building Their Own Blockchains</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    This selection marks an important milestone for Thales and Stinville in the ongoing air traffic modernization in Latin America with the award of a first contract for CORPAC (Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation) which aims to improve the processing of aeronautical messages with TopSky - AMHS (Aeronautical Message Handling System).  This new system will cover more than 35 sites across the country and will optimize communication between air traffic control centers, airports, and international air navigation service providers (ANSPs).  This contract, in collaboration with Thales’s local partner Stinville, represents a significant advancement for the country's aeronautical infrastructure, further establishing Thales as a key partner in the modernization of air traffic management in Latin America.

<p>The UAE’s crypto story has often been framed as a race to innovate. But Q3 2025 marks a turning point: regulators aren’t just experimenting anymore — they’re enforcing. Across Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the mainland, five authorities pushed new rules that will reshape how stablecoins, tokenized assets, and payment tokens operate in one of the world’s most ambitious digital-asset hubs.</p> Stablecoins and RWAs Step Into the Spotlight <p>Dubai’s VARA made its Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook effective this June, locking in disclosure duties, reserve requirements, and full licensing for fiat-referenced (FRVA) and asset-referenced (ARVA) tokens. Translation? If you want to issue a stablecoin or tokenize real-world assets in Dubai, you’re now playing by institutional-grade rules — and VARA is already testing the waters with enforcement.</p> Securities Meet Sukuk on&nbsp;Chain <p>The SCA introduced a new framework for Security and Commodity Tokens, bringing digital contracts under existing securities law. At the same time, it consulted on tokenized sukuk, hinting at a future where Islamic finance and blockchain converge. If realised, that could be a global first — making sukuk more accessible and liquid through fractionalisation.</p> ADGM: Innovation With Guardrails <p>In Abu Dhabi, the FSRA updated its digital-asset guidance, streamlined approvals, and drew a hard line against privacy coins and algorithmic stablecoins. It also opened consultation on fiat-referenced tokens — expanding oversight to custody, payments, and intermediation. The message is clear: ADGM wants to attract serious players, but only those willing to play inside the guardrails.</p> Payments Tighten Under the Central&nbsp;Bank <p>The CBUAE officially ended its transition period for Payment Token Services. From now on, general retail payments onshore can only be made with licensed, dirham-pegged stablecoins. For merchants and PSPs, that narrows the rails to CBUAE-approved tokens — a major nudge toward a domestic stablecoin ecosystem.</p> Real Estate Goes On-Chain — And Sells&nbsp;Out <p>Perhaps the most headline-grabbing news came from the Dubai Land Department (DLD). Its property-title tokenization pilots sold out instantly, drawing hundreds of investors from dozens of countries. With the launch of the DIFC PropTech Hub, the UAE is building a sandbox-to-scale pipeline for tokenized real estate. In a country where property is king, this is a glimpse of the&nbsp;future.</p> The Quiet Challenge: Data &amp; the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Behind all these flashy pilots and frameworks lies a less visible, but equally crucial shift: compliance with the FATF Travel Rule. VASPs must now share user data across borders, creating new privacy risks and operational headaches. This is where tools like Shyft Veriscope come in — offering a frictionless, peer-to-peer way to comply without parking sensitive data in centralised databases. For firms in the UAE, that could be the difference between regulatory success and privacy&nbsp;failure.</p> Why This Quarter&nbsp;Matters <p>The UAE is moving from regulatory ambition to execution. Stablecoins are regulated, tokenized assets have clear pathways, and payments are narrowing to licensed rails. At the same time, real estate tokenization is proving there’s real demand beyond&nbsp;theory.</p><p>For founders, issuers, and investors, the signal is clear: the UAE isn’t just a crypto playground anymore — it’s becoming a serious, rules-based market. Those who embrace compliance as part of their strategy, rather than a burden, will be best placed to ride the next wave of&nbsp;growth.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule. Enhanced by User Signing, it enables VASPs to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, streamlining the compliance process.</p><p>For more information, visit our website and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/contact">contact</a> our team for a discussion.

<p>The 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant for Identity Verification report offers compelling insights and underscores a critical reality: identity verification sits at the core of cybersecurity. This annual report—departing from the usual bi-annual cycle—highlights the escalating threat of identity-based attacks and the rapid technological evolution needed to counter them.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes growing concerns about identity fraud in critical business operations. In logistics and transportation, for example, false identity credentials create significant operational and liability risks. When unverified, untrained, or uninsured individuals operate commercial vehicles, companies face regulatory violations, safety incidents, and supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>Recent headlines about <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/scattered-spider-cybercrime-hackers">Scattered Spider</a> social engineering attacks and an <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250723-4">FBI warning about North Korean operatives</a> targeting American businesses through hiring fraud illuminate the current threat landscape. These incidents demonstrate that traditional identity verification processes are failing under modern attack methods.</p>
 Our Journey to Leader in Workforce Identity in One Year 
<p>Last year, 1Kosmos was selected from numerous competitors to join the Magic Quadrant alongside a handful of other vendors. Twelve months later—after tripling our annual recurring revenue (ARR) and securing $57 million in venture backing—we’ve emerged as the sole solution provider in the Challenger quadrant.</p>
<p>More significantly, 1Kosmos ranked Highest for Workforce Use Cases in the <a>2025 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Identity Verification</a> report. This recognition validates our core principle: securing the person, not just the credential, forms the foundation of modern enterprise security.</p>
<p></p>
 What Sets 1Kosmos Apart: The Trifecta of Trust 
<p>Gartner’s analysis highlighted three core strengths that differentiate 1Kosmos:</p>
 1. FedRAMP High Authorization 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform has achieved <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2334936522">FedRAMP High Authorization</a> —the highest security compliance level under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. 1Kosmos is the only vendor holding this authorization while also being a Kantara-certified full-service Credential Service Provider (CSP). Since we offer the same platform to commercial customers, these organizations benefit from an identity verification solution that has passed rigorous testing against over 420 separate security controls.</p>
 2. Comprehensive Integration Ecosystem 
<p>While many identity verification vendors struggle with basic workforce integrations, 1Kosmos provides deep, prebuilt connectors across the identity and access management stack. We integrate seamlessly with Active Directory, Ping, CyberArk, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and emerging tools for recruitment and IT service management.</p>
 3. Advanced Biometric Authentication 
<p>Our extensive face biometrics experience extends beyond one-time verification. We enable continuous, adaptive authentication that detects and responds to threats in real-time, creating a persistent security layer that evolves with your risk profile. No other vendor offers this comprehensive support for both identity verification and a reusable identity wallet for biometric authentication.</p>
 Innovation That Drives Results 
<p>Our privacy-by-design architecture represents more than marketing messaging—it’s a fundamental <a>architectural advantage</a>. By combining identity verification, passwordless authentication, and a distributed ledger for user-managed privacy, we’ve created a platform that rapidly adapts to new threats and requirements.</p>
<p>This approach recently earned recognition from KuppingerCole, who ranked 1Kosmos highest in innovation among identity verification vendors in their <a>2025 Leadership Compass for Identity Verification</a> report. When two leading analyst firms independently validate your technical approach, it signals you’re solving problems correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results demonstrate our platform’s effectiveness: customers have reduced identity fraud by more than 40% within six months of deployment, while our global platform processes over one billion daily authentications for 75+ million users.</p>
 Solving Real Business Problems 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform defends against stolen and fake identities daily at some of the world’s largest organizations, whether addressing in-person or online identity fraud.</p>
<p>We protect major retailers from identity fraud at point-of-sale and equipment rental locations. We secure logins for one of the largest global business process outsourcing firms and support one of the world’s largest FIDO2 deployments.</p>
<p>Our solutions protect healthcare workers and secure patient information for medical service providers, while enabling workforce logins at major financial services firms worldwide.</p>
 The 1Kosmos Difference: Complete Digital Identity 
<p>Combining identity verification, passwordless authentication, and user-controlled privacy in a single platform that supports both customers and workers delivers concrete business value.</p>
<p>This approach provides more than enhanced security against hiring fraud and social engineering attacks on IT service desks—it improves user experience. When employees can securely access all work applications through a single, verified digital identity, productivity increases while security risk decreases.</p>
<p>We’re the only company providing users with a digital identity wallet they control, enabling convenient and secure access to enterprise applications like Microsoft, Saviynt, ServiceNow, and Epic.</p>
<p>For privileged access management, our platform ensures that access to mission-critical systems remains tied to verified, identity-backed biometrics.</p>
 Speed of Deployment, Strength of Security 
<p>For enterprise decision-makers, 1Kosmos delivers these capabilities through rapidly deployable cloud services. While point solutions can require weeks or months to implement, our platform typically deploys in hours to days. In a threat environment where speed matters, this deployment advantage can mean the difference between preventing an attack and becoming a headline.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>Gartner’s recognition validates our approach while reinforcing our responsibility to continue pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities in identity security. As threats evolve, our defenses must evolve accordingly. The criminals behind Scattered Spider and similar operations are sophisticated and well-funded—our response must be equally sophisticated and agile.</p>
<p>We’re building more than improved identity verification; we’re constructing the foundation for a more secure digital economy where trust is verifiable, privacy is preserved, and organizations can confidently embrace digital transformation without compromising security or convenience.</p>
<p>The future of enterprise security begins with identity. And identity security starts with verified trust.</p>

 Are you ready for the future of Gaming? Prepared for the industry’s upcoming fraud and compliance challenges? IDnow’s identity verification experts will be on hand to answer all your IDV-related questions at Booth E405.&nbsp; 



 



<p>We will be attending <a href="https://sbcevents.com/sbc-summit/?promo=sbcmrktng--OawKYL0X&amp;utm_source=google%20&amp;utm_medium=cpc%20&amp;utm_campaign=sbcs-25&amp;utm_content=search-branded-ad3&amp;tr=true&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22426452479&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABJMA8uR9ESczJmVRW8tfw96VADSr&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjww4TGBhCKARIsAFLXndQOq6_bvKt1zGJoMQzF3XL8dc6PxjVqJ07j20slJlPSvHzxOa1VaSoaAoAUEALw_wcB">SBC Summit</a> in Lisbon from September 16-18 to share actionable insights on how to onboard players in seconds, remain compliant throughout Europe, and block fraud before it impacts the customer experience. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">first companies in Europe</a> to receive certification under the latest ETSI standard for remote identity proofing (a key requirement for eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI Wallet compliance), IDnow is well equipped to assess how prepared and future-ready businesses are for upcoming regulatory challenges. The team can be found at Booth E405 in Hall 4 and will be demonstrating how its wide range of automated and expert-led identity verification solutions can unlock safer and more secure gaming experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming operators are also invited to swing by to check out some of IDnow’s latest product developments, from its expanded fraud prevention technology to its NFC-enabled offering, which provides a seamless and streamlined experience, from document tap to trusted onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At midday on September 18, don’t forget to head over to Stage 3 – Technology &amp; Compliance to attend the ‘AML 2.0: Getting Serious about Fraud’ panel.</p>



<p>This will be a great opportunity to hear from Edouard Baussier, Solution Sales Director at IDnow, who, alongside other industry leaders and insiders, will explore how AI, real-time data, and regulations are transforming AML efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Traditional AML strategies are often too rule-based and reactive; focusing more on catching yesterday’s fraud than tomorrow’s. I look forward to joining my peers from the gaming and gambling space to explore how AI, data enrichment and behavioral analytics could be used to shape the future of AML.</p>Edouard Baussier, Solution Sales Director at IDnow</blockquote>



 Hoping for the treble.&nbsp; 



<p>IDnow will also be hoping history repeats itself at this year’s SBC Awards (taking place on the final day of SBC Summit Lisbon on September 18,) as it has once again been nominated for the ‘Fraud and Compliance Solution of the Year’ award.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having won the award in both 2023 and 2024, the Munich-headquartered identity verification platform provider will be hoping to win the prestigious award for three years in a row.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From opening a bank account to approving a mortgage or executing a cross-border payment, trust in a person’s digital identity is what keeps the financial system running smoothly. But in Europe, the digital identity landscape has long been fragmented with each country relying on its own tools, trust schemes, and identity providers. For financial services providers operating across borders, that means rising compliance costs, customer friction, and missed growth opportunities. The EU’s eIDAS 2.0 regulation is about to change all that, and for banks, insurers, and fintechs, the implications are massive.</p>

<p>At Bluesky, we’re working to drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open
and decentralized public conversation. We built our app to provide you with
better choices when it comes to privacy, expression, and safety. That’s why we
give people options for how content moderation works, on top of our baseline
policies.</p>
<p>We recognize that promoting safety for young people is a shared responsibility,
and we support the idea of collective action to protect children from online
risks. We also recognize that governments may have strong, often conflicting,
views on these issues and how to weigh competing priorities. In this rapidly
evolving regulatory environment, our goal is to respect the law while balancing
safety, free expression, and user privacy to serve the greater good of our
community. Responding to new laws and regulations will require pragmatism and
flexibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/07-10-2025-age-assurance">In the UK</a>, we
complied with a new law that requires platforms to restrict children from
accessing adult content. <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-22-2025-mississippi-hb1126">In
Mississippi</a>, the
law requires us to restrict access to the site for every unverified user. To
implement this change, we would have had to invest substantial resources in a
solution that we believe limits free speech and disproportionately harms smaller
platforms. We chose not to offer our service there at this time while legal
challenges continue.</p>
<p>South Dakota and Wyoming have also passed online safety laws that impose
requirements on services like ours. These are very similar to the requirements
of the UK Online Safety Act. So, as we did in the UK, we’ll enable <a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US/services/age-verification">Kids Web
Services’
(KWS)</a> age
verification solution for users in these states. Through KWS, Bluesky users in
South Dakota and Wyoming can choose from multiple methods to verify their age.
We believe this approach currently strikes the right balance. Bluesky will
remain available to users in these states, and we will not need to restrict the
app for everyone.</p>
<p>We’re committed to keeping our community informed as we navigate these new
regulations. As more states and countries adopt similar requirements, we will
update this blog post accordingly.</p>
<p>Update, September 26: Ohio has a law similar to South Dakota and Wyoming
regulations, so we'll be implementing the same solution in Ohio, effective
September 29th.</p>

				  With leading research company Juniper predicting a “fraud tidal wave,” Indicio’s authenticated biometric credential solution is a simple, powerful, cost effective defense against synthetic identity fraud and deepfakes while also streamlining account access, mobile, and cross-border payments.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Juniper Research <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/18/3134696/0/en/Fraud-to-Cost-Financial-Institutions-58-3-Billion-by-2030-Globally-as-Synthetic-Identities-Threaten-Fraud-Tidal-Wave.html">predicts</a> fraud will cost financial institutions $58.3 billion dollars, globally, by 2030 —&nbsp;and the bill is coming from synthetic identity fraud, where real, stolen, and fake information is combined to trick institutions into opening accounts and granting credit.</p>
<p>Add this to bots, phishing attacks, account takeovers, and AI being used to accelerate attacks, and generate deepfakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the demand for seamless, fast, mobile banking and payments has only increased. Juniper also forecasts that mobile payments will grow to over $8 trillion dollars by 2028.</p>
 Money 20/20 — Indicio is “poised to transform the world of money” 
<p>We’re doing this with authenticated biometric credentials, a simple, cost-effective solution to these authentication and KYC problems that can scale from the smallest SME to the corporations and countries.</p>
<p>With Indicio Proven software, any government issued identity document containing an image can be bound to the person who rightfully owns it — through a combination of face-mapping and liveness checking. And through our partnership with Regula, thousands of official identity documents from all over the world can be validated as authentic.</p>
<p>The result is a Verifiable Credential that contains an authenticated biometric — a combination of personal identity data and a biometric image that can be presented anywhere for instant verification — no centralized storage of personal or biometric data needed.</p>
<p>What makes this so powerful is that the issuer of the credential —&nbsp;a bank, a brokerage, a financial institution — can be cryptographically proven, along with the integrity of the data.</p>
<p>And this authentication takes place before any data is shared.</p>
<p>So if you trust the bank, you can trust the information in the credential —&nbsp;plus, you can automatically compare a live image of the person with a tamper-proof copy of their biometrics, a simple way to identify deepfakes.</p>
<p>The result is the most powerful digital identity in the global marketplace — one that can be created in minutes and verified with simple mobile software anywhere.</p>
<p>Bonus — with Indicio Proven, your authenticated biometric credential is globally interoperable, meaning it can work with the European Union’s new Digital Identity Wallet.</p>
 Indicio —&nbsp;the IDV disruptors 
<p>We first created this solution to enable seamless border crossing with the world’s first digital passport credential based on international standards. We won awards. But more importantly, we saw how this could transform identity verification for everyone and meet the emerging challenges of synthetic identity fraud.</p>
<p>Our software enables anyone to hold an authenticated biometric of themselves and instantly share it anywhere as the ultimate proof of identity in a world of fakery. And we also make it easy to verify anywhere, even offline.</p>
<p>It’s simple to implement —&nbsp;it will work with your existing systems. It’s simple to use —&nbsp;generate or scan a QR code; integrate with existing biometric infrastructure. And it is significantly less expensive than traditional IDV — but you’ll have to contact us to find out by how much.</p>
<p>The question is, in a world where synthetic identities and deepfakes threaten the financial security of your company, can you afford not to ask for a Proven biometric?</p>
 Getting Started 
<p>To get a better understanding of the technologies involved, you can visit our <a href="https://indicio.tech/banking-and-finance/">banking and finance page.</a> To discuss specifics or learn how you can start integrating this solution into your systems today, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact our team</a> and we will be happy to answer any questions or set up a time for a free consultation.</p>

			 José Navalon is Lead Backend Developer, he joined the company in 2021. 
 Reflecting on the 4-year Journey 
 You’ve been with the company for four years, as a Lead Backend Developer. How has the company supported your growth during this time? 
<p>These 4 years at Tokeny have honestly flown by. From the beginning, I’ve had a lot of freedom to propose ideas, build things from scratch, and push improvements across the backend. That kind of trust and ownership really helped me grow, not just technically but also in how I approach teamwork and long-term architecture. It’s been a great place to keep learning while actually making an impact.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>When I joined, Tokeny felt very startup-like. The team was small, and everyone wore multiple hats. Even though we’ve grown a lot, that openness and transparency are still there. What’s changed is that the different departments are way more aligned now. Marketing, product, tech… we’re all more connected, and that helps a lot in daily work.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “Above all, people still care, which makes it easy to stay motivated.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “Above all, people still care, which makes it easy to stay motivated.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>I’ve definitely grown a lot here. In the beginning, I focused mostly on solving backend tasks, but over time I started thinking more about the full picture: scalability, performance, developer experience, and how backend supports business needs. I’ve also learned how to mentor others, manage complexity better, and communicate across teams. I guess I’ve moved from just coding to building systems that last.</p>
<p>The last point I’d like to emphasize is that our team is committed to both achieving results and maintaining work-life balance. When urgent matters arise, we tackle them swiftly and efficiently, ensuring that nothing is left unresolved. At the same time, if no urgent issues arise, we ensure that our team members can fully enjoy their holidays, recognizing that recharging is essential for sustained performance. This balanced approach allows us to consistently deliver exceptional results while keeping the team motivated and at their best.</p>

 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you enjoyed working with a team that is honest and transparent. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team used this honesty, and how it was received? 
<p>One example that sticks with me was during a backend refactor. Halfway through, we realized our initial plan wasn’t working well. Instead of pushing forward blindly, we stopped, had a proper conversation, and agreed to pivot. It was a bit uncomfortable at first, but being honest saved us time and stress. And the team appreciated the transparency. It turned into a better solution in the end.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 
<p>I’d probably tell myself: “Don’t try to be the hero, collaborate more, and ask questions earlier.” Also: “Write better docs. Future-you will hate current-you if you don’t.” 😅And finally: enjoy the ride, it’s a great team and there’s a lot to learn if you stay curious</p>
 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>I think Tokeny is on track to become one of the key players in regulated digital assets, especially as more institutions look for serious infrastructure.</p>

			 “I see us moving toward even more modular and scalable services.” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			<p>Potentially even opening new products or markets. I’d love to keep helping with that, especially on the architecture side, and also mentoring new developers as the team grows.</p>
 Finally, as we’ve gotten to know you over the years, you’ve often shared your love for cooking traditional Valencian dishes. Do any learnings or skills from these hobbies translate into your work at Tokeny 
<p>For me, it’s all about timing, balance, and attention to detail. That actually translates really well into how I work. In backend development, you also need the right ingredients, a solid plan, and a lot of care to build something that works smoothly. Both give me that same feeling when everything comes together just right.</p>

<p>“We’ve been talking about identity and access for people for decades (well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password#History">millennia</a> if you think outside the tech box). Policies, role assignments, reviews, zero trust — these are familiar tools. The assumptions that go into them, however, don’t quite work when the “user” is no longer a person.”</p>



<p>Enter in the AI Agent.</p>



<p>An AI doesn’t log in, perform a task, and then head off to lunch. It doesn’t get tired, second-guess itself, or stop at the boundaries we assume people understand. Instead, it keeps going (was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energizer_Bunny">Energizer Bunny</a> an early AI? Hmmmm) at a scale no human can match. That difference matters. The way we’ve designed permissions for humans has always relied on certain constraints: limited speed, bounded intent, and oversight cycles that can reasonably keep up.</p>



<p>When the actor is an AI, those constraints are gone. What we’re left with is a gap between the pace at which machines can act and the pace at which human-designed governance can respond. Unfortunately, I don’t think that the gap can be smoothed over with existing tools.</p>



<p>This post looks at three of those cracks: how policy enforcement differs for people and AIs, why runtime governance becomes essential, and what zero trust does (and doesn’t) offer when roles blur.</p>

 Policy enforcement for people vs. AIs 



<p>With humans, policies usually align with job functions: a role grants access, and reviews catch drift over time. Even if people sometimes work around the edges of a policy, they’re bounded by human limits: a person can only click so fast, submit so many forms, or request so many resources. Enforcement mechanisms are tuned to those limits.</p>



<p>With AI, those assumptions evaporate. One executive at a very large enterprise told me — and asked me not to name them publicly — that they’d watched their own AI agents behave exactly like an attacker. The agents weren’t malicious; they were just single-minded. When faced with a roadblock, they tried every possible permutation of the request until something went through. From the agent’s point of view, this was just persistence in solving a problem. From a security team’s perspective, it looked indistinguishable from a brute-force attack.</p>



<p>That story captures the core difference: enforcing policies on humans is about constraining intent, while enforcing policies on AIs is about constraining behavior patterns that can unfold at machine speed.</p>



 Why runtime governance matters more 



<p>Oversight loops designed for quarterly certifications or annual audits simply don’t scale when an AI can run thousands of actions in seconds. Quarterly access reviews, audit reports, entitlement certifications: these are slow, deliberate checks designed for slow, deliberate actors. That’s why governance is shifting toward runtime validation. NIST’s <a href="https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/ai-research/nists-ai-standards-zero-drafts-pilot-project-accelerate">AI Standards “Zero Drafts” Pilot Project</a> makes a similar point in its early work on Testing, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation (TEVV): evaluation results are time-bound and must be re-established in live contexts as systems and environments change.</p>



<p>But an AI agent can spin through thousands of transactions in seconds. If one of those transactions violates policy, you don’t have three months to catch it. By the time the audit report lands, the damage is done.</p>



<p>That’s why runtime governance matters more in an AI world. Instead of periodic reviews, you need ongoing checks that validate each action in real time against business state, risk scores, and context. Governance has to run in the same tight loops as the systems it’s meant to protect. The consequences here aren’t theoretical. Weak runtime governance shows up directly in compliance failures, operational risks, and security exposures. If your audit assumes human pacing but your agents act at machine speed, that mismatch can quickly become costly.</p>



<p>This isn’t a radical departure from what we already know, but it is definitely a sidestep. It’s the same shift we’ve been making with zero-trust networking when verifying every access, every time. But with AIs, the volume and unpredictability make runtime enforcement non-negotiable.</p>



 Zero trust and blurred roles 



<p>Zero trust, in human terms, is simple enough: don’t assume trust based on location or role; verify every request.</p>



<p>But what does that look like when an AI agent is simultaneously:</p>



 
 Acting as a customer service rep, 



 Writing new code modules, 



 Spinning up cloud infrastructure, and 



 Querying internal HR data? 
 



<p>With people, those roles are clearly separated. With an AI, the boundaries collapse. The same system may be acting across functions at once, not because of malice but because it was asked to “just get the job done.”</p>



<p>Zero trust principles such as least privilege, continuous verification, and minimizing standing access still apply, but they need a new level of granularity. Instead of asking “Does this role have permission to access this system?”, the question becomes “Does this pattern of behavior still look acceptable, given what this agent is trying to achieve?”</p>



<p>And that’s not a static answer. It has to be recalculated in real-time because the roles themselves blur when machines act faster than our ability to categorize them.</p>



 What really changes? 



<p>For humans, permissions are about who can do what. For AIs, permissions are about what actions are acceptable, in what sequence, at what speed, and with what guardrails.</p>



<p>The shift is from assigning access to governing behavior, from periodic reviews to runtime enforcement, static roles to dynamic patterns. It’s not that the old tools are obsolete. Roles, reviews, and zero trust still matter, but they’re no longer sufficient on their own. When your “users” are tireless, literal, and unimaginably fast, you need governance that matches that pace.</p>



<p>The enterprise anecdote I mentioned earlier — of an AI acting like an attacker just to finish its assigned task — is a preview. It’s what happens when yesterday’s assumptions about permission models meet today’s machine-driven reality.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/08/12/agentic-ai-and-open-standards/">earlier post</a> on Agentic AI in the open standards community, I mentioned that standardization work is starting to grapple with these questions, too. Whether it’s NIST’s early TEVV guidance or W3C and IETF discussions on agent behavior, there’s a growing recognition that machine permissions as much a governance challenge as they are a technical one. </p>



 Closing thought 



<p>The real change isn’t in the idea of permissions itself. It’s in the urgency of treating permissions as living, runtime checks rather than dusty entitlements waiting for an audit.</p>



<p>So here’s my question to you: Are your permissions models built for human pace or machine pace? If you’ve already run into this problem in your deployments, I’d love to hear what you saw and how you dealt with it.</p>

 Transcript 



 Permissions in the Age of AI Agents 



<p>[00:00:30] Hi everyone, and welcome back.</p>



<p>[00:00:32] Today I want to talk about something that sounds deceptively familiar: permissions. Specifically—who is allowed to access what, when, where, why, and how?</p>



<p>[00:00:42] The tech space has been dealing with identity and access for decades. It’s a core concept not only for cybersecurity, but also for how businesses function.</p>



<p>[00:00:50] And honestly, if you zoom out far enough, humanity has been grappling with this concept for millennia—whether priests deciding who can enter a temple, or sysadmins deciding who can SSH into a server.</p>



 



 Policy Enforcement in a Human vs. AI World 



 



<p>[00:01:02] My very first tech job was in the 90s as a Galacticom BBS operator. My primary function was to create accounts, group users, and ban them when needed. In other words, managing who could and couldn’t access certain spaces.</p>



<p>[00:01:30] Enter stage left: the AI agent.</p>



<p>[00:01:34] Unlike humans, AI agents don’t self-limit. People get tired, bored, or notice they’re pushing too far. They can only click so fast or request so many resources before fatigue sets in.</p>



<p>[00:01:52] AI does not have those limits. It doesn’t need a coffee break. It doesn’t get bored. And it doesn’t stop at the guardrails we assume humans understand.</p>



 
 Humans → bounded by natural constraints 



 AI → tireless, literal, and unimaginably fast 
 



<p>[00:02:07] That difference matters. For years, permissions assumed humans were the actors—even bad actors. Governance cycles, reviews, and controls were tuned to human pace and intent.</p>



<p>[00:02:29] But when the actor is an AI, those assumptions fall apart. What we’re left with is a widening gap between machine speed and human-designed governance.</p>



 



 Governance at Machine Speed 



 



<p>[00:02:46] In this episode, I want to dig into three challenges:</p>



 
 How policy enforcement differs for people and AIs 



 Why runtime governance becomes essential 



 What zero trust really gives us when roles blur 
 



<p>[00:03:00] Let’s start with policy enforcement.</p>



<p>[00:03:03] With humans, policies align with job functions. Roles grant access, and reviews catch drift. Sure, people sometimes find workarounds, but their intent and ability are still bounded.</p>



<p>[00:03:20] With AI, those assumptions evaporate.</p>



<p>[00:03:37] I spoke with an executive at a large enterprise who shared a telling story. Their AI agents behaved almost exactly like attackers—not because they were malicious, but because they were single-minded.</p>



 
 The AI hit a roadblock 



 Instead of asking for new permissions, it tried every possible permutation until something worked 



 To the AI, that was persistence. To the security team, it looked like brute force 
 



<p>[00:04:10] Here’s the difference:</p>



 
 With humans → enforcing policies means constraining intent 



 With AI → enforcing policies means constraining behavior at machine speeds 
 



 



 Why Runtime Governance Matters 



 



<p>[00:04:25] Oversight cycles work for people: quarterly reviews, annual audits, entitlement certifications.</p>



<p>[00:04:42] But AI agents can execute thousands of transactions in seconds. If just one violates policy, waiting months for an audit report is far too late.</p>



<p>[00:04:56] This mismatch shows up in:</p>



 
 Failed audits 



 Blown budgets 



 Security incidents no one saw coming 
 



<p>[00:05:16] This is why runtime governance matters more in an AI world. Instead of periodic reviews, we need continuous validation:</p>



 
 Every action checked in real time 



 Risk scores recalculated constantly 



 Context updated dynamically 
 



<p>[00:05:29] NIST is already moving in this direction with the AI Standards Zero Drafts. One key theme: evaluation results are time-bound.</p>



<p>[00:05:52] AI permissions can’t be static entitlements waiting for audits. They must be living checks, recalculated as conditions shift.</p>



 



 Rethinking Zero Trust 



 



<p>[00:06:23] Let’s talk about zero trust.</p>



<p>[00:06:25] For humans, the principle is simple: don’t assume trust based on network location or job role. Verify every request.</p>



<p>[00:06:42] But what happens when the “user” is an AI agent?</p>



<p>[00:06:53] Unlike humans, who work within distinct roles, an AI might simultaneously:</p>



 
 Act as a customer service rep 



 Write new code modules 



 Spin up cloud infrastructure 



 Query HR data 
 



<p>[00:06:59] No human does all of that at once. But for AI, boundaries collapse.</p>



<p>[00:07:17] Zero trust still applies—least privilege, continuous verification, minimizing standing access. But it must go further.</p>



<p>[00:07:23] The real question isn’t does this role have access? It’s:</p>



 
 Does this behavior pattern look acceptable given the AI’s task? 
 



<p>[00:07:30] And those patterns aren’t static. They must be recalculated in real time because roles blur faster than we can categorize them.</p>



 



 From Permissions to Governance 



 



<p>[00:07:40] So what really changes when the user is an AI?</p>



 
 For humans → permissions define who can do what 



 For AIs → permissions define what actions are acceptable, in what sequence, at what speed, under which guardrails 
 



<p>[00:07:53] This represents a fundamental shift:</p>



 
 From assigning access → to governing behavior 



 From periodic reviews → to runtime enforcement 



 From static roles → to dynamic patterns 
 



<p>[00:08:18] Roles, reviews, and zero trust still matter. But on their own, they’re no longer enough when users act tirelessly and unimaginably fast.</p>



<p>[00:08:31] The anecdote I shared earlier of an AI acting like an attacker? That’s what happens when yesterday’s permission models collide with today’s machine-driven reality.</p>



 



 The Urgency of Machine-Ready Permissions 



 



<p>[00:08:47] This isn’t just happening inside one enterprise. Standards bodies like W3C and IETF are also recognizing that permissions for machines are more than just a technical detail.</p>



<p>[00:09:05] The real shift isn’t only about permissions—it’s about urgency. Permissions can’t sit as dusty entitlements waiting for audits. They must become runtime checks, recalibrated constantly for actors without human limits.</p>



<p>[00:09:22] So here’s a question for you: Are your permission models built for human pace, or for machine pace?</p>



<p>[00:09:33] If you’ve already seen cracks—your AI systems bumping up against the edges of human-centric permission models—I’d love to hear your stories. Maybe they’ll even make it into a future post.</p>

<p>Munich, September 9, 2025 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, and Docusign, the Intelligent Agreement Management company, today announced the launch of a joint solution enabling customers’ compliance with Germany’s Anti-Money Laundering (Geldwäschegesetz, or GwG) law through secure and automated identity verification and electronic signatures, powered by Germany’s electronic ID (eID).</p>



 A joint solution for trust, speed, and compliance 



<p>The new joint offering is designed to support customers’ obligations to meet GwG requirements and is aligned with evolving BaFin guidance and the EU eIDAS regulation, streamlining digital onboarding and agreement processes across regulated industries. This collaboration addresses the increasing demand for compliant, user-friendly digital identification services in the German market, particularly in sectors such as finance, insurance, and public administration.</p>



<p>In light of recent legislative discussions in Germany around enabling more automated identity solutions under GwG, and the growing expectation among users for faster and more intuitive experiences, this partnership broadens the available options for secure and compliant digital identification, reflecting the industry’s ongoing shift toward more flexible, future-ready technologies.</p>



 Leveraging combined expertise for enhanced solutions 



<p>This integrated solution leverages IDnow’s latest eID-based technology, fully integrated within the new AI-powered Docusign IAM platform. The process uses the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip and PIN functionality of German eID cards to enable automated, eIDAS-compliant, and binding e-signatures, allowing signers to verify their identity and complete agreements using just their smartphone, in under a minute. It delivers a seamless, secure and mobile-first experience, without video calls or manual checks, for both businesses and their customers.</p>



<p>Together, IDnow and Docusign now offer:</p>



  Solution to enable customers’ compliance with GwG using digital identification with Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)  



  A completely automated user experience, removing the need for video verification  



  Integration with Docusign’s trusted eSignature and Maestro workflows  



  Certification via IDnow Trust Services AB, an EU-accredited Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP)  



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>We are thrilled that Docusign has extended its existing partnership with IDnow, adding IDnow Trust Services AB to its network of qualified trust service providers, and leveraging our eID solution.</p>Uwe Stelzig, Managing Director DACH at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>“This partnership will not only streamline and accelerate digital signing processes for holders of the German eID card and resident permits but also make identification more convenient. With the growing complexity of digital regulations across Europe, it is more important than ever to have a secure, compliant and seamless solution in place for electronic signatures and identity verification,” added Stelzig.</p>



<p>“Germany is a priority market for Docusign, where we’re seeing digital transformation accelerate and demand for compliant, seamless digital experiences rise rapidly across financial services, insurance, and beyond,” said Maxime Hambersin, Senior Director, Product Management International at Docusign. “By combining our trusted eSignature capabilities with IDnow’s advanced identity verification, we’re removing friction while increasing compliance.”</p>

<p>Money service businesses (MSBs)—including remittance providers, currency exchanges, and prepaid platforms – face some of the strictest AML expectations globally. This article breaks down key KYC, KYB, KYT, and AML requirements in the U.S., UK, EU, Canada, Australia, and Singapore – and how iComply helps automate screening and reporting across borders.</p>
 
 Money service businesses (MSBs) operate in high-risk zones for financial crime, often processing large volumes of low-margin transactions across borders. As a result, regulators expect MSBs to maintain exceptional AML programs – on par with traditional banks. 
<p>With sanctions enforcement, PEP exposure, and transaction monitoring under scrutiny, MSBs need real-time, automated tools to meet growing global expectations.</p>
 
 AML Requirements for MSBs by Jurisdiction 
 United States 
 
 Regulator: FinCEN 
 Requirements: MSB registration, SARs, Travel Rule compliance, OFAC screening, and AML program implementation 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: AML registration, customer due diligence (CDD), sanctions/PEP screening, and transaction monitoring 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National AML authorities (under AMLD6) 
 Requirements: CDD, UBO verification, risk-based monitoring, and suspicious transaction reporting (STR) 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC 
 Requirements: MSB registration, client identification, sanctions list checks, STRs, and transaction recordkeeping 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF compliance, customer verification, risk assessment, sanctions screening, and SMRs 
 
 Singapore 
 
 Regulator: MAS 
 Requirements: AML licensing, KYC/EDD procedures, real-time screening, Travel Rule compliance, and robust recordkeeping 
 
 
 Top Compliance Challenges for MSBs 
<p>1. High Volume, Low Margin<br>
Manual processes are unsustainable at scale.</p>
<p>2. Multi-Jurisdictional Risk<br>
Global MSBs must satisfy overlapping and sometimes contradictory AML obligations.</p>
<p>3. Sanctions Exposure<br>
Real-time OFAC, UN, EU, and national list screening is mandatory—and changing daily.</p>
<p>4. Complex Workflows<br>
Onboarding, transaction monitoring, and alert handling often happen in siloed tools.</p>
 
 How iComply Supports Global MSBs 
<p>iComply offers MSBs a fully integrated platform to manage end-to-end AML workflows—designed to scale with global growth.</p>
 1. KYC + KYB with Edge Security 
 
 Verify individuals and businesses with on-device document processing 
 UBO mapping and risk profiling by geography, industry, and behavior 
 Supports ID types and languages in 195+ countries 
 
 2. Sanctions and PEP Screening 
 
 Real-time screening against OFAC, EU, UN, UK, and local lists 
 Refresh cycles and trigger-based review automation 
 Configurable thresholds and escalation rules 
 
 3. Transaction Monitoring (KYT) 
 
 Score by volume, frequency, and velocity 
 Detect structuring, layering, and red-flag behaviours 
 Trigger SAR/STR workflows automatically 
 
 4. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Assign reviews, document findings, and resolve alerts in one interface 
 Export audit logs for FinCEN, FCA, AUSTRAC, and others 
 
 5. Deployment and Data Governance 
 
 Cloud, private cloud, or on-premise setups 
 Data residency controls for sensitive jurisdictions (e.g., UAE, EU) 
 Consent management and end-to-end encryption 
 
 
 Case Insight: Global Remittance Platform 
<p>A cross-border remittance provider integrated iComply to centralize onboarding and monitoring across Africa, North America, and Europe:</p>
 
 Reduced sanctions screening false positives by 45% 
 Consolidated compliance review into one multilingual dashboard 
 Passed audits in three jurisdictions with unified audit logs 
 
 
 Final Thought 
<p>Regulators treat MSBs like banks – but most MSBs aren’t staffed or equipped like one. The only way forward is automation.</p>
<p>Talk to iComply to discover how our AML tools help MSBs manage global compliance, eliminate manual reviews, and focus on serving their customers.</p>

<p>Looking for a way to watch your favorite movies and TV shows without breaking the bank? The internet is filled with websites offering free streaming, but finding a reliable one can be tough. We’ve done the work for you, sifting through countless options to bring you a list of the top 10 sites to watch free movies online without hassle. Get ready to enjoy a high-quality streaming experience, all for free.</p>



 What to Look for When You Watch Free Movies Online 



 What Makes a Great Free Streaming Site? 



<p>Not all free streaming sites are created equal. The best platforms offer legal content, so you can watch without worrying about copyright issues. They also feature a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to find what you want to watch. Minimal ads are a must, as nothing ruins a movie marathon like constant interruptions. Finally, a great site should have strong device compatibility, allowing you to stream on your phone, tablet, or smart TV.</p>









 Stay Safe from Malware and Scams 



<p>When looking for free movies, you might encounter sites that seem too good to be true. Many unofficial streaming platforms are loaded with malware, pop-ups, and scams designed to steal your personal information or damage your device. To stay safe, always stick to trusted websites and avoid clicking on suspicious links. You should also use a secure browser like Herond Browser to protect your privacy and block malicious scripts.</p>



 Top 10 Free Platforms to Watch Free Movies Online for 2025 



 Tubi 



<p>Tubi offers a vast, ad-supported library of movies and TV shows across all genres. It’s a completely legal service with no subscription required, and it’s compatible with a wide range of devices, from smart TVs to mobile phones. You’ll find everything from cult classics to modern hits, making it a great choice for your next movie night.</p>

 Tips for Safe and Hassle-Free When You Watch Free Movies Online 



 Stream Legally, Stay Safe 



<p>To protect yourself from malware and scams, it’s crucial to stick to legal and trusted streaming platforms. Unofficial websites often contain malicious software, pop-up ads, and phishing attempts that can compromise your device and personal information. By using well-known services like Tubi, Pluto TV, or Crackle, you can enjoy your movies without any security risks, ensuring a hassle-free viewing experience.</p>

<p>Ready to get your heart racing? Dive into our top scariest movies of all time. From timeless classics that defined the genre to the new horror films of 2025 that will keep you up all night, we’ve got your next scream-filled movie marathon covered.</p>



 What Makes a Movie Truly Scary? 



 The Anatomy of a Scream 



<p>The most terrifying movies aren’t just about gore; they are masterclasses in psychological manipulation. Suspense is the slow burn, the creeping dread that something is just out of sight, making you anticipate the horror. Jump scares are the sudden, explosive release of that tension, designed to jolt you out of your seat. A great atmosphere uses sound, lighting, and setting to create a world that feels inherently wrong and unsettling. Finally, powerful storytelling makes you care about the characters and their fate, making the scares hit on a deeper, more emotional level.</p>









 Why the Classics Endure 



<p>Classic horror films like Psycho and The Exorcist are legendary for a reason. They perfected the art of suspense and atmosphere, often relying on what you don’t see to create terror. Instead of cheap tricks, they used masterful cinematography, sound design, and psychological depth to build a feeling of inescapable dread. These films prove that true horror comes from within, showing us our deepest fears reflected on screen.</p>



 The NewWave of 2025 



<p>This year’s releases are pushing the boundaries of what horror can be. The best new movies of 2025 are blending genres, from psychological thrillers and social commentary to sci-fi and survival horror. They tap into modern anxieties about technology, surveillance, and mental health, making the scares feel more personal and relevant than ever before. With innovative techniques and A-list talent, these films prove that horror is more than just a genre. It’s a reflection of our current fears.</p>



 Top Scariest Movies of All Time 



<p>Before we get to the new releases of 2025, let’s revisit the horror films that defined the genre and continue to haunt audiences today. These classics are a must-see for any true fan of fright.</p>



 
 Top Scariest Movies of All Time – The Exorcist (1973): More than a movie, this is an experience of psychological and visceral horror. Its terrifying power comes from a chillingly realistic portrayal of demonic possession, complete with groundbreaking practical effects and an unrelenting sense of dread that challenges your sense of reality. 
 









 
 Top Scariest Movies of All Time – Psycho (1960): Alfred Hitchcock’s masterpiece changed horror forever. It’s not about jump scares but about the terror of a true human monster. The iconic shower scene is just one part of a film that masterfully builds suspense and a chilling atmosphere, making you fear the seemingly normal person next door. 
 




Top Scariest Movies of All Time – Psycho (1960)




 
 Top Scariest Movies of All Time – The Shining (1980): Stanley Kubrick’s film is a slow, methodical descent into madness. Its genius lies in its unsettling atmosphere, haunting score, and masterful use of space to create a feeling of claustrophobia and inescapable dread. The horror here is both supernatural and deeply psychological, exploring how isolation can break a person’s mind. 
 









<p>You can often find these timeless classics on popular streaming platforms like Netflix and HBO Max. Remember to browse safely with Herond Browser for a seamless and secure streaming experience.</p>



 Top Scariest Movies to Watch in 2025 



<p>Horror is constantly evolving, and 2025 is a testament to that, with filmmakers pushing boundaries and tapping into our deepest, most modern fears. This year’s releases are bringing fresh takes on classic terror and introducing new forms of dread.</p>



 
 M3GAN 2.0: The killer AI doll is back! The sequel to the viral hit M3GAN dives deeper into our anxieties about technology and artificial intelligence. This film promises to explore what happens when our digital companions become a little too intelligent, and a lot more malicious. 
 









 
 28 Years Later: The legacy of the rage virus continues with this highly anticipated sequel. Directed by Danny Boyle, this film is set to deliver the relentless, visceral horror of the original while exploring the long-term consequences of a world ravaged by a fast-moving, terrifying plague. 
 









 
 The Conjuring: Last Rites: This is set to be the final chapter in the core Conjuring series, bringing back paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren for one last, terrifying case. Fans of supernatural horror and jump scares can expect a chilling conclusion to be one of the most successful horror franchises of all time. 
 









 Tips for Watching Top Scariest Movies of All Time 



<p>For a scream-worthy movie night without the risk, stick to these trusted platforms.</p>



 
 Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+: These are industry leaders with robust security measures, including data encryption and anti-malware protection. They offer a huge library of content and ensure a safe, high-quality streaming experience. 
 









 
 Amazon Prime Video: A secure and reliable option, Amazon Prime Video provides a vast selection of movies and TV shows, with a strong focus on user data protection. 



 Reputable Free Services: If you’re looking for free options, stick to well-known, ad-supported platforms like Tubi, Pluto TV, and Crackle. These are run by legitimate companies and are much safer than obscure, illegal streaming sites. 
 



 How to Choose the Right Platform for Top Scariest Movies of All Time 



<p>To pick the perfect platform for your horror binge, consider your viewing habits and budget. While a major service like Netflix offers a wide variety of genres, a niche platform like Shudder is a true haven for horror fanatics.</p>









 
 Netflix: With plans ranging from $7.99 to $24.99 per month, Netflix is a one-stop shop for everything from original horror films to classic thrillers. It supports 4K Ultra HD streaming on its Premium plan and is compatible with nearly every device, from smart TVs and game consoles to laptops and mobile phones. 



 Shudder: For the serious horror fan, Shudder is a must-have. Priced at a more affordable $6.99 per month, it focuses exclusively on horror, thriller, and supernatural content. You’ll find a curated collection of classics, indie gems, and exclusive originals you can’t get anywhere else. Shudder is compatible with major devices like Roku, Apple TV, and Xbox. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Whether you’re a seasoned horror veteran or a newcomer looking for a good fright, the world of scary movies has something for everyone. The classics show us that true terror lies in psychological suspense and chilling atmosphere, proving that a great story is timeless. Meanwhile, the new releases of 2025 are pushing the genre forward, using modern anxieties to deliver fresh, terrifying experiences. To get the most out of your movie marathon, remember to use secure and trusted streaming platforms like Netflix and Shudder, and for a truly worry-free experience.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to send an email but first having to manually configure SMTP servers, manage encryption keys, and pay postage fees in a specific currency you don’t own. This is essentially what Web3 feels like today. Account Abstraction (AA) promises to change that, making blockchain interactions as seamless as using&nbsp;Gmail.</p> The Current Problem: Web3’s User Experience Crisis <p>Today’s Ethereum wallets rely on Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) accounts controlled by a single private key. While groundbreaking for decentralization, EOAs create massive friction:</p>  Gas Token Dependency: You must hold ETH to pay fees, even for simple token transfers  Single Point of Failure: Lose your seed phrase, lose everything forever  Complex Interactions: Each transaction requires manual approval and gas estimation  Poor Recovery: No built-in way to recover lost&nbsp;accounts  <p>These limitations explain why Web3 remains challenging for mainstream users. Account Abstraction addresses these pain points by reimagining how accounts work entirely.</p> What is Account Abstraction? <p>Account Abstraction transforms user accounts from simple private key wallets into programmable smart contracts. Instead of being bound by EOA limitations, Account Abstraction allows accounts to define custom logic for authentication, fee payment, and transaction execution.</p><p>Think of it as upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone, the core functionality remains, but possibilities expand dramatically.</p> How Account Abstraction Works  Smart Contract&nbsp;Wallets <p>Instead of being tied to a private key, Account Abstraction uses a smart contract that acts as your account. This smart contract holds your tokens and assets while containing custom logic for managing the&nbsp;account.</p> ERC-4337: The Technical Foundation <p>The primary technical implementation of Account Abstraction comes through <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">EIP-4337</a>, which enables Account Abstraction without changing Ethereum’s core protocol. Here’s the simplified flow:</p>  UserOperations: Users create “UserOperations” containing their intended actions like token transfers.  Bundlers: Special actors collect UserOperations and submit them in&nbsp;bundles.  EntryPoint Contract: A singleton contract that validates and executes operations.  Smart Wallets: Execute the actual transactions based on their programmed logic.  <p>An in-depth explanation on the abstraction process can be found on this <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337?ref=blog.quicknode.com#the-useroperation-structure">Proposal</a>.</p> Paymasters: The Game&nbsp;Changer <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337?ref=blog.quicknode.com#extension-paymasters">Paymasters</a> are entities that can sponsor transaction fees, enabling gasless transactions. A dApp can pay your gas fees, or you can pay in USDC instead of&nbsp;ETH.</p> Key Benefits of Account Abstraction for&nbsp;Users  Gasless Transactions   Enables users to pay fees in any token (USDC, DAI, etc.)via paymaster.  dApps can sponsor your transaction costs.  No need to hold ETH for every interaction.   Social Recovery <p>Set up recovery procedures with trusted contacts or services. Lost your keys? Your designated recovery guardians can help restore access, no more permanent fund&nbsp;loss.</p> Customized Security   Multi-signature requirements  Spending limits for large transactions  Time delays for high-value transfers  Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch&nbsp;ID)   Improved User Experience   Session Keys: Authorize games to make small purchases automatically.  Transaction Bundling: Execute multiple operations in one confirmation.  Automated Execution: Set up recurring payments or trading strategies.  One-Click Onboarding: Start using Web3 without seed&nbsp;phrases.   Real-World Applications <p>Gaming: Players authorize a game for micro-transactions within set limits, eliminating constant wallet confirmations while maintaining security.</p><p>DeFi: Users set automated strategies like “swap to stablecoins if my portfolio drops 20%” without keeping devices&nbsp;online.</p><p>E-commerce: Shoppers pay with any token they own, while merchants receive their preferred currency all sponsored by the platform.</p><p>Enterprise: Companies implement multi-department approval workflows for large transactions.</p> Current Implementation &amp;&nbsp;Tools   Coinbase Smart Wallet: Mainstream-friendly onboarding.  UniPass: Actively enhancing Account Abstraction capabilities in partnership with Keystone.  Biconomy: Developer infrastructure for gasless experiences  Alchemy’s Account Kit: Tools for building Account Abstraction-enabled dApps  <p>Layer 2 networks like Polygon and Arbitrum are optimizing specifically for smart contract wallets, making AA transactions faster and&nbsp;cheaper.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>While ERC-4337 works today, additional proposals could enhance Account Abstraction:</p>  <a href="https://blog.web3auth.io/eip-3074-eip-7702/">EIP-3074</a>: Allows existing EOAs to delegate control to smart contracts  <a href="https://eip7702.io/">EIP-7702</a>: Proposes native account abstraction at the protocol&nbsp;level  <p>These aren’t competing solutions but complementary approaches that could coexist, providing migration paths for existing&nbsp;users.</p> Why This Matters for Web3&nbsp;Adoption <p>Account Abstraction represents Web3’s evolution from a power-user tool to a mainstream platform. Current barriers preventing mass adoption. Complex key management, mandatory gas tokens, poor recovery options are solved by Account Abstraction.</p><p>The infrastructure is maturing rapidly. What took Web2 decades to develop (user-friendly authentication, payment flexibility, account recovery) can now be built into Web3 from the ground&nbsp;up.</p> Conclusion: The Account Abstraction Revolution <p>Account Abstraction isn’t just a technical upgrade, it is the bridge between Web3’s technical sophistication and mainstream usability.

  Face identity search is a method that uses AI-powered facial matching instead of IDs or passwords. A system compares key features like eye spacing or cheek shape to a stored faceprint. It’s fast, contactless, and often more accurate than manual checks. People use it in banks, airports, and healthcare settings. Structurally, it works like this:...

<p>Face identity search is a method that uses AI-powered facial matching instead of IDs or passwords. A system compares key features like eye spacing or cheek shape to a stored faceprint. It’s fast, contactless, and often more accurate than manual checks.</p>
<p>People use it in banks, airports, and healthcare settings. Structurally, it works like this:</p>
 
 Captures a face image
<p></p> 
 Extracts meaningful facial points
<p></p> 
 Creates and compares a faceprint
<p></p> 
 Outputs a match or no-match result
<p></p> 
 
<p>This technology offers quick and secure identity checks without needing physical tokens. You can even explore open-source projects like<a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision"> Recognito’s GitHub repository</a> to see how developers are building practical tools with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Modern Systems Depend on AI-Driven Face Matching 
<p>Passwords and IDs can be lost or stolen. That’s why many systems now rely on biometric verification for better security, speed, and ease of use.</p>
<p>Benefits include:</p>
 
 Fast identity checks for crowds or busy queues
<p></p> 
 Higher accuracy than visual or document-based ID
<p></p> 
 Hands-free operation—no scanning or swiping cards
<p></p> 
 Scalable systems for millions of users
<p></p> 
 
<p>Studies show biometric tech is growing fast, with accuracy and adoption soaring across industries. Independent evaluations, such as the<a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT)</a>, confirm which systems are the most reliable in real-world conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Independent Testing Sets the Gold Standard 
<p>Governments and businesses lean on NIST’s FRVT program to judge performance, fairness, and accuracy. This ongoing benchmark evaluates algorithms on speed, bias, and resilience to poor image quality. Full results are published openly, like in<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> NIST’s FRVT 1:1 reports</a>, which compare one-to-one verification across different vendors.</p>
<p>By using such public benchmarks, companies can pick technologies that are not only fast but also proven to be fair and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Everyday Applications 
<p>This technology is no longer confined to research labs. It’s already part of daily life:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Security and Policing 
<p>Authorities use it to identify suspects in public areas. London’s police reported dozens of arrests in a single week of trial deployments.</p>
 Financial Services 
<p>Banks now let users unlock apps or approve payments by simply looking into the camera, improving both speed and trust.</p>
 Travel and Border Control 
<p>Airports in Singapore and the US speed up boarding by replacing paper tickets with biometric gates.</p>
 Healthcare 
<p>Hospitals deploy it to verify patient identities and reduce fraud in insurance systems.</p>
 Business and Retail 
<p>Companies use it for employee access, while retailers are testing it to create personalized shopping experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Strengths and Weaknesses 
<p>Advantages</p>
 
 Quick and seamless compared to ID cards
<p></p> 
 Helps prevent fraud and identity theft
<p></p> 
 Improves user experience
<p></p> 
 Works at scale for large organizations
<p></p> 
 
<p>Challenges</p>
 
 Raises privacy concerns if misused
<p></p> 
 Accuracy can drop with poor image quality
<p></p> 
 Bias risk if systems aren’t trained on diverse datasets
<p></p> 
 Sensitive databases may attract hackers
<p></p> 
 
<p>The good news is that testing programs like FRVT are pushing the industry to improve. For example, error rates have fallen drastically as vendors adapt their algorithms to meet those standards.</p>
<p></p>
 The Future of Face Identity Search 
<p>Looking ahead, we’ll see this technology combining with other biometrics like voice and fingerprint for multi-factor security. Processing will also move to local devices using edge computing, making systems faster and less dependent on cloud storage.</p>
<p>Smart cities may integrate it for public safety, while businesses will use it to enhance customer experiences. As the technology matures, issues like bias and privacy will need strict regulation, but the potential is too strong to ignore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Face identity search is reshaping how people prove who they are. From faster airport boarding to secure banking apps, it blends convenience with stronger protection. Independent testing programs, such as the FRVT run by NIST, ensure that the systems are fair, accurate, and ready for real-world use. The road ahead includes both challenges and opportunities, but its role in the future of digital identity is undeniable.</p>

 Infostructure patterns 
<p>One of the hottest topics in the digital economy has for some time been data sharing. Many proposals are evolving in Open Banking and Open Data, alongside digital identity frameworks and more specific digital credentialling. I’m seeing verifiable credentials methods and thinking leaning towards verified data.</p>
<p>“Infostructure” is a term for the orchestrated systems of policies, standards, rules, technologies and architecture that help control the use of important information.</p>
<p>Strikingly similar patterns are evident in the infostructures that have emerged in digital identity, open banking, card payments and digital credentialing. These patterns can help us solve the scaling problems that held back acceptance of digital IDs, and streamline the way we architect a number of important programs. It turns out that many of these programs are variations on a common theme.</p>
 The Standard Model of Digital Identity 
<p>The digital identity field has been dominated for twenty years by a supply-and-demand model featuring three types of participant: Subjects, Identity Providers (IdPs) and Relying Parties (RPs).</p>
<p>Technical standards, government policy, industry associations, businesses, and legislation have all been structured around this Three-Party model in which digital identities are “issued”, “held”, “presented”, “exchanged”, “used” and/or “consumed” as if these are a type of good.</p>
<p>The Standard Model <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/market-failure-of-digital-identity">has not gone well</a> but we can look to a much older canonical data sharing model for help.</p>
 What’s holding back the digital identity market? 
<p>One huge historical challenge has been apportioning liability and allocating reasonable fees for digital identity services.&nbsp; It’s never been really a clear in the standard three-party model of Digital Identity which parties gain the most economic benefit from assured qualities of the data they consume, and how do fees get fairly levied for these assurances.</p>
<p>This problem was solved over sixty years ago with the network business model of the credit card schemes. They realise a two-sided market of payment card issuers and merchants.&nbsp; These are just special cases of ID Issuers and Relying Parties.</p>
<p>Credit card networks have one core job: distribute and verify customer IDs so that merchants can extend credit to customers without needing to know them, and moreover, without knowing the customers’ banks either.&nbsp; That is, the networks join the credit providers (customers’ banks) to merchants without the merchants needing to make their own bilateral arrangements.</p>
 Don’t make this personal! 
<p>Another problem with traditional approaches to digital identity is they tend to over-complicate the problem, by framing it in terms of solving for “who someone is”.</p>
<p>Personal identity is complicated, hard to define, and impossible to standardise. In real life, “identity” means different things to different people. In transactional settings (where digital identity matters) each party needs to know different things about their counterparties, so a singular answer to “who you are” is fundamentally elusive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we reframe the digital identification problem around as What Do You Need To Know about a counterparty, and if we expect to address that question in different ways according to context, then the possible solutions look rather different from the traditional three-party model.</p>
<p>That is, let’s recognise digital identity as a special case of verified data sharing — and keep the personal out of it.</p>
 Generalising from Three Parties to Four 
<p>Lockstep has been working on a four-party <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/dvp/">data verification platform</a> (DVP) architecture inspired by the credit card network model. &nbsp;The DVP augments the traditional three players with a new fourth party that intermediates between Relying Parties and Issuers.</p>
<p>As I look at it, the awkward failures of Federated Identity (despite it seeming like such a great idea) shows that digital identity is not what we thought it was. But the tools and infrastructure that we’ve developed along the way can be repurposed.</p>
<p>It will be far more useful (and far less complicated) if we generalise digital identity frameworks from WHO to WHAT.</p>
<p>We should be issuing third party verifiable credentials to non-human Subjects (IoT devices, virtual agents, even AI algorithms themselves) to prove all the qualities and properties of interest. And to make these assertions legible and acceptable at scale, we need a new type of fourth party to intermediate between data sources and data receivers when these are at arm’s length from each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fourth party onboards data receivers (just like acquiring banks onboard merchants into the card systems), executes a standard form of contract with them, and supports them with metadata (credential descriptors, accreditation information, public keys etc.).</p>
<p>The fourth party is the missing link in scalable systems of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials cannot verify themselves. That is, the verification step requires essential metadata which need to be distributed to relying parties. &nbsp;This metadata includes the public keys needed to cryptographically confirm the signatures on credentials and presentations. It also includes the names and target values of such things as credential issuers, credential types, accreditations etc. These are the critical details needed for relying party software to make programmatic decisions to accept or reject the data that it’s being presented with.</p>
 Comparing Three Party and Four Party models 
<p>The following tables compare several paragons of the two types of model.</p>

<p>Every year <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-ai">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) is doing more, delivering better, and becoming faster. <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/ai/112426/apple-ceo-ai-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-the-internet-smartphones">Apple</a> says the AI revolution is “as big or bigger” than the internet, smartphones, cloud computing, and apps. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/6-ai-trends-youll-see-more-of-in-2025/">Microsoft</a> says AI technology will change every part of our lives. But our <a href="https://cybernews.com/ai-news/how-your-personal-information-is-training-ai/">personal information is fuelling the AI revolution</a>—and that presents massive AI privacy risks.</p>



<p>Without our consent, companies are scraping our personal information from across the internet and using it to train AI systems—and that’s just one way AI threatens personal privacy. Here we look at the long laundry list of AI privacy threats in 2025 and the tools you need to fight back.</p>



 12 AI privacy threats—and counting &nbsp; 



<p>Everything we do generates data—and AI systems scrape, link together, and thrive off that data.</p>



<p>AI uses our information to both understand what we want from it and to perform its tasks. We give AI our data intentionally (e.g. by writing prompts containing personal details) and unintentionally (e.g. by being near facial recognition technology such as a Ring doorbell).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But AI privacy and security threats don’t only stem from what we share with AI but also from how AI can analyze, infer, and act on that information without permission.<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">Academics</a> have identified at least <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">12 privacy risks from AI</a>:</p>



 
 AI collects massive amounts of data from everywhere, increasing risks of surveillance. AI can harvest phone numbers, emails, and personal information and images from websites, social media, and public records. 



 AI automatically links identity information across various data sources, increasing risk of personal identity exposure. Using pattern recognition, AI can match and correlate scraped data from scattered sources and readily knit it together into a clear profile of a person. 



 When AI combines data about a person, it makes inferences from it, boosting the risks of privacy invasion. 



 AI infers personality or social attributes from physical characteristics, potentially leading to bias and discrimination. 



 AI repurposes data beyond its original intended use, further eroding user control. 



 AI has opaque data practices which fail to inform and give users control over how their data is used. 



 AI storage practices and data requirements risk data leaks and improper access. 



 AI can reveal sensitive information, such as through generative AI techniques. 



 AI’s ability to generate realistic but fake content makes it easier to spread false or misleading information. 



 AI can cause improper sharing of data when it infers additional sensitive information from raw data. 



 AI makes sensitive information more accessible to a wider audience than intended. 



 AI technologies invade personal space or solitude, often through surveillance measures. 
 



<p></p>



<p>One rapidly growing impact of AI data gathering is targeted scams and phishing. AI makes fraud more convincing by using readily available personal data to tailor attacks. AI-generated <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-mysudo-to-save-loved-ones-from-voice-deep-fake-scams/">voice deepfakes</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/beware-ai-generated-deepfake-texts-emails-and-websites-this-holiday-season/">deepfake</a> texts, emails and web sites promoting fake products, deals and giveaways are part of the highest reported form of scam, according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-show-consumers-reported-losing-nearly-88-billion-scams-2022">FTC</a>.</p>



 Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ultimate data broker 



<p>If you think about it, AI is the ultimate <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data broker</a>.</p>



<p>Data brokers are companies that harvest, manipulate and even misrepresent consumer data and sell it to companies, usually for marketing. Data brokers are legitimate but unregulated businesses, there are about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">4,000</a>&nbsp;of them worldwide,&nbsp;and their&nbsp;industry is worth about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">US $200 billion</a>&nbsp;annually.&nbsp;The largest data brokers, such as Acxiom, <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">have tens of thousands of servers</a> collecting and analyzing thousands of data points per person from <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">hundreds of millions of consumers</a> globally.</p>



<p>AI systems basically do the same thing—and in turn data brokers are using AI to boost their success rate and profit margins. According to the <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-05-22/how-your-data-ends-up-in-ai-training-sets">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, “a rapidly growing industry has also sprung up to broker training data to AI companies with more niche requirements. Some of the datasets you can buy on this marketplace include images of conflict, protest crowds, adult content, audio datasets of recorded phone conversations on various topics, and social media posts classified by the sentiment they express.”</p>



 Auto opt-in to AI training is a big issue 



<p>A recent deep dive into how to stop AI from getting its bots on your personal data by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings">The Guardian</a> says default opt-ins are an industry-wide issue. It says a recent report by the FTC on the data practices of nine social media and streaming platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Amazon “found that nearly all of them fed people’s personal information into automated systems with no comprehensive or transparent way for users to opt out.” The article gives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings">instructions</a> for opting out of the major platforms but warns it’s not easy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/">Wired</a> ran a similar article on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/">how to opt out of AI training</a> and covered more platforms including Figma, Adobe, Grammarly, Google Gemini, LinkedIn and loads more.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-05-22/how-your-data-ends-up-in-ai-training-sets">article</a> also has instructions but warns consumers to be realistic about the fact that the horse has already bolted.</p>



<p>“Any companies building AI have already scraped the web, so anything you’ve posted is probably already in their systems. Companies are also secretive about what they have actually scraped, purchased, or used to train their systems,” the Wired guide notes.</p>



 How to protect your personal information from AI 



<p>You can use <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/">Wired’s</a> instructions for removing your data from AI training on all the major platforms, but there’s an easier strategy going forward: don’t expose your personal information in the first place. How do you do that? Use <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">MySudo Reclaim</a>, and the rest of the <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals">MySudo suite</a>. And note: this strategy for protecting your personal information from AI is the same strategy you’d use to protect your personal information from the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">surveillance capitalism machine that is big tech</a> and others that profit from your personal data (even your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/your-bank-is-selling-your-personal-data/">bank</a>!).</p>



 How MySudo protects your personal information from AI 



<p>MySudo is a privacy app that gives you up to 9 separate <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=Products,Sudo%20profile%20and%20manage%20it.">Sudos</a>—secure digital profiles with phone, email, and payment cards to use instead of your own. Anywhere you would usually give your personal details, give your Sudo details instead.</p>



 Each Sudo has: 



 
 1 customizable phone number* 



 1 email address 



 1 virtual card* 



 1 private browser 



 1 handle** 
 



<p></p>



<p>In the AI era, Sudos are powerful because they:</p>



 
 Separate your identity from your activity:Each Sudo is <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy-2/">compartmentalized</a>. If you use one for online shopping, another for dating apps, and another for networking, for example, AI scrapers can’t easily link them together and build a profile on you. 



 Limit your exposure: Instead of sharing your real phone number and email all over the internet, you share your alternative Sudo details, which breaks your data trail. 



 Offer strong security: You can use a dedicated Sudo number for 2FA and account recovery, keeping your real number out of the databases that AI systems analyze. 
 



<p></p>



<p>What’s more, MySudo is an immediate safeguard for you and your family against voice deep fakes like the popular <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-mysudo-to-save-loved-ones-from-voice-deep-fake-scams/">grandparent scam</a>. To protect yourself:</p>



 
 Set up a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;and assign it a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;that you&nbsp;only ever give out to your closest family and friends. 



 Be diligent about only giving out the number to your loved ones so that you build and protect a&nbsp;trusted communication channel with your inner circle. 



 If you have only carefully shared the Sudo number with those you trust, then you’ll know if that number rings, it’s a legitimate communication from within your circle and not a deepfake scammer impersonating you or your loved ones. If you’ve been diligent in protecting your safe Sudo number, it is very unlikely a criminal would have it.

<p>Self-service password reset (SSPR) and self-service account recovery (SSAR) are essential for reducing IT workload and empowering users. However, these solutions, if not implemented securely, can become an organization's biggest security hole. Up to 50% of all IT help desk tickets are for password resets, costing approximately $70 each. While SSPR and SSAR aim to solve this, traditional methods are often fundamentally broken, leaving organizations vulnerable to costly account takeovers.</p>  
 What Are SSPR and SSAR?  
<p>SSPR and SSAR are self-service features that allow users to reset their passwords or recover access to their accounts without needing help from an IT professional. While this can drastically cut operational costs and reduce help desk tickets, it introduces a significant security issue.</p> 
<p>Definitions and Business Use Cases:</p> 
  
  SSPR (Self-Service Password Reset): Allows users to reset a forgotten password without IT intervention.  
  SSAR (Self-Service Account Recovery): Enables users to regain access to a locked or compromised account on their own.  
  
 The Risk of Traditional Recovery Methods  
<p>Traditional SSPR and SSAR solutions rely on methods that are easily exploited by attackers, turning a convenience into a major security vulnerability. These gaps leave organizations open to account takeover (ATO) and social engineering.</p> 
  
  Security questions: Easily guessed or found online through social engineering, making them a weak form of authentication.  
  SMS/email OTPs: Susceptible to phishing and SIM swaps, where attackers can intercept the codes sent to a user's device.  
  Authenticator apps: Can be bypassed with "push bombing" attacks or rendered useless if a user loses or replaces their device.  
  
 Why Identity Verification Is Critical  
<p>Verifying a user's identity before granting access is the only way to ensure security during password resets or recovery. Modern solutions use a multi-factor identity verification (IDV) process that combines document scanning with liveness detection to confirm that a real, present person is requesting access.</p> 
 The Modern SSPR Challenge: Uniting Security and Simplicity  
<p>Effective account recovery presents a difficult challenge: how do you balance the need for absolute security with the user's demand for a fast, simple experience? Traditional methods often fail this test. A lengthy call to a help desk might be secure, but it creates frustration and high operational costs. Conversely, a simple security question is easy for the user but offers almost no real protection against a determined attacker.</p> 
<p>The ideal solution is an intelligent, adaptive flow that can orchestrate multiple signals of identity. It should be able to create a recovery path that is appropriate for the level of risk, making the process frictionless for legitimate users while presenting insurmountable barriers for fraudsters.</p> 
<p>This modern approach moves beyond simple checks to a holistic verification of a user's identity, ensuring that convenience and security are no longer a trade-off.</p> 
 The HYPR Affirm SSPR/SSAR&nbsp;Flow  
<p>HYPR Affirm is a secure, self-service solution that solves the paradox of traditional SSPR and SSAR. It eliminates the vulnerabilities of legacy methods by using a robust, multi-layered identity verification process.</p> 
<p>Here’s how Affirm verifies the user at each step:</p> 
  
  User Initiates SSPR/SSAR: The process begins when the user requests a password reset or account recovery from the login screen or a dedicated service portal.  
  Phone number, Location Check: This includes phone number verification to confirm possession, along with checks on geographic location to identify anomalies.  
  ID Document Scan and&nbsp;Selfie Liveness Check: The user is prompted to scan a government-issued photo ID (like a driver's license or passport). HYPR then performs a certified liveness check with a selfie to confirm the user is physically present, preventing deepfake and presentation attacks in compliance with NIST&nbsp;standards.  
  Automated Verification &amp; Intelligent Escalation: The system instantly cross-references all identity data points to make a verification decision. If the evidence is conclusive, the user is approved. If the risk signals are uncertain, the flow can be automatically escalated to a secure manager or help desk agent chat or a live video call for final, human-assisted verification.  
  Phishing-Resistant Credential Reset: Once fully verified, the user securely completes their password reset or account recovery, establishing a new, phishing-resistant credential for safe, ongoing access.  
  
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
  
  Traditional SSPR/SSAR methods are not secure and can lead to costly account takeovers.  
  Multi-factor identity verification is the most effective way to secure the recovery process.  
  HYPR Affirm replaces vulnerable methods with a seamless, secure flow that cuts costs and reduces risk.  
  
 FAQs  
<p>Q: How does HYPR Affirm prevent deepfake attacks? A: HYPR Affirm uses a certified liveness check that analyzes the user's selfie in real-time to ensure they are a physically present person, not a deepfake or a static photo.</p> 
<p>Q: Can HYPR Affirm be used with different types of IDs? A: Yes, HYPR Affirm is designed to work with various government-issued photo IDs, such as driver's licenses and passports.</p> 
<p>Q: What is the cost benefit of using HYPR Affirm? A: By reducing help desk tickets for password resets and account recovery by up to 95%, HYPR Affirm can drastically cut operational costs for organizations.</p>

				  Identity Week is the place to learn about the latest in identity technology. Whether you are attending on behalf of a large enterprise, government agency, or small business, this is your chance to see what others are doing and what is coming next in the industry. Here are just a few sessions that Indicio is most excited about.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
 The Startup Pitch Competition (Day 2, Seminar Theater A, 12:50 – 2:50) 
<p>The startup pitch competition brings together 10 startups that have impressed the judges with their applications and technologies. This is your chance to evaluate up and comers in the space and ask questions about their products and services. With each competitor having only seven minutes to pitch and three&nbsp; minutes for questions, this session moves fast and keeps things lively as you get a sneak peek at tomorrow’s tech. Be sure not to miss Indicio’s CEO Heather Dahl as she takes the stage at 1:25 to pitch Indicio and explain how our authenticated biometrics and verifiable credentials solution will save the world!</p>
 Digital IDs at a national scale (Day 1, Seminar Theater B, 3:00) 
<p>Mohamed Al Kuwaiti, Head of Cybersecurity, Cyber Security Council<br>David Almirol, Undersecretary for e-Government, Department of Information and Communication Technology<br>Moderator:<br>Scott Rea, Chief Operating Officer, CertiNext<br></p>
<p>The most important identity that most of us have is the one issued to us by our government, usually through a physical document like a driver’s license or passport. This panel brings together leaders from the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines who have both implemented digital national identities to learn more about their experiences and what the rest of the world can learn from their solutions. Our team is particularly interested in hearing about the benefits their citizens have realized, each government’s strategy for building trust and privacy, and their future plans for interoperability between their national systems and other countries.</p>
 Digital identity at the border: What it means for you, me, and global travel (Day 2, Theater 1, 11:50) 
<p>Michael Zureik, Head of Ecosystem Partnerships – Digital Travel, SITA</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials containing authenticated biometrics enable “government-grade” digital identities. These can be used for preauthorized travel and seamless border crossing, transforming international travel. SITA’s Michael Zuriek explains the evolution of this technology, how it’s needed to meet the current and projected growth in international travel, how it benefits airlines, airports, governments, and travelers —&nbsp;and how crossing the border is only the start of the traveler’s digital identity journey.</p>
 Fighting fraud: Assessing the state of play across the fraud landscape (Day 1, Theater 3, 2:20) 
<p>Chris Skowronek, Dr. Solutions Engineering, Vonage<br>Raphael Tsow, Sr. Director, Identity and Risk Engineering, Ebay<br>Christian Guirnalda, Senior Director Network API Innovation, Verizon<br>Jon Prisby, Lead Biometric and Identity Technology Center, DHS S&amp;T<br>Moderator:<br>Maria Karamalis, CEO/President, Karamalis Consulting LLC<br></p>
<p>Fraud is surging with identity-based attacks displacing malware as the critical vector of attack. Boosted by brute force attacks using AI tools and by the rise of sophisticated&nbsp; generative AI deepfakes, it has never been easier to steal or impersonate someone’s identity. This session will discuss the most promising&nbsp; strategies to combat fraud, how AI innovations are both enabling and preventing fraud, and how to better educate and protect the public. Our team is interested in hearing their thoughts as Indicio’s recent combination of authenticated biometrics in Verifiable Credentials presents a powerful way to prevent <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/how-verifiable-credentials-disrupt-online-fraud-phishing-and-identity-theft/">account phishing</a> and synthetic identity fraud and <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/how-verifiable-credentials-can-handle-the-threat-of-deepfakes-in-kyc/">bypass deepfakes.</a></p>
 Human-centered, business-ready: AI for smarter identity decisions (Day 2, Seminar Theater B, 1:30) 
<p>Arif Mamedov, CEO, Regula Forensics Inc.</p>
<p>Here’s the pitch from Regula Forensics CEO Arif Mamedov: “AI is transforming identity verification, but it is not magic. When used without context or proper control, even advanced systems can mislead. This session explores what makes AI truly effective in high-stakes identity workflows, from airports to banking. Drawing on Regula’s decades of forensic expertise, we will share how explainable logic, human-in-the-loop design, and well-defined boundaries lead to reliable, scalable business results – without relying only on automation.”&nbsp; Count us interested!</p>

 Building Trust In The Decentralized Era <p>In a world that is rapidly moving towards decentralization, one question continues to dominate the conversation: how do we build trust when intermediaries disappear? This is the challenge that gave birth to Ontology Network a high performance, open source blockchain designed not just for speed or scalability, but for trust, identity, and data sovereignty.</p><p>The Problem: Trust in the Digital&nbsp;Age</p><p>The internet has connected billions, yet it has also created a paradox while information flows freely, trust remains scarce. Every time we log in, share data, or engage in digital transactions, we are forced to rely on centralized platforms. These platforms act as the gatekeepers of identity, data, and reputation.</p><p>But this centralization comes at a&nbsp;cost:</p><p>Data exploitation by corporations who monetize personal information.</p><p>Single points of failure that expose users to breaches, hacks, and censorship.</p><p>Lack of digital sovereignty, where individuals cannot truly own or control their digital identities.</p><p>Clearly, the digital future requires a new framework one that puts people, not platforms, at the&nbsp;center.</p><p>The Vision of&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>Ontology Network was created to answer this need. Its existence is grounded in one simple but transformative idea: trust should be decentralized, verifiable, and user&nbsp;owned.</p><p>By combining high-speed blockchain infrastructure with decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions, Ontology gives individuals and enterprises the ability&nbsp;to:</p><p>Own their identities across multiple platforms without relying on a central authority.</p><p>Control their data and decide who can access it, when, and for what&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Transact securely and transparently, with trust anchored in cryptography rather than third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Why The Ontology Network&nbsp;Exists</p><p>Ontology exists because the future of the internet demands more than just financial decentralization. While many blockchains focus primarily on tokenization and DeFi, Ontology focuses on the foundations of digital society: who we are, how we prove it, and how we interact.</p><p>Here’s what sets Ontology&nbsp;apart:</p><p>1. Decentralized Identity (ONT ID): A framework where individuals own their identity credentials and can use them anywhere.</p><p>2. Data Sovereignty: Instead of handing over your data to corporations, you control, share, and even monetize it on your own&nbsp;terms.</p><p>3. Enterprise Ready Infrastructure: Ontology provides the scalability and tools businesses need to integrate blockchain trust into their services.</p><p>4. Interoperability: Ontology is designed to work across chains, ensuring that identity and data can move freely across the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>The Bigger&nbsp;Picture</p><p>Ontology doesn’t just exist to solve today’s problems. It exists to shape tomorrow’s digital world a world&nbsp;where:</p><p>Healthcare records belong to patients, not hospitals.</p><p>Educational achievements are verified and portable across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Financial inclusion becomes a reality, as people without banks can still build verifiable reputations.</p><p>Communities thrive on trust that is algorithmically provable, not institutionally enforced.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>The Ontology Network exists because trust is the currency of the future, and the way we build and verify that trust must evolve. By enabling decentralized identity, data sovereignty, and interoperable trust frameworks, Ontology is laying the foundation for a digital world that is more secure, transparent, and human&nbsp;centric.</p><p>The internet of the past belonged to corporations.<br>The internet of the future belongs to us.<br>And Ontology is here to make that future possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/why-the-ontology-network-exists-f8f102a37602">WHY THE ONTOLOGY NETWORK EXISTS</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Managing and verifying professional certificates is still stuck in the paper era: paper documents are slow, insecure, and easy to fake. Digital PDFs aren’t much better — they can be forged, misplaced, or become outdated as soon as someone changes jobs.</p><p>That’s where verifiable credentials come in. In this demo, Richard Esplin (Head of Product at Truvera) shows how fast and simple it is to build a credential issuance and verification solution using the Truvera platform. In just an afternoon, our team put together a proof of concept for issuing and verifying safety training certificates.</p>

<p>Commercial lenders face heightened global AML expectations, especially around KYB, UBO verification, and ongoing monitoring. This article outlines key obligations across the U.S., UK, Canada, EU, and Australia—and how iComply helps automate compliance for business loan onboarding and risk management.</p>
 
 Commercial lenders – from banks to fintech platforms to leasing companies – are under increasing pressure to validate the legitimacy of the businesses they serve. Regulators worldwide now expect lenders to implement robust know-your-business (KYB) procedures, identify beneficial owners (UBOs), and monitor ongoing risk across their business lending portfolios. 
<p>With varying standards across borders and complex corporate structures at play, automation is no longer optional – it’s essential.</p>
 
 AML and KYB Expectations for Lenders 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, OCC, FDIC, state banking departments 
 Requirements: BOI reporting under the Corporate Transparency Act, CDD Rule compliance, SAR filings, and sanctions screening 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA, PRA 
 Requirements: KYB, UBO verification, transaction monitoring, and enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk entities 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Business client verification, beneficial ownership discovery, ongoing monitoring, and STRs for suspicious transactions 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National regulators under AMLD6 framework 
 Requirements: KYB and UBO collection, EDD for complex structures, and real-time transaction tracking 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF compliance for non-bank lenders, UBO transparency, and reporting obligations for high-value transactions 
 
 
 Lending-Specific Risk Factors 
<p>1. Opaque Business Structures<br>
LLCs, trusts, and holding companies often obscure real ownership.</p>
<p>2. High Application Volume<br>
Manual KYB checks don’t scale with demand.</p>
<p>3. Evolving Regulatory Standards<br>
CTA in the U.S., EU AMLA rollout, and FATF alignment create shifting expectations.</p>
<p>4. Loan Fraud and Misuse of Funds<br>
Inadequate checks can lead to reputational damage, defaults, and penalties.</p>
 
 How iComply Supports AML in Lending 
<p>iComply provides a configurable platform that simplifies KYB, UBO discovery, and AML monitoring for commercial lenders.</p>
 1. Streamlined KYB Onboarding 
 
 Verify legal entities through registry and document checks 
 Identify directors, shareholders, and authorized signatories 
 Localized workflows and multilingual support 
 
 2. Beneficial Ownership Mapping 
 
 Visual UBO trees across jurisdictions

<p>Ransomware prevention is no longer about defense alone. It’s a Monday morning at a global consumer bank. Customers logging into online banking suddenly can’t access their accounts. Behind the scenes, ransomware has encrypted core systems and stolen millions of customer records. The attackers aren’t only demanding payment to restore access, they’re also threatening to release personally identifiable information (PII), exposing customers to fraud and the bank to severe regulatory penalties. This isn’t a nightmare scenario, but the reality that many financial institutions are already facing. According to the <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03GT9kP0">Link Index for Ransomware Prevention (2025)</a>, ransomware incidents are rising year-over-year in the financial services sector, with projected damages exceeding $30 billion annually by 2026. The Link Index echoes findings from Cybersecurity Ventures, which identify ransomware as one of the fastest-growing forms of cybercrime worldwide, with a new attack occurring every two seconds as perpetrators refine their malware payloads and extortion tactics.</p>



 







 



 What is Ransomware? 



<p>The Link Index defines ransomware as malicious software that encrypts or steals an organization’s data and demands payment for its return or release. Once considered a technical nuisance, ransomware has become a systemic cyber risk impacting industries from financial services to healthcare.</p>



 Types of Ransomware Attacks 



 
 Encryption-based ransomware: Locks critical systems until ransom is paid. 



 Double extortion: Combines encryption with data theft, threatening to publish sensitive data if payment is refused. 



 AI-enabled ransomware: Accelerates the threat further, mutating payloads faster than defenders can respond. 
 



 Why Traditional Defenses Fail 



<p>The Link Index highlights a persistent reliance on backups, endpoint detection (EDR), and extended detection and response (XDR) that are proving inadequate:</p>



 
 Backups no longer guarantee resilience, since stolen data can still be weaponized for extortion. 



 EDR/XDR tools overwhelm analysts, with over 40% of ransomware alerts flagged as false positives in some enterprises. 
 



<p>These findings are reinforced by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM and Ponemon Institute</a>, which identify alert fatigue as one of the costliest inefficiencies for enterprise security teams. The U.S. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> echoes this challenge, noting in its #StopRansomware Guide that traditional defenses often fail against modern double extortion and data destruction tactics.Perhaps most concerning: defenses can’t keep up with the speed of ransomware evolution. By the time a signature is written, AI-enabled ransomware variants like LockBit 3.0 and BlackCat have already mutated, leaving enterprises one step behind.</p>



 The Stakes Are Rising 



<p>According to Liminal’s research, the top drivers of enterprise adoption for ransomware prevention solutions are regulatory pressure, insurance mandates, and operational continuity. These forces are intensifying across global markets.</p>



 



 



Top buyer adoption drivers for ransomware prevention solutions



 
 Regulatory Pressure: In the U.S., the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-139">SEC</a> now requires public companies to disclose material cyber incidents on Form 8-K. In Europe, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">EU NIS2 Directive</a> enforces similarly strict resilience standards. 



 Insurance Mandates: The Link Index found that insurance mandates rank among the top three adoption drivers, with industry leaders like <a href="https://www.marsh.com/en/services/cyber-risk/insights.html">Marsh</a> confirming stricter underwriting standards. 



 Operational Continuity: Downtime remains one of the most critical financial risks. Studies show a single day of ransomware downtime can cost enterprises $1M per day (ITIC via ransomware.org). 
 



<p>For broader strategies around managing supplier and insurer demands, see the <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03GTskf0">Link Index for Cybersecurity Third-party Risk Management</a>.</p>



 



<p>“We’re seeing ransomware shift from being an IT headache to a full-blown business crisis. The data shows damages climbing past $30B by 2026, and the old playbook of backups and detection just isn’t enough anymore. Enterprises need intelligence-first prevention to stay ahead.”— Jonathan Gergis, Insights Team Lead, Liminal</p>

 The Solution: How Intelligence-Driven Ransomware Prevention Works 



<p>The Link Index identifies a decisive shift toward intelligence-driven prevention as the new enterprise standard. Rather than waiting for alerts, enterprises are adopting solutions that:</p>



 
 Correlate weak signals across endpoints, cloud, and networks. 



 Apply behavioral analytics to detect credential abuse and lateral movement. 



 Provide real-time business context to analysts for decisive action. 
 



<p>This shift is visible in the market. Vendors are retooling product roadmaps to deliver ransomware-specific intelligence capable of detecting advanced variants like LockBit and BlackCat. Importantly, 63% of CISOs surveyed in the Link Index now rank intelligence-first ransomware prevention above legacy tool upgrades. This trend is echoed by Gartner, which emphasizes that behavioral detection and intelligence-driven strategies must replace signature-based tools.</p>



<p>Leading security vendors are already pivoting toward this model:</p>



 
 Microsoft has embedded ransomware-specific intelligence into its Defender platform. 



 CrowdStrike has expanded its Falcon platform to correlate signals across endpoints and cloud. 



 Palo Alto Networks is retooling its Cortex suite to emphasize prevention through behavioral analytics and automated response. 
 



<p>These shifts reflect a broader industry recognition that traditional defenses cannot keep pace with AI-enabled ransomware variants.</p>



<p>For broader strategies around managing AI Data Governance, see the <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03GTmL00">AI Data Governance Link Index</a>.</p>



 What CISOs Should Do Now 



<p>CISOs looking to strengthen resilience against ransomware should prioritize intelligence-first strategies. Key actions include:</p>



 
 Build cross-platform intelligence pipelines to unify data across endpoints, cloud, and network environments. 



 Validate vendor claims by demanding proof of real-time ransomware variant detection, not just signature-based defenses. 



 Update incident response playbooks to address modern double extortion scenarios. 



 Align prevention strategies with regulations like the SEC’s cyber disclosure rules and the EU’s NIS2 Directive, ensuring compliance and insurer coverage. 



 Invest across five prevention categories from the Ransomware Prevention Link Index: endpoint protection, backup and recovery, identity security, detection and response, and email/web security. 
 



<p>By embedding these practices into a unified, intelligence-driven prevention framework, enterprises can reduce reliance on reactive defenses and build resilience that meets both regulatory scrutiny and insurance mandates.</p>



 Key Takeaways 



 
 $30B in annual ransomware damages by 2026 (Link Index). 



 Traditional defenses fail against AI-enabled ransomware like LockBit 3.0 and BlackCat; false positives drain analyst resources. 



 Intelligence-driven prevention is the new enterprise standard: signal correlation, behavioral analytics, and real-time context. 



 Regulatory, insurance, and financial pressures SEC, EU NIS2, and leaders like Marsh, are accelerating adoption. 



 CISOs must act now: align strategies with regulations and insurance standards while investing in intelligence-led prevention.

<p>Across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including mature economies like Singapore and Malaysia, and high-growth markets like Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, as well as in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), the future of finance is being written in real time. From Jakarta to Sydney, Bangkok to Wellington, financial institutions are embracing rapid digitization. Regulatory reform, fintech competition, rising fraud threats, and shifting consumer expectations are all pushing the industry to evolve rapidly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in this rush to innovate, success is no longer just about launching the next digital wallet, cashless payment option, or open banking Application Programming Interfaces (API). It’s about trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To grow and scale in today’s connected economy, financial services organizations must continuously prove who a customer is, whether a transaction is safe, and how data should be shared. That’s where digital identity, or identity and access management (IAM) comes in. Digital identity is not simply a technical enabler - it’s the connective tissue between trust, innovation, security, and scale. And across ASEAN and ANZ, it’s increasingly being recognized as the foundational capability that determines how, and how fast, financial services can evolve.</p>

 Your diploma, on your phone: a student-first guide to secure digital credentials 
<p>Who this is for: students (and anyone helping students—career services, program leads, registrars)<br>
Promise: zero paper chase, faster opportunities, more privacy—without you learning any tech.</p>
 TL;DR (read this if you’re between classes) 
 
 Show proof in seconds. Instead of digging for PDFs or waiting on office emails, you share a secure link or QR from your phone. Employers, scholarships, other schools—everyone gets a clear yes/no instantly. 
 You control your info. Share only what’s needed (e.g., “enrolled this term” or “degree awarded”). No oversharing, no surprises. 
 Built for real life. Lost your phone? Credentials can be re-issued. Name spelled wrong? They can revoke and fix fast, and verifiers always see the latest version. 
 AI-first for safety. Extrimian uses AI to protect your identity and speed up university workflows—not to snoop on you or cut corners. 
 
<p>Why should you care (today, not “someday”)?</p>
<p>Scholarships and benefits need status now, not next week. Many proofs are simple: “Is this student currently enrolled?” Your enrollment credential answers that without dumping your full transcript. Fewer forms; faster yeses.</p>
<p>Study abroad and transfers are smoother. Another school can confirm a course completion or degree without emailing five offices. You share once; they verify independently; your application keeps moving.</p>
<p>Privacy actually improves. You don’t have to forward ancient PDFs that reveal way too much. With a digital credential, you show the minimum required—and only when you choose.</p>
<p>You always have it with you. Your phone already holds tickets, payments, and boarding passes. Your diploma and key proofs belong there too—secure, portable, ready when opportunity calls.</p>
 How it works—without the nerd talk 
<p>Think of each credential (your diploma, enrollment status, course badge) as a sealed envelope with your university’s unique stamp.</p>
 
 If someone opens it and changes even a line, the stamp breaks, and the checker immediately says Not valid. 
 Extrimian provides the stamp (digital signature), the envelope (the credential in your wallet), and the counter window (the university’s one-page verification site) where anyone can check it—no emails, no guessing. 
 
<p>You don’t manage keys, blockchains, or any of that. You just receive, store, and share—and it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real moments you’ll use it (and how it feels) 
 1) “Can you prove you actually graduated?” 
<p>You tap Share diploma, send a link or show a QR. The recruiter scans and sees: Valid — Degree: [Your Degree], Issuer: [Your University], Date: [Month/Year]. Done. No PDF edits, no “I’ll pass it to my manager,” no waiting.</p>
 2) “We need proof you’re enrolled for this semester.” 
<p>You share Enrollment: Current Term. It shows exactly that—and nothing else. If your status changes, the old credential is revoked and anyone who checks it sees that it’s no longer valid.</p>
 3) “Upload a course completion for credit transfer.” 
<p>You share a verifiable course credential that confirms you passed the class. The other school verifies it themselves and moves on to the next step. Less paperwork, fewer delays.</p>
 4) “Student discount—show ID?” 
<p>You present a student ID credential. The vendor or campus service scans and gets a simple Yes without seeing your grades, address, or anything personal they don’t need.</p>
 5) “Oh no, I lost my phone…” 
<p>If you lose your device, you tell the university. They revoke the old credentials and re-issue to your new device after confirming it’s you. The verification page always shows the latest truth, so you’re covered.</p>
 6) “There’s a typo on my diploma.” 
<p>It happens. The registrar revokes the old one and re-issues a corrected credential. Anyone who checks the old link sees “Revoked,” and the new link shows your accurate details. No awkward explanations.</p>
 Your data, your call (how privacy works in plain language) 
 
 Share the minimum. Many checks only need a yes/no on a specific fact (enrolled, degree awarded, course completed). Your credential can provide just that. 
 You choose when to share. Nothing leaves your wallet until you decide to present it. You’re in the driver’s seat. 
 It’s obvious if someone tampers. If a file is altered, the verification fails immediately. You don’t have to argue; the page tells the truth. 
 Clean history for you. When a credential is revoked and re-issued (e.g., to fix a typo), everyone sees the updated version at the same link. No “which PDF is the latest?” chaos. 
 
 Get started in 3 easy steps (what you’ll actually do) 
 
 Receive your credential.<br>
 When your university turns this on, you’ll get instructions to add a wallet (mobile or web) and receive your diploma/enrollment credentials securely. 
 Keep it safe.<br>
 Set a PIN or biometric lock for the digital identity wallet (Face ID, fingerprint). If you change phones, you’ll have a simple way to recover or re-issue with university support. 
 Share when needed.<br>
 For scholarships, or transfers: open the wallet → Share → send link or show QR. The other side gets a clear answer in seconds, and you keep control. 
 
<p>See a real live demo here from UAGRO, one of our succesfull cae studies:&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kdeaJqsRFbe4mE32_hoZ81HVC4-2Km0C/view?usp=sharing">UAGRO – Students Credentials &amp; Digital ID Wallet Demo</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>University Secure Identity &amp; Data</p>
 
 FAQ about verified digital diplomas: 
 Can I still get a paper diploma? 
<p>Yes, if your university offers it. The digital version is the official way to prove authenticity online—and you can even print a QR on the paper diploma that points back to it.</p>
 Do I need the internet to show it?<br>
 
<p>You can open your wallet and show the QR; the verifier needs a connection to check the status. If you’re somewhere with poor signal, you can share the link later. Many events now have scanners or staff with connectivity.</p>
 What if I don’t want to share my grades?<br>
 
<p>You don’t have to. Most checks only need a degree or enrollment. Share the minimum required for the situation.</p>
 What if something’s wrong on my credential? 
<p>Ask the registrar to revoke and re-issue. You’ll get the corrected one quickly, and anyone using the old link will see it’s no longer valid. No awkward “ignore my last attachment” moments.</p>
 <br>
Which benefits this tech offers to student &amp; clubs 
 
 Club badges and event passes: your university may issue digital badges for roles or events. They’re easy to share with sponsors or include in portfolios. 
 Volunteering &amp; labs: log verified hours or lab competencies as mini-credentials you can show to research programs or NGOs. 
 Community trust: a simple Valid check reduces ticket fraud and line headaches at big events. 
 
<p>(Availability depends on what your university enables—ask your student affairs office what’s planned.)</p>
 What this means for your university

				  Through its partnership with SITA, Indicio will advance government-issued digital travel credentials in this two-year digital identity wallet trial, building on its success as the first to implement biometric-enabled credentials for international travel and border crossing.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>APTITUDE, one of the newest Large Scale Pilots backed by the European Commission, has officially launched, marking a major milestone in the EU’s drive to equip 80% of residents with a digital identity wallet by 2026 and setting out to prove how digital wallets can transform travel and payments across Europe.</p>
 What is APTITUDE? 
<p>APTITUDE is a groundbreaking €20 million cross-border initiative coordinated by the French government that brings together 118 partners from 11 EU Member States and Ukraine to analyze, integrate, and pilot real-world use cases for travel and payment within the European Digital Identity Framework (EUDI).</p>
<p>Backed by funding under the €8.1 billion <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/digital">Digital Europe Programme</a>, APTITUDE is part of the EU’s broader effort to drive digital transformation and operationalize the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/spaces/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/pages/694487738/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> by demonstrating its value across critical industries.</p>
<p>The scale of APTITUDE reflects the importance of digital identity in enabling secure, efficient, and interoperable services across borders. The project is a milestone in the global movement to make digital identity secure, interoperable, and practical at scale. Uniting governments, technology providers, and industry leaders, APTITUDE will test and validate solutions that meet EU standards and deliver practical benefits to citizens and businesses.</p>
 The digital transformation of travel 
<p>Travel and payments are critical touchpoints between people, governments, and businesses. As more governments and businesses worldwide build new digital identity ecosystems, Indicio’s leadership and expertise in decentralized identity, its expertise in combining <a href="https://indicio.tech/biometric-authentication/">biometrics</a> in <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, and its focus on <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-standards/">interoperability</a> based on open standards, make digital identity in travel work seamlessly, simply, and cost-effectively across ecosystems while delivering real value.</p>
<p>With our partner SITA, a recognized leader in aviation technology, Indicio is helping to create the infrastructure and software solutions that allow digital identity to be securely verified and reused across airlines, airports, border control checkpoints, and payment channels.</p>
<p>Indicio’s technology streamlines the traveler’s journey by reducing repeated identity checks, reliance on paper documents, manual data entry, and visual inspections. It also increases airport capacity and enables governments to control their borders with the highest level of identity assurance.</p>
<p>The result is measurable value:</p>
 
 Airlines and airports reduce bottlenecks and improve operational flow without the need to increase resources or higher costs. 
 Governments gain secure, interoperable systems that strengthen compliance and protect against identity fraud and document abuse. 
 Travelers and citizens enjoy a&nbsp; faster, seamless experience that safeguards their privacy and personal data. 
 
 Global leadership, local impact 
<p>Indicio’s contributions to APTITUDE are part of our broader leadership in building solutions that deliver digital trust worldwide. From Africa, the Middle East, and Asia to Europe, the Carribean and the Americas, Indicio is connecting industries, governments, and citizens in ways that are fast, secure, private, and valuable.</p>
<p>APTITUDE shows what is possible when expertise and collaboration come together. By contributing to this large-scale pilot, Indicio is helping shape the future of travel and payments in Europe and the global framework for trusted digital identity.</p>
<p>If you are an organization preparing for the shift to digital identity, now is the time to act. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Connect with Indicio</a> to stay up-to-date with this project and to book a call with one of our experts to discuss how our solutions can rapidly deliver the benefits of trusted digital identity and data.</p>

  <p>Secure access with enterprise IT oversight between independent applications that communicate with each other is a recognized gap in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/">OAuth 2.0</a>. Enterprises can’t effectively regulate cross-app communication, as OAuth 2.0 consent screens rely on users granting access to their individual accounts. Now, with the advent of AI agents that communicate across systems, the need to solve the gap is even greater – especially given the growing importance of enterprise AI security in protecting sensitive data flows.</p>

 What is Cross App Access (XAA)? 

<p>Cross App Access (XAA) is a new protocol that lets integrators enable secure agent-to-app and app-to-app access. Instead of scattered integrations and repeated logins, enterprise IT admins gain centralized control: they can decide what connects, enforce security policies, and see exactly what’s being accessed. This unlocks seamless, scalable integrations across apps — whether it’s just two like Google Calendar and Zoom, or hundreds across the enterprise. Read more about Cross App Access in this post:</p>

<p>Or watch the video about Cross App Access:</p>

 
            
         

<p>In this post, we’ll go hands-on with Cross App Access. Using Todo0 (the Resource App) and Agent0 (the Requesting App) as our sample applications, and Okta as the enterprise Identity Provider (IdP), we’ll show you how to set up trust, exchange tokens, and enable secure API calls between apps that enable enterprise IT oversight. By the end, you’ll not only understand how the protocol works but also have a working example you can adapt to your own integrations.</p>

 Prerequisites to set up the AI agent to app connections using Cross App Access (XAA) 

<p>To set up secure agent-to-app connections with Cross App Access (XAA), you’ll need the following:</p>

 
   Okta Developer Account (Integrator Free Plan): You’ll need an Okta Developer Account with the Integrator Free Plan. This account will act as your Identity Provider (IdP) for setting up Cross App Access.
     
       If you don’t already have an account, sign up for a new one here: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta Integrator Free Plan</a> 
       Once created, sign in to your new org 
     
   
   AWS Credentials: You’ll need an AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key
     
       The IAM user or role associated with these credentials must have access to Amazon Bedrock, specifically the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, enabled 
       If you don’t know how to obtain the credentials, <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-cross-app-access-mcp/blob/main/guide/aws-bedrock.md">follow this guide</a> 
     
   
   Developer Tools: These tools are essential for cloning, editing, building, and running your demo applications
     
       <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> – to clone and manage the repository 
       <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">VS Code</a> – for reading and modifying the sample source code 
       <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">Dev Containers Extension (VS Code)</a> – recommended, as it automatically configures dependencies and environments when you open the project 
       <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker</a> – required by the Dev Container to build and run the sample applications in isolated environments

 Use Okta to secure AI applications with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>Before we dive into the code, we need to register our apps with Okta. In this demo:</p>

 
   Agent0: the AI agent requesting app (makes the API call on behalf of the user) 
   Todo0: the resource app (owns the protected API) 
   Managed connection: the trust relationship between the two apps, created in Okta 
 

<p>We’ll create both apps in your Okta Integrator Free Plan account, grab their client credentials, and then connect them.</p>

 Enable Cross App Access in your Okta org 

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note: Cross App Access is currently a self-service Early Access (EA) feature. It must be enabled through the Admin Console before the apps appear in the catalog. If you don’t see the option right away, refresh and confirm you have the necessary admin permissions. Learn more in the <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/security/manage-ea-and-beta-features.htm">Okta documentation on managing EA and beta features</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   Sign in to your Okta Integrator Free plan account 
   In the Okta Admin Console, select Settings &gt; Features 
   Navigate to Early access 
   Find Cross App Access and select Turn on (enable the toggle) 
   Refresh the Admin Console 
 

<p></p>

 Create the resource app (Todo0) 

 
   In the Okta Admin console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Select Browse App Catalog 
   Search for Todo0 - Cross App Access (XAA) Sample Resource App, and select it 
   Select Add Integration 
   Enter “Todo0” in the Application label field and click Done 
   Click the Sign On tab to view the Client ID and Client secret. These are required to include in your <code>.env.todo</code> 
 

<p></p>

 Create the requesting app (Agent0) 

 
   Go back to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Select Browse App Catalog 
   Search for Agent0 - Cross App Access (XAA) Sample Requesting App, and select it 
   Select Add Integration 
   Enter Agent0 in the Application label field and click Done 
   Click the Sign On tab to view the Client ID and Client secret. These are required to be included in your <code>.env.agent</code> 
 

<p></p>

 Establishing connections between Todo0 &amp; AI agent (Agent0) 

 
   From the Applications page, select the Agent0 app 
   Go to the Manage Connections tab 
   Under App granted consent, select Add requesting apps, select Todo0, then Save 
   Under Apps providing consent, select Add resource apps, select Todo0, then Save 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now Agent0 and Todo0 are connected. If you check the Manage Connection tab for either app, you’ll see that the connection has been established.</p>

 Set up a test user in Okta org 

<p>Now that the apps are in place, we need a test user who will sign in and trigger the Cross App Access flow.</p>

 Create the test user 

 
   In the Okta Admin Console, go to Directory &gt; People 
   Select Add Person 
   Fill in the details:
     
       First name: Bob 
       Last name: Tables 
       Username / Email: <code>bob@tables.fake</code> 
     
   
   Under Activations, select Activate now, mark ☑️ I will set password, and create a temporary password 
   Optional: You can mark ☑️ User must change password on first login 
   Select Save (If you don’t see the new user right away, refresh the page) 
 

<p></p>

 Assign the Okta applications to the test user 

 
   Open the Bob Tables user profile 
   Select Assign Applications 
   Assign both Agent0 (requesting app) and Todo0 (resource app) to Bob 
 

<p></p>

<p>This ensures Bob can sign in to Agent0, and Agent0 can securely request access to Todo0 on his behalf.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note: Bob will be the identity we use throughout this guide to demonstrate how Agent0 accesses Todo0’s API through Cross App Access.</p>
</blockquote>

 Configure the Node.js Cross App Access project 

<p>With your Okta environment (apps and user) ready, let’s set up the local project. Before we dive into configs, here’s a quick look at what you’ll be working with.</p>

 
   
    <p>Clone the repository:</p>

       <code> git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-cross-app-access-mcp

</code>   

 Configure OAuth 2.0 and AI foundation models environment files 

<p>At this point, you have:</p>

 
   Client IDs and Client Secrets for both Agent0 and Todo0 (from the Okta Admin Console) 
   
    <p>Your Okta org URL, visible in the Okta Admin Console profile menu of the Admin Console. It usually looks like</p>

       <code>  https://integrator-123456.okta.com
</code>       
   
 

<p>This URL will be your IdP issuer URL and is shared across both apps.</p>

 Generate OIDC configuration and access token files 

<p>From the project root, run:</p>

   <code>yarn setup:env
</code>   

<p>This scaffolds the following files:</p>

 
   <code>packages/authorization-server/.env.todo</code> 
   <code>packages/authorization-server/.env.agent</code> 
   <code>packages/agent0/.env</code> 
 

 Configure AI and resource application connection values 

<p>Open each file and update the placeholder with your org-specific values:</p>

<p><code>authorization-server/.env.todo</code></p>

   <code>CUSTOMER1_EMAIL_DOMAIN=tables.fake
CUSTOMER1_AUTH_ISSUER=&lt;Your integrator account URL&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_ID=&lt;Todo0 client id&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;Todo0 client secret&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>authorization-server/.env.agent</code></p>

   <code>CUSTOMER1_EMAIL_DOMAIN=tables.fake
CUSTOMER1_AUTH_ISSUER=&lt;Your integrator account URL&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_ID=&lt;Agent0 client id&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;Agent0 client secret&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>agent0/.env</code></p>

   <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&lt;your AWS access key id&gt;
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;your AWS secret access key&gt;
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note:</p>
   
     The issuer URL (<code>CUSTOMER1_AUTH_ISSUER</code>) is the same in both <code>.env.todo</code> and <code>.env.agent</code> 
     The Client ID/Client secret values differ because they come from the respective apps you created 
     AWS credentials are required only for Agent0 (requesting app) 
   
</blockquote>

 Register OAuth 2.0 redirect URIs for both apps 

<p>Finally, we need to tell Okta where to send the authentication response for each app.</p>

<p>For Agent0:</p>

 
   From your Okta Admin Console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Open the Agent0 app 
   Navigate to the Sign On tab 
   In the Settings section, select Edit 
   
    <p>In the Redirect URIs field, add</p>

       <code> http://localhost:5000/openid/callback/customer1
</code>       
   
   Select Save 
 

<p>Repeat the same steps for Todo0:</p>

 
   Open the Todo0 app 
   Go to the Sign On tab &gt; Settings &gt; Edit 
   
    <p>In the Redirect URIs field, add:</p>

       <code> http://localhost:5001/openid/callback/customer1
</code>       
   
   Select Save 
 

<p>Now both apps know where to redirect after authentication.</p>

 Initialize the database and run the project 

<p>With the apps and environment configuration in place, the next step is to prepare the local project, set up its databases, and bring both applications online.</p>

 Bootstrap the project 

<p>From the root of the repo, install all workspaces and initialize the databases:</p>

   <code>yarn bootstrap
</code>   

<p>Since this is your first run, you’ll be asked whether to reset the database. Type “<code>y</code>” for both Todo0 and Agent0.</p>

 Run and access the apps in your browser 

<p>Once the bootstrap is complete, start both apps (and their authorization servers) with:</p>

   <code>yarn start
</code>   

<p>Open the following ports in your Chrome browser’s tab:</p>

 
   Todo0 (Resource App): <a href="http://localhost:3001">http://localhost:3001</a> 
   Agent0 (Requesting App): <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> 
 

<p>At this point, both apps should be live and connected through Okta. 🎉</p>

 Testing the XAA flow: From Bob to Agent0 to Todo0 

<p>With everything configured, it’s time to see Cross App Access in action.</p>

 Interact with Todo0, the XAA resource app, by creating tasks 

 
   In the Work Email field, enter: <code>bob@tables.fake</code>, and select Continue
 
   You’ll be redirected to the Okta Login page. Sign in with the test user credentials:
     
       Username: <code>bob@tables.fake</code> 
       Password: the temporary password you created earlier 
     
   
   The first time you sign in, you’ll be prompted to:
     
       Set a new password 
       Enroll in <a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/mobile/okta-verify-overview.htm">Okta Verify</a> for MFA 
     
   
   Once logged in, add several tasks to your to-do list 
   Select one of the tasks and mark it as complete to verify that the application updates the status accurately
 
 

 Let the AI agent, the requesting app, access your todos 

 
   Open the Agent0 app in your browser
 
   Select Initialize to set up the AWS Bedrock client. Once connected, you’ll see the following message:<br>
<code>✅ Successfully connected to AWS Bedrock! You can now start chatting.</code> 
   Select the Connect to IdP button
     
       Behind the scenes, Agent0 requests an identity assertion from Okta and exchanges it for an access token to Todo0 
       If everything is configured correctly, you’ll see the following message<br>
<code>Authentication completed successfully! Welcome back.</code>
 
     
   
   To confirm that Agent0 is actually receiving tokens from Okta:
     
       Open a new browser tab and navigate to: <code>http://localhost:3000/api/tokens</code> 
       You should see a JSON payload containing: <code>accessToken</code>, <code>jagToken</code>, and <code>idToken</code> This verifies that Agent0 successfully authenticated through Okta and obtained the tokens needed to call Todo0
 
     
   
   Now interact with Agent0 using natural prompts. For example: write this prompt
       <code> What's on my plate in my to-do list?
</code>       
    <blockquote>
      <p>⚠️ Note: Agent0 will call the Todo0 API using the access token and return your pending tasks
</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Let’s try some more prompts
     
       Ask Agent0 to add a new task 
       Ask it to mark an existing task complete 
       Refresh the Todo0 app — you’ll see the changes reflected instantly
 
     
   
 

 Behind the scenes: the OAuth 2.0 Identity Assertion Authorization Grant 

<p>✅ Bob Tables logs in once with Okta<br>
⏩ Agent0 (requesting app) gets an identity assertion from Okta<br>
🔄 Okta vouches for Bob and exchanges that assertion for an access token<br>
👋 Agent0 uses that token to securely call the Todo0 (resource app) API</p>

<p></p>

   We don’t spend much time thinking about the roads we drive on—until one cracks, collapses, or dumps us somewhere we didn’t mean to be. Identity in the age of agentic AI? Same deal. It’s infrastructure. Like a good road, it needs to be ready for traffic we can’t imagine.

<p>“We don’t spend much time thinking about the roads we drive on—until one cracks, collapses, or dumps us somewhere we didn’t mean to be.”</p>



<p> Identity in the age of agentic AI? Same deal. It’s infrastructure. And just like a good road system, it needs to be engineered with care, built on solid standards, and ready for traffic we can’t even imagine yet.</p>



<p>Right now, autonomous agents are already taking actions on behalf of people and businesses—booking meetings, writing and summarizing emails, pushing code, moving money. Which means we should probably stop and ask: how are those identity and access decisions getting made? Are they secure? Reviewed? Built to best practices? Or are we flooring it across an uninspected bridge, hoping the potholes aren’t too deep?</p>



<p>The protocols making this possible—things like the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) and Google’s <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/">Agent2Agent</a> (A2A)—are still wet cement. If we want to go from today’s cow paths (cow poop included) to tomorrow’s superhighways, we can’t just slap on more lanes later. We need a strong identity layer poured in from the start.</p>



<p>This post is based on a keynote I gave recently at a large corporate event, where the audience was asking the right questions. If you’re building or maintaining systems that will eventually include autonomous agents, or you’re already there, this is for you.</p>

 What I mean by identity, identity infrastructure, and agentic AI 



<p>“Identity” and “identity infrastructure” can mean different things depending on who you ask. (Get a hundred IAM professionals in a room and you’ll get a thousand definitions.) Since this is my blog post, here’s how I’m using the terms:</p>



 
 Identity – a persistent, verifiable representation of an entity—human or non-human—that other systems can use to decide what it can do, when, for what purpose, and under what conditions. 



 Identity infrastructure – the shared, stable, and standards-based systems, protocols, and governance that make those identities usable across teams, organizations, and technologies, securely, interoperably, and at scale. 



 Agentic AI – borrowing <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/">NVIDIA’s phrasing</a>, an AI system (often powered by large language models) with sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning that can autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems. The key word here is autonomous. Generative AI creates content; agentic AI takes action. 
 



<p>Without grounding in these definitions, it’s easy to talk past each other. With them, we can focus on the real issue: building identity infrastructure that works across both human and non-human actors, especially when those non-humans are making decisions at machine speed.</p>



 AI’s upside is real, but it’s missing a foundation 



<p>When most people talk about AI, we talk about the upside:</p>



 
 Faster iteration cycles 



 Smart automation 



 Real productivity gains 



 Code generation 



 Helpful chatbots that can field questions at scale 
 



<p>GitHub’s <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">Octoverse</a> report showed a 59% surge in contributions to generative AI projects and a 98% increase in the number of projects overall. Many contributions came from India, Germany, Japan, and Singapore. Interestingly, they also reported that AI hasn’t flooded open source with low-quality junk—if anything, it’s drawing more people into development. (I’m not sure I believe their assertion about the junk. That doesn’t match what I’m hearing anecdotally, but then again, that’s why there are actual studies to balance perception with facts.)</p>



<p>That’s all impressive, even when the results aren’t perfect. These tools are still young, evolving fast, and unlocking new creativity across the stack.</p>



<p>But there’s a missing question in all this excitement: who is acting? On whose behalf? And with what authority?</p>



<p>That’s the identity layer. Without it, all this innovation becomes harder to govern, harder to scale, and harder to trust.</p>



 Agents are already in your systems 



<p>This isn’t hypothetical. Agents are in your tools, updating dependencies, answering tickets, creating calendar invites, summarizing documents, pushing code, and talking to customers.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s 2025 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born">Work Trend Index</a> reports that global leaders rank customer service, marketing, and product development as the top three areas for accelerated AI investment in the next 12–18 months. Seventy-three percent of leading-edge companies will use AI for marketing. Sixty-six percent for customer success. Even internal communications sees 68% adoption.</p>



<p>That’s a lot of automation acting in our name. Without clear identity controls, there is also a lot of potential for AI “marketing fails” or, worse, high-stakes errors.</p>



<p>A few examples:</p>



 
 <a href="https://fastforward.boldstart.vc/when-ai-goes-wrong/">A rogue AI coding assistant</a> wiped out a startup’s production database. 



 <a href="https://www.staffingindustry.com/editorial/cws-30-contingent-workforce-strategies/tutoring-firm-settles-eeocs-first-ai-hiring-bias">AI-powered recruiting software</a> rejected qualified applicants based purely on age and gender, landing the company in court with the EEOC. 
 



<p>These tools are powerful and fast—but oversight around identity and accountability hasn’t kept up.</p>



 Identity isn’t just a login box 



<p>Identity is infrastructure. And infrastructure is more than a username and password. When humans act, we typically have an audit trail: who did what, when, and why. We rely on login sessions, logs, access controls, and behavioral patterns.</p>



<p>But when AI agents act, especially ones with high autonomy, we need something more durable. We need fine-grained delegation models, audit trails tied to machine-driven decisions, and identity primitives that work across humans and non-humans alike.</p>



 
 Identity systems that recognize both human and non-human actors 



 Delegation models that can express “who can do what, for whom, under what conditions” 



 Clear provenance: who authorized the action, and is it appropriate in this context? 



 Verifiability—so we can prove what happened, after the fact 
 



<p>Without that infrastructure, the entire agentic AI ecosystem risks becoming a black box. And for security teams, DevOps leads, and auditors, that’s a non-starter.</p>



 The right questions lead to better systems 



<p>If an agent makes a change, you should be able to answer: Was it authorized? Who delegated the authority? What policy applied?</p>



<p>Microsoft’s report hints at this by asking leaders: how many agents are needed for which roles and tasks, and how many humans to guide them? Those are good but very surface-level questions.</p>



<p>We can push further:</p>



 
 Do you have enough data to clearly scope the role for an AI? 



 Can you give it only the access it needs, when it needs it, for the specific task at hand? 
 



<p>These questions aren’t just risk management. They’re a chance to improve system hygiene and clarity across the board.</p>



 Protocols are evolving but identity hasn’t caught up 



<p>You might be thinking: okay, so what’s out there to support this?</p>



<p>Protocols like the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview">Multi-Agent Communication Protocol</a> (MCP) and <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/">Agent2Agent</a> (A2A) messaging are <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/17/the-mcp-bandwagon/">early candidates</a>. They enable agents to communicate and coordinate in powerful ways. But they were designed to simplify agents’ communication with agents; they weren’t designed with identity in mind.</p>



<p>Even folks who helped shape OAuth are wrestling with how traditional delegation models fit—or don’t fit—into this space. The communication protocols aren’t broken, they’re just early. Identity hasn’t caught up yet.</p>



<p>And if we don’t make faster progress on these issues, we’ll be forever retrofitting trust into systems that were never built to handle it.</p>



 Why this can’t be proprietary 



<p>You might be tempted to solve this in-house. Build your own delegation model, your own trust chain, your own method for agentic AI authorization. This scenario freaks me out. If every organization invents its own approach to agent identity, we’ll end up right back where we started, in a world of fragile integrations, inconsistent assumptions, and big gaps in accountability.</p>



<p>We’ve ALL seen this before, and the result is always the same:</p>



 
 Fragile integrations 



 Misaligned assumptions between systems 



 Gaps in visibility and accountability 



 Security holes you can drive a nation-state through 
 



<p>That’s why <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/24/digital-identity-open-standards/">open standards</a> matter, not as a checkbox, but as the only viable way to scale trust across systems, companies, and industries.</p>



<p>And to be clear, “open” doesn’t just mean “you can download the spec.” It means:</p>



 
 Shared governance 



 Transparent development 



 Real-world applicability 



 Participation from a broad mix of stakeholders, including security, product, legal, and compliance 
 



<p>This isn’t easy work. But it’s the work that makes the rest possible. And when it works, we get something better than “compliant.” We get trustworthy infrastructure that scales.</p>



 What to do now—before the collapse 



<p>So where does that leave us?</p>



<p>If you’re building agentic AI capabilities into your platform, or even just experimenting with automation, you’re already laying infrastructure. The question is whether that infrastructure will support accountability, or collapse under the weight of delegation you can’t verify. Either we bolt identity onto agentic systems after the fact, or we treat identity like the infrastructure it is, and build it into the foundation.</p>



<p>You don’t need to have all the answers today. But you do need to start asking better questions:</p>



 
 Is identity part of the design, or bolted on later? 



 Are we modeling trust relationships clearly, or making assumptions? 



 Will our logs stand up in an audit, or are we relying on magic? 
 



<p>Start there.</p>



<p>And if you’re in a position to influence the broader direction of the industry, join a standards group. Challenge assumptions in product reviews. Push for interoperability, not lock-in. Make identity part of the foundation, not just a feature.</p>



<p>We don’t have to wait for things to fall apart. We can build roads we actually want to drive on.</p>

 Transcript 



 Roads as a Metaphor 



<p>[00:00:29] Welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. I’m Heather Flanagan, and today we’re going to talk about roads. Yes, roads. They’re an amazing metaphor, and I’m just going to drive this one all night long.</p>



<p>[00:00:42] We usually don’t think about the roads we drive on—until one cracks, collapses, or leaves us stranded somewhere we never meant to be.</p>



<p>[00:00:49] Identity in the age of agentic AI works the same way. It is infrastructure. And like any good road system, it must be:</p>



 
 Engineered with care 



 Built on solid standards 



 Ready for traffic we can’t even imagine yet 
 



 



 The Rise of Autonomous Agents 



<p>[00:01:04] Autonomous agents are already taking actions on behalf of people and businesses. They’re:</p>



 
 Booking meetings 



 Writing and summarizing emails 



 Pushing code 



 Moving money 
 



<p>[00:01:14] Which raises the key question: how are identity and access management decisions being made for those actions?</p>



<p>Are they secure? Reviewed? Designed according to best practices? Or are we flooring it across an uninspected bridge, hoping the potholes aren’t too deep?</p>



 



 Protocols in Wet Cement 



<p>[00:01:34] Many of the protocols enabling this—such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google’s Agent-to-Agent (A2A)—are still wet cement.</p>



<p>[00:01:44] If we want to move from today’s cow paths (cow poop included) to tomorrow’s superhighways, we can’t just slap on more lanes later. We need a strong identity layer poured in from the start.</p>



 



 Defining Identity and Agentic AI 



<p>[00:02:19] Let’s pause and define a few key terms. Because “identity” can mean wildly different things depending on who you ask.</p>



 
 Identity → A persistent, verifiable representation of an entity (person or machine) that other systems use to decide what it can do, when, and under what conditions. 



 Identity Infrastructure → Shared, stable, standards-based systems and governance that make identity portable, interoperable, and reliable at scale. 



 Agentic AI → Borrowing from Nvidia: AI, usually powered by large language models, that doesn’t just generate code but plans and reasons through complex multi-step problems on its own. 
 



<p>[00:03:46] Generative AI writes things.<br>[00:03:52] Agentic AI acts on things.</p>



<p>And that difference matters.</p>



 



 Productivity Gains vs. Identity Risks 



<p>[00:04:11] Conversations around agentic AI often emphasize upsides:</p>



 
 Faster iteration cycles 



 Smarter automation 



 Productivity gains 



 Code generation 



 Scalable chatbots 
 



<p>[00:04:25] GitHub’s Octoverse report shows:</p>



 
 59% surge in contributions to generative AI projects 



 98% increase in overall projects 



 Growth driven by developers in India, Germany, Japan, Singapore, and Latin America 
 



<p>[00:05:15] But what’s often missing is the question: who or what is acting on whose behalf, and with what authority? Without identity, this innovation becomes harder to govern, scale, and trust.</p>



 



 Real-World Consequences 



<p>[00:06:19] Consider these examples:</p>



 
 An AI coding assistant that wiped out a startup’s production database. 



 AI-powered recruiting software that rejected qualified applicants based on age and gender, resulting in lawsuits. 
 



<p>[00:06:47] These tools are fast and powerful—but oversight around identity and accountability has not caught up.</p>



 



 Why Identity Infrastructure Matters 



<p>[00:06:59] Infrastructure is more than usernames and passwords. When humans act, we leave audit trails.</p>



<p>[00:07:15] But when AI agents act at machine speed, we need more durable systems:</p>



 
 Identity recognition for both human and non-human actors 



 Delegation models clarifying who can do what for whom 



 Provenance signals to confirm authorization 



 Verifiability to prove what happened 
 



<p>[00:07:42] Without this infrastructure, agentic AI becomes a black box—and that’s a nonstarter for security teams, DevOps leads, and auditors.</p>



 



 Open Standards, Not DIY 



<p>[00:09:34] You may be tempted to build your own delegation models and trust chains.</p>



<p>[00:09:42] Please don’t.</p>



<p>Doing so leads to:</p>



 
 Fragile integrations 



 Misaligned assumptions 



 Gaps in visibility and accountability 



 Security holes you could drive a nation-state through 
 



<p>[00:09:56] That’s why open standards matter—not as a compliance checkbox, but as the only viable way to create scalable trust across companies and industries.</p>



 



 Building Roads That Last 



<p>[00:10:27] If you’re building agentic AI capabilities, you’re already laying down infrastructure. The question is:</p>



 
 Will your road support accountability? 



 Or will it collapse under unverifiable delegation? 
 



<p>[00:10:49] Ask yourself:</p>



 
 Is identity part of the design—or bolted on later? 



 Are trust relationships clearly modeled—or just assumed? 



 Will logs stand up in an audit—or are you relying on magic? 
 



<p>[00:11:03] If you want to shape the standards of the future, join standards groups, challenge assumptions in product reviews, and push for interoperability—not lock-in.</p>



<p>[00:11:21] We don’t need to wait for the bridge to collapse. We can build roads we actually want to drive on.</p>

<p>Law firms face rising global AML expectations, especially for client onboarding, source of funds checks, and beneficial ownership verification. This article explores evolving KYC and KYB rules across Canada, the UK, the U.S., Australia, and the EU – and how iComply automates compliance without compromising client confidentiality.</p>
 
 For legal professionals, client trust is everything. But across key jurisdictions, law firms are being asked to do more: verify client identity, trace beneficial ownership, and flag suspicious behaviour—all while protecting solicitor-client privilege and meeting strict privacy laws. 
<p>In Canada, the U.S., UK, and beyond, anti-money laundering regulations are evolving quickly. Firms must now demonstrate that they not only follow procedures – but that their systems can withstand audits and adapt to new threats.</p>
 
 AML Obligations for Law Firms by Jurisdiction 
 Canada 
 
 Regulators: Law societies, FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Client Identification Procedures (CIP), ongoing monitoring, beneficial ownership checks, privacy compliance (PIPEDA) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: SRA (Solicitors Regulation Authority) 
 Requirements: AML risk assessment, KYC for clients, source of funds/source of wealth checks, SARs, and recordkeeping under MLR 2017 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: ABA model rules, BOI reporting (Corporate Transparency Act) 
 Expectations: Evolving best practices for law firm AML controls, especially in real estate and corporate formation 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: Legal Services Commissions, AUSTRAC guidance 
 Requirements: Identification and verification for clients in regulated transactions; alignment with AML/CTF Act for high-risk sectors 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National bar associations, 6AMLD 
 Requirements: Client due diligence, UBO transparency, suspicious transaction reporting, GDPR compliance 
 
 
 Common Challenges in Legal Compliance 
<p>1. Confidentiality vs. Transparency<br>
Law firms must balance their duty to clients with the obligation to detect and report suspicious activity.</p>
<p>2. Manual and Fragmented Workflows<br>
Paper forms, email, and disconnected tools result in audit gaps and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>3. Complex Entity Structures<br>
Client organizations often involve trusts, layers of ownership, or offshore nominees.</p>
<p>4. Jurisdictional Conflicts<br>
Global clients mean law firms must harmonize privacy, AML, and risk obligations across borders.</p>
 
 iComply: Legal-Grade KYC and AML for Modern Firms 
<p>iComply offers a configurable platform designed to help law firms automate AML compliance while preserving client confidentiality.</p>
 1. Secure Client Onboarding (KYC/KYB) 
 
 Edge-based identity and document verification 
 No raw PII leaves the client device unencrypted 
 Supports Canadian, U.S., UK, EU, and Australian standards 
 
 2. Beneficial Ownership Mapping 
 
 Automatically uncover UBOs across jurisdictions 
 Flag nominee structures and offshore shell patterns 
 Enable configurable thresholds for review and escalation 
 
 3. Risk-Based Screening and Case Management 
 
 Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media checks 
 Centralized dashboard for audits, escalations, and decision documentation 
 Secure retention policies to meet legal recordkeeping duties 
 
 4. Privacy and Privilege Safeguards 
 
 Local hosting or on-prem options for law firm control 
 Full audit logs without exposing client communications 
 Compliance with GDPR, PIPEDA, and solicitor-client privilege standards

 Ontology’s DIDs as a Solution for Global Financial Security <p>The recent <a href="https://ont.io/news/revolut-s-fraud-dilemma-why-decentralized-identity-is-the-real-answer/">massive leaks of banking data</a> have highlighted the vulnerability of centralized financial systems and the urgent need to rethink the security of personal information. In an increasingly digital world, where cyberattacks are commonplace, users’ trust in financial institutions has been shaken. In the face of this crisis of confidence, Decentralized Identities (DIDs), offered by platforms like <a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>, are emerging as a promising solution to strengthen global financial security. This article will explore how <a href="http://ont.id">Ontology’s DIDs</a>, by returning control of data to users, can transform the financial security landscape and prevent future scandals.</p> The Achilles Heel of Centralized Systems: Banking Data&nbsp;Leaks <p>Traditional banking systems rely on a centralized model where clients’ personal and financial information is stored in vast databases managed by institutions. Although these systems are protected by sophisticated security measures, they remain prime targets for cybercriminals. Each year, millions if not billions of customer records are compromised in data breaches, leading to significant financial losses, identity theft, and the erosion of public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>These incidents underline a fundamental weakness: the concentration of data creates a single point of failure. Once an attacker breaches an institution’s defenses, they potentially gain access to a goldmine of sensitive information. Moreover, the fact that data is managed by third parties means users have little to no control over how their information is stored, used, or shared. This lack of sovereignty over data is at the heart of today’s security&nbsp;issues.</p> ONT ID: Ontology’s Decentralized Identity&nbsp;Solution <p>Ontology offers a radically different approach to identity and data management through its decentralized identity framework, ONT ID. Based on W3C recommendations for Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), ONT ID enables individuals and organizations to create and control their own digital identities. Unlike centralized systems, where data is held by third parties, ONT ID restores data sovereignty to the&nbsp;user.</p><p>With ONT ID, users can generate unique, self-sovereign identifiers that are not tied to any central entity. They can then collect verifiable credentials (e.g., diplomas, driver’s licenses, proof of residence) from trusted issuers and store them securely in their digital wallet. The crucial aspect is that the user decides when and with whom to share this information, and only the necessary data. For instance, to prove their age, a user would not need to reveal their exact date of birth, but only a verifiable proof that they are over 18. This approach minimizes the exposure of sensitive data and drastically reduces the attack surface for cybercriminals.</p> How DIDs Improve Global Financial Security <p>The integration of DIDs, and specifically ONT ID, into the financial sector provides several key advantages for security:</p>  Reduced risk of massive data leaks: By decentralizing the storage of identity data and allowing users to control their information, DIDs eliminate the single point of failure represented by centralized databases. Even if a system is compromised, attackers would only access pseudonymous identifiers rather than full personal&nbsp;data.  Stronger, passwordless authentication: DIDs enable more robust authentication methods than traditional passwords, which are frequent targets of hacking. DID-based authentication can leverage cryptographic keys, making phishing and identity theft attempts far more difficult.  Improved regulatory compliance with privacy protection: DIDs allow for more effective and privacy-preserving KYC/AML compliance. Financial institutions can verify necessary credentials without storing full copies of clients’ documents. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), often associated with DIDs, enable proving possession of an attribute (e.g., being of legal age) without disclosing the attribute itself.  Fraud and identity theft prevention: By ensuring the authenticity of digital identities and making it harder to create fake ones, DIDs can significantly reduce financial fraud and identity theft. Each transaction or interaction can be tied to a verifiable identity, without revealing the real identity to all&nbsp;parties.  Enhanced auditability and traceability: DID-related transactions are recorded on a blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent audit trail. This facilitates the detection of suspicious activities and the tracing of funds in case of fraud, while protecting legitimate users’ privacy through pseudonymization.   Challenges and Future&nbsp;Outlook <p>Despite their revolutionary potential, widespread adoption of DIDs in the financial sector is not without challenges. Interoperability between different DID implementations, raising awareness and educating both users and institutions, and achieving global regulatory harmonization are all crucial steps. Governments and regulators will need to collaborate with decentralized technology developers to create frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability.</p><p>Ontology, with its commitment to W3C standards and its growing ecosystem, is well-positioned to play a leading role in this transition. By continuing to develop user-friendly tools and forging strategic partnerships, Ontology can help bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the needs of the traditional financial sector paving the way for a future where banking data security is inherently tied to digital identity sovereignty.</p> Conclusion <p>Banking data leak scandals are a stark reminder of the fragility of centralized systems and the urgent need to adopt more resilient solutions. Decentralized Identities (DIDs), and especially Ontology’s ONT ID, offer a promising path to redefining financial security. By empowering individuals to regain control of their data, strengthening authentication, enabling privacy-preserving compliance, and reducing fraud, DIDs can radically transform how we interact with our finances.</p><p>The future of global financial security no longer lies in reinforcing centralized fortresses but in distributing the power and responsibility of digital identity to the users themselves. Ontology is at the forefront of this revolution, providing the necessary tools to build a safer, fairer, and more resilient financial ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/after-the-banking-data-leak-scandal-67ee6bca3fcb">After the Banking Data Leak Scandal</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In less than a month after the launch, SkyBridge Capital, founded by Anthony Scaramucci, a believer of bitcoin and former White House Communications Director, is moving $300m of its flagship hedge funds on-chain through Apex Digital 3.0.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are now open to invest in cryptocurrencies. These assets are designed to settle instantly, without friction. However, investors in those funds face the opposite reality as they are distributed on traditional rails.</p>
<p>It causes slow subscription, redemptions, and transfers due to fragmented settlements, as a transfer often has to pass through multiple layers of middlemen. It results in high transactional costs and delays, which in turn limit liquidity.</p>
<p>That’s why SkyBridge is moving on-chain to eliminate fragmentation and deliver real-time services. By tokenising its hedge funds, subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers can run 24/7 with full transparency. The result is lower costs, faster operations, and an investor experience that finally matches the always-on expectations of today’s markets.</p>
 Tokenisation market&nbsp;challenges 
<p>For years, tokenisation struggled to take off. Most early projects weren’t true tokenisation but digitalisation experiments. The problem wasn’t legal, but operational.</p>
<p>The key actors, including transfer agents, custodians, and asset managers, simply weren’t ready. They could put the asset on-chain, but struggled to manage subscriptions, redemptions, and custody on-chain. As a result, many institutional projects ended up with assets merely represented on the blockchain, while the servicing processes remained off-chain.</p>
<p>The market has been maturing, service providers have built the capabilities, custodians can hold tokenised assets, more people are equipped and accepting self-custody wallets, and regulators have set clearer frameworks. But integration remains critical and without it tokenisation risks becoming another silo.</p>
 On-chain finance adoption accelerates for real 
<p>That’s why we built Apex Digital 3.0. For too long, firms were promised “end-to-end” tokenisation, only to discover critical gaps. No legal structuring, no compliance support, no custody of the underlying assets, and no real distribution. The result was complexity, with issuers forced to juggle multiple providers and still falling short of scale.</p>
<p>Apex Digital 3.0 changes that. It brings everything together: legal setup, compliance advisory, issuance, custody, servicing, and cross-platform distribution in one infrastructure. Clients who want a complete 0-to-1 solution rely on us without the headache of managing separate partners. And, for those who already have preferred tools, our open architecture makes integration seamless.</p>
<p>With 22 years of proven trust and $3.5 trillion of assets under administration, Apex Group is the trusted bridge to on-chain finance, giving institutions the confidence to move massively.</p>
<p>SkyBridge’s $300m project is a live example, with more in the pipeline. This time, institutional adoption at scale is real.</p>

 The Unseen Divide 
<p>The modern consumer’s journey is a fluid dance between digital and physical spaces, yet current solutions force the retail industry to treat these channels as separate entities. While e-commerce provides a wealth of data for personalization, the physical store remains a critical setting for brand loyalty and immersive experiences, yet it remains siloed. This “unseen divide” prevents the creation of a truly unified customer profile, a single, holistic record that aggregates online and offline interactions to deliver the hyper-personalized experiences that drive revenue and retention.</p>
 The Business Problem: Fragmented Data and Impersonal Experiences 
<p>Today’s shoppers expect brands to know their interests and anticipate their needs, making personalization a competitive necessity and a key driver of success. According to a McKinsey &amp; Company report, brands that excel at personalization are seeing significant gains in marketing efficiency and up to 40% increases in revenue and retention. Conversely, failing to link online and offline personas leads to:</p>
 
 Disjointed Customer Journeys: A customer who browses shoes online may be offered a generic in-store coupon for hats, an interaction that feels impersonal and out of context. 
 Missed Revenue Opportunities: Store associates, lacking real-time insight into online purchase history or loyalty status, cannot offer the timely, personalized upsells, recommendations, or support that drive higher order value. 
 Annoying Interactions: The inability to unify a customer’s activity across channels can result in a frustrating experience, such as being asked to review an item they have already returned. 
 
<p>The path to unified commerce, which integrates the physical and digital experiences into a seamless customer journey, requires a technology that can connect the last mile of the physical store to the digital customer record.</p>
 The Strategic Imperative: Proximity-Powered Personalization with LISNR 
<p>To bridge the retail data gap, businesses must leverage technology that can instantly and securely identify customers in physical spaces and link their real-time presence to their unified digital profiles. The LISNR solution, powered by the Quest Customer Engagement Platform and the Radius data-over-audio SDK, provides the technical foundation for this strategic imperative.</p>
<p>LISNR’s platform allows brands to move beyond traditional loyalty programs by creating gamified experiences and incentivizing the most impactful customer actions. This solution empowers retailers to drive revenue through loyalty, not just discounts.</p>
<p>Key benefits of adopting this platform for a unified strategy include:</p>
 
 Real-Time Customer Recognition: Identify and acknowledge a customer at the point of entry, not just the point of payment. 
 Smarter Engagement: Engage customers with personalized, contextual messages at the precise decision point, such as the shelf, display, or waiting area. 
 Data-Driven Loyalty: Leverage a unified customer record to offer incentives that are impactful to your business and rewarding to your consumers. 
 
 Technical Solution: Implementation Roadmap for Retail Media 
<p>Implementing the LISNR solution involves integrating the proximity identification layer (Radius) with the engagement intelligence layer (Quest) into your existing retail technology stack. This roadmap is designed to facilitate the rapid deployment of contextual customer engagement.</p>
 Phase 1: Establish Proximity Context (LISNR Radius SDK Integration) 
<p>The first step is enabling the customer’s device to communicate securely with the physical store environment. This is achieved by integrating the Radius SDK into your existing consumer application, which turns every customer’s phone into a secure receiver for in-store context:</p>
 
 Mobile App Integration: For businesses with a native mobile app, the Radius SDK is integrated directly into the application. The SDK supports major development frameworks, allowing the app to securely listen for inaudible ultrasonic tones while the consumer is shopping. 
 Security Configuration: During this phase, robust security features, such as&nbsp;ToneLock&nbsp;and&nbsp;AES 256 encryption,&nbsp;are configured. This is essential to ensure that only authorized receivers, specifically your customers’ applications, can securely demodulate the ultrasonic data payloads, protecting the data exchange. 
 
 Phase 2: Deploy Engagement Infrastructure (Quest Platform Setup) 
<p>Once the consumer app is set up with Radius, Quest is deployed as the intelligence engine for gamification and personalization. Quest operates as a cloud-based control center:</p>
 
 Centralized Management Portal: Business users leverage the Quest management portal to define rules, create custom quests, design gamified loyalty experiences, and manage rewards. Create complete customer engagement programs in minutes with no coding required. 
 Radius Integration via Webhooks: Quest allows businesses to incentivize any customer action, including ones tracked or triggered by Radius. For example, a business could give customers reward points just for stopping by a sample tasting. The merchant’s app would hear a tone (see Phase 3) signaling that a customer is near the sample booth, then send a webhook to Quest to give the customer credit for that action. 
 
 Phase 3: In-Store Activation (Tone Broadcasting) 
<p>The final step is to activate the physical environment. This involves deploying simple, low-cost speakers or utilizing existing in-store audio playback capabilities, such as those embedded in digital signage, PA systems, or POS devices, to broadcast the inaudible ultrasonic tones.</p>
 
 Proximity Markers: These in-store audio sources act as precise, digital markers. When a customer’s app, running the Radius SDK, detects a tone, the app’s backend can instantly recognize the customer’s presence and their location within the store. This real-time context can then trigger personalized engagement, such as sending a targeted coupon or advancing a loyalty quest. 
 
<p>By following this three-phase roadmap, retailers can move beyond siloed data and rapidly deploy a unified commerce strategy that transforms physical store visits into measurable, high-value engagement opportunities.</p>

<p>Tracking attendance has evolved significantly from the old methods of paper registers and punch cards. Today, organizations are increasingly adopting facial recognition attendance systems to streamline tracking, improve security, and save time. These systems combine advanced face detection attendance system technology with AI to ensure accurate and hassle-free employee management.</p>
<p>With workplaces getting more tech-driven, integrating an AI attendance system not only improves efficiency but also reduces human errors associated with traditional attendance methods. This technology ensures that attendance is accurate, instantaneous, and tamper-proof, offering a significant upgrade over legacy systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is a Facial Recognition System for Attendance 
<p>A facial recognition system for attendance uses biometric technology to identify individuals based on their unique facial features. Unlike cards or fingerprint scanners, face recognition offers touch-free verification, making it quicker and more sanitary.</p>
<p>These systems capture the user’s face using cameras and match it against a stored database. The system analyzes unique facial features, such as eye spacing, nose structure, and jaw contours, to confirm a person’s identity. Modern AI-powered systems even adapt to changes in lighting, angle, and facial accessories like glasses or masks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Features of a Facial Recognition System for Attendance 
 
 Contactless Verification: Reduces physical touchpoints, improving hygiene.
<p></p> 
 High Accuracy: Advanced algorithms minimize false positives and negatives.
<p></p> 
 Real-Time Tracking: Attendance logs update instantly.
<p></p> 
 Integration with Payroll: Automatically syncs attendance data with payroll systems.
<p></p> 
 Multi-Device Support: Works on cameras, smartphones, and tablets.
<p></p> 
 
<p>A study by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a> highlights the high accuracy rates of modern facial recognition algorithms, proving their reliability in real-world applications. For detailed technical insights, you can check their<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Face Recognition Technology Evaluation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Using a Face Detection Attendance System 
<p>Switching to a face detection attendance system offers several benefits for organizations, large or small:</p>

<p>The Central Bank of the UAE has drawn a line in the sand. <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/uae-central-bank-tells-fis-to-drop-sms-otp-authentication-a-28589">By March 2026, the era of the SMS and One-Time Passwords will be over for the nation's financial institutions.</a></p> 
<p>This is not a minor policy tweak. It's a seismic shift.</p> 
<p>For years, the SMS/OTP has been the default security blanket for digital banking. A familiar, but flawed, solution. But the CBUAE's directive acknowledges a harsh reality: in the face of sophisticated phishing, SIM-swapping, and social engineering attacks, this legacy method has become a critical liability. It creates unacceptable financial and reputational risk.</p> 
<p>For the C-suite in the UAE's banking sector, it's easy to view this as another compliance burden. Another costly, complex project to manage. But that’s a limited view. The leaders who will win the next decade of digital banking will see this mandate for what it truly is: a strategic inflection point. This is your opportunity to leapfrog the competition by building a digital experience that is not only radically more secure, but also profoundly simpler for your customers.</p>  
 Phishing-Resistant Passkeys: The Secure Alternative to SMS OTP  
<p>The CBUAE recommends a move toward robust, risk-based authentication. The golden standard that unequivocally answers this call is passkeys.</p> 
<p>Passkeys are not just an incremental improvement. They represent a fundamental change in authentication technology, offering a rare combination of superior security and a user experience that is genuinely effortless. Built on FIDO standards, passkeys replace passwords and OTPs entirely. They use the biometrics already built into your customers' devices, like Face ID or a fingerprint, to create a login experience that is fast, familiar, and frictionless.</p> 
<p>So, why are passkeys the definitive solution to the CBUAE mandate?</p> 
  
  They are Inherently Phishing-Resistant. A passkey is cryptographically bound to your bank's specific website or app. There is no password to steal, no code to intercept. The primary attack vector for financial fraud is neutralized at its source, directly protecting your customers and your firm’s bottom line.  
  They Create a World-Class Customer Experience. No more waiting for delayed SMS messages. No more frustrated calls to the help desk. A frictionless, biometric login increases digital channel adoption, boosts customer satisfaction, and builds loyalty in a fiercely competitive market.  
  They Lower Your Operational Costs. The business case is undeniable. You can immediately eradicate the significant and rising costs of SMS delivery. More importantly, passwordless authentication slashes password-related help desk inquiries, lowering your total cost of ownership (TCO) and freeing up valuable IT resources to focus on innovation, not resets.  
  
 From Onboarding to Transactions: A CIAM Approach to Customer Identity  
<p>True digital leadership isn't just about a secure login. It’s about securing the entire customer relationship. This is where HYPR’s Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) solution extends the power of passkeys across the entire user journey.</p> 
<p>Our unified framework allows you to:</p> 
  
  Onboard Customers with Trust: Securely register new customers and establish confidence from the very first interaction, accelerating their transition into high-value digital clients.  
  Deliver Effortless Authentication: Provide a consistent, best-in-class login experience across all your digital properties, reinforcing your brand’s commitment to innovation and security.  
  Protect High-Value Transactions: Implement seamless, biometric step-up authentication for sensitive actions, preventing fraud without adding frustrating friction for your legitimate customers.  
  
 The HYPR Advantage: Proven Results and Accelerated Time-to-Market  
<p>Navigating this transition requires more than just new technology; it requires a proven, globally-deployed partner.</p> 
<p>HYPR is not a startup testing a new theory. We are the trusted identity partner to the world's most demanding financial institutions, including two of the four largest US banks. Our FIDO-certified solutions are architected for the scale, reliability, and security your institution demands. And with our flexible SDKs and APIs, we enable rapid integration with your existing infrastructure, ensuring you lead the market in this transition, not follow it.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>The CBUAE’s SMS OTP ban is far more than a compliance requirement — it’s a turning point for the UAE’s financial sector. Institutions that treat it as a checkbox exercise will fall behind, while those that embrace phishing-resistant passkeys will gain a lasting competitive edge.<br><br>Now is the time to act. With the March 2026 deadline fast approaching, early movers will be the ones to set the standard for secure, passwordless digital banking in the region.<br></p>

<p>Hiring fraud is in the news. Google recently announced it’s <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/google-brings-back-in-person-job-interviews-as-ceo-sundar-pichai-cracks-down-on-ai-cheating/ar-AA1LdLeV">bringing back in-person job interviews</a>, citing concerns about AI cheating during technical assessments. But there’s a bigger issue lurking beneath the surface: how do companies verify that the identity of the person who applied, interviewed remotely, and got hired is actually the same and is who they claim to be?</p>
<p>This identity verification challenge has created an opening that sophisticated fraud networks and state-sponsored actors are actively exploiting. The US government <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-coordinated-nationwide-actions-combat-north-korean-remote">has recognized the serious issue</a> of North Korean operatives successfully impersonating American tech workers, securing remote positions and gaining access to sensitive corporate systems.</p>
 The Scale of the Problem 
<p>According to the <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/03/top-scams-2024">Federal Trade Commission</a>, financial losses from job and employment scams have exploded from $90 million in 2020 to more than $501 million in 2024, a staggering 456% increase that signals the emergence of hiring fraud as a major profit center for organized criminal networks.</p>
<p>These financial losses, while significant, represent only the measurable impact. The broader concern is operational disruption, intellectual property theft, and potential access to sensitive systems that could compromise business operations or customer data.</p>
 How Modern Hiring Fraud Works 
<p>Today’s hiring fraud has evolved beyond simple resume padding. We’re witnessing the emergence of “synthetic identities,” completely fabricated personas backed by AI-generated credentials, deepfake technology, and sophisticated social engineering.</p>
 AI-Powered Identity Fabrication 
<p>Modern fraud networks deploy AI tools that can generate convincing resumes and cover letters in minutes. More concerning, they’re using deepfake technology to mask fraudsters’ appearances and voices during video interviews, creating personas that can pass human scrutiny while bypassing traditional verification methods.</p>
<p>These aren’t isolated incidents. According to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">Google’s Mandiant threat intelligence team</a>, one American facilitator working with North Korean IT workers “compromised more than 60 identities of U.S. persons, impacted more than 300 U.S. companies, and resulted in at least $6.8 million of revenue” over just three years. The report notes it’s “not uncommon for a DPRK IT worker to be working multiple jobs at once, pulling in multiple salaries on a monthly basis.”</p>
 The Challenges with Current Hiring Processes 
<p>The very technologies designed to streamline hiring (automated applicant screening, virtual interviews, and rapid onboarding) have become tools that sophisticated adversaries exploit at unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>The traditional hiring trust model, built on static documents, phone interviews, and the assumption that remote workers are who they claim to be, has proven insufficient in an era of AI-enabled deception.</p>
 Moving Beyond Point Solutions: The Identity Assurance Approach 
<p>Most cybersecurity vendors are approaching hiring fraud with the same mindset they apply to email phishing or malware detection as a point-in-time problem requiring better filters. But hiring fraud isn’t just a detection problem; it’s an identity assurance challenge.</p>
<p>Current solutions fall into two categories: applicant filters that optimize recruitment by culling suspicious applications, and breach prevention tools that try to catch infiltrators before they access sensitive systems. Both approaches treat symptoms while ignoring the root cause: the absence of a verifiable, persistent digital identity foundation.</p>
 How 1Kosmos Addresses Identity Assurance 
<p>1Kosmos has developed a different approach to this challenge, one that establishes verified identity proofing at the very first interaction and maintains that assurance throughout the entire employee lifecycle.</p>
<p>Our platform’s LiveID technology performs real-time liveness detection while cross-referencing live biometrics with verified government-issued credentials from issuing authorities. This creates a triangulation of identity claims that is exponentially more difficult for synthetic identities or deepfakes to spoof than traditional document-plus-selfie verification methods.</p>
 Continuous Identity Assurance Beyond Hiring 
<p>The value of true identity assurance extends beyond initial hiring decisions. Once an employee’s digital identity is established through the 1Kosmos platform, it becomes the foundation for every subsequent authentication, access request, and sensitive transaction throughout their tenure.</p>
<p>While point solutions focus exclusively on the hiring moment, 1Kosmos provides continuous identity-backed security. This addresses an important gap in most security strategies: the reality that threats don’t end once someone is hired. Account takeovers, insider threats, and credential compromise can still occur unless there’s a persistent, biometrically-backed identity foundation preventing them.</p>
 Building the Identity Foundation for Modern Workforce Security 
<p>The hiring fraud challenge represents more than a cybersecurity issue. It’s a trust challenge that requires organizations to rethink how they establish and maintain confidence in their workforce’s identity.</p>
<p>Companies can no longer afford to treat identity as a point-in-time checkbox in their security strategy. In an environment where sophisticated adversaries can manufacture convincing digital personas and nation-state actors are actively infiltrating American businesses through fraudulent hiring, identity assurance must become the foundational layer upon which all other security measures are built.</p>
<p>1Kosmos addresses hiring fraud by:</p>
 
 Establishing Trust on First Use: Securely onboarding new hires with high-assurance, government-verified identity proofing 
 Maintaining Trust Continuously: Providing continuous monitoring and persistent identity assurance for every login, access request, and sensitive operation 
 Empowering User Control: Making employees partners in their own security by giving them control over their identity data 
 Future-Proofing the Enterprise: Creating a zero-trust foundation that protects against the full spectrum of identity-based threats 
 
 Looking Forward: Evolution in Identity Security 
<p>As AI-powered deception capabilities continue to advance and organized fraud networks become increasingly sophisticated, companies face an important choice: evolve their identity assurance strategies or remain vulnerable to an escalating threat.</p>
<p>The companies that recognize identity as the new security perimeter and invest in platforms that provide verified identity assurance rather than point-in-time fraud detection will gain a significant advantage in both security and talent acquisition.<br>
The question isn’t whether your organization will encounter hiring fraud. The question is whether you’ll detect it before it impacts your business, or better yet, prevent it entirely by building your workforce on a foundation of verified, persistent digital identity.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently released a new white paper, <a href="https://go.updates.iata.org/unlocking-the-future">Unlocking the Future – The Passenger’s Journey Toward a Seamless and Contactless Experience</a> which highlights the pressing challenges facing aviation: growing passenger volumes, repeated identity checks, and the burden of manual document verification at every stage of the journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From baggage drop to security,&nbsp; lounge access to boarding, and crossing international borders, travelers are asked to present documents again and again. This creates bottlenecks, frustrates passengers, consumes staff resources, and creates long queues that overwhelm airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>With air travel numbers growing each year and expected to reach eight billion by 2041, IATA argues that it is imperative to shift identity and admissibility checks as quickly as possible into a seamless, contactless system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what Indicio’s decentralized identity technology makes possible.</p>
<p>Indicio was the first to successfully develop and deploy Digital Passport Credentials following the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) specification&nbsp; for Digital Travel Credentials (DTC) to allow travelers to cross borders in seconds.</p>
<p>Indicio was also the first to implement IATA’s OneID for seamless check in, lounge access, and boarding —&nbsp;and show how it could be combined with a Digital Passport Credential for international travel in a simple, single workflow for a traveler.</p>
<p>And Indicio will be the first to deploy a Digital Passport Credential issued by governments by the end of the year — and will use its expertise to help develop these credentials for issuance by European governments as part of the APTITUDE Large Scale Pilot project.</p>
 Streamline the traveler experience with reusable digital identity 
<p>Airlines, airports, and border agencies all need to confirm passenger identity. This means repeating the same check multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven® turns these manual checks into automated, seamless experiences&nbsp; by creating “government-grade” digital identities that combine authenticated biometrics with Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are tamper-proof digital credentials held in a digital wallet on a mobile device. They can be cryptographically verified — which is instantaneous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Digital Passport Credentials, travelers&nbsp; scan the electronic chips in their passports. Indicio’s software ingests the data and then checks the electronic image of the person against a liveness check to make sure that the person doing the scan is the same as the person the passport belongs to. The passport data is then cryptographically verified to make sure it was issued by a legitimate passport office, upon which the traveler receives a Digital Passport Credential. This credential follows the ICAO specifications for a DTC-1.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Digital Passport Credential is issued directly by the passport office as a counterpart to a traveler’s physical passport. This credential follows the ICAO specifications for DTC-2.</p>
<p>The result is that travelers have digital identities that can be seamlessly authenticated, either through a face scan or a contactless corridor.</p>
<p>In effect, the traveler’s face becomes their boarding pass. Airlines, airports, and border authorities can trust that the person cleared at the start is the same person moving through each step, without requiring the passenger to repeatedly present paper documents or plastic cards.</p>
 Meeting immigration and transit requirements 
<p>IATA’s white paper also notes the strain on airlines from needing to confirm that every international traveler has been approved for entry. Manual checks slow down processing and errors can lead to costly delays and fines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio solves this by making it possible to verify a passenger’s immigration status before they even arrive at the airport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials that prove visa status or travel authorization can be issued and shared as Verifiable Credentials, and instantly authenticated by the airline and immigration control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Airlines now have a secure way to stop inadmissible travelers from boarding and ensure smooth operations for carriers.</p>
 Why Indicio is the right partner 
<p>IATA’s call for an interoperable, end-to-end solution that transforms the passenger journey isn’t something in the distant future, it’s here today at Indicio with technology already in use by airports and governments worldwide.</p>
<p>Our technology gives travelers a consistent, reliable experience anywhere, while providing authorities and airlines the assurance they need everywhere.</p>
<p>The future of aviation depends on removing bottlenecks and maintaining security. Indicio Proven® makes that future possible today.</p>

<p>For many insurers, identity insurance is still framed as a safety net. It’s only there if something goes wrong. For customers, that means help only arrives after fraud has already caused real problems. For insurers, it means bigger payouts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This old way of doing things is expensive, and it’s quickly losing relevance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The better way: Add proactive protection to your offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is a proactive identity protection suite?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>A proactive identity protection suite has privacy and security tools that actively prevent fraud before it happens. These solutions work continuously, blocking threats in the background and seamlessly integrating safer tools into your customers’ daily lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key capabilities include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Credit freezes prevent criminals from opening fraudulent accounts.&nbsp; 



 Dark-web monitoring scans hacker forums for exposed data such as SSN and credit card details.&nbsp; 



 Personal data removal finds sensitive information from people-search and data broker sites.&nbsp; 



 Phishing and malware defense protect users with secure email and browser tools that block scams at the source.&nbsp; 



 Password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every account, preventing credential theft and account takeover.&nbsp; 



 Private browser blocks ads, trackers, and cookies while keeping browsing history fully encrypted, ensuring no one can follow users online.&nbsp; 



 VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts internet connections on any network, protecting data and activity from hackers, snoops, or unsafe Wi-Fi.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Why prevention works&nbsp; 



<p>Credit monitoring, real-time alerts, and dark-web scanning allow insurers and customers to spot threats early. Stopping fraud at the source not only saves customers from stress but also reduces costly claims for insurers. The result is greater peace of mind for policyholders and stronger retention for providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By catching suspicious activity quickly, these solutions prevent minor issues from turning into significant losses. Customers see the benefit every day, which keeps them engaged and feeling secure. And for insurers, that proactive approach means fewer claims to cover, lower costs, and stronger long-term relationships with policyholders.&nbsp;</p>



 The dual benefit of proactive insurance&nbsp; 



<p>Proactive identity protection turns a one-time claim process into a continuous service that builds trust and engagement. Better yet, this trust becomes a business advantage:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer retention matters. <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers">Improving retention by just 5%</a> can boost insurer profits by 25% to 95%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the insurance sector, offering seamless digital engagement and proactive protection can significantly increase customer loyalty, resulting in more renewals and upsell opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



 Prevention pays (literally)&nbsp; 



<p>For insurers, prevention benefits customers and helps the bottom line. Every fraudulent incident avoided is a claim you don’t have to pay. At scale, that translates into substantial savings. Add in the fact that subscription-based identity protection creates recurring, high-margin revenue, and the business case becomes clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A proactive model lowers overall risk exposure while generating consistent income, all while positioning your brand as a leader in trust and innovation. The end result is stronger financial performance and stronger customer relationships.&nbsp;</p>



 Protect your customers and your bottom line&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The old way of handling identity theft, waiting until fraud happens and then covering the losses, isn’t enough anymore. Customers don’t just want reimbursement, they want protection. Proactive tools turn identity insurance into something customers use every day, not just in a crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits flow both ways:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Customers avoid the stress and frustration of fraud before it ever impacts their lives.&nbsp; 



 Insurers cut down on claim payouts, reduce operating costs, and strengthen long-term loyalty.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>With Anonyome Labs’ Digital Identity Protection suite, insurers can deliver these proactive tools under their own brand. It’s a simple way to move from reactive payouts to daily, trust-building protection by creating a win for both policyholders and your bottom line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				  Don’t settle for basic when you can get portable, fraud-proof mDLs biometrically bound to the holder.<br>  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are digital credentials that replace physical, plastic driver’s licenses. You hold them on your phone and present them for instant identity authentication. Many states in the U.S. have begun issuing them, but <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/make-mobile-drivers-licenses-work-everywhere-easily-with-indicio-proven/">they don’t always make them easy to verify</a>, which inhibits adoption. The European Union has made mDL adoption a goal of its digital identity and digital wallet rollout.</p>
<p>Still, the promise is strong. What makes an mDL useful is the ability to verify it and confirm that the person presenting it is the rightful holder — and other useful information, such as their age.</p>
<p>But in an age of increasing biometric fraud, mDLs already need an upgrade —&nbsp;authenticated biometrics.</p>
<p>By authenticating the image of the person on the license as the person holding the license and then binding both to their device, an mDL becomes a much more powerful form of digital identity —&nbsp;capable of defense against biometric identity fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a>, you have the power to authenticate biometrics using facemapping and liveness checks, validate official documents and the information they contain, and bind them to their rightful owner by issuing a Verifiable Credential.</p>
<p>This is the process used to <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/governments-can-now-directly-issue-digital-passport-credentials-using-indicio-proven/">create Digital Passport Credentials </a>(DTCs)—&nbsp;”government-grade” digital identities for crossing a border seamlessly — and a similar process can be used to create mDLs with <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/portable-authenticated-biometrics-101/">authenticated biometric benefits</a>.</p>
 Advanced mDL verification 
<p>With authenticated biometrics, mDLs are much more powerful. For businesses, this level of assurance opens the door to workflows that were previously too risky or too expensive to conduct remotely. Businesses and government services can confirm a person’s identity at a distance with confidence. This saves money and reduces fraud by eliminating duplicate verification steps and cutting back on time consuming and faulty manual processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a bank can onboard a customer remotely, knowing that the individual on the other side of the screen is the same person to whom the mDL was issued. This cuts the cost of in-branch visits, prevents fraud, and accelerates account openings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A healthcare provider can verify a patient’s identity before a telemedicine appointment, reducing the risk of errors or misuse of insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employers can complete I-9 or age-verification processes remotely, without waiting for physical documents.</p>
<p>In travel, an mDL with authenticated biometrics can streamline every stage of domestic travel. Airlines can verify identity at booking, security, and boarding without requiring multiple checks of physical documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TSA can process travelers more efficiently, confident that the person presenting the mDL matches the credential issued to them. The result is a smoother passenger experience and stronger security at the same time.</p>
<p>Every successful mDL verification builds trust and adoption, creating an ecosystem where identity works as seamlessly as swiping a card, but with stronger security and privacy.</p>
 The bigger mDL picture 
<p>The long-term value is clear. An mDL that is biometrically bound to its holder moves across use cases and industries for faster, simpler, and more secure experiences. For the governments that have invested in issuing mDLs, adoption means their investment in mDLs is paying off.</p>

<p>As campuses gear up for another academic year, a quieter — but equally damaging — threat is draining university budgets: direct deposit fraud.</p>
<p>This isn’t ransomware that makes headlines by shutting down networks. Instead, it slips through unnoticed. Fraudsters steal credentials, log in like a legitimate user, and quietly reroute paychecks, stipends, and refunds to their own accounts. By the time faculty or students realize a payment is missing, the money is long gone.</p>
 Why Universities Are Prime Targets 
<p>Universities process millions in payments every semester:</p>
 
 Faculty and staff payroll 
 Student worker wages 
 Research and graduate stipends 
 Tuition refunds and financial aid 
 
<p>The attack surface is huge. Thousands of new students and employees join each term, many with limited cybersecurity awareness. Add in multiple disconnected systems (HR, payroll, bursar) and self-service portals that let users update bank info with little verification, and it’s a fraudster’s dream.</p>
 Anatomy of a Campus Heist 
<p>The playbook is simple:</p>
 
 Compromise credentials – via phishing or stolen logins. 
 Access payroll/portal – log in as the user. 
 Change direct deposit info – update bank details to a mule account. 
 Wait for payday – the next paycheck or refund flows to the fraudster. 
 No malware. No alarms. Just stolen wages. 
 
 The True Cost 
<p>Beyond the missing funds, universities are left scrambling:</p>
 
 Covering replacement paychecks 
 Hours of admin and IT investigation 
 Damaged credit and financial stress for victims 
 Reputational hits that erode trust with faculty and students 
 
<p>Worse, once a fraudster succeeds at one campus, the same playbook spreads quickly to others.</p>
 The Identity Gap 
<p>The weakness isn’t the technology — it’s the assumption. Most systems trust that if you know the password, you must be the rightful owner. In today’s world of credential compromise, that assumption is broken.</p>
 How to Stop It: Three Layers of Protection 
<p>Universities can close the gap by verifying more than just passwords:</p>
 
 Verify the person 
 Step-up identity checks at the moment of a bank account change — government ID scan + selfie match, or biometric re-authentication. 
 
 
 Verify the account 
 Use services like Plaid to confirm the bank account is actually owned by the verified user, not a money mule. 
 
 
 Verify the risk 
 Apply risk-based rules: if the request comes from a new device or unusual location, enforce stronger checks before approving changes. 
 
<p>Together, these controls stop fraudsters cold, even if they’ve stolen valid credentials.</p>
 The Path Forward 
<p>Direct deposit fraud may not make headlines, but it’s quietly siphoning millions from universities. The fix is both available and practical: add identity verification at the exact point where sensitive changes happen.</p>
<p>For faculty and students, it’s 30 seconds of extra security. For universities, it’s the difference between a secure paycheck and a stolen one.</p>

 IAM Demo Day 2025: What Buyers Need to Know 



<p>When we set out to <a href="https://liminal.co/demo-day/evolving-identity-access-management/">host the IAM Demo Day</a>, the goal was not just to showcase products. It was to answer a bigger question: what does the future of identity access management actually look like in practice? On August 20, 12 leading vendors gave us their answer. From adaptive authentication and orchestration layers to access governance and Zero Trust enforcement, what became clear is that IAM is no longer a background IT function. It has become the connective tissue between security, compliance, and user experience.</p>



 







 



<p>For buyers such as CISOs under pressure to reduce risk, product leaders balancing login friction with conversion, and compliance officers navigating new regulatory regimes, the demos were a reminder that vendor selection in IAM is not about comparing feature checklists, but choosing the architecture your organization will be living with for the next decade.</p>



 1. Adaptive Authentication Is the New Baseline 



<p>The age of static passwords and “MFA everywhere” is over. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/66d9e945e15a047f3fa5d137">Nearly 90% of enterprises experienced an account takeover attempt last year</a>, and the vendors on stage were unanimous: authentication must adapt dynamically to context. Device, location, behavioral signals — these are the new inputs to trust.</p>



<p>As Joe Palmer, CIO at iProov, explained: “Not all biometrics are equal. Device biometrics like Face ID prioritize convenience over security. Cloud biometrics, tied to a trusted ID, are what stop deepfakes.”</p>



<p>He then added, “You don’t need to force a face scan on every login. Zero Trust means you always authenticate, but when risk is high, that’s when biometrics shine.”</p>



<p>The takeaway is clear: if your authentication system treats a suspicious login attempt the same way it treats a low-risk returning user, you are already behind. And for product leaders, the stakes are even higher. Every unnecessary prompt is a drop in conversion, every extra click a lost customer. Adaptive authentication is parting away from being just a security control, and it’s becoming a growth strategy.</p>



 2. Identity Orchestration Is Becoming the Control Layer 



<p>If authentication is the frontline, orchestration is the command center. Time and again, vendors showcased orchestration layers that knit together logins, consent flows, and user data across disparate systems. Why? Because <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03FrF_b0">74% of organizations still cite fragmented identity data as their biggest challenge</a>.</p>



<p>Think about that. For all the talk of digital transformation, most enterprises are still piecing together identity flows that do not talk to each other. Orchestration platforms promise to end that.</p>



<p>As David Mahdi, CIO at Transmit Security, explained: “You bring in all these third-party solutions… it adds to the complexity. And frankly, attackers love this. That’s where orchestration comes in as the baseline — to unify identity and give you a single confident view of the user.”</p>



<p>Orchestration becomes the difference between weeks of custom integration and a few clicks. It ensures that consent and access policies are enforced consistently, no matter whether a customer logs in through an app, a website, or a third-party service.</p>



<p>But as orchestration stitches systems together, it also shines a light on the next pressing question: who has access, and can you prove it?</p>



 3. Access Governance Moves to the Forefront 



<p>Once upon a time, access governance was the unglamorous corner of IAM, more a compliance checkbox than a competitive differentiator. Not anymore. Workforce IAM demos leaned heavily on role-based access, privileged account management, and Zero Trust enforcement. The subtext was clear: governance is now make-or-break.</p>



<p>As Filip Verley, our CIO, reminded the audience:&nbsp; “Zero Trust isn’t just about denying access, it’s about proving the right access. And proving it again and again, in ways that regulators can see.”</p>



<p>Least privilege is not a nice-to-have; it is the only defensible posture in a regulatory audit. The burden of proof is now squarely on the enterprise, and as governance rises in importance for the workforce, a parallel trend is reshaping the customer side of IAM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If IAM is splintering into so many dimensions, then buyers themselves must become more specific about what success looks like.</p>



 4. Customer IAM Is Becoming the Source of Truth 



<p>If there was one forward-looking theme cutting across the demos, it was the push for customer IAM to become the authoritative record of identity. Liminal research shows that <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/670541bb29cd74c93639c834">91% of businesses want CIAM solutions that integrate with MDM</a>, and while vendors didn’t use the term “MDM,” they clearly pointed in that direction. Several positioned themselves not just as login providers, but as the backbone for a unified, trustworthy customer record.</p>



<p>As Brook Lovatt, CPO at SecureAuth, explained: “Identity is more than just people; it’s about agents, APIs, and systems that act on behalf of people. If you don’t extend IAM guardrails to them, you’re blind to half your attack surface.”</p>



<p>Why does this matter? Because fragmented identity data is more than a compliance risk; it is a drag on the business. Personalization fails when profiles are scattered, silos expand the attack surface, and regulators will not accept “we couldn’t reconcile the data” as an excuse. The takeaway is clear: IAM is evolving into the system of record for identity, spanning both human and non-human users.</p>



 5. Buyer Priorities Are Becoming Role-Specific 



<p>The final, and perhaps most important, takeaway is that IAM is no longer one market with one buyer. The demos underscored how fragmented the buyer landscape has become. CISOs want measurable threat reduction. Product leaders demand orchestration that accelerates, not slows, development. Compliance executives expect governance to be mapped cleanly to regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>In other words, IAM vendors cannot win with generic pitches anymore. They have to prove value to each buyer persona on their terms. And for buyers, the lesson is just as stark: do not settle for “good enough across the board.” Choose the vendor that solves your highest-stakes problem, because IAM is now a competitive differentiator, not a background system.</p>

<p>Not all bots are bad, but they all cost someone something. Until we fix the incentives for identifying and managing automated traffic, we’ll keep having the same tired fight: block all bots and break useful functionality, or get overrun by them and save our content and services.</p>

 What do we mean by “bot”? 



<p>Let’s clarify the terminology. “Bot” is a term that covers everything from benign automation to outright criminal activity. For the purposes of this post, we’re talking about non-human actors who interact with web services, some with permission and some without.</p>



<p>That includes:</p>



 
 Helpful bots: search crawlers, accessibility checkers, uptime monitors 



 AI agents: tools that retrieve or generate content, often hitting your site through a third-party interface 



 Enterprise automation: scripts and services performing integrations across APIs 



 Malicious bots: scrapers, credential-stuffers, spam engines, DDoS zombies 
 



<p>Some are essential, some annoying, and some outright hostile. According to the <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/ppc/application-security/bad-bot-report">2025 Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, automated traffic now makes up 51% of all web traffic, with 37% of that classified as malicious. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/from-googlebot-to-gptbot-whos-crawling-your-site-in-2025">Cloudflare Radar</a> data has its own stats that indicate bots account for approximately 30% of global web traffic.</p>



<p>Regardless of the type of bot, they all generate load at a rate faster than humans can manage on their own. And that’s where things get tricky.</p>



 Identity is only the first step 



<p>There’s been a lot of work recently on figuring out how bots can identify themselves in a standardized, trustworthy way. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/webbotauth/about/">Web Bot Authentication</a> discussion at the IETF is a good example. More and more content and service providers are demanding the ability to identify and/or differentiate bot traffic from human. Fewer (but not zero) bot developers are eager to support that goal. A handful want to be good actors, to say clearly, “Hey, I’m not a human, but I’m not here to cause trouble either.”</p>



<p>It probably goes without saying (but I’m going to say it anyway): If you’re building a polite, well-behaved bot, the last thing you want is to be lumped in with attackers. But the other side of the equation is the cost to the site your bot is connecting to. Knowing a bot’s identity doesn’t change the fact that other organizations’ infrastructures are paying the price; they may want to block you to protect themselves.</p>



<p>Even a verified, well-meaning AI agent scraping a site to summarize its content for someone’s personalized feed still hits that site’s CDN, database, and cloud compute budget.</p>



<p>And if they’re not charging for that access—if there’s no business model that connects bot traffic to revenue—then the only thing that providing some form of identity to a bot does is to give that polite visitor a name tag before they raid the pantry.</p>



 Why incentives matter 



<p>The developers building these bots often say, “We just want access. Don’t block us.” And the site operators reply, “We just want you not to break our infrastructure.”</p>



<p>That’s not a disagreement. That’s a misaligned incentive.</p>



<p>From the bot developer’s perspective:</p>



 
 Self-identifying should reduce the risk of being blocked (though, for the moment, it doesn’t) 



 A clear spec helps them integrate in good faith (if they can figure out where the spec is being developed) 



 They’d rather focus on product, not evasion tactics (who wouldn’t rather make real progress than jump through hoops?) 
 



<p>From the service provider’s perspective:</p>



 
 Every request has a cost 



 Authentication doesn’t offset bandwidth 



 Good behavior still eats resources 
 



<p>Even well-behaved bots can DDoS you by accident. You can’t fix that with certificates or signatures.</p>



 Emerging ideas from the Web Bot Auth conversation 



<p>The <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/web-bot-auth/Ouc9xB6ORaMZjUItntb4mJyjyHo/">Web Bot Auth mailing list</a> had some smart commentary recently on what incentives actually look like:</p>



 
 Reputation and differentiation: Bot operators don’t want impostors ruining their good name. Self-identification helps create reputational trust. 



 Better treatment through transparency: Authenticated bots could be treated as “allowed by default” rather than punished by default, which would flip the current anti-abuse script. 



 Load management: Many sites are being overloaded, not just attacked. Infrastructure strain is forcing even friendly sites to take defensive measures. This opens the door to load-based incentives: service operators could offer higher rate limits or more reliable access to bots that self-identify and follow documented behavior guidelines. Rather than treating all automation as abusive, a tiered system could encourage cooperative bots to behave responsibly in exchange for stable access. 
 



<p>All of that leads to an observation: identity is useful, but it doesn’t answer the real question. Who decides if the bot is worth the load it brings? That’s a value judgment that falls outside the scope of identity systems. What it does highlight is that services can’t ignore that automated traffic is hitting their infrastructure, and they need tools, not just blind faith, to manage it.</p>



 What could a better system look like? 



<p>Imagine a world where bots:</p>



 
 Register and authenticate using open standards 



 Earn a reputation score over time 



 Get tiered access based on usage patterns and benefit to the service 



 Pay—or pass value back—in proportion to their impact 
 



<p>This isn’t a fantasy. We already do this for humans via OAuth scopes, rate limiting, and usage tiers. The challenge is applying it to non-human actors in a way that scales.</p>



<p>(As an aside here, there are two people I recommend you follow if you’d like to dig into the gory, gory details of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7347897976654041089/">NHI taxonomy</a> and the practical realities of NHI: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-wahlstr%C3%B6m-98bba117/">Erik Wahlstöm</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-kasselman-0259862/">Pieter Kasselman</a>.)</p>



 What you can do today 



<p>If you’re a product manager or DevOps lead, this doesn’t have to wait on a new IETF spec. You can start with:</p>



 
 Separate metrics for bot vs. human traffic – Understand where your resources are going and whether that automation is helping or hurting. This won’t be perfect. If it were, we wouldn’t need to figure out how to differentiate the traffic in the first place. But you can get a gross approximation to start, using things like user-agent parsing, request behavior patterns, or identity-aware proxies. That can help you make smarter decisions about rate limits, caching strategies, or whether to even allow certain types of traffic at all. 



 Bot policy transparency – If you expect bots to authenticate, say so. If you want them to throttle, document it, ideally in machine-readable formats. That could include published API docs, robots.txt extensions, or structured metadata in your OpenAPI spec. You could also express bot policies via HTTP headers, usage dashboards, or identity-aware gateways. Don’t hide the rules in your EULA; bots don’t read fine print, but their developers might parse structured access guidance. 



 Selective encouragement – Are there bots that drive value? Give them the green light, but with boundaries. Tools like API gateways (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway, Apigee) already support rate limiting and tiered access policies that can help enforce those boundaries. Standards such as OAuth 2.0 and mutual TLS (mTLS) can be used to verify identity and scope access. Emerging efforts like the Web Bot Authentication discussions and SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity also offer structured ways to manage and audit bot and automation access without resorting to total denial or blanket approval. 
 



<p>And if you’re building a bot:</p>



 
 Respect the load you place on services. 



 Identify yourself if you want a long-term relationship. 



 Assume you’re not entitled to the same treatment as a human user unless you bring similar value. 
 



 Final thought 



<p>This isn’t about punishing bots or yelling at them to get off your lawn. Automation is here to stay. But if we want to coexist, we have to stop pretending that identification alone is the solution.</p>



<p>Identity without incentives is just surveillance.</p>



<p>Incentives without constraints are just spam.</p>



<p>Let’s aim for something better than either.</p>

 Bots, Incentives, and Identity 



<p>Hi, welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. I’m Heather Flanagan, and today we’re talking about bots.</p>



<p>[00:00:36] Speaker A: Not the horror stories, not the buzzwords, but the real, practical tension that comes up when your system starts to feel the weight of automated traffic.</p>



<p>If you’re a product manager, DevOps lead, or identity architect managing automated requests—or even a bot developer or AI agent creator—this episode has insights for you.</p>



<p>Because here’s the challenge:</p>



 
 Not all bots are bad. 



 But all bots cost someone something. 
 



 



 What We Mean When We Say Bot 



<p>Bots cover a wide spectrum of activity. They can mean:</p>



 
 Helpful automation: search engine crawlers, uptime checkers, accessibility tools 



 AI agents: fetching, generating, or summarizing content 



 Enterprise scripts: internal automation and integrations 



 Malicious actors: scrapers, spam bots, credential stuffers 
 



<p>Some are essential, some are annoying, and some are harmful. But regardless of intent, they all place a burden on infrastructure—and that cost usually lands on the target system.</p>



 



 Identity Is Only the First Step 



<p>Identity is one of my favorite topics, but identity alone doesn’t solve the bot challenge.</p>



<p>There is growing interest in creating standardized, trustworthy ways for bots to identify themselves. For example:</p>



 
 Efforts like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are exploring bot authentication. 



 Bots could say, I’m not human, but I’m not here to cause trouble either. 



 Some providers welcome this—they want visibility into what’s hitting their sites. 
 



<p>However, many bot developers aren’t eager to adopt these practices because:</p>



 
 Self-identification doesn’t currently bring them benefits. 



 Even when they do identify, site operators still pay the cost in bandwidth, compute, and storage. 
 



<p>So the tension remains: without incentives for both sides, we’re stuck in the cycle of block everything or get overrun.</p>



 



 Why Incentives Matter 



<p>Bot developers want access without being mistaken for abusers.<br>Site operators want reliable service for their human users.</p>



<p>This isn’t pure conflict—it’s misalignment.</p>



 
 Developers want recognition as ecosystem contributors. 



 Operators need to judge whether a bot’s value is worth its load. 
 



<p>Identity management can’t make that judgment. It requires a value framework.</p>



 



 Emerging Ideas for Bot Incentives 



<p>Public discussions around bot authentication highlight some promising concepts:</p>



 
 Legitimate bots want protection from imposters who could damage their reputation. 



 Self-identification and adherence to published guidelines could be rewarded. 



 Smaller site operators are overwhelmed and often default to blocking—even when bots aren’t malicious. 
 



<p>This points toward load-aware incentives. Imagine:</p>



 
 Anonymous bots: limited access 



 Known bots: more access 



 Trusted, valuable bots: highest access 
 



<p>In other words, an API-style approach with access tiers.</p>



 



 Designing a Smarter System 



<p>We already use systems like OAuth scopes, rate limits, and usage quotas for humans. Why not for bots?</p>



<p>A smarter system could include:</p>



 
 Open standards for bot registration and authentication 



 Tiered access based on reputation, utility, and resource use 



 Machine-readable policies that clearly define what’s allowed 



 Monetization or resource-sharing models for high-impact bots 
 



<p>Companies like Cloudflare are already experimenting in this space, and it’s worth tracking their efforts.</p>



 



 What You Can Do Today 



<p>You don’t have to wait for global standards. There are steps you can implement right now:</p>



 
 Measure traffic: Separate bot and human activity with user agent parsing, behavioral analysis, or identity-aware proxies. 



 Be transparent: Publish expectations in API specifications, robots.txt, or OpenAPI metadata. Avoid hiding them in user agreements. 



 Encourage good bots: Support bots that drive value (like discoverability or user support) through API gateways, OAuth scopes, or mTLS. 
 



<p>By doing this, you’re not punishing automation—you’re designing for it, while keeping your infrastructure sustainable.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>At the end of the day:</p>



 
 Identity without incentives is just surveillance. 



 Incentives without constraints are just spam. 
 



<p>The goal is something more useful—balanced systems where automation and infrastructure coexist productively.</p>

 The Blockchain That Could Reshape Global&nbsp;Finance <p>The global financial system is at a turning point. For decades, centralized banking, legacy infrastructure, and opaque financial intermediaries have defined how money flows across borders. But the rise of blockchain technology is rewriting the rules, and among the networks leading this transformation is Ontology&nbsp;(ONT).</p><p>Ontology is more than just another blockchain project it is an ecosystem designed to bring trust, identity, and data solutions to real world financial systems. Its potential to reshape the way we interact with money, identity, and institutions cannot be overstated.</p> 1. Trust Without Middlemen <p>Traditional finance relies heavily on intermediaries like banks, brokers, and clearinghouses. These entities provide trust but at a cost slow transaction speeds, high fees, and limited access for billions of people worldwide.</p><p>Ontology introduces decentralized identity (DID) and data attestation, enabling users to prove their identity and ownership without relying on centralized authorities. In practice, this means that financial transactions can be conducted directly between individuals or institutions, reducing friction and costs while maintaining security.</p> 2. Financial Inclusion for the Underserved <p>According to the World Bank, nearly 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked. Traditional banking systems often exclude people due to lack of documentation, geographical barriers, or high account maintenance fees.</p><p>Ontology’s DID system empowers individuals to create and control their digital identity, opening the doors to financial services such as lending, insurance, and cross border payments. By cutting down on paperwork and enabling trustless verification, Ontology can help bring billions of people into the global financial ecosystem.</p> 3. Secure Data Sharing in&nbsp;Finance <p>Data is the new oil, and in finance, it determines everything from creditworthiness to fraud detection. Unfortunately, the way data is currently managed is fragmented and prone to abuse. Customers often have little control over their personal financial information.</p><p>Ontology enables secure, decentralized data sharing where users maintain ownership of their data and grant access selectively. This ensures both compliance with privacy laws (like GDPR) and better efficiency for financial institutions. Imagine a world where you can share your verified credit history instantly with a lender without exposing sensitive details unnecessarily.</p> 4. Cross Border Transactions and DeFi&nbsp;Growth <p>Global remittances are projected to surpass $700 billion annually, yet fees remain painfully high, with an average of 6–8% per transaction. Ontology’s blockchain can cut down these costs drastically while ensuring instant settlement.</p><p>Moreover, Ontology supports DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications that provide alternatives to traditional banking products loans, yield farming, staking, and more. This opens up new opportunities for individuals and businesses to grow wealth without being tied to centralized institutions.</p> 5. A More Transparent Financial System <p>Trust in financial institutions has been eroded by crises, scandals, and mismanagement. Ontology’s transparent, tamper proof ledger ensures accountability, auditability, and fairness. Regulators and institutions alike can benefit from greater visibility into transactions without compromising user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Conclusion: Ontology’s Financial Revolution <p>The Ontology Network is positioning itself as a cornerstone of the new financial era one that is inclusive, secure, transparent, and globally accessible. By integrating decentralized identity, trusted data, and efficient transaction systems, Ontology could fundamentally reshape how money and trust move across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In the next five years, we may see Ontology not just as a blockchain project, but as a key infrastructure layer for global finance, bridging the gap between traditional banking and the decentralized economy.</p><p>The world is moving toward a trustless, borderless, and more equitable financial system and Ontology is paving the&nbsp;way.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-network-dc37dc587cca">THE ONTOLOGY NETWORK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re proud to share that 1Kosmos has been recognized in the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/6875366">2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant</a> as a Challenger and for Identity Verification (IDV) — and we’ve earned the #1 Product Score for Workforce based on the Critical capability Matrix.</p>
<p>This recognition reinforces what we’ve believed from the beginning: workforce identity isn’t just a productivity concern. It’s a frontline security imperative.</p>
 The Reality of Workforce Identity Today 
<p>Workforce identity isn’t just inefficient — it’s under active attack.</p>
<p>Employees still wrestle with <a>password resets.</a> Security teams drown in manual reviews. HR leaders lose valuable time onboarding talent. But the stakes have escalated far beyond productivity.</p>
<p>Groups like <a>Scattered Spider</a> and state-sponsored impersonators from North Korea are exploiting weak workforce identity systems with alarming success. According to recent reports, 1 in 5 organizations have already raised concerns about deepfake-driven fraud, synthetic identities, and credential-based attacks targeting their workforce.</p>
<p>This isn’t merely an optimization issue anymore. It’s a frontline security challenge. And without robust identity verification at the core of the workforce experience, enterprises remain exposed to attackers who can impersonate employees as easily as they once stole passwords.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the impact firsthand. A large Fortune 100 organization recently shared that they were struggling with impersonation attempts during onboarding, where fraudulent applicants were slipping past legacy checks. In one case, attackers even used synthetic identities to try and gain employee-level access.</p>
<p>After deploying 1Kosmos, the organization was able to verify identities in real time, flagging suspicious patterns and blocking bad actors before they entered the workforce. At the same time, legitimate new hires were onboarded in under 30 minutes instead of days, giving HR confidence in security without sacrificing speed.<br>
That’s the impact we’re most proud of.</p>
 Proof Points from the Field 
<p>What sets 1Kosmos apart is that we don’t just verify identity once — we make that verification persistent and reusable through LiveID.</p>
<p>LiveID is our biometric credential recovery solution. Once an employee has been verified, they never need to go through repeated document checks or manual identity proofing again. If they forget a password, lose a device, or need to reset credentials, they can simply look into any camera — laptop, mobile, or kiosk — and recover access instantly. No helpdesk calls. No new onboarding cycles. And critically, no opportunity for attackers to impersonate them with stolen credentials.</p>
<p>Our customers are already seeing this difference:</p>
 
 Eliminated the need for repeat ID verification during credential resets at a global enterprise, saving IT teams thousands of hours per year. 
 Cut helpdesk password reset requests by over 60%, thanks to employees recovering access through LiveID without intervention. 
 Prevented synthetic identity attacks during onboarding at a financial services customer — LiveID established a trusted baseline and stopped fraudulent applicants before they got inside. 
 Blocked impersonation attempts from advanced threat groups, including Scattered Spider-style social engineering, because attackers couldn’t replicate a live biometric identity check. 
 
<p>With LiveID, identity proofing becomes an always-on assurance mechanism. Employees are empowered with seamless recovery, and enterprises gain a durable defense against the most sophisticated impersonation threats.</p>
 Where We’re Heading Next 
<p>Recognition in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant is an important milestone. But our roadmap makes clear: we’re just getting started.</p>
 
 Smarter fraud detection – We’re piloting AI-driven pattern recognition with select customers today, helping them spot anomalies before they turn into incidents. 
  Defending against deepfakes and synthetic IDs – Our liveness and biometric verification is evolving with AI to stay ahead of attackers who are weaponizing generative media. 
 Natural language queries for identity data – Imagine asking, “Show me anomalies in remote access logins over the last 24 hours” and getting real-time insights. Early prototypes are already in testing. 
 Developer-first flexibility – Our newest SDK release enables customers to customize verification workflows within minutes, making it easier to adapt identity flows to their unique business processes. 
 
<p>These aren’t aspirations — they’re real initiatives already underway with customers who are shaping the next generation of workforce identity with us.</p>
 Industry Context: Why Now 
<p>The stakes for workforce identity have never been higher. Attackers are outpacing legacy solutions, weaponizing AI to impersonate employees and create synthetic identities at scale. Passwords, static credentials, and bolt-on MFA simply don’t stand a chance.</p>
<p>Enterprises need more than incremental fixes. They need a frontline security control that delivers continuous verification, privacy by design, and frictionless usability at enterprise scale.</p>
<p>That’s where 1Kosmos stands apart. With innovations like <a>LiveID</a>, we’ve redefined workforce identity proofing into a durable, reusable assurance mechanism that blocks impersonation threats while empowering employees with effortless access.</p>
<p>That’s why Gartner’s recognition matters. Ranking 1Kosmos #1 in Workforce Product Score validates what the market is already demanding: a shift away from fragmented, outdated tools to an integrated identity platform that makes workforce verification both secure and seamless.</p>
<p>Our recognition in the Gartner Magic Quadrant isn’t just about us. It’s about the customers and partners who have trusted us to protect their workforce identities. Together, we are proving that identity can be more than a checkpoint. It can be a foundation of trust, resilience, and innovation across the enterprise.</p>

<p>Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and mobile identity documents (mDocs) are rapidly moving from pilot projects to mainstream adoption. With more than five million mDLs already in circulation and half of U.S. states announcing plans to issue them, the identity community is asking an important question: what do these standards really mean for privacy, interoperability, and real-world implementation?</p><p>To explore these issues, we hosted a live podcast featuring two leading experts. Andrew Hughes, VP of Global Standards at FaceTec, has spent more than a decade shaping international ISO standards for digital identity, credentials, and biometrics. Ryan Williams, Program Manager of Digital Credentialing at the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), leads the subcommittee responsible for translating ISO standards into North American implementation guidelines.</p><p>Moderated by Richard Esplin, Head of Product at Dock Labs, the conversation offered a rare opportunity to connect the dots between how the ISO standards are written, how they are being interpreted in practice, and what identity practitioners need to know as mDLs roll out worldwide.</p>

 The Early Days: A Security Obsession 
<p>I’ve always been a security geek. Back before Information Security was a thing, I was figuring out ways to get into systems or keep people out. This goes all the way back to the days of dial-up modems, bulletin boards, and online services like CompuServe and AOL.</p>
<p>A large portion of my security career was spent building the Information Security program at Lehman Brothers. During that 12-year run, the focus was on perimeter security, endpoint protection, and network monitoring – the first forms of intrusion detection/prevention. We wrote our own tools to do what Splunk and CyberArk do today.</p>
 The Convergence Vision 
<p>I was not only engrossed in information security but also in physical security. I spent the last few years of my career at Lehman Brothers, before their bankruptcy, managing physical security technology. My vision was to someday position myself as a CISO who would manage both worlds, as there was considerable discussion back then about the unification of those two disciplines.</p>
<p>What I didn’t realize at the time was that the missing piece in my security toolkit wasn’t physical security but a verifiable digital identity. The issue was that it didn’t exist yet. Of course, we had usernames and passwords, which don’t confirm someone’s identity but only offer a guess or hope about who they are. I deployed the company’s first SecureID server with hardware tokens sometime in the late ’90s, adding more layers but not necessarily increasing the certainty of identity. We also had PKI, PGP, and other acronyms.</p>
 The Pivot to Startups 
<p>My aspirations of becoming a leader in physical and information security shifted after Lehman’s bankruptcy, prompting me to explore the venture-backed startup world. I partnered with Chris Rouland (former ISS, EndGame, Bastille, Phosphorous) on a journey at Bastille Networks. After Bastille’s successful launch and securing a total of $100 million in VC funding, I saw an opportunity to begin the process of founding 1Kosmos. While raising VC money isn’t a guarantee of ultimate success, it indicates a certain level of traction and confidence in our value proposition.</p>
 The Genesis Moment – 1Kosmos 
<p>But I’m here today to talk about digital identity and the genesis of 1Kosmos, and what led us down the path of creating the world’s first unified digital identity platform. For starters, there is the name: 1Kosmos. Kosmos means “universe” in Greek. I partnered with the</p>
<p>serial entrepreneur Hemen Vimadalal (Vaau, Simeio, Brinqa, Securonix, Saviynt, etc.) to launch the company. The idea we were kicking around was that someday you would own your own identity and be able to use it anywhere on the internet (or in the Cosmos!). Imagine a digital wallet that doesn’t just hold your credit cards, but your key identity information.</p>
<p>After early traction, we partnered with ForgePoint Capital for a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/15-million-in-series-a-funding-forgepoint-capital/">Series A</a>, and again with ForgePoint and now Oquirrh Ventures in our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/">$57 million Series B.</a></p>
<p>I got really excited about identity when we first started 1Kosmos. Our CTO and fellow co-founder, Rohan Pinto, showed me how decentralized identity could be a real game-changer back in 2018.</p>
<p>I quickly realized, after only a few months of trying to tell this story, that the world wasn’t ready for this approach because of the classic chicken-and-egg problem with digital wallets: you need widespread adoption for it to be useful, but you also need it to be helpful to get widespread adoption. Without a major platform provider like Google, Apple, or perhaps a government player pushing it into the market, you won’t see broad-scale adoption from or for individual users.</p>
 The Strategic Pivot 
<p>So, we pivoted. The core principles of the product and decentralized identity stayed the same, but our go-to-market strategy changed. We became the first to combine verified digital identity with phishing-resistant, passwordless access, using the same proof that defines a digital wallet. When paired with biometrics, it provides a great user experience and significantly boosts security.</p>
<p>We didn’t realize at the time that this would become a key aspect of zero trust: knowing exactly who is accessing the data or service.</p>
 The Power of Decentralized Architecture 
<p>Because we are built on a decentralized identity model (and still operate on it), the user always controls their own identity and authentication. This allows us to offer employers, businesses, and governments a much better way to verify and demonstrate their users’ identities.</p>
 Market Validation and Evolution 
<p>As I refined the story in the early days of the company, I tested the solution with my friends in the industry, who are now CISOs of Fortune 100 companies. In those early days, it wasn’t</p>
<p>a top priority because there was so much else to focus on, with everyone concentrating on cloud and other hot topics of the moment.</p>
<p>But one thing they all agreed on was that passwords had to be eliminated. The methods to accomplish this would evolve over the years, but the core principles remained the same. They also agreed that verifying a user’s identity was vital for key access points into their organizations, such as calls to the service desk and confirming the identity of new hires.</p>
 The Perfect Storm 
<p>When the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/stopping-scattered-spider-at-the-identity-layer-protecting-airlines-from-identity-based-cyberattacks/">Scattered Spider</a> attacks began, we were well positioned to capitalize on the increased focus on digital identity. Our competitors in the industry were only concentrating on passwordless solutions without verified identities, leaving them with ineffective, patchwork solutions. The surge in security incidents and breaches motivated us to go to market and test the waters for a Series B raise. This belief was shared by our entire team.</p>
 Betting on Our Vision: The Series B 
<p>When we secured our $57 million Series B funding, my leadership team and I invested a substantial portion of our own personal wealth. As I mentioned at the time, “We’re not just confident in our pitch deck and customer base. We’re betting our personal wealth on our vision.”</p>
<p>We are addressing the core flaw in traditional identity and access management. By linking biometrics to a verified identity, we are re-confirming a user’s identity at every login, not just verifying a credential. We are truly transforming authentication from being about “something you have” to “who you are.”</p>
 The AI Challenge and Opportunity 
<p>As we look ahead, the threat landscape continues to evolve. The next major challenge for every CISO is how AI will change business operations, attacks, and defenses. We’re observing AI being weaponized, but also leveraged for defensive opportunities.</p>
<p>Once again, we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time regarding how we verify human identities. We’ve been using deepfake mitigation tools for years and continuously improving them. Once again, we are years ahead of our competitors, and this will be our key to winning the AI arms race. I am confident in our ability to deliver this high level of assurance, which will be our main differentiator between leading and lagging identity platforms.</p>
 Coming Full Circle: The Decentralized Future 
<p>But returning to what Rohan showed me in 2018 with decentralized identity and verifiable credentials: I see this not as a competing technology because it’s been integrated into the platform from the start. Instead, I view it as the ultimate realization of the 1Kosmos vision—getting this form of identity into the hands of every person.</p>
<p>The original idea might have been years too early, but having this capability in the platform will be the fourth “right time at the right place” moment for 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>To recap, our four key timing moments have been:</p>
<p>1. Verified identity</p>
<p>2. Passwordless access</p>
<p>3. Unifying those two principles by linking them to a biometric</p>
<p>4. And now, decentralized identity is coming of age</p>
 Reflection 
<p>My journey from CISO to company founder has been truly remarkable. I’m very fortunate to be surrounded by great fellow founders, and I couldn’t be more excited about our journey and the path we’re creating for our customers.</p>

<p>I was delighted and honoured to be invited by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katina-michael-103177/">Professor Katina Michael</a> to provide input to the <a href="https://www.socialcyber.co/">Social Cyber Institute</a> Australia-India consultation on Technology Impact Assessment (TIA).</p>
<p>Katina and I had a wide-ranging discussion about technology, data protection and digital transformation. A video recording is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEOUGKk5Aa0">posted on YouTube</a> and I am writing a few blogs to consolidate some of the topics we had fun traversing.</p>
<p>This first blog concerns the untapped potential of applying public health principles to cyber security.</p>
 In praise of public health 
<p>I have come to understand a little and appreciate a lot about public health through my extraordinary life partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-denney-wilson-13419410/">Dr Elizabeth (Lizzie) Denney-Wilson</a>, a leading researcher in preventive health and <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/elizabeth-denney-wilson.html">Professor of Nursing at the University of Sydney</a>. Through a bit of home office serendipity, Lizzie happened to meet Katina as we were warming up to record the TIA interview. This prompted me to share a few reflections on the differences I’ve observed between public health and cyber security professionals when it comes to human factors.</p>
<p>The thing is, people make bad decisions. People smoke and gamble; they eat too much but don’t exercise enough.</p>
<p>Human error is notoriously blamed for most cyber security problems. But in contrast to epidemiologists, information technologists have little sympathy for regular people and their bad decisions. We can’t fathom why users clicked on links and got phished. Or why they reused the same password across multiple sites. Or why people choose such stupid passwords to begin with!</p>
<p>In contrast, public health professionals long ago stopped blaming people for making harmful choices. “Bad decisions” isn’t even part of their frame of reference. Instead, preventive health researchers focus on human behaviour and working out the pathways to changing behaviour.</p>
<p>We need to stop the victim-blaming in cyber security. Regular folks are lumbered with complex, brittle, unforgiving Internet systems, designed by engineers, most often for engineers.</p>
 Security need not be difficult by design 
<p>Lizzie taught me the public health policy maxim, Make the best choice the easy choice.</p>
<p>Think about passwords. It’s not the users’ fault that they need passwords!</p>
<p>The password is a relic of 1960s computing, where it suited highly technical network administrators. In the good old days before global public networks, computers were only accessible from inside secure buildings, so single factor passwords were perfectly adequate.</p>
<p>The password must be the only piece of IT where effectiveness is inversely proportional to ease of use. That is, the harder a password is to use, the better it is! Technicians in data centres can deal with that, but the general public cannot, while they have come to use modern pocket-sized supercomputers for everything from home security to grocery shopping.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/fido-and-ambient-cryptography/">FIDO Alliance</a> launched <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> that regular users’ easy choice of authenticator became the best choice.</p>

<p>Every business strives to provide its customers with the best possible experience. A significant challenge, however, is identity friction. This issue does not stem from a lack of effort but rather from the fact that traditional identity systems were not designed for today’s digital-first environment.</p><p>There is encouraging news. Verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) are already helping organizations create seamless customer experiences. Below is an overview of how VDCs are addressing long-standing challenges and enabling business success.</p> Understanding the Customer Experience Challenge <p>Research consistently shows that identity friction is one of the largest barriers to customer satisfaction in the digital age. 70%&nbsp;of global shoppers abandon their online carts across the board, but when forced to create an account,&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/blog/identity-the-critical-link-in-retail-and-hospitalitys-digital-future?ref=blog.spruceid.com">26% of U.S. shoppers&nbsp;specifically drop off</a> due to that friction point. When businesses fail to reduce barriers at critical moments like onboarding, checkout, or account recovery, they risk not only losing immediate sales but also eroding long-term customer trust and loyalty. This is where verifiable digital credentials can make a measurable difference.</p> How VDCs Are Creating Better Customer Experiences <p>Verifiable digital credentials provide a fundamentally different approach to identity management. Instead of requiring users to repeatedly prove who they are, VDCs enable a single credential that can be used across services. This allows for instant verification without friction while giving users complete control over the information they share.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-physical-id-card-and-a-verifiable-digital-credential/">technology behind VDCs</a> offers cryptographic security for assurance, real-time verification capabilities, and interoperability across systems. Most importantly, VDCs are designed with user-friendly interfaces that make advanced security processes seamless and unobtrusive for end users.</p> How are VDCs Being Used in the Wild? <p>Age Verification at Checkout<br>When a shopper adds an age-restricted product to their cart, the system can instantly request proof of age via a verifiable digital credential. Instead of uploading an ID or typing in sensitive details, the customer shares only a simple confirmation - “Over 18” or “Over 21.” The purchase moves forward without unnecessary exposure of birthdate or address, keeping checkout fast and private.</p><p>Ticket and Booking Confirmation<br>During checkout for flights, concerts, or sporting events, customers can present a digital credential linked to their booking. At entry, that same credential confirms validity in seconds, no paper tickets or manual lookups needed. This reduces fraud, shortens wait times, and makes the overall customer flow smoother.</p><p>Insurance or Payment Eligibility<br>In a healthcare checkout or appointment booking flow, a patient can present a digital credential that proves both identity and insurance eligibility. This replaces lengthy form-filling and card uploads, allowing check-in and payment confirmation to happen in one click. The result: less administrative friction, faster processing, and a better overall experience.</p> The Customer Experience Transformation <p>These use cases highlight key areas where VDCs generate significant business value. </p>  First, they eliminate friction through one-click authentication processes that replace password reset frustrations with instant verification.   Second, VDCs build trust by ensuring security and empowering users with control over their data.   Third, they increase conversion by reducing abandonment and accelerating onboarding, leading to higher completion rates and improved engagement.   Finally, VDCs lower operational costs by reducing support overhead and automating verification, freeing resources for company growth initiatives.   Explore VDCs for Your Brand <p>The customer experience opportunity is not only about fixing inefficiencies, but about unlocking new possibilities. VDCs improve security while enabling businesses to deliver seamless, trustworthy experiences that meet modern customer expectations.</p><p>The key question is not whether businesses can afford to implement VDCs, but how VDCs can strengthen customer experience and drive long-term success. Organizations that adopt VDCs are not simply solving technical challenges. They are building competitive advantages that will define the future of digital engagement.</p><p>If your organization is ready to explore how VDCs can transform customer experience and create opportunities for growth, SpruceID can help design and deploy systems that enhance customers' interactions with your brand.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Crypto platforms must comply with tightening AML laws worldwide—from MiCA in the EU to Travel Rule enforcement in the U.S., UK, Singapore, and UAE. This article explores global KYT, KYC, and AML expectations for VASPs and how iComply helps automate screening, verification, and cross-chain compliance.</p>
 
 The crypto industry has grown from fringe innovation to a core component of global finance – but with that growth comes regulation. In every major market, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are now expected to meet traditional financial crime standards. For crypto exchanges, custodians, token issuers, and wallets, this means embracing full-spectrum AML compliance: from real-time identity verification to transaction monitoring and data sharing protocols. 
 
 The Global AML Landscape for Crypto 
 European Union 
 
 Frameworks: MiCA, AMLD6, and Travel Rule compliance 
 Expectations: KYC for all users, KYB for corporate clients, transaction monitoring (KYT), and cross-border data sharing via TRP (Travel Rule Protocol) 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, state regulators 
 Requirements: MSB licensing, Travel Rule compliance, sanctions screening (OFAC), suspicious activity reporting (SARs), and BOI reporting for corporate accounts 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: Registration, AML risk assessment, PEP and sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and Travel Rule data transfer 
 
 Singapore 
 
 Regulator: MAS 
 Requirements: VASP licensing, CDD/EDD, KYT, and secure data transfer of originator/beneficiary details under the Travel Rule 
 
 United Arab Emirates 
 
 Regulators: VARA (Dubai), SCA (federal) 
 Requirements: KYC, transaction monitoring, UBO reporting, and Travel Rule compliance for all virtual asset transfers 
 
 
 Core Compliance Responsibilities for Crypto Firms 
 
 KYC/KYB: Identity verification of users and business clients 
 KYT: Monitoring of blockchain transactions for anomalies, structuring, and prohibited counterparties 
 Sanctions + PEP Screening: Ongoing checks of users, addresses, and counterparties 
 Travel Rule: Transmitting originator and beneficiary information securely and in real time 
 Audit-Ready Documentation: Logging all decisions, escalations, and screening events 
 
 
 Why Compliance Is Harder in Crypto 
<p>1. Pseudonymity: Wallet addresses lack inherent identity linkage</p>
<p>2. Cross-border complexity: Differing enforcement timelines and data localization laws</p>
<p>3. Fragmented tooling: Most tools only cover part of the AML process</p>
<p>4. User drop-off risk: Friction-heavy verification drives away users if poorly implemented</p>
 
 How iComply Helps VASPs Stay Compliant and Competitive 
<p>iComply delivers a modular, API-friendly platform tailored to VASPs across jurisdictions:</p>
 1. Edge-Based KYC + KYB 
 
 Verify individuals and businesses using local devices before encryption 
 Avoid transmitting raw PII or breaching GDPR or UAE data rules 
 Supports 14,000+ global ID types in 140+ languages 
 
 2. KYT: Smart Blockchain Monitoring 
 
 Monitor wallet behaviour and transaction patterns 
 Score and escalate suspicious flows (e.g., tumblers, DEX swaps, sanctions exposure) 
 Correlate blockchain data with user risk profiles 
 
 3. Travel Rule Compliance 
 
 Integrate with TRISA, OpenVASP, or TRP 
 Securely send and receive originator/beneficiary info 
 Log data sharing and counterparty responses for audits 
 
 4. Sanctions + PEP Screening 
 
 Screen individuals, addresses, and corporate entities 
 Configure alerting thresholds and refresh cycles 
 
 5. Unified Case Management 
 
 Assign investigators, log decisions, and export regulatory reports 
 Full traceability across onboarding, transactions, and disposition 
 
 
 Case Insight: US Crypto Exchange 
<p>A mid-sized US exchange adopted iComply’s full-stack compliance suite. Results:</p>
 
 Reduced onboarding drop-off by 35% 
 Achieved KYB, KYC and Travel Rule readiness in under 60 days 
 Improved screening accuracy and reduced processing time 
 
 
<p>Crypto compliance isn’t just about checking a box – it’s about building trust, enabling scale, and staying ahead of regulators. VASPs that embed KYT, KYC, and AML at the infrastructure level are best positioned for global growth.</p>

  A new Mississippi law requires us to block full access to Bluesky unless all users complete age checks. We have concerns about this law’s implementation.

<p>Keeping children safe online is a core priority for Bluesky. We’ve invested a lot of time and resources building moderation tools and other infrastructure to protect the youngest members of our community. We’re also aware of the tradeoffs that come with managing an online platform. Our mission is to build an open and decentralized protocol for public conversation, and we believe in empowering users with more choices and control over their experience. We work with regulators around the world on child safety—for example, Bluesky follows the UK's Online Safety Act, where age checks are required only for specific content and features.</p>
<p>Mississippi's approach would fundamentally change how users access Bluesky. The Supreme Court’s recent <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a97_5h25.pdf">decision</a> leaves us facing a hard reality: comply with Mississippi’s age assurance <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1126/id/2988284">law</a>—and make every Mississippi Bluesky user hand over sensitive personal information and undergo age checks to access the site—or risk massive fines. The law would also require us to identify and track which users are children, unlike our approach in other regions. We think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Unlike tech giants with vast resources, we’re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control. Age verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring — costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users.</p>
<p>We believe effective child safety policies should be carefully tailored to address real harms, without creating huge obstacles for smaller providers and resulting in negative consequences for free expression. That’s why until legal challenges to this law are resolved, we’ve made the difficult decision to block access from Mississippi IP addresses. We know this is disappointing for our users in Mississippi, but we believe this is a necessary measure while the courts review the legal arguments.</p>
<p>Here’s more on our decision and what comes next.</p>
 Why We’re Doing This 
<p>Mississippi’s <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1126/id/2988284">HB1126</a> requires platforms to implement age verification for all users before they can access services like Bluesky. That means, under the law, we would need to verify every user’s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The potential penalties for non-compliance are substantial — up to $10,000 per user. Building the required verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure would require significant resources that our small team is currently unable to spare as we invest in developing safety tools and features for our global community, particularly given the law's broad scope and privacy implications.</p>
 Our Concerns About Mississippi’s Approach 
<p>While we share the goal of protecting young people online, we have concerns about this law’s implementation:</p>
 
 Broad scope: The law requires age verification for all users, not just those accessing age-restricted content, which affects the ability of everyone in Mississippi to use Bluesky. 
 Barriers to innovation: The compliance requirements disadvantage newer and smaller platforms like Bluesky, which do not have the luxury of big teams to build the necessary tooling. The law makes it harder for people to engage in free expression and chills the opportunity to communicate in new ways. 
 Privacy implications: The law requires collecting and storing sensitive personal information from all users, including detailed tracking of minors. 
 
 What We’re Doing 
<p>Starting today, if you access Bluesky from a Mississippi IP address, you’ll see a message explaining why the app isn’t available. This block will remain in place while the courts decide whether the law will stand.</p>
 How This Differs From Our Approach in Other Places 
<p>Mississippi’s new law and the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) are very different. Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/07-10-2025-age-assurance">follows</a> the OSA in the UK. There, Bluesky is still accessible for everyone, age checks are required only for accessing certain content and features, and Bluesky does not know and does not track which UK users are under 18. Mississippi’s law, by contrast, would block everyone from accessing the site—teens and adults—unless they hand over sensitive information, and once they do, the law in Mississippi requires Bluesky to keep track of which users are children.</p>
 Other Apps on the Protocol 
<p>This decision applies only to the Bluesky app, which is one service built on the AT Protocol. Other apps and services may choose to respond differently. We believe this flexibility is one of the strengths of decentralized systems—different providers can make decisions that align with their values and capabilities, especially during periods of regulatory uncertainty. We remain committed to building a protocol that enables openness and choice.</p>
 What’s Next 
<p>We do not take this decision lightly. Child safety is a core priority, and in this evolving regulatory landscape, we remain committed to building an open social ecosystem that protects users while preserving choice and innovation. We’ll keep you updated as this situation develops.</p>

				 By Helen Garneau<p></p>
<p>Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-mobile-drivers-licenses/">gaining traction worldwide</a> as governments look for secure, digital alternatives to physical identity documents. The promise is clear: residents and citizens can carry a government-issued license on their phone, verify their identity, keep their privacy, and reduce reliance on physical cards.</p>
<p>But there’s a challenge to adoption. While it’s easy to issue an mDLs, verifying one across different systems, borders, and industries is not. Without an easy way to verify an mDL, its usefulness is limited.</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a> solves. Proven makes mDL verification simple, mobile, and cost-effective. With Proven, an mDL can be used and trusted at banks, airports, and businesses.</p>
 Closing the mDL verification gap 
<p>Proven bridges the verification gap in two ways.</p>
<p>For organizations that want integration at the system level, Proven provides APIs that can be embedded into existing workflows.</p>
<p>And for those who want to verify quickly, without system integrations, Proven provides a mobile verifier, downloadable as an app that is simple to use and cost-effective to adopt.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to verify an mDL:&nbsp;at a government agency, at a retailer for proof of age — anywhere, anyone needs to prove who they are.</p>
 Interoperability by design 
<p>With Proven, you have a system for digital identity that scales to your needs and meets the requirements for verifiable digital identity around the world. Proven enables you to issue, verify, and combine with <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/governments-can-now-directly-issue-digital-passport-credentials-using-indicio-proven/">Digital Travel Credentials (DTC)</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicios-support-for-the-w3c-did-specification-and-its-path-to-standardization/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/implement-digital-identity-in-europe-with-sd-jwt-vcs-from-indicio-proven/">SD-JWT VC</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">AnonCreds</a>, and interoperate with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/destination-europe-unlock-markets-create-seamless-services-with-indicio-provens-eudi-wallet-integration/">European Digital Identity Wallet.</a> (EUDI).</p>
<p>Proven also allows you to combine authenticated biometrics with Verifiable Credentials to provide the highest level of digital identity assurance and mitigate the threats of biometric identity fraud and AI-generated deepfakes.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/regula-and-indicio-partner-to-transform-identity-verification-with-verifiable-credentials/">our partnership with Regula,</a> Proven now provides access to document validation for 250-plus countries and territories — all of which can be combined with biometric authentication.</p>
<p>This breadth of options in Proven provides enterprises and governments with a range of innovative, easy-to-implement solutions that meet current and future document and identity authentication needs — all with the assurance of interoperability, privacy-by-design, and open-standard robustness.</p>
 Lower cost, increase revenue 
<p>Indicio Proven isn’t just about saving you on identity verification, fraud, and security costs, it provides a way to monetize verification. Very small fees for verification are imperceptible to users but soon add up when your solution scales. It’s a boon for government infrastructure — rapid deployment, user simplicity, immediate revenue.</p>
<p>No other digital identity technology offers this benefit trifecta.</p>

<p>Identity has become one of the most vulnerable parts of the digital world. Every week, we see headlines about new attacks: deepfakes tricking people into wiring money, social engineering scams bypassing help desks, and stolen credentials fueling large-scale breaches. Groups like<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/stopping-scattered-spider-at-the-identity-layer-protecting-airlines-from-identity-based-cyberattacks/"> Scattered Spider</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/why-the-fortune-500-keeps-getting-duped-by-deepfake-job-applicants-and-how-to-stop-it/">North Korea’s “shadow IT” workers</a> have shown just how easily attackers can manipulate outdated processes. These incidents reveal a simple truth: the old ways of handling identity are no longer enough.</p>
 Why Traditional Identity Falls Short 
<p>Most identity systems were built decades ago, around usernames, passwords, and static credentials stored in centralized databases. At the time, it made sense. But in today’s environment, this approach creates more risk than protection. Centralized stores are tempting targets, and when they fall, millions of records go with them. Meanwhile, adversaries are using AI to generate fake voices and faces, harvest credentials in real time, and run scams that outpace static security controls.</p>
<p>The human impact is also clear. People are asked to hand over personal information to countless organizations without knowing how it is stored or shared. They have almost no control, and when regulations tighten, enterprises end up scrambling to catch up.</p>
 Putting People Back in Control 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe the answer is not to add more layers to a broken model, but to rethink identity from the ground up. That is why we are building privacy-first, decentralized identity solutions that shift control back to the user.</p>
<p>The heart of this approach is the digital wallet. Instead of credentials living in a central database, they are stored securely on a person’s device. That means an individual can carry verified credentials, like a driver’s license, proof of employment, or a biometric factor, and choose exactly when and with whom to share them. Organizations, in turn, can instantly verify authenticity without holding sensitive data themselves.</p>
<p>The result is stronger privacy, reduced risk of mass breaches, and a much better experience. No more resets. No more risks. No more roadblocks. We’re already seeing the impact of this approach. Enterprises using 1Kosmos have cut fraud loss, reduced fraud losses by 90% and eliminated millions of password resets. For employees and customers, it means faster access, fewer frustrations, and stronger trust in every interaction.</p>
 Fueling the Shift with $57 Million 
<p>We’re already seeing strong traction with enterprises and governments embracing a privacy-first identity model. Our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/">$57 million Series B funding</a> is the catalyst to move even faster—expanding innovation, integrations, and global reach. The investment validates the market’s urgent need for identity modernization and accelerates our ability to deliver it.</p>
<p>With this funding, we are advancing AI-powered defenses against deepfakes and impersonation attempts, expanding enterprise-ready digital wallets, and strengthening integrations with IAM, CIAM, PAM, and zero-trust platforms. We are also growing our reach into new markets across North America, EMEA, and APAC.</p>
<p>These steps build on the momentum we have already achieved, including becoming the only full-service Kantara-certified credential service provider with FedRAMP High authorization, and winning a 10-year, $194.5 million Login.gov agreement to supply next-generation identity proofing.</p>
 Where We Go From Here 
<p>For too long, identity has been the weakest link. We see it as the foundation of trust—and the key to better digital experiences when built on privacy and user control.</p>
<p>That is the vision we are pursuing at 1Kosmos. By combining verified identity proofing, passwordless authentication, and blockchain-based privacy, we are giving organizations the tools to stop impersonation attacks before they start, while giving individuals more control over their digital lives.</p>
<p>The stakes have never been higher, but neither have the opportunities. With our Series B investment, we are moving faster toward a world where identity is no longer the first step in the kill chain, but the first line of defense.</p>

<p>Decentralized systems have been in vogue at least since the rise of Web3, particularly in Europe. Unlike in the USA or China, where centralized structures prevail, Europe consists of many comparatively small democratic nations that must coordinate in all areas of life to provide their citizens with a high quality of life. </p>
<p>Similar to participants in decentralized Web3 networks, individual citizens in Europe enjoy a high degree of autonomy, freedom, and self-determination. While this autonomy is inherently embedded in the software code of Web3, in Europe, national governments create the legal frameworks. Examples like <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a> and <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Crypto/guideline_self-sovereign_identities.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">Self-sovereign Identities</a> (SSI) establish EU-wide standards that enable secure cross-border digital transactions.</p>
<p>At Datarella, we have actively participated in decentralized systems through our projects, most recently in the <a href="https://gaia-x.eu">GAIA-X</a> funding project <a href="https://moveid.org">moveID</a>. The experiences gained lead to two key conclusions: The values and benefits of decentralized systems are recognizable and measurable, offering flexibility and innovation in dynamic environments. However, decentralized systems are not feasible or value-creating without a direct connection to centralized elements. This may sound contradictory at first, but it is not.</p>
<p>The Necessity of Centralized Elements in Decentralized Systems</p>
<p>Decentralized systems do not develop from within themselves; they always require a central idea or organization as the initial spark. Furthermore, a central entity must permanently handle tasks in governance, administration, and management. Without this, decentralized systems tend toward apathy or inactivity, as current incentive models do not ensure long-term constructive activity. A decentralized system remains active only as long as central functions provide the necessary incentives. Additionally, basic infrastructure must be created and operated – a task typically handled centrally, with costs distributed among participants.</p>
<p>From the perspective of organization theory, this aligns with contingency theory: There is no universally best structure; the choice between central and decentralized depends on the environment. In stable contexts, centralized systems provide efficiency and control, while decentralized ones promote agility in volatile markets. <a href="https://mintzberg.org">Henry Mintzberg</a> describes in his organizational models that centralized structures (e.g., Machine Bureaucracy) are suitable for standardization, whereas decentralized ones (e.g., Adhocracy) foster innovations. Disadvantages of centralized systems include the lack of flexibility, while decentralized systems can lead to coordination issues. </p>
<p>Symbiosis as the Path to Success</p>
<p>In short, decentralized and centralized systems can form a beneficial symbiosis that compensates for the drawbacks of monolithic approaches and generates more prosperity for all participants. Hybrid models, as recommended in organization theory, combine stability with agility and are exceptionally sensitive in complex environments. </p>
<p>A necessary prerequisite for this symbiotic interplay is the ability and willingness of participants to understand the advantages and limitations of each system, along with the commitment to contribute to governance constructively. Only then do the positive outcomes emerge. Participants who see only the benefits of a monolithic structure should be excluded to maintain integrity.</p>
<p>At Datarella, we apply these insights in our data-driven solutions for health and sustainability, developing hybrid systems that link autonomy with reliable governance. </p>

 How ONT ID Can Restore Trust in the Face of Manipulative AI <p>The rise of generative artificial intelligence has opened unprecedented technological horizons, but it has also raised a fundamental question: how can we distinguish truth from falsehood in a world where content text, images, videos, audio can be manipulated or entirely created by algorithms? AI-generated deepfakes and fake news threaten to undermine trust in the media, institutions, and even human interactions. In the face of this digital truth crisis, innovative solutions are needed. This article explores how ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, can serve as a robust verification mechanism to authenticate content and restore trust in the digital ecosystem.</p> The Trust Challenge in the Age of Generative AI <p>Generative AI, capable of producing text, images, sounds, and videos with striking realism, has transformed the content creation landscape. However, this capability comes with a major downside: the ease with which it can be used to generate misleading or outright false information. Deepfakes of public figures, AI-generated news articles spreading misinformation, and automated online comments manipulating public opinion have become tangible&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The problem goes beyond the technical detection of manipulated content, which is an endless race between creators and AI detectors. The real issue is the erosion of trust. If users can no longer distinguish authentic content from synthetic content, the value of information itself diminishes. This has profound implications for democracy, commerce, education, and social relationships. Developing mechanisms to prove the origin and integrity of content and restore trust in the digital ecosystem has become imperative.</p> ONT ID: An Anchor of Trust in a Sea of&nbsp;Content <p>This is where ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, comes into play. Built on blockchain technology and adhering to W3C standards for Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), ONT ID provides a robust framework to establish the provenance and authenticity of digital content. Instead of relying on centralized platforms that can be compromised or manipulated, ONT ID allows content creators to digitally sign their work with their decentralized identity.</p><p>Imagine a content creator whether a journalist, artist, or researcher using their ONT ID to cryptographically link their identity to each piece of content they produce. This digital signature, recorded on the blockchain, becomes immutable proof of the content’s origin. Any consumer can then verify this signature using an ONT ID-compatible tool, confirming that the content genuinely comes from the claimed source and has not been altered since its creation.</p><p>Moreover, ONT ID can be used to attest to the nature of the content. For example, a creator could label content as “AI-generated” or “human-verified.” This transparency allows users to make informed decisions about the credibility and nature of the content they consume. By providing a verifiable and decentralized anchor of trust, ONT ID offers a powerful means to combat misinformation and restore confidence in the digital ecosystem.</p> Practical Implementation and&nbsp;Benefits <p>Applying ONT ID for content verification can take several&nbsp;forms:</p>  Digital content signatures: Content creation platforms (news outlets, press agencies, digital art studios) could integrate ONT ID to allow authors and artists to digitally sign their work. These signatures would be visible and verifiable by the public, adding a layer of&nbsp;trust.  Marking AI-generated content: Generative AI tools could be required to integrate ONT ID to indelibly mark the content they produce as AI-generated. This allows consumers to immediately know whether they are interacting with human or synthetic content.  Source identity verification: In journalism and research, ONT ID could be used to verify the identity of information sources, ensuring that the information comes from legitimate people or organizations rather than bots or malicious entities.  Digital reputation and credibility: Over time, content creators who regularly sign their work with ONT ID and are recognized for the reliability of their information could build a verifiable digital reputation on the blockchain. This would encourage the production of authentic, high-quality content.  <p>The advantages of this approach are manifold: a significant reduction in misinformation, restoration of public trust in media and online information, increased protection against fraud and identity theft, and a more transparent and accountable digital ecosystem. By shifting the burden from detection to proof of authenticity, ONT ID offers a proactive and sustainable solution to the trust challenge in the AI&nbsp;era.</p> Conclusion <p>The rise of generative AI has created a digital landscape where truth is increasingly difficult to discern. In the face of proliferating manipulated content and deepfakes, restoring trust has become a top priority. Ontology’s ONT ID provides a powerful, decentralized solution to this challenge. By enabling creators to digitally sign their content and providing consumers with tools to verify authenticity and provenance, ONT ID can serve as an essential anchor of trust in the digital ecosystem.</p><p>By adopting decentralized identity technologies like ONT ID, we can not only fight misinformation but also build a more transparent, secure, and trustworthy digital future one in which truth can once again flourish.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-age-of-digital-distrust-21c796608581">The Age of Digital Distrust</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our series on building the Many-to-Many System. In our first two posts, we explored the project’s origins, the challenge of structuring our complex knowledge, and the human pace required to do it well. We left off discussing the need to create a digital “guide” to help people navigate the deep and interconnected learnings from our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Over the past three months, that abstract idea has become a tangible reality. We have been working in parallel on two major outputs: a linear, narrative-driven Field Guide and a modular, interactive website. These two pieces have been in constant conversation, shaping each other as they evolve. In this post, we, Arianna, Gurden, and Michelle, share our reflections on bringing this part of the system to life, the power of a good design process, and what it feels like to see emergence in&nbsp;action.</p><p>Arianna: Maybe I can start. The last three months have been a back-and-forth conversation between our two major outputs: the Field Guide and the website. We were working on them in parallel, so every new page or piece of content for the Field Guide would influence the website, and the website would influence the Field Guide. A really interesting part was categorising all the tools. For you too, Michelle, I imagine writing in the Field Guide and then seeing the first draft of the website that Gurden built really helped clarify what should remain in a linear format and what could become an interactive element.</p>Working on copy and storytelling on the website, it’s not easy to go from the Field Guide which has 80+ pages to a 3 paragraphs maximum&nbsp;format.<p>This double narration is key. The Field Guide is linear, so people can follow page by page, and we’ve put a lot of effort into diagrams that synthesise and distinguish each section clearly. On the website, we’re trying to simplify the experience with shortcuts and modular recalls so that everything is interconnected. That has been our core challenge and focus these last&nbsp;months.</p>Our two ways to discover and learn about the Many-to-Many System.<p>Gurden: Yeah, listening to you, Arianna, it’s really cool to watch this flow of content between the Field Guide and the website. We made these structural decisions months ago, sitting in a park during our workshop, and it’s a great feeling to see them validated now. We were a bit unsure at the time because we’re dealing with so much complexity: many, many, many things, as the name suggests! But we made a conscious decision to have both a linear and an interactive flow, and the process has proven that was the right&nbsp;call.</p>The Field Guide is not simply a PDF report, it has guiding elements, small interactive buttons, guiding diagrams, and visual elements to help navigate complexity.<p>As the Field Guide grew, the website structure grew with it. To make sure the website is structurally sound, I set up a skeleton database in Notion for the main content. To be honest, my expectations were a bit low when I asked Michelle and Annette to fill it, but big shoutout to Annette, her mind works just so quickly. She immediately got the object-oriented structure and filled it up, making the connections brilliantly. That gave me a distilled version of the content to populate our website via the Content Management System.</p>Screenshot from Sanity, our content management system, showing linkages between&nbsp;data.<p>I’m glad we didn’t try to perfect everything at once. We moved fast, built a rough first version, and brought it to life, which is now live internally. We’ve already done a few quick user tests. If we had just stayed in Figma, we’d still be there six months from&nbsp;now.</p><p>Michelle: I have so little to add because you’ve both covered most of it! My main addition is to highlight how everything has informed everything else. You’ve talked about the Field Guide and website, but they, in turn, provided enough structure for the database so Annette could go in and finish it. That process gave all of us a deeper understanding of our tools, examples, case studies and other assets we needed to&nbsp;create.</p><p>It’s a good example of real emergence. A lot of people talk about emergence when they’re really just describing chaos without enough boundaries. But here, we had pieces that genuinely formed the next piece, that formed the next piece. What was supposed to come out and what would be useful for other people was illuminated by going through this process. It gave birth to key assets we hadn’t yet imagined, like Angela’s “Experimenter’s Logbook”, which will be available soon on the website. I’m not sure that would have been conceived in the same way without this interplay. It’s a testament to what a good design process does, and even though we didn’t invent the design process, it was nice to be part of one that was so fruitful.</p>Index preview of the Field Guide, which will be avilable&nbsp;soon.<p>Gurden: I agree. The process exists, but I’ve seen so many teams not follow it well. And credit to you, Arianna, the interconnected diagrams you created are now coming to life. When you navigate the website, you see a problem and the related tools linked directly to it. These interlinkages are what make it a living system, not just a static&nbsp;page.</p><p>Of course, that’s also our next challenge: making sure the user experience works, that people don’t get lost. A website is a living organism, and new ideas will constantly come in. The hard part now is making conscious decisions about what we need to fix before launch versus what can wait for the next&nbsp;version.</p><p>Arianna: That brings me to another point: how we are all holding many hats. We aren’t a typical product team where each person has one defined role. The core team is tiny, and each of us holds three or four different roles. This has positives, we can communicate rapidly, and as designers and coders, we are deeply embedded in the content, thanks to the time Michelle and Annette took to teach us. But on the other side, by holding many roles, we have to compromise. We can’t excel at everything. So, for this first version, we might focus less on perfecting accessibility, for example, because our goal is to launch an alpha or beta version. When we have more time to focus, we can scale it and do it&nbsp;better.</p><p>Michelle: That’s a super good reflection on the human side of the process. So, to wrap up, we’ve now asked a set of close collaborators to give us feedback over the next month. Our hope is that the website, the core tools, and the Field Guide will be ready to share more widely in late September or mid-October. Then we’ll put it out into the world, get a wider set of feedback, and see what people&nbsp;think.</p><p>Our next step is to incorporate feedback from our close network before sharing it with all of&nbsp;you.</p><p>Thanks for following our journey.

 The certification reinforces IDnow’s role as a trusted, future-proof partner for regulated businesses and ensures that IDnow’s core solutions are fully aligned with current and upcoming EU compliance requirements, including EUDI Wallet readiness by 2027.&nbsp; 



 



<p>IDnow has become one of the first companies in Europe to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">receive certification under the latest ETSI</a> standard for remote identity proofing, which is a key requirement for eIDAS 2.0 compliance and EUDI Wallet readiness by 2027.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This milestone cements IDnow’s position as a trusted and future-proof partner for regulated industries and ensures its solutions are aligned with both current and upcoming EU compliance frameworks.&nbsp;</p>



 Certified for the future of European Digital Identity&nbsp; 



<p>The certification, developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and officially endorsed by the European Commission, confirms that several of IDnow’s core products meet the strict biometric integrity, security, and assurance levels required for digital onboarding in highly regulated sectors. These solutions are now certified as compliant with eIDAS 2.0 at the Extended Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) – the highest level defined under the revised regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The certified identity verification methods include:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">Expert-led video verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">Automated identity verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-introduces-nfc-based-verification-for-digital-ids/">NFC-based ID verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">eID (electronic ID) verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet verification</a>&nbsp;  



 Why ETSI standards are so important for remote identity verification&nbsp; 



<p>In achieving certification, IDnow demonstrated compliance with the following ETSI standards:&nbsp;</p>



  ETSI TS 119 461 V2.1.1 – Identity proofing component requirements&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 401 V3.1.1 – General policy requirements for Trust Service Providers&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 411-1 V1.5.0 – Requirements for TSPs issuing certificates&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 411-2 V2.6.0 – Requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 412-2 V2.3.1 – Certificate profiles for legal persons&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 412-5 V2.4.1 – Certificate profiles for identity proofing&nbsp;  



 Addressing rising fraud with certified security&nbsp; 



<p>With AI-powered fraud tactics like deepfakes and injection attacks growing rapidly in both sophistication and scale, IDnow’s certification arrives at a critical moment for digital security. According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pindrops-2025-voice-intelligence--security-report-reveals-1-300-surge-in-deepfake-fraud-302479482.html">2025 report by Pindrop</a>, deepfake fraud attempts have surged urged by over 1300% in 2024, escalating from an average of one per month to seven per day. This alarming increase underscores the growing sophistication and frequency of AI-driven fraud, particularly targeting financial services and contact centers. The report also forecasts a <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/article/deepfake-fraud-could-surge/">162% rise in deepfake-related fraud in 2025</a>, highlighting the urgent need for robust verification solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ETSI TS 119 461 standard provides essential safeguards through its strict requirements for features such as presentation attack detection (PAD), injection attack detection (IAD), biometric integrity assurance, and real-time fraud prevention – offering businesses and users protection at the highest level of assurance.&nbsp;</p>

 Use Okta for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>The first step is registering your app in Okta as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) client using Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), the most secure and mobile-friendly OAuth 2.0 flow. PKCE is a best practice for mobile apps to prevent authorization code interception attacks.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Native Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Redirect URI: <code>com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/callback</code> 
       Post Logout Redirect URI: <code>com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/</code>
 (where <code>{yourOktaDomain}.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device. 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 

<p>NOTE: When using a custom authorization server, you need to set up authorization policies. Complete these additional steps:</p>

 
   In the Admin Console, go to Security &gt; API &gt; Authorization Servers 
   Select your custom authorization server (<code>default</code>) 
   On the Access Policies tab, ensure you have at least one policy:
     
       If no policies exist, click Add New Access Policy 
       Give it a name like “Default Policy” 
       Set Assign to to “All clients” 
       Click Create Policy 
     
   
   For your policy, ensure you have at least one rule:
     
       Click Add Rule if no rules exist 
       
        <p>Give it a name like “Default Rule”</p>
       
       
        <p>Set Grant type is to “Authorization Code”</p>
       
       Set User is to “Any user assigned the app” 
       Set Scopes requested to “Any scopes” 
       Click Create Rule 
     
   
 

<p>For more details, see the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#custom-authorization-server">Custom Authorization Server</a> documentation.</p>


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Native App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

   <code>Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your Okta domain.</p>

 Prefer phishing-resistant authentication factors 

<p>Every new Integrator Free Plan admin account must use the Okta Verify app by default to set up MFA (multi-factor authentication). We’ll retain the default settings for this project, but you can tailor the authentication policy for your organization’s needs. We recommend phishing-resistant factors, such as Okta Verify with biometrics and FIDO2 with WebAuthn. These configurations help defend against credential theft and phishing and align with Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment, standards like NIST SP 800-63, and industry regulations like SOC 2 or HIPAA.</p>
 
   Prefer MFA or phishing-resistant factors for real users 
   Tailor policies based on risk level, environment (dev vs prod), and user behavior 
 

<p>Thoughtfully configuring your <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/policies/modify-first-party-app-policies.htm">authentication policies</a> protects your users while maintaining a seamless login experience.</p>

 Create an iOS project with Okta’s mobile libraries for authentication 

<p>Before diving into integration, ensure you have the following prerequisites:.</p>

 
   Xcode version 15.0 or later. This guide assumes you’re comfortable working in Xcode and building iOS apps in Swift. 
   Swift - This guide uses Swift 5+ features. 
   Swift Package Manager (SPM) - We’ll use Swift Package Manager for managing dependencies. Ensure it’s available in Xcode. 
   Node and npm installed locally to run the backend server 
 

 Creating your Xcode project 

<p>If you are starting from scratch, create a new iOS app:</p>

 
   Open Xcode 
   Go to File -&gt; New -&gt; Project 
   Select iOS App and select Next 
   Enter the name of the project 
   Set the Interface to SwiftUI or UIKit, depending on your preference
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this post, we will be using SwiftUI</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Select Next and save your project locally 
 

<p>You’re now ready to add Okta’s SDK into your project.</p>

 Authenticate your iOS app using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 with Okta 

<p>To integrate the Okta SDK into your iOS app, follow these detailed steps using Swift Package Manager (SPM), the recommended and modern way to manage dependencies in Xcode.</p>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>
 
   Open the project if it’s not already open 
   Select File → Add Package Dependencies 
   In the search bar at the top right of the window that appears, add the <code>https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift</code> repository and select Enter. Xcode will fetch the package details. 
   Choose the latest version available (recommended) or the version you prefer. 
   When prompted to choose the products to add, make sure to select your project next to <code>BrowserSignin</code> in the Add to Target column 
   Select Add Package 
 

<p>This package provides the full login UI experience and token handling utilities for OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. It’s the core component for authentication in your iOS app.</p>

<p>Once added, you’ll see the Okta SDK listed under your project’s Package Dependencies.</p>

 Add the OIDC configuration to your iOS app 

<p>To use the <code>OktaBrowserSignin</code> flow, initialize the shared client with your specific app credentials.</p>

<p>The cleanest and most scalable way to manage configuration is to use a property list file for Okta stored in your app bundle.</p>

<p>Create the property list for your OIDC and app config by following these steps:</p>
 
   Right-click on the root folder of the project 
   Select New File from Template (New File in legacy Xcode versions) 
   Ensure you have iOS selected on the top picker 
   Select Property List template and select Next 
   Name the template <code>Okta</code> and select Create to create a <code>Okta.plist</code> file 
 

<p>You can edit the file in XML format by right-clicking and selecting Open As -&gt; Source Code. Copy and paste the following code into the file.</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;scopes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;openid profile offline_access&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;redirectUri&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/callback&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;clientId&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;{yourClientID}&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;issuer&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;logoutRedirectUri&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code>   

<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} and {yourClientID} with the values from your Okta org.</p>

<p>If you use something like this now in code, you can directly access the <code>BrowserSignin</code> shared object, which will already be allocated and ready for use.</p>

 Manage authentication actions for your iOS app using the Okta Swift SDK 

<p>We’ll build the core authentication layer for our app, the <code>AuthService</code>. This service handles login, logout, token refresh, and user info retrieval using the <code>OktaBrowserSignin</code> module.</p>

<p>Create a new folder named <code>Auth</code> under your project’s folder structure. We’ll use this folder to organize our authentication code. Inside that folder, create a new Swift file named <code>AuthService.swift</code> and define the protocol and class:</p>

   <code>import BrowserSignin
protocol AuthServiceProtocol {
    var isAuthenticated: Bool { get }
    var idToken: String? { get }
    
    func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo?
    func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo?
    func signIn() async throws
    func signOut() async throws
    func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws
}
final class AuthService: AuthServiceProtocol {
    // Implementation will go here
}
</code>   

<p>After doing this, you will get an error message saying that the <code>AuthService</code> does not conform to protocol <code>AuthServiceProtocol</code> because we haven’t implemented the functions yet. We will implement the functions as we progress.</p>

<p>Create a folder named <code>Models</code> inside the <code>Auth</code> folder. Within the <code>Models</code> folder, create a new file named <code>TokenInfo.swift</code>, and add the code shown:</p>

   <code>struct TokenInfo {
    // we will add properties in the next section
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we will add the <code>signIn</code> and <code>signOut</code> methods inside the <code>AuthService</code> class.
With the Okta Swift SDK, handling user authentication is straightforward and secure – thanks to the built-in <code>signIn</code> and <code>signOut</code> methods in the <code>BrowserSignin</code> client. Let’s break down how to build these methods in your <code>AuthService</code>.</p>

 The <code>signIn</code> method 

<p>The <code>signIn</code> method redirects the user to authenticate using Okta, handles the PKCE flow, and retrieves the authentication tokens upon successful login. Open the <code>AuthService</code> class, find the comment <code>Implementation will go here</code>, replace the comment with the following code:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func signIn() async throws {
    BrowserSignin.shared?.ephemeralSession = true
    let tokens = try await BrowserSignin.shared?.signIn()
    if let tokens {
      _ = try? Credential.store(tokens)
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s unpack this:</p>

<p><code>BrowserSignin.shared?.ephemeralSession = true</code></p>

<p>This property controls the type of browser session used for authentication:</p>
 
   If set to true, it forces an ephemeral browser session, meaning no cookies or session state will persist across authentication attempts. It’s like opening a private/incognito window for each login attempt. 
   If set to false, it shares the browser state with the system browser, allowing Okta to remember the user’s login state across sessions (for example, for single sign-on across apps). 
 

<p>In our demo, we set <code>ephemeralSession = true</code> to treat each login as a fresh authentication, which is ideal for testing.</p>
 
   <code>signIn(from: window)</code>
  This function launches the Okta-hosted sign-in page.
  The window parameter provides context for where to present the login UI, typically your app’s current window if building in UIKit. 
   <code>Credential.store(tokens)</code>
  After login, we store the tokens securely (e.g., access token, ID token, and refresh token) using Okta’s built-in Credential storage helper. 
 

 The <code>signOut</code> method 

<p>Signing out is also straightforward. We will proceed by adding it immediately below the <code>signIn</code> method in the <code>AuthService</code> class:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func signOut() async throws {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else { return }
  try await BrowserSignin.shared?.signOut(token: credential.token)
  try? credential.remove()
}
</code>   

<p>Here’s what happens:</p>
 
   We check if there’s a current credential by calling <code>Credential.default</code>. 
   We call <code>signOut</code> on the shared <code>BrowserSignIn</code> instance, passing the current token for session revocation. 
   After a successful logout, we remove the credential from secure storage. 
 

<p>This ensures the user’s session is entirely revoked and cleared from the app and Okta’s backend.</p>

 Add handling for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC tokens and the authenticated session 

<p>Once we’ve set up authentication flows, we must handle token management and session state. This step ensures that your app knows when the user is authenticated, how to access their tokens, and how to refresh tokens when needed.</p>

<p>The protocol requires implementing two computed variables and three functions to help us manage the tokens and the session.</p>

<p>Add the following code in the implementation of the <code>AuthService</code> class right above the <code>signIn</code> method:</p>

   <code>var isAuthenticated: Bool {
  return Credential.default != nil
}
</code>   
<p>Let’s go through the code.</p>

<p>The <code>isAuthenticated</code> computed property checks whether there’s a valid token stored in the app:</p>
 
   It uses <code>Credential.default</code>, a singleton that securely stores the user’s tokens. 
   If a valid token exists, the user is considered authenticated; otherwise, they are not. 
 

<p>Next, we’ll add the second helper computed property, which we will use to retrieve the user’s ID token. In the <code>AuthService</code> class, under the <code>isAuthenticated</code> property, add the following code:</p>

   <code>var idToken: String? {
  return Credential.default?.token.idToken?.rawValue
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>idToken</code> property retrieves the raw value of the ID token from the stored credential:</p>
 
   The ID token is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) containing user identity information, such as the user’s email, name, and subject (<code>sub</code>). 
 

<p>We successfully implemented the computed properties required by the protocol. Next, we’ll add the implementation for the three helper functions.</p>

<p>Tokens always expire, which means that at some point, they are no longer valid, and we must refresh them. Lucky, Okta’s SDK provides us with a solution for this need. We can leverage the refresh function, which is part of the <code>Credential</code> object.</p>

<p>Inside the <code>AuthService</code> class, right after the <code>signOut</code> method, add the <code>refreshTokenIfNeeded()</code> function:</p>

   <code>func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else { return }
  try await credential.refresh()
}
</code>   
<p>The <code>refreshTokenIfNeeded</code> method ensures that tokens are up-to-date by attempting a token refresh when necessary:</p>
 
   It calls the <code>Credential.refresh()</code> method, which uses the refresh token (if available) to get a new access token and ID token. 
   This helps avoid token expiration issues that could interrupt the user’s session. 
 

<p>At this point, we’ll add an empty implementation to the other two functions, which will help us get some information about the token and the user. In our case, we will present some data on the screen. Add the following code after the <code>refreshTokenIfneeded()</code> function:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  return nil
}
    
func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo? {
  return nil
}
</code>   

<p>With this added, we resolved the errors we saw in <code>AuthService</code>, and you’ll be able to build the project successfully.</p>

 Use the auth service in your Swift app 

<p>Now that we’ve built the <code>AuthService</code> to handle sign in, sign out, token management, and user info retrieval, let’s see how to integrate it into your app’s UI.</p>

 Use <code>AuthService</code> in your views 

<p>Since this app is about authentication, rename the auto-generated view <code>ContentView</code> to <code>AuthView</code> and rename the file to match. Don’t forget to rename all the existing and auto-generated references to <code>ContentView</code> and use <code>AuthView</code> instead.</p>

<p>Next, in the same folder as the <code>AuthView</code>, we will create the <code>AuthViewModel</code>. The <code>AuthViewModel</code> handles all user actions and authentication:</p>

   <code>import Foundation
import Observation
import BrowserSignin

@Observable
final class AuthViewModel {
    // MARK: - Dependencies
    
    /// This is the service that handles all the sign-in, sign-out, token, and user info logic.
    private let authService: AuthServiceProtocol

    // MARK: - UI State Properties

    /// True if the user is currently logged in.
    var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    
    /// The user's ID token (used for secure backend communication).
    var idToken: String?
    
    /// Shows a loading spinner while something is happening in the background.
    var isLoading: Bool = false
    
    /// If something goes wrong (e.g., login fails), the error message will show in the UI.
    var errorMessage: String?
    
    /// This holds a message returned from the resources server.
    var serverMessage: String?

    // MARK: - Initialization

    
    /// Create the view model and immediately update the UI with the current authentication status.
    init(authService: AuthServiceProtocol = AuthService()) {
        self.authService = authService
        updateUI()
    }
    
    // MARK: - UI State Management

    /// Updates the `isAuthenticated` and `idToken` values from the authentication service.
    func updateUI() {
        isAuthenticated = authService.isAuthenticated
        idToken = authService.idToken
    }
    
    // MARK: - Authentication
    
    /// Called when the user taps the "Sign In" or "Sign Out" button.
    /// Signs the user in or out, updates the UI, and handles any errors.
    @MainActor
    func handleAuthAction() async {
        setLoading(true)
        defer { setLoading(false) }

        do {
            if isAuthenticated {
                // User is signed in → sign them out
                try await authService.signOut()
            } else {
                // User is signed out → sign them in
                try await authService.signIn()
            }
            updateUI()
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - Token Handling
    
    /// Refreshes the user's token if it's about to expire.
    /// Keeps the user logged in longer without needing to manually sign in again.
    @MainActor
    func refreshToken() async {
        setLoading(true)
        defer { setLoading(false) }

        do {
            try await authService.refreshTokenIfNeeded()
            updateUI()
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - User Info
    
    /// Requests user information (like name, email, etc.) from the authentication service.
    @MainActor
    func fetchUserInfo() async -&gt; UserInfo? {
        do {
            let userInfo = try await authService.userInfo()
            return userInfo
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
            return nil
        }
    }

    // MARK: - Token Info

    /// Retrieves token metadata like expiry time or claims.
    /// Returns nil if no token is available.
    func fetchTokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
        guard let tokenInfo = authService.tokenInfo() else { return nil }
        return tokenInfo
    }

    // MARK: - Helpers
    
    /// Sets the loading state (used to show/hide a spinner in the UI).
    private func setLoading(_ value: Bool) {
        isLoading = value
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we must extend the <code>AuthView</code> to use the view model and all the properties and functions we added. This view will change depending on whether the user is authenticated and will incorporate displaying the ID token and a button to refresh the token. Open <code>AuthView.swift</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

struct UserInfoModel: Identifiable {

    let user: UserInfo
}
</code>   

<p>With this in place, you can run the application and test the authentication. Currently, we are not using the <code>TokenInfo</code> and the <code>UserInfo</code> from the <code>ViewModel</code> because we will expand the view in the next section.</p>

 Read token info 

<p>After successfully authenticating a user, it’s helpful to extract meaningful details from the ID token and present them in a user-friendly format. For this purpose, we created a <code>TokenInfo</code> model in the previous sections. It will be initialized from the ID token and includes a <code>toString()</code> function to generate a nicely formatted description of the token data for display in the UI.</p>

<p>Open <code>TokenInfo.swift</code> and add the code shown.</p>

   <code>import Foundation
import BrowserSignin

struct TokenInfo {
    var idToken: String
    var tokenIssuer: String
    var preferredUsername: String
    var authTime: String?
    var issuedAt: String?
    
    init?(idToken: JWT) {
        guard let idToken = Credential.default?.token.idToken else {
            return nil
        }
        
        self.idToken = idToken.rawValue
        self.tokenIssuer = idToken.issuer ?? "No Issuer found"
        self.preferredUsername = idToken.preferredUsername ?? "No preferred_username found"
        
        let formatter = DateFormatter()
        formatter.dateStyle = .medium
        formatter.timeStyle = .medium
        
        if let authTime = idToken.authTime {
            self.authTime = formatter.string(from: authTime)
        }
        
        if let issuedAt = idToken.issuedAt {
            self.issuedAt = formatter.string(from: issuedAt)
        }
    }
    
    func toString() -&gt; String {
        var result = ""
     
        result.append("ID Token: \(idToken)")
        result.append("\n")
        result.append("Preffered username: \(preferredUsername)")
        result.append("\n")
        result.append("Token Issuer: \(tokenIssuer)")
        result.append("\n")
        if let authTime {
            result.append("Auth time: \(authTime)")
            result.append("\n")
        }
        
        if let issuedAt {
            result.append("Issued at: \(issuedAt)")
            result.append("\n")
        }

        return result
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the previous sections, we introduced two methods for fetching information about the token and the authenticated user. However, we left their implementation empty. It’s now time to implement those functions, and we will start by implementing the <code>tokenInfo()</code> function.</p>

<p>Navigate to your <code>AuthService</code> class and in there find the <code>tokenInfo()</code> function, which should look something like this:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  return nil
}
</code>   

<p>To initialize our TokenInfo modal view, we need the ID token. Okta’s Swift SDK lets us fetch the ID token directly from the <code>Credential.default</code>. Remove the <code>return nil</code> from the function implementation and add the following code:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  guard let idToken = Credential.default?.token.idToken else {
    return nil
  }
      
  return TokenInfo(idToken: idToken)
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation extracts the ID token from the default Credential and tries to instantiate the <code>TokenInfo</code> object.</p>

<p>Next, we must implement the second empty function introduced in the previous sections, <code>userInfo()</code>. We’ll use the SDK’s <code>UserInfo</code> model to pass the data around. Replace the existing implementation of <code>userInfo()</code> with the code shown.</p>

   <code>func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo? {
  if let userInfo = Credential.default?.userInfo {
    return userInfo
  } else {
    do {
      guard let userInfo = try await Credential.default?.userInfo() else {
        return nil
      }
      return userInfo
    } catch {
      return nil
    }
  }
}
</code>   
<p>If your Okta setup includes them, you could extend this method to extract more claims, such as email, given name, family name, or custom claims.</p>

<p>With this code in place, we need to display the information to the user somehow in the UI. First, we’ll create a <code>TokenInfoView</code> to display all the information we fetched previously. Create a new Swift file in the root folder of your application and name it <code>TokenInfoView.swift</code>. After creating the file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI

struct TokenInfoView: View {
  let tokenInfo: TokenInfo
  @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

  var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) {
        Button {
          dismiss()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
            .resizable()
            .foregroundStyle(.black)
            .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
            .padding(.leading, 10)
          }
                
          Text(tokenInfo.toString())
          .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))
          .padding()
          .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
      }
         
    }
    .background(Color(.systemGroupedBackground))
    .navigationTitle("Token Info")
    .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Proceed with adding one more Swift file named <code>UserInfoView.swift</code>. This view displays previously fetched information about the User. In your newly created file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI
import BrowserSignin

struct UserInfoView: View {
  let userInfo: UserInfo
  @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
    
  var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) {
        Button {
          dismiss()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
              .resizable()
              .foregroundStyle(.black)
              .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
              .padding(.leading, 10)
          }
                
        Text(formattedData)
          .font(.system(size: 14))
          .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
          .padding()
      }
    }
      .background(Color(.systemBackground))
      .navigationTitle("User Info")
      .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
  }
    
  private var formattedData: String {
    var result = ""
     
    result.append("Name: " + (userInfo.name ?? "No Name set"))
    result.append("\n")
    result.append("Username: " + (userInfo.preferredUsername ?? "No Username set"))
    result.append("\n")
    if let updatedAt = userInfo.updatedAt {
      let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
      dateFormatter.dateStyle = .medium
      dateFormatter.timeStyle = .short
      let date = dateFormatter.string(for: updatedAt)
        result.append("Updated at: " + (date ?? ""))
      }

      return result
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, we need to add some actions to the <code>AuthView</code> to see the views we just created. In the <code>AuthView</code> class at the end of the file, you will find the private extension that we previously defined. After the <code>refreshTokenButton</code> in the private extension of <code>AuthView</code>, add the following buttons:</p>

   <code>/// Opens the full-screen view showing token info.
var tokenInfoButton: some View {
  Button {
    showTokenInfo = true
  } label: {
      Image(systemName: "info.circle")
        .foregroundColor(.blue)
    }
    .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
  }

  /// Loads user info and presents it full screen.
  var userInfoButton: some View {
    Button("👤 User Info") {
      Task {
        if let user = await viewModel.fetchUserInfo() {
          await MainActor.run {
            userInfo = UserInfoModel(user: user)
          }
        }
      }
    }
    .font(.system(size: 14))
    .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
}
</code>   

<p>Now that we have the buttons implemented, we need to add them to the <code>body</code> of <code>AuthView</code> so that the user can see them and click them. Scroll to the top of the file and find <code>struct AuthView:View</code>. Add both buttons right after <code>refreshTokenButton</code>, and then the <code>VStack</code> in your body should look like this:</p>

   <code>VStack(spacing: 20) {
  statusSection
  tokenSection
  authButton
  if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
    refreshTokenButton
    tokenInfoButton // tokenInfoButton added here
    userInfoButton // userInfoButton added here
  }
  
  if viewModel.isLoading {
    ProgressView()
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Within the definition for <code>body</code>, we need to call two view modifiers to be able to see the TokenInfoView and UserInfoView. You’ll add the following code right after the closing brace of the <code>message: {}</code> property:</p>

   <code>// Show Token Info full screen
.fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showTokenInfo) {
  if let tokenInfo = viewModel.fetchTokenInfo() {
    TokenInfoView(tokenInfo: tokenInfo)
  }
}
// Show User Info full screen   
.fullScreenCover(item: $userInfo) { info in
  UserInfoView(userInfo: info.user)
}
</code>   

<p>Now, if you run the application, you should be able to click on the Info button to get the token information and the User Info button to get the user information.</p>

<p>And there you have it! 🎉 We built a sample app from scratch using Okta’s new Swift SDK and the <code>BrowserSignin</code> module to show the authenticated user’s ID claims. By following these steps, you’ve learned how to:</p>

 
   ✅ Configure Okta and set up your application 
   ✅ Implement a robust AuthService to handle login, logout, and token management 
   ✅ Build a SwiftUI interface that displays user info and handles authentication flows seamlessly 
 

<p>With just a few lines of code, you have a fully functional, secure login flow integrated into your iOS app – no more OAuth headaches or token handling nightmares.</p>

<p>Authentication is the first step in an app, but we want to display data from a backend resource securely.</p>

 Add backend authorization using a custom resource server 

<p>If you want to go beyond authentication and add authorization checks for your APIs, we can experiment using Okta’s Node.js Resource Server example as a starting point.</p>

<p>Here’s how to connect your iOS app to a backend that validates access tokens:</p>

 Set up a customer resource server for your mobile app 

<p>Clone the example Node.js resource server:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4.git
cd samples-nodejs-express-4
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Open the project in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. I like Visual Studio Code because it has a built-in terminal, but you can make the required code changes directly to the file. Open <code>resource-server/server.js</code>. Look for the configuration block where <code>oktaJwtVerifier</code> is initialized. Update it like this:</p>

   <code>const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
});
</code>   

<p>Replace the <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your Okta org domain, and replace the <code>{yourClientID}</code> with the client ID of your iOS project.</p>

<p>Serve the resource server by running the following command in the terminal.</p>

   <code>npm run resource-server
</code>   

<p>You should see your server running locally at: http://localhost:8000/</p>

<p>This server will validate incoming access tokens and respond with two messages if the token is valid:</p>

   <code>{
   "messages":[
      {
         "date":"2025-07-03T19:06:59.799Z",
         "text":"I am a robot."
      },
      {
         "date":"2025-07-03T18:06:59.799Z",
         "text":"Hello, world!"
      }
   ]
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s create the model conforming to this payload.</p>

<p>Create a file named <code>MessagesResponse.swift</code> in the <code>Auth/Models</code> folder and add the code.</p>

   <code>import Foundation

struct MessageResponse: Codable {
   let messages: [Message]
}

struct Message: Codable {
   let date: String
   let text: String
}
</code>   

 Make authorized API requests from your iOS app 

<p>To call the resource server API from our iOS code, we must first implement a function inside our <code>AuthService</code> to fetch messages.</p>

<p>Open the <code>AuthService</code> file and add one more function at the end of the <code>AuthServiceProtocol</code>:</p>

   <code>protocol AuthServiceProtocol {
  var isAuthenticated: Bool { get }
  var idToken: String? { get }
  
  func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo?
  func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo?
  func signIn() async throws
  func signOut() async throws
  func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws
  func fetchMessageFromBackend() async throws -&gt; String // added
}
</code>   

<p>Because we introduced a new function to the protocol, it requires an implementation. In the <code>AuthService</code> class, immediately after the implementation of <code>userInfo()</code>, add the following code:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func fetchMessageFromBackend() async throws -&gt; String {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else {
      return "Not authenticated."
  }

  var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "http://localhost:8000/api/messages")!)
  request.httpMethod = "GET"

  await credential.authorize(&amp;request)

  let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
  let decoder = JSONDecoder()
  let response = try decoder.decode(MessageResponse.self, from: data)
  if let randomMessage = response.messages.randomElement() {
      return "\(randomMessage.text)"
  } else {
      return "No messages found."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>With this, you will get an error message that some classes aren’t found. That’s because we must <code>import Foundation</code> into our <code>AuthService.swift</code> file just below <code>import BrowserSignIn</code>.</p>

   <code>import BrowserSignin
import Foundation // added
</code>   

<p>Okta’s iOS SDK provides a handy method for automatically adding your access token as an Authorization header on a URL request.</p>

<p>We need to go back to the <code>AuthViewModel</code> and add a function to call <code>fetchMessageFromBackend()</code> and set the server message to our <code>serverMessage</code> property of the <code>viewModel</code>. Add the following code right after <code>fetchTokenInfo()</code>:</p>

   <code>// MARK: - Server Messages

/// Asks the backend for a message and saves it for display in the UI.
@MainActor
func fetchMessage() async {
  setLoading(true)
  defer { setLoading(false) }
  
  do {
    let message = try await authService.fetchMessageFromBackend()
    serverMessage = message
  } catch {
    errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We need to extend the <code>AuthView</code> to use this function and show the fetched server message as an alert to the user. For this purpose, go to the <code>AuthView</code> file and in the extension just below the <code>userInfoButton</code>, we will add one more button like this:</p>

   <code>/// Requests a message from the backend and shows it in the UI.
var getMessageButton: some View {
  Button("🎁 Get Message") {
    Task {
        await viewModel.fetchMessage()
        
    }
  }
  .font(.system(size: 14))
  .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to present this button to the view. In the <code>body</code>of <code>AuthView</code>, let’s add <code>getMessageButton</code> and the body will look like this:</p>

   <code>VStack(spacing: 20) {
  statusSection
  tokenSection
  authButton
  if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
    refreshTokenButton
    tokenInfoButton
    userInfoButton
      getMessageButton // getMessageButton added here
  }
  if viewModel.isLoading {
    ProgressView()
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, we’ll alert the user with the message contents received from our backend if the authentication is successful. To do so, we need to add the <code>.alert</code> view modifier to the body of <code>AuthView</code> after the final <code>fullScreenCover</code> closing bracket, like this:</p>

   <code>// Show Alert with the fetched message
.alert("Message Response", isPresented: .constant(viewModel.serverMessage != nil)) {
    Button("OK", role: .cancel) {
        viewModel.serverMessage = nil
    }
} message: {
    // Show message if available
    if let message = viewModel.serverMessage {
        Text(message)
    }
}
</code>   

<p>With all this in place, you’ll see a message alert when pressing the Get Messages button.</p>

<p>This is the recommended approach for securely connecting your mobile app to backend APIs using OAuth 2.0 and JWT validation. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-swift-mfa-redirect-example">completed project in a GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>🎉 And that’s it! Your iOS app now has authentication and calls a backend API with the access token for fully integrated authorization verification.</p>

<p>Facial recognition technology has become increasingly common in our daily lives. From unlocking phones to airport security, it is changing the way we identify and <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">verify people</a>. This technology uses advanced software to analyze facial features and match them with existing databases, making many tasks faster and more secure.</p>
<p>While facial recognition offers convenience and improved safety, it also comes with challenges. Privacy concerns, accuracy issues, and ethical questions are important factors to consider before adopting this technology. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition can help businesses and individuals make informed choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Facial Recognition Technology? 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">Facial recognition technology</a> is a type of software that identifies or verifies a person by analyzing their facial features. Cameras with facial recognition capture images or video of faces. The software then compares these images to a database to identify a match.</p>
<p>It is widely used in security, banking, law enforcement, and even marketing. While it offers convenience, it also raises concerns about privacy and accuracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Facial Recognition Technology 
<p>Facial recognition technology offers several important benefits. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
 1. Enhanced Security 
<p>One of the main advantages of facial recognition is improved security. It can identify individuals in crowded places, detect unauthorized access, and prevent fraud. For businesses, this technology can help protect sensitive areas.</p>
 
 Banks use facial recognition to verify clients for online transactions. 
 Airports and government buildings use it to control access and ensure safety. 
 
<p>By providing a layer of security beyond passwords or ID cards, facial recognition technology reduces the risk of theft and unauthorized entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Convenience and Speed 
<p>Facial recognition can make daily tasks faster and easier. Unlike traditional authentication methods, it does not require remembering passwords or carrying cards.</p>
 
 Phones and laptops can be unlocked instantly. 
 Airports can speed up boarding with automated facial scans. 
 Offices can track attendance without manual checks. 
 
<p>This convenience saves time for both individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Contactless Identification 
<p>In the era of health concerns and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">pandemics</a>, contactless systems have become essential. Facial recognition is a non-intrusive, touch-free technology. It reduces the need for physical contact, which is safer in public spaces and healthcare environments.</p>
<p>This feature makes it ideal for hospitals, banks, airports, and retail stores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Law Enforcement and Public Safety 
<p>Facial recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in tracking and identifying suspects. It is useful for finding missing persons, preventing crimes, and investigating incidents.</p>
<p>Cameras with facial recognition can scan crowds in real time, alerting authorities to potential threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Integration with Other Systems 
<p>Facial recognition can work with other technologies, such as security cameras, mobile apps, and access control systems. This integration allows for smarter solutions. For example, smart home systems can use facial recognition to unlock doors for family members but restrict access to strangers.</p>
<p>Platforms like <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> make it easy to integrate facial recognition into existing systems efficiently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Disadvantages of Facial Recognition Technology 
<p>Despite its advantages, facial recognition technology has limitations and potential risks. Here are some of the main disadvantages:</p>
 1. Privacy Concerns 
<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of facial recognition is the potential invasion of privacy. Constant surveillance can make people feel watched and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Data collected through facial recognition can be misused if not properly secured. Some governments and companies have faced criticism for using this technology without consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Risk of Misidentification 
<p>Facial recognition is not 100% accurate. Lighting, camera quality, facial expressions, and changes in appearance can affect results. Misidentification can lead to wrongful accusations or denied access.</p>
<p>This is a serious concern, especially in law enforcement and security applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. High Costs 
<p>Facial recognition requires good cameras, software, and secure storage, which can be expensive. Maintenance and upgrades also add to the cost. Tools like Recognito offer cost-effective solutions, making it easier for businesses to adopt without overspending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Ethical and Legal Issues 
<p>Facial recognition raises ethical questions. How and where should the technology be used? What limits should be set? Different countries have different laws regarding the use of facial recognition, making compliance challenging.</p>
<p>Improper use could lead to legal penalties or public backlash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Potential for Bias 
<p>Some facial recognition systems have shown bias against certain ethnic groups or genders. This can result in unfair treatment, especially in hiring processes, law enforcement, or financial services.</p>
<p>Developers are working to reduce bias, but it remains a concern.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Balancing the Pros and Cons 
<p>When considering this technology, it is essential to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition. For example, businesses may benefit from enhanced security and convenience. However, they must also address privacy, accuracy, and ethical concerns.</p>
<p>Public awareness, transparency, and regulations play a key role in ensuring facial recognition is used responsibly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future of Facial Recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology continues to evolve. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are improving accuracy and reducing bias. We are likely to see more industries adopt this technology for secure, efficient, and contactless operations.</p>
<p>However, its future will also depend on legal frameworks and public acceptance. Companies must use it responsibly and prioritize the protection of user data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition highlight both its strengths and limitations. Facial recognition technology offers many advantages, including better security, convenience, and integration with modern systems. At the same time, it comes with risks such as privacy concerns, misidentification, and ethical challenges.</p>
<p>For businesses or developers looking for facial <a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision/">recognition solutions</a>, platforms like Recognito provide advanced facial recognition <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sdk/">SDKs</a>. These tools allow companies to integrate secure and accurate facial recognition into their applications while focusing on privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>By understanding the pros and cons of facial recognition, individuals and organizations can make smarter decisions about adopting this technology in a safe and responsible way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Frequently Asked Questions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Can facial recognition technology invade personal privacy? 
<p>Yes, facial recognition can raise privacy concerns since it involves surveillance and data collection. If misused, it may track people without consent. Strong regulations and secure data storage are vital to protect privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Is facial recognition technology 100% accurate? 
<p>No, it isn’t fully accurate. Lighting, camera quality, or changes in appearance can cause errors. AI has improved accuracy, but misidentifications still occur, especially in law enforcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Can facial recognition be integrated with smart home devices? 
<p>Yes, facial recognition integrates well with smart homes. It can unlock doors for family members, restrict strangers, and personalize settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Can facial recognition technology be fooled by photos or masks? 
<p>Sometimes. Older systems may be tricked by photos or masks. Modern solutions use <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">liveness detection</a> and 3D imaging, making it much harder to bypass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. How Much Does It Cost to Implement a Facial Recognition System? 
<p>Costs vary by scale. Small setups may cost a few thousand dollars, while large projects can reach hundreds of thousands. Hardware, software, and maintenance all influence the total price.</p>

<p>As CMO of 1Kosmos, I’ve had a front-row seat to watch this company evolve over the past five years. When we founded the company, the cybersecurity world was still obsessed with building bigger walls around the perimeter. Password managers were the hot solution. Multi-factor authentication was cutting edge.</p>
<p>We saw something different coming. Identity would become the new perimeter. Passwords would become the liability, not the solution. And users would demand authentication that was both more secure and more convenient than anything available.</p>
<p>The market needed time to catch up to our vision. But it has, in a big way.</p>
 The Market Caught Up 
<p>Our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/">$57 million Series B brings our total funding to over $72 million.</a> This isn’t just validation of our technology. It’s proof that the market has fundamentally shifted. Our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-partnership-with-carahsoft-awarded-login-gov-next-generation-identity-proofing-blanket-purchase-agreement-bpa-worth-up-to-194-5m/">$194.5 million agreement for Login.gov</a> through Carahsoft shows that enterprise buyers are ready for what we’ve been building.</p>
<p>The timing makes sense. Every week brings news of another devastating breach, another ransomware attack, another company targeted by AI-generated deepfakes. Traditional passwords and even SMS-based two-factor authentication aren’t cutting it anymore. We’re seeing North Korean operatives deepfake their way into US companies through remote interviews and social engineers extract hundreds of millions in losses through the IT Service Desk.</p>
 What We Built 
<p>Instead of adding another layer to broken systems, we rebuilt the foundation with a platform that verifies you are who you say you are, every single time you log in. No more checking passwords – we verify actual identity.</p>
<p>We use biometrics tied to verified credentials on a private, permissioned ledger. The technology is sophisticated, but the user experience is intuitive: biometric authentication replaces passwords entirely. Users authenticate once with their identity, then access digital and in-person services seamlessly.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves – millions of daily users, zero successful account takeovers on our platform, and deployment times measured in hours instead of months. Our customers routinely tell us their users prefer our authentication to anything they’ve used before. Business efficiency improves.</p>
 The Certifications That Matter 
<p>We’re the only platform with full service NIST 800-63-3, FIDO2, and iBeta<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/"> certifications</a> – and that’s more than alphabet soup. These certifications prove our solution has the highest level of interoperability and works at the highest levels of government security requirements, which is why FedRAMP gave us High Authorization for national security applications.</p>
 Where We Go From Here 
<p>I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that technology alone doesn’t win markets, but when your technology solves a real problem that’s only getting worse and major enterprises are making significant commitments to deploy it, you know you’re onto something.</p>
<p>The identity verification market is exploding because every organization needs to know their users are who they claim to be – not just once during onboarding, but every time they log in.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, we bet that the future of cybersecurity would be identity-first, passwordless, and privacy-preserving. Today, that future is here, and we’re leading it.</p>
<p>Ready to see what passwordless looks like in practice?<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/contact/"> Let’s talk.</a></p>

			 Tokeny–recently acquired by leading global financial services provider Apex Group–is set to tokenize two of SkyBridge’s funds on the Avalanche blockchain network. 
<p>NEW YORK, 19th August 2025 – <a href="https://www.skybridge.com/">Skybridge Capital</a> today announced it will tokenize $300 million of its flagship hedge funds on the <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche</a> blockchain network. This landmark initiative represents a collaboration with enterprise-grade tokenization leader <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a> and its parent company, <a href="https://www.apexgroup.com/">Apex Group Ltd.</a>, a global financial services provider servicing over $3.5 trillion in assets.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenizing our funds on Avalanche, supported by the technology and operational infrastructure of Tokeny and Apex Group, represents a significant step forward in modernizing the alternative<br>
investment landscape. We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors, and demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain can work together to create smarter, more efficient investment solutions.  Anthony ScaramucciFounder &amp; CEO of SkyBridge Capital    
	 
		 
			<p>A former Goldman Sachs executive and White House Communications Director, Scaramucci has long been a prominent voice in alternatives and digital assets, with deep networks across pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, SkyBridge will tokenize its Digital Macro Master Fund Ltd and Legion Strategies Ltd leveraging the proven ERC-3643 standard with operational infrastructure delivered through Apex Group’s Digital 3.0 platform. The platform offers a single-source solution for the entire investment lifecycle, enabling institutional clients to seamlessly transition their funds to blockchain-based rails with integrated capabilities for creation, issuance, administration, and distribution.</p>

		 
	 
    This milestone shows how Apex Group and Tokeny are breaking down the operational and technology barriers that have historically slowed institutional tokenization. SkyBridge’s tokenization on Avalanche proves that with the right technology, trusted operators, and regulatory clarity, tokenization at scale is not just possible, it’s happening.  Daniel CoheurGlobal Head of Digital Assets at Apex Group and Co-Founder of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Avalanche was selected for its institutional-grade architecture, offering the transaction speed and near-instant finality required for large-scale tokenization. As a leading blockchain for real-world assets (RWAs), Avalanche’s rapidly expanding institutional ecosystem already hosts regulated offerings in tokenized money market funds, private credit, and more. The network’s EVM compatibility and scalability make it an ideal foundation for bringing traditional assets on chain to unlock new distribution channels, utility, and blockchain-naive products and services.</p>

		 
	 
    Our work with Tokeny, Apex Group, and SkyBridge marks a pivotal moment for institutional adoption and serves as a powerful market signal that tokenization has entered the mainstream. SkyBridge Capital’s leadership and network within the allocator community makes this a strong validation of Avalanche's position as the premier platform for connecting capital.  John WuPresident of Ava Labs.    
	 
		 
			<p>This collaboration brings together next-generation technology, enterprise-grade infrastructure, and institutional credibility, a critical combination for accelerating the adoption of RWAs across hedge funds, private credit, and multi-strategy vehicles.</p>

<p>If you’ve wondered what working group chair skills actually matter, I have news for you: you don’t need to be a spec-writing wizard to be effective.</p>



<p>I do get it, though. I chair working groups, and I still can’t read specs the way implementers do. Half the time I open a technical specification, my eyes glaze over after the abstract. I couldn’t code myself out of a wet paper bag. (Unless that wet paper bag happens to include m4 and sendmail rulesets. Those, I can do.)</p>



<p>That said, if you take nothing else away from this post, take this and embed it in your brain: you don’t have to be a spec-writing wizard to be an effective contributor, or even to chair a working group.</p>



<p>In fact, some of the most valuable skills in standards work have nothing to do with writing code.</p>

 What a chair actually does (and doesn’t do) 



<p>There’s a misconception that working group chairs must be the ultimate subject-matter experts, the kind of person who can answer any question off the cuff. I used to believe that too. *buzzer sound* Wrong, try again! The job is about facilitation and neutrality, not encyclopedic knowledge.</p>



<p>A good chair brings the right working group chair skills to the table:</p>



 
 Manages time, the agenda, and the meeting queue. 



 Keeps the room neutral and separates their “chair hat” from their personal opinions. 



 Tests for consensus and documents objections. 



 Guides the group back to its charter when things start to sprawl. 
 



<p>What a chair doesn’t do:</p>



 
 Decide the technical design. 



 “Win” arguments on the mic. 



 Gatekeep new contributors. 
 



<p>Yes, a baseline of knowledge helps, mainly to keep the group on track and ask the right questions. But if you’re the loudest voice in the room or the person with the most opinions? That’s a red flag.</p>



 The Madrid moment 



<p>This post was inspired by a moment at the recent IETF meeting in Madrid.</p>



<p>I was sitting in a session (not one I was running) feeling wildly inadequate. The chair of that meeting seemed to know everything: answering questions without pause, bouncing ideas around, and generally radiating expertise. I thought, I can’t do that. I’ll never be that person.</p>



<p>Later, I mentioned my self-doubt to a friend who’s been in standards work since Gandalf was a baby (i.e., a very long time). They said something that stuck:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“That kind of deep subject-matter expertise isn’t what makes a good chair. The job is to be neutral, help the group come to consensus, and keep the process fair. If you’re too invested in the outcome, you can’t do that well.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And they were right. In a session I chaired the next day, I reminded myself of that. Instead of getting pulled into the details, I paused, restated the questions we were debating, and asked for commitments to review from experts in the room. We left the meeting with clear decisions and action owners. Go, team!</p>



<p>No wizard-level technical knowledge required.</p>



 Where non‑coders shine 



<p>Even if you’re not a chair, these are the same skills that make you a great contributor and help you develop working group chair skills if you want to take that step later. Non‑coders are often the ones who:</p>



 
 Turn pain points into crisp user stories. “We need X because Y breaks if we don’t.” 



 Write readable summaries for product managers, lawyers, and execs. 



 Triage issues on GitHub—label them, close duplicates, line up proposals for meetings. 



 Spot interoperability gaps. Help set up test plans, track what passes/fails, and document blockers. 



 Herd the cats. Draft pre-reads, take notes, and make sure decisions actually get written down. 
 



<p>These are the unglamorous but critical pieces that keep work moving forward. Without them, groups stall, meetings get repetitive, and good ideas die in the noise. Groups well and truly need someone brave enough to ask “stupid” questions (that are never actually stupid) about how it all works.</p>



 How to start if you’re “not technical enough” 



<p>If you want to get involved but don’t know where to start, try this:</p>



 
 Read the charter of the group and two or three recent GitHub issues. 



 Introduce yourself on the mailing list with a sentence about what you can help with (e.g., “I’m a PM and can help with use cases or meeting notes”). 



 Volunteer once. Scribe a meeting, write a summary, or draft a use-case doc. 



 Ask the chairs: “What would unblock you this week that doesn’t require coding?” 



 Shadow a consensus call and notice how the chair phrases questions and records outcomes. 
 



<p>These small steps get you known as someone who adds value quickly. That reputation goes a long way.</p>



 For managers: send the right people 



<p>If you lead a team, the worst thing you can do is assume only senior engineers belong in standards groups. You should be sending:</p>



 
 PMs, solution architects, and analysts. 



 Tech writers who can make decisions and docs accessible. 



 Support or operations leads who know what customers actually need. 
 



<p>Give them specific assignments: draft use cases, clean up issues, track interop progress. And measure their impact by outcomes that matter: fewer rehashed meetings, clearer issues, faster consensus.</p>



 Common traps (and how to avoid them) 



<p>Even experienced chairs and contributors stumble into these:</p>



 
 Wearing the company hat too heavily. Remember: your job is to move the group’s work forward. 



 Turning meetings into tutorials. Save deep dives for dedicated docs or issues. 



 Letting the loudest voice set direction. Ask for explicit “can live with it” signals from the room. 



 Treating silence as consent. It usually isn’t. 
 



<p>A simple chair’s checklist helps: agenda posted in advance (see the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/important-dates/">Important Dates</a> page for IETF meetings) → pre‑reads linked → scribe/timekeeper assigned → decisions written down → minutes posted within 48 hours.</p>



 Why this matters 



<p>Standards work touches every part of the identity world—federation, digital credentials, browsers, payments. These decisions shape products and policies your teams will live with for years. I mentioned this a while back in <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/03/11/standards-versus-reality/">Standards Versus Reality</a> with how even well‑intentioned technical choices can clash with deployment realities, which is why diverse voices are so important.</p>



<p>But the process isn’t self-sustaining. If only engineers and spec authors show up, important perspectives get lost. And that hurts interoperability, usability, and deployment.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be the smartest engineer in the room to develop strong working group chair skills. You need to listen, ask questions, and help the group get to a decision.</p>



 Your turn 



<p>If you’ve thought, standards aren’t for me, try showing up once. Scribe a meeting. Draft a use-case doc. Or if you lead a team, send someone who can listen, write, and keep things moving.</p>

 Introduction 



<p>[00:00:26] Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29] Hi everyone, and welcome back to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>



<p>[00:00:33] Today I want to talk about something I hear often from people who are curious about standards work but never take the leap to participate.</p>



<p>[00:00:42] It’s that feeling of “I’m not technical enough. Standards are for engineers, so I’ll just sit this one out.”</p>



<p>[00:00:50] If that’s you, this episode is for you.</p>



<p>[00:00:54] The truth is, standards work is not just for coders. Some of the most important roles in working groups don’t involve writing a single line of code.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why Standards Work Isn’t Just for Engineers 



<p>[00:01:04] I want to pull back the curtain on my own experience as a working group chair. I’ll share:</p>



 
 The skills that actually make standards work successful 



 How non-coders can contribute 



 How to build the confidence to jump in 
 



<p>[00:01:24] Here’s my confession: I chair groups in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>



<p>[00:01:33] But if you handed me a technical specification to implement — I couldn’t do it. I can’t code my way out of a wet paper bag.</p>



<p>[00:01:42] I can read the text of a specification.<br>[00:01:48] I can follow the arguments and track design decisions.<br>[00:01:53] But I don’t read specs like implementers do.</p>



<p>And that’s okay. Because being a chair is not about being the ultimate expert — it’s about facilitating process, guiding discussion, and keeping the group focused.</p>



 



 *** 



 What a Working Group Chair Actually Does 



<p>[00:02:16] So what does a chair really do?</p>



<p>[00:02:24] On a good day, you’re:</p>



 
 Setting the agenda and keeping discussions on track 



 Managing the queue so everyone knows when it’s their turn 



 Listening carefully and testing for consensus 



 Making sure objections are heard and documented 



 Guiding the group back to its agreed charter 
 



<p>[00:03:06] Importantly, chairs do not decide technical design. They don’t win arguments or gatekeep contributors.</p>



<p>[00:03:14] Yes, technical knowledge helps — but being the loudest, most opinionated person in the room? That’s a liability for a chair.</p>



 



 *** 



 Lessons from Experience 



<p>[00:03:30] This all came to mind recently at an IETF meeting in Madrid.</p>



<p>[00:03:36] I was sitting in a session I wasn’t chairing and felt completely inadequate. The chair was brilliant — answering every question instantly and recalling years of history.</p>



<p>[00:04:06] I shared my self-doubt with a long-time standards veteran. Their advice stuck: A good chair isn’t about deep expertise. It’s about neutrality and guiding consensus.</p>



<p>[00:04:28] The very next day, while chairing my own session, I leaned on that advice. Instead of diving into debate, I paused, restated the question, and asked the group to continue the discussion asynchronously.</p>



<p>[00:05:09] The result? We left the room with clear decisions and owners for next steps.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why Non-Coders Are Essential 



<p>[00:05:19] Here’s the truth: non-coders bring incredible value to standards development.</p>



<p>[00:05:31] Examples include:</p>



 
 Turning pain points into crisp user stories 



 Writing clear summaries for product managers, executives, and legal teams 



 Triage work: labeling GitHub issues, closing duplicates, organizing proposals 



 Spotting interoperability gaps between specifications 



 Setting up test plans and documenting blockers 



 “Herding cats” by taking notes and tracking decisions 
 



<p>[00:06:44] None of these require writing code — but all are vital to progress.</p>



 



 *** 



 How to Get Started in Standards Work 



<p>[00:06:58] If you’re wondering where to begin, here are practical steps:</p>



 
 Read the group’s charter and skim recent issues to understand scope 



 Introduce yourself on the mailing list — even a short message offering to scribe is welcome 



 Ask the chairs directly what one thing you could do this week to help 



 Observe consensus calls to learn how experienced chairs guide groups 
 



<p>[00:08:20] These small steps build confidence and help you learn core chairing skills: listening, documenting, and facilitating decisions.</p>



 



 *** 



 Advice for Managers 



<p>[00:08:31] If you lead a team, don’t assume only senior engineers should join standards groups.</p>



<p>Send your:</p>



 
 Product managers 



 Solution architects 



 Analysts 



 Technical writers 
 



<p>[00:08:56] Give them specific assignments like drafting use cases, cleaning up issues, or tracking interoperability progress. Measure outcomes such as:</p>



 
 Fewer rehash meetings 



 Closed issues and pull requests 



 Documented progress 
 



<p>[00:09:23] This builds institutional knowledge in your organization while helping the group succeed.</p>



 



 *** 



 Common Traps to Avoid 



<p>[00:09:31] Even experienced chairs fall into these traps:</p>



 
 Wearing your company hat too heavily 



 Turning meetings into tutorials that eat time 



 Letting the loudest voice set direction instead of true consensus 



 Treating silence as consent instead of seeking explicit signals 
 



<p>[00:11:04] A simple checklist can help avoid these pitfalls:</p>



 
 Post agendas in advance 



 Share pre-reads 



 Assign a scribe and timekeeper 
 



<p>It’s basic, but it works.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why This Matters 



<p>[00:11:30] Standards work touches every part of digital identity — from federation to credentials, browsers to payments.</p>



<p>[00:11:46] But if only engineers show up, critical perspectives are lost. That hurts usability, interoperability, and adoption.</p>



<p>[00:11:57] You don’t need to be the smartest engineer in the room to contribute. You just need to listen, ask questions, and help the group reach decisions.</p>



 



 *** 



 Final Thoughts 



<p>[00:12:10] If you’ve thought “standards development isn’t for me,” I challenge you to reconsider.</p>



<p>Show up once.<br>Scribe a meeting.<br>Draft a use case.<br>Or, if you lead a team, send someone who can write, listen, and help keep things moving.</p>



<p>[00:12:26] These are the skills that keep standards work healthy.</p>



<p>[00:12:30] So ask yourself: What non-coding skill could you bring into a working group this month?</p>



<p>[00:12:48] Thank you for listening to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>

Trust Crisis in Stablecoins<p>The biggest challenge in scaling stablecoin payments isn’t speed. It’s&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Stablecoins are everywhere. They’re powering remittances, cross-border commerce, crypto payroll, and even merchant checkout systems. From Stripe to Shopify to major exchanges, stablecoin adoption is accelerating.</p><p>But while blockchains have solved the problem of speed and cost, they’ve quietly ignored the biggest bottleneck in real-world use: identity.</p><p>If stablecoins are going to scale globally, across regions, merchants and users, they need more than fast rails. They need a decentralized identity&nbsp;layer.</p> The Problem With Stablecoin Compliance Today <p>Most stable coins weren’t built with compliance in mind. And now that they’re being used in payments, cracks are&nbsp;showing.</p>  Merchants don’t know who they’re accepting money&nbsp;from  Platforms are duct-taping KYC providers into&nbsp;apps  Users go through verification again and&nbsp;again  There’s no standard for crypto KYC that works across wallets, bridges, and&nbsp;dApps  <p>The result? A fragile trust layer built on centralized data silos and repetitive identity checks. The exact same problems crypto was supposed to&nbsp;solve.</p> Stablecoin Payments Need Verifiable Identity, Not Just&nbsp;Wallets. <p>Verifiable Identity is the missing layer in the stablecoin stack.</p><p>As governments push for stablecoin regulation such as MiCA in the EU and the GENIUS Act in the US, platforms are scrambling to become compliant.</p><p>But compliance doesn’t have to mean surveillance.</p><p>With decentralized identity, users can hold their own credentials, verify once, and move between apps and services without repeating KYC. This is the foundation for self-sovereign identity, where users control their data and platforms remain compliant without storing sensitive information.</p> What’s Needed: A Portable, Privacy-First Trust&nbsp;Layer <p>Stablecoin adoption at scale will only happen if three things become possible:</p>  Users prove who they are without exposing everything  Merchants can verify transactions without handling private&nbsp;data  Developers can plug into identity infrastructure that works cross-chain  <p>That’s what Ontology is building. A modular identity and privacy framework that makes stablecoin payments secure, compliant, and user-controlled.</p> Ontology: The Identity Infrastructure for Stablecoin Adoption <p>Unlike issuers, Ontology isn’t creating another dollar-pegged token. We’re building the trust infrastructure that makes stablecoins usable in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Here’s what that looks&nbsp;like:</p>  DID-based KYC that users&nbsp;control  Zero Knowledge Proofs to verify facts without revealing data  Reusable identity credentials for wallets, dApps, and fiat&nbsp;on-ramps  Cross-border compliance without centralized trust  <p>This infrastructure goes beyond payments. The next era of Web3 relies on a rebuilding of the crypto identity infrastructure.</p> The Future of Stablecoin Compliance is User-Controlled <p>If stablecoins want to compete with traditional infrastructure, they can’t just be faster. They have to be trusted. And that trust can’t be outsourced to centralized APIs or third party data&nbsp;silos.</p><p>It has to be built into the protocol layer and embedded in how users verify themselves, how dApps authorize transactions, and how compliance gets done in a decentralized world.</p><p>Speed is solved. Identity isn’t. Ontology is solving&nbsp;it.</p> About Ontology <p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> is a high-performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data infrastructure.

<p>Capital markets firms face unique AML challenges across jurisdictions due to their cross-border activity and high-risk products. This article outlines key KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML expectations in the U.S., UK, EU, and other financial centre – and how iComply helps automate compliance workflows with speed and precision.</p>
 
 Global capital markets are fast, fluid, and increasingly regulated. Broker-dealers, custodians, exchanges, and asset managers operate across jurisdictions where expectations for AML, sanctions screening, and beneficial ownership verification continue to grow. 
<p>In high-risk sectors like trading, custody, private placements, and tokenization, regulators want more than just client onboarding—they expect continuous monitoring, automated escalation, and clear audit trails.</p>
 
 AML Frameworks Shaping the Sector 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: SEC, FINRA, FinCEN 
 Requirements: CDD Rule, ongoing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, sanctions screening (OFAC) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: CDD/EDD, transaction monitoring, PEP screening, audit logs, and AML controls under MLR 2017 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: ESMA, local NCAs 
 Requirements: 6AMLD, MiCA (for tokenized assets), UBO verification, and harmonized AML rules under AMLA (in progress) 
 
 Switzerland &amp; Luxembourg 
 
 Regulators: FINMA, CSSF 
 Requirements: KYC/AML for securities and fund transactions, strong data protection, and beneficial ownership transparency 
 
 
 Key Compliance Tasks 
<p>Capital markets participants must:</p>
 
 Verify legal entities and individuals across onboarding and lifecycle events 
 Monitor transactions for anomalies or regulatory breaches 
 Screen all clients against sanctions, PEP, and adverse media lists 
 Capture beneficial ownership for institutional and private placements 
 Log decisions and escalate based on internal risk policies 
 
 
 Industry-Specific Challenges 
<p>1. Cross-border account flows → Require localized data handling and multilingual tools</p>
<p>2. Institutional onboarding → Often slow due to document-heavy workflows and complex UBO structures</p>
<p>3. Layered due diligence → Multiple parties, custodians, and intermediaries complicate audit trails</p>
<p>4. Tokenized and digital assets → Face rapidly evolving rules under MiCA, AMLD, and SEC guidance</p>
 
 How iComply Accelerates AML for Capital Markets 
<p>iComply provides a secure, modular platform that streamlines compliance from onboarding to monitoring:</p>
 1. KYB + UBO Automation

 On-device processing for secure and compliant identity checks 
 
 3. Transaction Monitoring (KYT) 
 
 Score trades and transactions by geography, frequency, value, and behavioural anomalies 
 Custom rules for escalations and risk segmentation 
 
 4. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Combine onboarding, AML, and due diligence into a unified audit trail 
 Assign reviews, manage escalations, and export regulatory reports 
 
 5. Flexible Deployment 
 
 On-premise, private cloud, or hybrid environments

Please check the full article for more details: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4">https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4</a></p><p>물론입니다. 팀은 3분기 목표를 향해 순조롭게 진행 중입니다. 다만 구체적인 날짜는 공개하지 않았습니다. 모든 디지털 제품과 마찬가지로, 준비가 완벽히 끝났을 때 출시하기&nbsp;위함입니다.</p><p>퍼블릭 메인넷이 공식 런칭됐습니다! 자세한 내용은 전체 공지를 확인해 주세요: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4">https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4</a></p> 3. Why don’t we give a specific schedule/date? <p>Digital releases don’t require fixed launch dates like physical products (e.g., movies, retail). Avoids pressure that can lead to mistakes, citing the Columbia Shuttle disaster as an example of deadline-driven risk. Launch will be announced when ready, ensuring fairness and transparency to all participants simultaneously.</p><p>출시 일자는 유연하게 설정하여 충분히 준비가 완료된 후에 진행하는 것이 무엇보다 중요합니다. NASA 콜롬비아호 사고 역시 일정 압박이 한 원인이 된 사례로 자주 언급됩니다. HPP는 모든 준비가 철저히 마무리된 시점에, 모든 참여자에게 공정하고 투명하게 동시에 출시 사실을 알리는 방식으로&nbsp;진행됩니다.</p> 4. Are we going to do buybacks? <p>Buybacks are usually done by companies with revenue or exchanges tied to trading volume. HPP is performing strongly compared to the CMC100, even in a tough&nbsp;market.</p><p>Additional Context</p><p>Buybacks are more of a market signal than a sustainable growth strategy. They are often tied to short-term campaigns or exchange-driven burn mechanisms, which can create only temporary price support without strengthening the fundamentals. The reality is that their impact tends to be limited and short-lived, making them less effective for long-term ecosystem growth. Our approach is different. We aim to ensure that value stems from genuine fundamentals and usage, rather than from market engineering.</p><p>바이백은 보통 매출을 내는 기업이나 거래량과 연결된 거래소에서 진행합니다. HPP는 어려운 시장 환경 속에서도 CMC100 대비 강한 성과를 내고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>추가 설명</p><p>바이백은 장기적 성장 전략보다는 시장에 “신호”를 주는 성격이 강합니다. 단기 캠페인이나 거래소 주도의 소각 메커니즘과 연결되는 경우가 많으며, 일시적인 가격 지지 효과를 내지만 근본적인 가치 강화에는 기여하지 못합니다. 즉, 효과는 제한적이고 단명하는 경우가 대부분입니다. HPP의 접근 방식은 다릅니다. 우리는 인위적인 시장 개입이 아니라, 토큰의 실제 사용성·펀더멘털·생태계 확장을 통해 지속적인 가치를 만들어가고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> 5. Why doesn’t HPP pump with other&nbsp;tokens? <p>HPP has outperformed the CMC100 over 12 months and the past 5 months. Movement doesn’t always align with BTC/ETH, which are influenced by ETFs and macro&nbsp;flows.</p><p>HPP는 지난 12개월과 최근 5개월 동안 CMC100보다 우수한 성과를 보여왔습니다. 단, 움직임이 항상 BTC/ETH와 일치하지는 않습니다. BTC와 ETH는 ETF나 거시경제 자금 흐름 등 외부 요인에 더 큰 영향을&nbsp;받습니다.</p> 6. What are cryptocurrency investment agents (on the roadmap)? <p>The specific product details are not disclosed yet. However, the vision and target direction have already been introduced under ArenAI. ArenAI will serve as an intelligent, AI-driven trading and asset management layer, enabling users to interact with DeFi and exchange platforms through natural language, agent automation, and portfolio optimization.</p><p>For more background and context, please refer to our previous article on ArenAI, which outlines the concept and future potential of this product: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2">https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2</a></p><p>구체적인 제품 내용은 아직 공개되지 않았습니다. 하지만 방향성은 이미 ArenAI를 통해 제시되었습니다. ArenAI는 AI 기반의 지능형 자산 관리 및 트레이딩 레이어로, 사용자들이 자연어 인터페이스, 자동화된 에이전트, 포트폴리오 최적화를 통해 DeFi 및 거래소와 상호작용할 수 있도록&nbsp;설계됩니다.</p><p>자세한 내용은 ArenAI에 관한 이전 아티클을 참고해 주세요: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2">https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2</a></p> 7. Updates on Upleat collaboration and stablecoin? <p>Aergo(HPP) provides tech infrastructure to Blocko and enterprise clients. No direct connection to the referenced stablecoin announcement.</p><p>Additional Context</p><p>Stablecoins are more than just blockchain-based technology. They interface directly with monetary policy tools, such as M1 (currency in circulation plus demand deposits) and M2, meaning their issuance may affect the real-world money supply and economic dynamics. That is why any project launching a stablecoin without operating within the bounds of formal governmental frameworks, such as Korea’s K-BTF (Korea-Blockchain Trust Framework), runs the risk of being inconsequential. These frameworks are crucial for establishing trust, gaining legal recognition, and integrating with national payment&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Without adherence to such regulatory and policy frameworks, a stablecoin project may technically function, but it will lack the necessary legitimacy, operational resilience, and broader institutional acceptance. To be meaningful, stablecoins must not only run on code but also align with economic infrastructure and compliance standards.</p><p>Aergo(HPP)는 Blocko와 엔터프라이즈 클라이언트들에게 기술 인프라를 제공합니다. 하지만 이번에 언급된 스테이블코인 발표와 직접적인 연결은&nbsp;없습니다.</p><p>추가 설명</p><p>스테이블코인은 단순한 블록체인 기술이 아니라 통화정책 도구(M1, M2 등)와 직접 연결됩니다. 즉, 발행은 실제 화폐 공급과 경제 역학에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 그렇기 때문에 한국의 K-BTF(Korea-Blockchain Trust Framework) 같은 정부 주도의 제도적 틀 안에서 운영되지 않는 스테이블코인 프로젝트는 실질적 의미가 크게 제한될 수밖에&nbsp;없습니다.</p><p>이러한 제도적·정책적 프레임워크는 신뢰 확보, 법적 인정, 국가 결제 시스템과의 통합을 위해 반드시 필요합니다. 이런 기반이 없다면 스테이블코인은 기술적으로는 작동할 수 있어도 제도적 정당성, 운영 회복력, 기관 차원의 수용성을 확보하지 못합니다. 진정한 의미의 스테이블코인은 코드만으로 존재하는 것이 아니라, 경제 인프라와 규제 준수 기준에 맞추어야&nbsp;합니다.</p> Closing <p>The session closed with reminders that no universal solution exists to “make a token pump.” The team continues to deliver milestones on time, with the imminent launch of the Public&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>이번 세션은 “토큰 가격을 펌핑시킬 수 있는 보편적 해법은 없다”는 점을 다시 확인하며 마무리되었습니다. 팀은 퍼블릭 메인넷을 비롯한 주요 마일스톤을 계획대로 달성해나가고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-21-public-mainnet-buybacks-and-arenai-4d71e7046c14">[Aergo Talks #21] Public Mainnet, buybacks, and ArenAI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
