  <p>Summary</p>
<p>In this episode, Simon and David discuss the convergence of identity and cybersecurity, particularly in the context of cloud adoption. They explore the challenges and opportunities that arise from this convergence and the impact on organizations of different sizes. They also touch on the confusion caused by the abundance of acronyms in the industry and the need for clarity and standardization. Overall, they emphasize the importance of protecting identity components and the critical role of identity in security. The conversation explores the challenges and opportunities in the identity and access management (IAM) space, with a focus on the importance of data management and the need for effective discovery and remediation processes. The fragmentation of identity systems and the lack of visibility into identities and their interactions are identified as key issues. The acquisition of Q Radar by Palo Alto is discussed as a potential game-changer in the IAM space. The conversation concludes with the recognition that while automation and AI have their place, human involvement is still crucial for effective remediation.</p>

 Creating seamless experiences for skeptical users 



<p>It’s been a swift shift toward a ubiquitous use of AI. Early iterations of e-commerce used traditional AI <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/07/how-to-design-an-ai-marketing-strategy%22%20/t%20%22_blank">largely to create dynamic marketing campaigns</a>, improve the online shopping experience, or triage customer requests. Today the technology’s advanced capabilities encourage widespread adoption. AI can be integrated into every touchpoint across the commerce journey. According to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo">recent report from the IBM Institute for Business Value</a>, half of CEOs are integrating generative AI into products and services. Meanwhile, 43% are using the technology to inform strategic decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But customers aren’t yet completely on board. Fluency with AI has grown along with the rollout of ChatGPT and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent">virtual assistants</a> like Amazon’s Alexa. But as businesses around the globe rapidly adopt the technology to augment processes from merchandising to order management, there is some risk. High-profile failures and expensive litigation threatens to sour public opinion and cripple the promise of generative AI-powered commerce technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI’s impact on the social media landscape<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/generative-ai-social-media-integration-dangers-disinformation-addiction/673940/%22%20/t%20%22_blank"> garners occasional bad press.</a> Disapproval of brands or retailers that use AI is as high as 38% among older generations, requiring businesses to work harder to gain their trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ai-retail?">report</a> from the IBM Institute of Business Value found that there’s enormous room for improvement in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a>. Only 14% of surveyed consumers described themselves as “satisfied” with their experience purchasing goods online. A full one-third of consumers found their early customer support and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbot</a> experiences that use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a> so disappointing that they didn’t want to engage with the technology again. And the centrality of these experiences isn’t limited to B2C vendors. Over 90% of business <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/customer-experience/">buyers say a company’s customer experience is as important as what it sells</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poorly run implementations of traditional or generative AI technology in commerce—such as deploying deep learning models trained on inadequate or inappropriate data—lead to bad experiences that alienate both consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid this, it’s crucial for businesses to carefully plan and design <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a> initiatives that prioritize the needs and preferences of their customers, whether they are consumers or B2B buyers. By doing so, brands can create contextually relevant personalized buying experiences, seamless and friction-free, which foster customer loyalty and trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article explores four transformative use cases for AI in commerce that are already enhancing the customer journey, especially in the e-commerce business and e-commerce platform components of the overall omnichannel experience. It also discusses how forward-thinking companies can effectively integrate AI algorithms to usher in a new era of intelligent commerce experiences for both consumers and brands. But none of these use cases exist in a vacuum. As the future of commerce unfolds, each use case interacts holistically to transform the customer journey from end-to-end–for customers, for employees, and for their partners. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Use case 1: AI for modernization and business model expansion 



<p>AI-powered tools can be incredibly valuable in optimizing and modernizing business operations throughout the customer journey, but it is critical in the commerce continuum. By using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms and big data analytics, AI can uncover patterns, correlations and trends that might escape human analysts. These capabilities can help businesses make informed decisions, improve operational efficiencies, and identify opportunities for growth. The applications of AI in commerce are vast and varied. They include:</p>



 Dynamic content 



<p>Traditional AI fuels recommendation engines that suggest products based on customer purchase history and customer preferences, creating personalized experiences that result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Experience building strategies like these <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/07/how-to-design-an-ai-marketing-strategy">have been  used by online retailers for years</a>. Today, generative AI enables dynamic customer segmentation and profiling. This segmentation activates personalized product recommendations and suggestions, such as product bundles and upsells, that adapt to individual customer behavior and preferences, resulting in higher engagement and conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>



 Commerce operations 



<p>Traditional AI allows for the automation of routine tasks such as inventory management, order processing and fulfillment optimization, resulting in increased efficiency and cost savings. Generative AI activates predictive analytics and forecasting, enabling businesses to anticipate and respond to changes in demand, reducing stockouts and overstocking, and improving supply chain resilience. It can also significantly impact real-time fraud detection and prevention, minimizing financial losses and improving customer trust. &nbsp;</p>



 Business model expansion 



<p>Both traditional and generative AI have pivotal and functions that can redefine business models. They can, for example, enable the seamless integration of a marketplace platform where AI-driven algorithms match supply with demand, effectively connecting sellers and buyers across different geographic areas and market segments. Generative AI can also enable new forms of commerce—such as voice commerce, social commerce and experiential commerce—that provide customers with seamless and personalized shopping experiences. </p>



<p>Traditional AI can enhance international purchasing by automating tasks such as currency conversions and tax calculations. It can also facilitate compliance with local regulations, streamlining the logistics of cross-border transactions. </p>



<p>However, generative AI can create value by generating multilingual support and personalized marketing content. These tools adapt content to the cultural and linguistic nuances of different regions, offering a more contextually relevant experience for international customers and consumers.&nbsp;</p>



 Use case 2: AI for dynamic product experience management (PXM) 



<p>Using the power of AI, brands can revolutionize their product experience management and user experience by delivering personalized, engaging and seamless experiences at every touchpoint in commerce. These tools can manage content, standardize product information, and drive personalization. With AI, brands can create a product experience that informs, validates and builds the confidence necessary for conversion. Some ways to use relevant personalization by transforming product experience management include:&nbsp;</p>



 Intelligent content management 



<p>Generative AI can revolutionize content management by automating the creation, classification and optimization of product content. Unlike traditional AI, which analyzes and categorizes existing content, generative AI can create new content tailored to individual customers. This content includes product descriptions, images, videos and even interactive experiences. By using generative AI, brands can save time and resources while simultaneously delivering high-quality, engaging content that resonates with their target audience. Generative AI can also help brands maintain consistency across all touchpoints, ensuring that product information is accurate, up-to-date and optimized for conversions. </p>



 Hyperpersonalization 



<p>Generative AI can take personalization to the next level by creating customized experiences that are tailored to individual customers. By analyzing customer data and customer queries, generative AI can create personalized product recommendations, offers and content that are more likely to drive conversions. </p>



<p>Unlike traditional AI, which can only segment customers based on predefined criteria, generative AI can create unique experiences for each customer, considering their preferences, behavior and interests. Such personalization is crucial as organizations adopt software-as-a-service (SaaS) models more frequently: Global subscription-model billing is expected to double over the next six years, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/subscription-business-model">and most consumers say those models help them feel more connected to a business.</a> With AI’s potential for hyperpersonalization, those subscription-based consumer experiences can vastly improve. These experiences result in higher engagement, increased customer satisfaction, and ultimately, higher sales.&nbsp;</p>



 Experiential product information 



<p>Al tools allow individuals to learn more about products through processes like visual search, taking a photograph of an item to learn more about it. Generative AI takes these capabilities further, transforming product information by creating interactive, immersive experiences that help customers better understand products and make informed purchasing decisions. For example, generative AI can create 360-degree product views, interactive product demos, and virtual try-on capabilities. These experiences provide a richer product understanding and help brands differentiate themselves from competitors and build trust with potential customers. Unlike traditional AI, which provides static product information, generative AI can create engaging, memorable experiences that drive conversions and build brand loyalty. &nbsp;</p>



 Smart search and recommendations 



<p>Generative AI can revolutionize search engines and recommendations by providing customers with personalized, contextualized results that match their intent and preferences. Unlike traditional AI, which relies on keyword matching, generative AI can understand natural language and intent, providing customers with relevant results that are more likely to match their search queries. Generative AI can also create recommendations that are based on individual customer behavior, preferences and interests, resulting in higher engagement and increased sales. By using generative AI, brands can deliver intelligent search and recommendation capabilities that enhance the overall product experience and drive conversions.&nbsp;</p>



 Use case 3: AI for order intelligence&nbsp; 



<p>Generative AI and automation can allow businesses to make data-driven decisions to streamline processes across the supply chain, reducing inefficiency and waste. For example, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/digitizing-mid-and-last-mile-logistics-handovers-to-reduce-waste%22%20/t%20%22_blank">a recent analysis</a> from McKinsey found that nearly 20% of logistics costs could stem from “blind handoffs”—the moment a shipment is dropped at some point between the manufacturer and its intended location. According to the McKinsey report, these inefficient interactions might amount to as much as $95 billion in losses in the United States every year. AI-powered order intelligence can reduce some of these inefficiencies by using:&nbsp;</p>



 Order orchestration and fulfillment optimization 



<p>By considering factors such as inventory availability, location proximity, shipping costs and delivery preferences, AI tools can dynamically select the most cost-effective and efficient fulfillment options for an individual order. These tools might dictate the priority of deliveries, predict order routing, or dispatch deliveries to comply with sustainability requirements. &nbsp;</p>



 Demand forecasting 



<p>By analyzing historical data, AI can predict demand and help businesses optimize their inventory levels and minimize excess, reducing costs and improving efficiency. Real-time inventory updates allow businesses to adapt quickly to changing conditions, allowing for effective resource allocation.</p>



 Inventory transparency and order accuracy 



<p>AI-powered order management systems provide real-time visibility into all aspects of the critical order management workflow. These tools enable companies to proactively identify potential disruptions and mitigate risks. This visibility helps customers and consumers trust that their orders will be delivered exactly when and how they were promised.&nbsp;</p>



 Use case 4: AI for payments and security&nbsp; 



<p>Intelligent payments enhance the payment and security process, improving efficiency and accuracy. Such technologies can help process, manage and secure digital transactions—and provide advance warning of potential risks and the possibility of fraud. </p>



 Intelligent payments 



<p>Traditional and generative AI both enhance transaction processes for B2C and B2B customers making purchases in online stores. Traditional AI optimizes POS systems, automates new payment methods, and facilitates multiple payment solutions across channels, streamlining operations and improving consumer experiences. Generative AI creates dynamic payment models for B2B customers, addressing their complex transactions with customized invoicing and predictive behaviors. The technology can also provide strategic and personalized financial solutions. Also, generative AI can enhance B2C customer payments by creating personalized and dynamic pricing strategies.&nbsp;</p>



 Risk management and fraud detection 



<p>Traditional AI and machine learning excel in processing vast volumes of B2C and B2B payments, enabling businesses to identify and respond to suspicious trends swiftly. Traditional AI automates the detection of irregular patterns and potential fraud, reducing the need for costly human analysis. Meanwhile, generative AI contributes by simulating various fraud scenarios to predict and prevent new types of fraudulent activities before they occur, enhancing the overall security of payment systems.&nbsp;</p>



 Compliance and data privacy 



<p>In the commerce journey, traditional AI helps secure transaction data and automates compliance with payment regulations, enabling businesses to quickly adapt to new financial laws and conduct ongoing audits of payment processes. Generative AI further enhances these capabilities by developing predictive models that anticipate changes in payment regulations. It can also automate intricate data privacy measures, helping businesses to maintain compliance and protect customer data efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



 The future of AI in commerce is based on trust&nbsp; 



<p>Today’s commercial landscape is swiftly transforming into a digitally interconnected ecosystem. In this reality, the integration of generative AI across omnichannel commerce—both B2B and B2C—is essential. However, for this integration to be successful, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/business-trends-2024">trust must be at the core</a> of its implementation. Identifying the right moments in the commerce journey for AI integration is also crucial. Companies need to conduct comprehensive audits of their existing workflows to make sure AI innovations are both effective and sensitive to consumer expectations. Introducing AI solutions transparently and with robust data security measures is imperative. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses must approach the introduction of trusted generative AI as an opportunity to enhance the customer experience by making it more personalized, conversational and responsive. This requires a clear strategy that prioritizes human-centric values and builds trust through consistent, observable interactions that demonstrate the value and reliability of AI enhancements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking forward, trusted AI redefines customer interactions, enabling businesses to meet their clients precisely where they are, with a level of personalization previously unattainable. By working with AI systems that are reliable, secure and aligned with customer needs and business outcomes, companies can forge deeper, trust-based relationships. These relationships are essential for long-term engagement and will be essential to every business’s future commerce success, growth and, ultimately, their viability.</p>

<p>Business leaders worldwide are asking their teams the same question: “Are we using the cloud effectively?” This quandary often comes with an accompanying worry: “Are we spending too much money on cloud computing?” Given the statistics—82% of surveyed respondents in a 2023 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/511283/worldwide-survey-cloud-computing-risks/">Statista study</a> cited managing cloud spend as a significant challenge—it’s a legitimate concern.</p>



<p>Concerns around security, governance and lack of resources and expertise also top the list of respondents’ concerns. Cloud maturity models are a useful tool for addressing these concerns, grounding organizational cloud strategy and proceeding confidently in cloud adoption with a plan.</p>



<p>Cloud maturity models (or CMMs) are frameworks for evaluating an organization’s cloud adoption readiness on both a macro and individual service level. They help an organization assess how effectively it is using cloud services and resources and how cloud services and security can be improved.</p>



 Why move to cloud? 



<p>Organizations face increased pressure to move to the cloud in a world of real-time metrics, microservices and APIs, all of which benefit from the flexibility and scalability of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>. An examination of cloud capabilities and maturity is a key component of this digital transformation and cloud adoption presents tremendous upside. McKinsey believes it presents a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/getting-ahead-in-the-cloud">USD 3 trillion opportunity</a> and nearly all of responding cloud leaders &nbsp;(99%) view the cloud as the cornerstone of their digital strategy, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/cloud-strategy-innovation-survey-report.html">according to a Deloitte study</a>.</p>



<p>A successful cloud strategy requires a comprehensive assessment of cloud maturity. This assessment is used to identify the actions—such as upgrading legacy tech and adjusting organizational workflows—that the organization needs to take to fully realize cloud benefits and pinpoint current shortcomings. CMMs are a great tool for this assessment.</p>



<p>There are many CMMs in practice and organizations must decide what works best for their business needs. A good starting point for many organizations is to engage in a three-phase assessment of cloud maturity using the following models: a cloud adoption maturity model, a cloud security maturity model and a cloud-native maturity model.</p>



 Cloud adoption maturity model 



<p>This maturity model helps measure an organization’s cloud maturity in aggregate. It identifies the technologies and internal knowledge that an organization has, how suited its culture is to embrace managed services, the experience of its DevOps team, the initiatives it can begin to migrate to cloud and more. Progress along these levels is linear, so an organization must complete one stage before moving to the next stage.</p>



 
 Legacy: Organizations at the beginning of their journey will have no cloud-ready applications or workloads, cloud services or cloud infrastructure. 



 Ad hoc: Next is ad hoc maturity, which likely means the organization has begun its journey through cloud technologies like infrastructure as a service&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas">IaaS)</a>, the lowest-level control of resources in the cloud. IaaS customers receive compute, network and storage resources on an on-demand, over the internet, pay-as-you-go pricing basis. 



 Repeatable: Organizations at this stage have begun to make more investments in the cloud. This might include establishing a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) and examining the scalability of initial cloud investments. Most importantly, the organization has now created repeatable processes for moving apps, workstreams and data to the cloud. 



 Optimized: Cloud environments are now working efficiently and every new use case follows the same foundation set forth by the organdization. 



 Cloud-advanced: The organization now has most, if not all, of its workstreams on the cloud. Everything runs seamlessly and efficiently and all stakeholders are aware of the cloud’s potential to drive business objectives. 
 



 Cloud security maturity model 



<p>The optimization of security is paramount for any organization that moves to the cloud. The cloud <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/is-the-cloud-more-secure-or-less-secure/">can be more secure</a> than on-premises data centers, thanks to robust policies and postures used by cloud providers. Prioritizing cloud security is important considering that public cloud-based breaches often take months to correct and can have serious financial and reputational consequences.</p>



<p>Cloud security represents a partnership between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the client. CSPs provide certifications on the security inherent in their offerings, but clients that build in the cloud can introduce misconfigurations or other issues when they build on top of the cloud infrastructure. So CSPs and clients must work together to create and maintain secure environments.</p>



<p>The Cloud Security Alliance, of which IBM® is a member, has a <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2022/04/22/four-ways-to-use-the-cloud-security-maturity-model/">widely adopted</a> cloud security maturity model (CSMM). The model provides good foundation for organizations looking to better embed security into their cloud environments.</p>



<p>Organizations may not want or need to adopt the entire model, but can use whichever components make sense. The model’s five stages revolve around the organization’s level of security automation.</p>



 
 No automation: Security professionals identify and address incidents and problems manually through dashboards. 
 



 
 Simple SecOps: This phase includes some <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure-as-code">infrastructure-as-code</a> (IaC) deployments and federation on some accounts. 
 



 
 Manually executed scripts: This phase incorporates more federation and multi-factor authentication (MFA), although most <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> is still executed manually. 
 



 
 Guardrails: It includes a larger library of automation expanding into multiple account guardrails, which are high-level governance policies for the cloud environment. 



 Automation everywhere: This is when everything is integrated into IaC and MFA and federation usage is pervasive. 
 



 Cloud-native maturity models 



<p>The first two maturity models refer more to an organization’s overall readiness; the cloud-native maturity model (CNMM) is used to evaluate an organization’s ability to create apps (whether built internally or through open source tooling) and workloads that are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a>. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/cloud-strategy-innovation-survey-report.html">According to Deloitte,</a> 87% of cloud leaders embrace cloud-native development.</p>



<p>As with other models, business leaders should first understand their business goals before diving into this model. These objectives will help determine what stage of maturity is necessary for the organization. Business leaders also need to look at their existing enterprise applications and decide which <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">cloud migration strategy</a> is most appropriate.</p>



<p>Most “lifted and shifted” apps can operate in a cloud environment but might not to reap the full benefits of cloud. Cloud mature organizations often decide it’s most effective to build cloud-native applications for their most important tools and services.</p>



<p>The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has put forth its own model.</p>



 
 Level 1 – Build: An organization is in pre-production related to one proof of concept (POC) application and currently has limited organizational support. Business leaders understand the benefits of cloud native and, though new to the technology, team members have basic technical understanding. 
 



 
 Level 2 – Operate: Teams are investing in training and new skills and SMEs are emerging within the organization. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> practice is being developed, bringing together cloud engineers and developer groups. With this organizational change, new teams are being defined, agile project groups created and feedback and testing loops established. 
 



 
 Level 3 – Scale: Cloud-native strategy is now the preferred approach. Competency is growing, there is increased stakeholder buy-in and cloud-native has become a primary focus. The organization is beginning to implement shift-left policies and actively training all employees on security initiatives. This level is often characterized by a high degree of centralization and clear delineation of responsibilities, however bottlenecks in the process emerge and velocity might decrease. 



 Level 4 – Improve: At level 4, the cloud is the default infrastructure for all services. There is full commitment from leadership and team focus revolves heavily around cloud cost optimization. The organization explores areas to improve and processes that can be made more efficient. Cloud expertise and responsibilities are shifting from developers to all employees through self-service tools. Multiple groups have adopted Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications.&nbsp; With a strong, established platform, the decentralization process can begin in earnest. 



 Level 5 – Optimize: At this stage, the business has full trust in the technology team and employees company-wide are onboarded to the cloud-native environment. Service ownership is established and distributed to self-sufficient teams. DevOps and DevSecOps are operational, highly skilled and fully scaled. Teams are comfortable with experimentation and skilled in using data to inform business decisions. Accurate data practices boost optimization efforts and enables the organization to further adopt FinOps practices. Operations are smooth, goals outlined in the initial phase have been achieved and the organization has a flexible platform that suits its needs. 
 



 What’s best for my organization? 



<p>An organization’s cloud maturity level dictates which benefits and to what degree it stands to gain from a move to the cloud. Not every organization will reach, or want to reach, the top level of maturity in each, or all, of the three models discussed here. However, it’s likely that organizations will find it difficult to compete without some level of cloud maturity, since 70% of workloads will be on the cloud by 2024, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/doc/774666-approaches-to-avoid-common-cloud-strategy-pitfalls">according to Gartner</a>.</p>



<p>The more mature an organization’s cloud infrastructure, security and cloud-native application posture, the more the cloud becomes advantageous. With a thorough examination of current cloud capabilities and a plan to improve maturity moving forward, an organization can increase the efficiency of its cloud spend and maximize cloud benefits.</p>

<p>Organizations today are both empowered and overwhelmed by data. This paradox lies at the heart of modern business strategy: while there’s an unprecedented amount of data available, unlocking actionable insights requires more than access to numbers.</p>



<p>The push to enhance productivity, use resources wisely, and boost sustainability through data-driven decision-making is stronger than ever. Yet, the low adoption rates of business intelligence (BI) tools present a significant hurdle.</p>



<p>According to Gartner, although the number of employees that use analytics and business intelligence (ABI) has increased in 87% of surveyed organizations, ABI is still used by only 29% of employees on average. Despite the clear benefits of BI, <a href="https://www.eckerson.com/articles/new-study-identifies-drivers-of-bi-and-analytics-adoption-in-companies-today">the percentage of employees actively using ABI tools has seen minimal growth over the past 7 years</a>. So why aren’t more people using BI tools?</p>



 Understanding the low adoption rate 



<p>The low adoption rate of traditional BI tools, particularly dashboards, is a multifaceted issue rooted in both the inherent limitations of these tools and the evolving needs of modern businesses. Here’s a deeper look into why these challenges might persist and what it means for users across an organization:</p>



 1. Complexity and lack of accessibility 



 



<p>While excellent for displaying consolidated data views, dashboards often present a steep learning curve. This complexity makes them less accessible to nontechnical users, who might find these tools intimidating or overly complex for their needs. Moreover, the static nature of traditional dashboards means they are not built to adapt quickly to changes in data or business conditions without manual updates or redesigns.</p>



 2. Limited scope for actionable insights 



<p>Dashboards typically provide high-level summaries or snapshots of data, which are useful for quick status checks but often insufficient for making business decisions. They tend to offer limited guidance on what actions to take next, lacking the context needed to derive actionable, decision-ready insights. This can leave decision-makers feeling unsupported, as they need more than just data; they need insights that directly inform action.</p>



 3. The “unknown unknowns” 



<p>A significant barrier to BI adoption is the challenge of not knowing what questions to ask or what data might be relevant. Dashboards are static and require users to come with specific queries or metrics in mind. Without knowing what to look for, business analysts can miss critical insights, making dashboards less effective for exploratory data analysis and real-time decision-making.</p>



 Moving beyond one-size-fits-all: The evolution of dashboards 



<p>While traditional dashboards have served us well, they are no longer sufficient on their own. The world of BI is shifting toward integrated and personalized tools that understand what each user needs. This isn’t just about being user-friendly; it’s about making these tools vital parts of daily decision-making processes for everyone, not just for those with technical expertise.</p>



<p>Emerging technologies such as generative AI (gen AI) are enhancing BI tools with capabilities that were once only available to data professionals. These new tools are more adaptive, providing personalized BI experiences that deliver contextually relevant insights users can trust and act upon immediately. We’re moving away from the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional dashboards to more dynamic, customized analytics experiences. These tools are designed to guide users effortlessly from data discovery to actionable decision-making, enhancing their ability to act on insights with confidence.</p>



 The future of BI: Making advanced analytics accessible to all 



<p>As we look toward the future, ease of use and personalization are set to redefine the trajectory of BI.</p>



 1. Emphasizing ease of use 



 



<p>The new generation of BI tools breaks down the barriers that once made powerful data analytics accessible only to data scientists. With simpler interfaces that include conversational interfaces, these tools make interacting with data as easy as having a chat. This integration into daily workflows means that advanced data analysis can be as straightforward as checking your email. This shift democratizes data access and empowers all team members to derive insights from data, regardless of their technical skills.<br><br>For example, imagine a sales manager who wants to quickly check the latest performance figures before a meeting. Instead of navigating through complex software, they ask the BI tool, “What were our total sales last month?” or “How are we performing compared to the same period last year?”</p>



<p>The system understands the questions and provides accurate answers in seconds, just like a conversation. This ease of use helps to ensure that every team member, not just data experts, can engage with data effectively and make informed decisions swiftly.</p>



 2. Driving personalization 



<p>Personalization is transforming how BI platforms present and interact with data. It means that the system learns from how users work with it, adapting to suit individual preferences and meeting the specific needs of their business.</p>



<p>For example, a dashboard might display the most important metrics for a marketing manager differently than for a production supervisor. It’s not just about the user’s role; it’s also about what’s happening in the market and what historical data shows.</p>



<p>Alerts in these systems are also smarter. Rather than notifying users about all changes, the systems focus on the most critical changes based on past importance. These alerts can even adapt when business conditions change, helping to ensure that users get the most relevant information without having to look for it themselves.</p>



<p>By integrating a deep understanding of both the user and their business environment, BI tools can offer insights that are exactly what’s needed at the right time. This makes these tools incredibly effective for making informed decisions quickly and confidently.</p>



 Navigating the future: Overcoming adoption challenges 



<p>While the advantages of integrating advanced BI technologies are clear, organizations often encounter significant challenges that can hinder their adoption. Understanding these challenges is crucial for businesses looking to use the full potential of these innovative tools.</p>



 1. Cultural resistance to change 



<p>One of the biggest hurdles is overcoming ingrained habits and resistance within the organization. Employees used to traditional methods of data analysis might be skeptical about moving to new systems, fearing the learning curve or potential disruptions to their routine workflows. Promoting a culture that values continuous learning and technological adaptability is key to overcoming this resistance.</p>



 2. Complexity of integration 



<p>Integrating new BI technologies with existing IT infrastructure can be complex and costly. Organizations must help ensure that new tools are compatible with their current systems, which often involve significant time and technical expertise. The complexity increases when trying to maintain data consistency and security across multiple platforms.</p>



 3. Data governance and security 



<p>Gen AI, by its nature, creates new content based on existing data sets. The outputs generated by AI can sometimes introduce biases or inaccuracies if not properly monitored and managed.</p>



<p>With the increased use of AI and machine learning in BI tools, managing data privacy and security becomes more complex. Organizations must help ensure that their data governance policies are robust enough to handle new types of data interactions and comply with regulations such as GDPR. This often requires updating security protocols and continuously monitoring data access and usage.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2GEBTI5J&amp;ct=240129&amp;st=sb">According to Gartner</a>, by 2025, augmented consumerization functions will drive the adoption of ABI capabilities beyond 50% for the first time, influencing more business processes and decisions.</p>



<p>As we stand on the brink of this new era in BI, we must focus on adopting new technologies and managing them wisely. By fostering a culture that embraces continuous learning and innovation, organizations can fully harness the potential of gen AI and augmented analytics to make smarter, faster and more informed decisions.</p>

<p>In September 2022, Entrust published the article, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/nsa-announces-new-post-quantum-resistant-algorithm-suite-2-0-and-transition-timetable/">NSA Announces New Post-Quantum Resistant Algorithm Suite 2.0 and Transition Timetable</a>. At that time the National Security Agency was one of the first to put a firm line in the sand, publishing an aggressive timeline for the recommended adoption of post-quantum-resistant algorithms. It was a bit of a wake-up call to the digital security industry. Fast forward 18 months and we have a new updated version of the paper: <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/1/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 and Quantum Computing FAQ</a>. Algorithm specifications, recommendations, and guidance are slowly starting to crystallize. The eagerly anticipated NIST standardized PQC (post-quantum cryptography) algorithms are set to be approved in summer 2024. You can <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization">check for updates here</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, the algorithm suite looks unchanged:</p>

<p>Table: Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0</p>
<p>The newly assigned NIST names are now included in the table (see highlighted rows above) as we prepare to let go of the names CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, chosen originally by the cryptographers who designed the algorithms. These are now replaced by the more formal ML-DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) and ML-KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism), a set of algorithms that can be used to establish a shared secret key between two parties communicating over a public channel. These algorithms now have FIPS Publications, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.ipd.pdf">FIPS PUB 203</a> and <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.204.ipd.pdf">204</a> respectively, assigned to them. The paper also includes an informative FAQ section and some guidance on which PQC algorithms can be used in which situation. Some key areas to note include:</p>
 NIST SP 800-208 
<p>Regarding stateful hash-based signature schemes, published in 2020, the NSA has only approved LMS and XMSS for use in National Security Systems (NSS). The multi-tree algorithms HSS and XMSSMT are not allowed, although no explanation has been given for this decision.</p>
 Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA) 
<p>Known to many as SPHINCS+, despite being hash-based, it cannot be used to sign software. It’s not part of the CNSA and is not approved for use.</p>
 FIPS Approval of LMS and XMSS Signing Algorithms 
<p>Hardware security modules (HSMs) are discussed in relation to certification/FIPS approval of LMS and XMSS signing algorithms. For validating signatures, they must have passed NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).</p>
 Hardware Security Modules and the Use of LMS and XMSS 
<p>Code signing applications using HSMs will need to be validated to NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). LMS and XMSS algorithms are stateful, meaning they use one-time signatures and when deployed can only produce a finite number of signatures before a new public/private key needs to be generated. See the illustration below for a visual of the stateful key generation process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Illustration of the stateful generation of derived keys</p>
<p>The private key is a random seed that derives a new private key for each signature. To maintain their security properties, the private key must be used in conjunction with a counter. This is what limits derived private keys to only generate a single signature. The CNSA 2.0 paper further highlights the concern that these private keys, if backed up or migrated to multiple devices, could break the “one-signature-per-derived-private-key” rule. The NSA’s opening position was to forbid export of keys created using these algorithms regardless of whether they’re encrypted or not. While some vendors still believe in the doctrine of storing keys in the box, in the physical memory of the HSM, most vendors have followed Entrust’s long-standing approach: Store keys as encrypted fragments, tokens, or key blobs – whichever terminology you prefer – outside of the physical HSM. The HSM-vendor community, including Entrust, have raised strong objections with the NSA proposal since that would create a single point of failure and severely limit the lifespan of an HSM. Deployments of HSMs are typically configured in pairs where resilience, availability, and backing up keys is standard practice. The NSA has agreed to look at supporting exports without the detrimental impact on the integrity of the algorithm’s security. We’ll continue to keep you updated on the outcome on their review.</p>
 Firmware Signatures – Begin Transitioning Immediately 
<p>The updated CNSA 2.0 paper also explains the rationale for the prioritization of firmware signatures in their timeline, recognizing that in this use case, the validation algorithm is not easily updated.</p>
 
 “Software- and firmware-signing: begin transitioning immediately, support and prefer CNSA 2.0 by 2025 where available, exclusively use CNSA 2.0 by 2030.” 
 
<p>Further, the paper explains, “even in systems that are designed for extensibility and cryptographic agility, a quantum-resistant root of trust may be required in the firmware years before the rest of the system upgrades to quantum-resistance. NSA prioritizes this in our timelines to avoid unexpected costs and security issues later in our transition.”</p>
<p>The NSA is recognizing the role that HSMs as a root of trust play in signing firmware, which then acts as the foundation layer of an organization’s cryptographic stack. With 2025 only months away, Entrust is already working on firmware that is safe from a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC).</p>
 ML-DSA for Firmware or Software Signing 
<p>The paper recognizes that firmware roots of trust are long-term and, “are a critical component to upgrade…expected to be implemented for some long-lived signatures in 2025, before validated ML-DSA is widely available.” This is impactful for Entrust and our customer base.</p>
 Deployment of CNSA 2.0 Algorithms in Mission Systems 
<p>The paper encourages algorithm deployment as soon as available and recommends, “testing in vendor and government research environments now to understand the effects of deployment of the new algorithms on particular systems given the increased sizes used in these algorithms.”</p>
 Hybrid Solutions 
<p>The FAQ section covers the NSA’s position on hybrid cryptographic solutions, using a combination of both classic and post-quantum cryptography. The idea is that until PQC algorithms are standardized and proven in the field, hybrid covers both bases – if the classic algorithms are compromised by a CRQC, the PQC algorithm will protect the data. Equally, if the PQC algorithm was found to be weak, the classic algorithm will still provide some level of protection. According to <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/1/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">the paper</a>, details that, “the NSA has confidence in CNSA 2.0 algorithms and will not require NSS developers to use hybrid certified products for security purposes.” They further state in the paper that, “NSA recognizes that some standards may require using hybrid-like constructions to accommodate the larger sizes of CRQC algorithms and will work with industries on the best options for implementation.”</p>
<p>The NSA explained their reservations about hybrid deployments are due to concerns on complexity, compatibility, and the fact that hybrid deployments are an interim solution and will need to be migrated in the future to solely PQC algorithms.</p>
<p>However, the hybrid approach has support in the industry. Some highlight the ill-fated SIKE algorithm, which made it to the 4th round of the NIST competition only to falter and be broken on a laptop, as an example of what can happen to emerging post-quantum cryptography. Hybrid adds an extra layer of protection in case the PQC algorithm turns out to be vulnerable. I’ve published blog posts about my colleagues at Entrust actively involved in the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/post-quantum-cryptography-advancesunder-the-hood/">specification of composite signatures</a> in conjunction with the Internet Engineering Task Force.</p>
<p>In summary, in the space of 18 months the PQC position has moved forward. We can anticipate some of the NIST PQC short-listed algorithms to be standardized in summer 2024. What was theoretical and fuzzy a couple of years ago is starting to take shape. Timelines are firming up and the NIST and NSA are being prescriptive on which algorithms should be adopted in which particular use case, and by when.</p>
<p>For organizations who are following NSA recommendations and want to experiment now, Entrust offers a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/sites/default/files/documentation/datasheets/entrust-pqc-option-pack-ds.pdf">PQC Option Pack</a> for use in conjunction with our nShield HSMs. It supports the NIST’s PQC algorithms identified for standardization.

  <p>The emergence of cloud technology and the hybrid work model, along with the rapidly increasing intensity and sophistication of cyber threats, are significantly reshaping the work landscape. As organizational boundaries become increasingly blurred, private applications and resources that were once secure for authenticated users are now vulnerable to intrusion from compromised systems and users. When users connect to a corporate network through a traditional virtual private network (VPN), they’re granted extensive access to the entire network, which potentially poses significant security risks. These challenges have introduced new demands that traditional network security approaches struggle to meet. Even <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-13-gartner-identifies-three-factors-influencing-growth-i">Gartner predicts</a> that by 2025, at least 70% of new remote access deployments will be served predominantly by ZTNA as opposed to VPN services, up from less than 10% at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>, part of Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, securely connects users to any private resource and application, reducing the operational complexity and risk of legacy VPNs. It enhances the security posture of your organization by eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. As traditional VPN enterprise protections continue to wane, Private Access improves a user’s ability to connect securely to private applications easily from any device and any network—whether they are working at home, remotely, or in their corporate office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enable secure access to private apps that use Domain Controller for authentication&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access (Preview), you can now implement granular app segmentation and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on any on-premises resource authenticating to domain controller (DC) for on-premises users, across all devices and protocols without granting full network access. You can also protect your DCs from identity threats and prevent unauthorized access by simply enabling privileged access to the DCs by enforcing MFA and Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance your security posture and minimize the attack surface, it’s crucial to implement robust Conditional Access controls, such as MFA, across all private resources and applications including legacy or proprietary applications that may not support modern auth. By doing so, you can safeguard your DCs—the heart of your network infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A closer look at the mechanics of Private Access for on-prem user scenario 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how Private Access helps secure access to on-prem resources and applications and provides a seamless way for employees to access the on-premises resources when they’re locally accessing these resources, while ensuring the security of the company's critical services. Imagine a scenario where an employee is working on-premises at their company's headquarters. They need to access the company's DCs to retrieve some important information for their project or make some changes. However, when they try to access the DC directly, they find that access is blocked. This is because the company has enabled privileged access, which restricts direct access to the DC for security reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of accessing the DC directly, the employee's traffic is intercepted by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-clients">Global Secure Access Client</a> and routed to the Microsoft Entra ID and Private Access Cloud for authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the DC and its resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the employee attempts to access the private resources they need, they’re prompted to authenticate using MFA. This additional layer of security ensures that only legitimate users can gain entry to the DC. Private Access also extends MFA to all on-premises resources, even those that lack built-in MFA support. This means that even legacy applications can benefit from the added security of MFA. With Private Access, the company has also enabled granular app segmentation, which allows them to segment access to specific applications or resources within their on-premises environment. This means that the employee can only interact with the services they’re authorized to access, ensuring the security of critical services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these added security measures, the employee's user experience remains seamless. Only authentication traffic leaves the corporate network, while application traffic remains local within the corporate network. This minimizes latency and ensures that the employee can access the information they need quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Private Access enforces flexible MFA to on-prem resources for on-prem users, strengthening your security posture and minimizing your attack surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key benefits: Elevate network access security to on-premises resources with Private Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations seeking to enhance the security of their on-premises resources and protect their critical assets, including DCs, against identity threats can benefit from the key capabilities provided by Private Access—in preview. With Private Access, organizations can enable granular segmented access and extend Conditional Access controls to all their private applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access allows for the implementation of MFA for private apps that use DC for authentication, adding an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access and reduce identity-related risks. By enabling granular segmented access policies for individual applications or groups, organizations can ensure that only authorized users interact with critical resources and services. Additionally, Private Access extends Conditional Access controls to all private resources, even those relying on legacy protocols, allowing organizations to consider factors such as application sensitivity, user risk, and network compliance when enforcing modern authentication methods across their entire environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access provides granular access controls on all private applications for any user- on-premises or remote while bridging the gap between legacy applications and modern security practices. The capabilities of Private Access provide new tools to confidently enable secure access to private apps that use DC for authentication and navigate the complex landscape of modern authentication and access controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Navigating the complexities of SOC 2 compliance is daunting. Said more simply: getting SOC 2 certified sucks. It will always suck some, but it won’t suck quite as much if you’re using YeshID.</p>
<p>Certification is important and becoming vital. Certification assures others that your systems are secure, their data will be protected, and your processes align with stringent regulatory standards. More and more companies will refuse to do business with you if you aren’t SOC 2-certified. You may be familiar with companies like <a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta</a>, <a href="https://drata.com/">Drata</a> &amp; <a href="https://secureframe.com/">Secureframe</a> that help with certification. We’ve gotten SOC 2 certified with their help.</p>
<p>SOC 2 certification requires well-defined access management protocols and evidence that the protocols are being followed. The first part is “relatively” easy: anyone can design a protocol. The second part is hard, and it’s where YeshID helps big-time. YeshID simplifies and streamlines identity &amp; access management (instead of cobbling together checklists, spreadsheets, and ticketing systems). And YeshID keeps track of what you do. YeshID helps you get SOC 2 (and stay SOC 2) with more SOCcess.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works.&nbsp;</p>
 CC and SOC 2 
<p>Almost everyone knows that CC stands for the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation and that it’s an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer security certification. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/index.cfm">CC website</a>)</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows that SOC 2, or Service Organization Control Type 2, is a cybersecurity framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in 2010.</p>
<p>And almost everyone knows the relationship between SOC 2 and the Common Criteria. But for the one or two readers who don’t know, we’ve spelled out some of the connections and how YeshID helps.</p>
 Logical and Physical Access Controls 
<p>SOC 2 compliance ensures that only authorized personnel can access your systems and data. YeshID excels in managing access controls:</p>
 
 Production Deployment Access Control (CC 6.1): YeshID restricts access to production deployments by controlling who can modify application access. This ensures that only authorized personnel can deploy changes to production environments.

<p>I’ve been speaking and writing a lot recently about the newly legislated Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS).</p>
 
 <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/talking-digital-id-with-nab">Talking Digital ID with NAB </a> 
 <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-ep9-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">Conserving the IDs</a> we are already familiar with instead coming up with new ones 
 The need to <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity">keep Digital ID small</a> (and simple). 
 
 Digital ID caught between the old and the new 
<p>In some ways, AGDIS embodies fresh thinking, such as the pivot away from abstract “digital identity” to the more concrete Digital ID.</p>
<p>On the other hand, AGDIS tries to leverage the federal government’s long-standing “Trusted Digital Identity Framework” (TDIF) which was conceived a decade ago for the purposes of single sign-on to tax and human services. TDIF predates modern digital wallets and verifiable credentials. It is a creature of an earlier era.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are mixed messages around AGDIS.</p>
<p>Will it furnish Australians with “reusable” proof of identity? Will it come with new ID numbers and a central registry? Or will it simply better protect our many existing IDs in digital form? And what is an “ID” anyway?</p>
<p>Minister Katy Gallagher has assured us that there is no new national ID, and indeed, there is nothing I can see in the Digital ID Bill about new numbers or a central registry.</p>
 The last thing we need is a novel ID 
<p>And according to Lockstep’s research, there is no fundamental need for anything new of that type. You see, proof of identity works reasonably well today using familiar IDs like driver licences, passports, birth certificates and social security cards.</p>
<p>Or I should say, proof of identity works well in real life.</p>
<p>But identification breaks down in cyberspace when these IDs are presented as plaintext to online processes. Web forms and web servers can’t tell if a plaintext ID has been presented by its rightful holder or by a fraudster who’s bought the data on the black market.</p>
<p>Almost all identity fraud now occurs online; very little fraud is attempted in person using counterfeit ID documents. So that tells us that the logic of using government IDs for identification remains sound in the digital age — if only we made the presentation in the digital realm as reliable as it is in the physical world.</p>
 Pivot away from plaintext presentation — again! 
<p>The real problem to solve is not “identity” but identification, and specifically, making the government IDs we use day-to-day more reliable online.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials technology is the solution. We should ‘seal’ existing IDs into digital wallets and then present them digitally, from device-to-server, instead of manually typing ID details into forms.</p>
<p>And the really good news is there’s a precedent for this transition. We’ve done it before! The world shifted from plaintext to digital IDs for handling credit card numbers — when chip cards replaced magnetic stripes.</p>
<p>Now we have smart phone wallets alongside chip cards, with exactly the same cryptographic security that protects cardholder details against theft and cloning.</p>
<p>Consumer acceptance today of digital wallets is high and growing; over one third of all card payments in Australia are now done via a digital wallet (Reference: <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">Reserve Bank of Australia</a>). So verifiable credentials are commonplace.</p>
 It’s all about data quality 
<p>What excites me the most is that AGDIS shows a way forward for all data.</p>
<p>The government in its wisdom is making the ACCC the Digital ID regulator. The ACCC currently governs the Consumer Data Right (CDR), Australia regulatory regime for open banking and data sharing. Now, the CDR is not perfect, but it features a strong regulatory model, it sits in the right place with the ACCC, and it is extensible to the protection of Digital IDs.</p>
<p>The CDR is essentially a governance systems for data flows, tracing where certain data has come from, where it’s going, what is it being used for, and above all, carrying consent for the data to be used in defined contexts.</p>
<p>I see CDR and Digital ID boiling down to data and metadata, in the broadest sense of that word.</p>
<p>That is, what are the properties of a data record that really matter when deciding whether to use it for some application? Where did the record come from? What is its intended purpose? If it’s a personal data record, then what consent was granted for its usage?</p>
<p>The same sort of metadata is routinely baked into verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Remember that a verifiable credential is a data record holding one or more assertions about a person or entity (i.e. the credential subject) together with details of the credential issuer and metadata such as when, where, how and why the credential was issued.</p>
<p>So, with the ACCC governing data sharing and verifiable IDs, we could see a uniform new approach to managing data quality. Remember the pattern. In any critical digital transaction, there will be something precise you need to know about the counterparty. So ask yourself:</p>
 
 What do you need to know about the party you’re transacting with? 
 Where will your transaction system get that data when you need it? 
 And how will the system check know that it’s fit for purpose? 
 
<p>If we can govern that pattern consistently across the digital economy, then we will be able to solve a set of problems that are much bigger and much more important than identity. We can take care of the quality of all data.</p>
 Governing all data quality 
<p>The same data quality questions recur everywhere we look.</p>
<p>The wicked problems with deep fakes arise because we consumers can’t tell where the data is coming from. But a governance regime is within sight to provide quality signals (i.e. metadata) about any important data.</p>
<p>Consider an online image or article, or any piece of content online: what if you could be sure where the digital data has really come from, that it’s intact and genuine? We have the technology to authenticate authors and publishers and AI algorithms, anchored in verifiable credentials with certified hardware roots of trust.</p>
<p>If this looks complicated, then let me reiterate that we have already pivoted to digital presentation of payment card data. Banks routinely provision cardholder data in the form of verifiable credentials, a growing proportion of consumers are comfortable with digital wallets, and merchants can readily accept payments from digital devices, with radically reduced incidence of card fraud.</p>
<p>Australians could soon be presenting any Digital ID with the click of a button from a mobile digital wallet, with exactly the same privacy, security and ease of use as a card payment.</p>
<p>Looking to the future of data sharing, with AGDIS and CDR under the same regulatory umbrella, I see us heading towards a united governance regime for all important data. We can be sure where any data has come from, what it is supposed to be used for, and that it’s always been in the right hands.</p>

  <p>In previous resilience blog posts, we’ve shared updates about the continuous improvements we’re making to resilience and reliability, including our most recent update on <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-resilience-update-workload-identity/ba-p/4094704">regionally isolated authentication endpoints</a> and an announcement last year of our industry-leading and first of its kind <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advances-in-azure-ad-resilience/ba-p/2147048">backup authentication service</a>. These and other innovations behind the scenes enable us to deliver consistently very high rates of availability globally each month. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll outline what we’re doing to help customers see how available and resilient Microsoft Entra really is for them, to not only hold us accountable when issues arise, but also better understand what actions to take within their tenant to improve its health. At the global level, you see it in the form of retrospective <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-sla-performance">SLA reporting</a>, which shows authentication availability exceeding our 4 9s promise (<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/99-99-uptime-for-azure-active-directory/ba-p/1999628">launched in spring 2021</a>) by a wide margin and reaching 5 9s in most months. But it becomes more compelling and actionable at the tenant level: what is the uptime experience of my users on my organization’s apps and devices? Is my tenant handling surges in sign-in demand?  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often hear from customers about the effect on resilience insights when they move to the cloud. In the on-prem world, identity health monitoring occurred onsite and with tight control; operational awareness happened entirely within a company’s first-party IT department. Now, we need to achieve that same transparency or better in an outsourced, cloud-based identity service and with a federated set of dependencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT departments and developers are working hard to ensure each of their users maintains seamless, uninterrupted access that doesn’t compromise security. Enabling access for the right users with minimal friction while stopping intrusions and risk is critical to keep the world running. When an organization outsources their identity service to Microsoft, they expect us to acknowledge degradations when they happen, then take accountability to learn and continuously improve from those events. We also recognize that human-driven communication can only take us so far.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, we’re increasingly embracing granular monitoring and automation. We start from the assumption that the unexpected will find a way of happening in any complex system, no matter how resilient it is. Beyond resilience, we must detect incidents, respond to them effectively, and improve as we go—and help our customers do the same. You see examples of this approach both in our rollout of in-tenant health monitoring and in our investments behind the scenes aimed at fast incident detection and communication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with out-of-the-box automated health monitoring in premium tenants. Tenant-level health monitoring empowers customers to independently understand the quality of their users’ experiences with authentication and access. It also sets the stage to prompt tenant administrators with actions they can take to investigate and reduce disruptions, all from Microsoft Entra admin center or using MS Graph API calls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve taken a step in this direction by introducing a group of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">precomputed health metric streams</a> that enable our premium customers to watch key authentication scenarios, an early milestone in our investments to enhance transparent visibility into tenant health and service resilience. These new health metrics isolate relevant signals from activity logs and provide pre-computed, low-latency aggregates every 15 minutes for specific high-value observability scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With their granularity and scenario-specific focus, health metrics go a step beyond the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/increasing-transparency-into-azure-active-directory-s-resilience/ba-p/2147047">monthly tenant-level SLA reporting</a> we released in 2023. Precomputed health metrics also supplement the activity log data that we’ve been providing and continue to improve on. With sign-in logs, customers can build their own computed metrics to monitor, like isolating a specific sign-in method to watch for increases in success and failure. With our new precomputed streams, customers can snap to Microsoft-defined indicators of health, take advantage of features we’re developing at scale, and dive into activity logs for deeper investigations. We encourage customers to make use of both options to get a full picture. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the initial public preview offering, we’re releasing health metric streams related to maintaining highly available:  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Multifactor authentication (MFA) &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are managed under Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are compliant with Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) sign-ins  &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re starting with authentication-related scenarios because they are mission critical to all our customers, but other scenarios in areas like entitlement management, directory configuration, and app health will be added in time along with intelligent alerting capabilities in response to anomalous patterns in the data. We’re publishing the health metrics in Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure Portal, and M365 admin center, as well as in Microsoft Graph for programmatic access and integration into other monitoring pipelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about how to access the health monitoring metrics, visit the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">Microsoft Learn documentation</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure shows the Scenario monitoring landing page &amp; the Sign in with MFA scenario details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even as in-tenant observability improves, customers will still rely on traditional incident communications when Microsoft-side issues happen. Like all service providers, we push messages about incidents to affected customers and post service health announcements to a website and communications feed in Azure. However, when this approach relies solely on hand-crafted service monitors and human-driven communications, it has limitations. Customers are right to have concerns about the timeliness of communication and the monitoring coverage itself.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we’re building increasingly sophisticated default monitoring packages attached to automated communications. The early results are promising. We’ve been able to bring times to notify customers about incidents down significantly, with service degradations and downtime being communicated within about 10 minutes of auto-detection. We’re also catching service degradations increasingly early by investing in monitoring, the results of which we track by watching customer-reported incident volumes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp; best incidents are the ones that never happen. Our goal is to find and mitigate problems before they impact our customers. So, in addition to advances, we continue to prioritize building systematic resilience measures to prevent service degradations and outages or auto-mitigate them before they affect a customer environment. We will share more on this in a future blog.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continuously improve our services in partnership with our customers, we’re combining improvements in our service-level safety net with tenant-level monitoring. We’re also expanding our monitored scenarios, boosting our out-of-the-box monitoring intelligence, and speeding up our communication. Plus, integration with Azure, M365, and Microsoft Graph ensures that Microsoft Entra observability can happen wherever it’s needed. Together, we’re making sure everyone can work securely and seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our already strong foundation of availability and resilience, security-enhancing recommendations, and mature service monitoring and incident communications, we’re excited to see these new capabilities take Entra health transparency to the next level.   &nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023">Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023 (MDDR)</a>, we shared that on average, there are 11 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#anomalous-token">token replay</a> detections per 100,000 active users in Microsoft Entra ID each month. In addition, there are approximately 18,000 multifactor authentication (MFA) fatigue attempts observed per month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest developments in Entra ID Protection help you reduce the risks of these attacks by making it easier to deploy risk policies, understand their impact, and protect your organization from emerging threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the highlights:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Deploying Entra ID Protection just became easier with Microsoft-managed policies in your environment and an impact analysis workbook.&nbsp; 
  You can now investigate and remediate compromised users faster with help from Copilot and expansion of self-remediation to hybrid users.&nbsp; 
  You can also fine-tune the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm by providing feedback and identify and block token theft and suspicious actions taken by an attacker within Entra ID with new detections.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy with ease and confidence 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft managed policies and impact analysis workbook</p>
<p>Identity and access management is a huge responsibility requiring diligence and expertise. Between policies across identity, infrastructure, network, devices, apps, and data—and weighing the impact to end users and security—there’s a lot on your plate. To help with this, we have two exciting updates so you can get started with protecting your users faster and easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we announced in November, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/managed-policies">Microsoft-managed Policies</a> will enable some of our most valuable Conditional Access polices by default in select tenants, including requiring end users to perform MFA when we detect high risk to their sign in. This policy blocks attackers and allows your users to self-remediate their risk. We’re enabling Microsoft-managed policies slowly and deliberately to make sure we can incorporate your feedback and maximize value for you. Learn more about our approach to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/managed-policies">managed policies in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that changes to how your users authenticate into resources require thoughtful consideration, and it’s helpful to know how the changes will affect your unique environment. Our new Impact analysis of risk-based access workbook will help you see the precise impact of turning on risk-based Conditional Access Policies so you can enable a new policy with confidence. The workbook uses historical sign-in data to allow you to immediately see the impact the policy would have had, with no report-only policy required. You can try out the new workbook <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/workbook-risk-based-policy-impact">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New dashboard generally available 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/what-s-new-with-microsoft-entra-id-protection/ba-p/3773132">Entra ID Protection launched a new dashboard</a> that presents risk insights for your tenant at a glance. We’re excited to announce today that this experience is now generally available and is the default landing page of ID Protection. The dashboard will give you a better understanding of your tenant’s security posture through key metrics, graphics, and recommended actions to improve your organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general availability, the attack counts in the Attacks Graphic are also now clickable, and you can easily navigate to them in the Risk Detections report to further investigate. The Risk Detections report has this new “Attack type” column, showing the primary attack type based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques for the detections. This further empowers your admins and SOC teams to understand the risks and take actions accordingly. See the risk detection to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/id-protection-dashboard#risk-detection-type-to-mitre-attack-type-mapping">MIRTE ATT&amp;CK type mapping</a>&nbsp;in our documentation.</p>

 Investigate and remediate efficiently 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On-premises password reset remediates user risk of compromise (general availability)</p>
<p>Our new feature to allow on-premises password changes to reset user risk is now generally available for Entra P1 and P2 customers. This feature allows hybrid customers to include their users in risk-based Conditional Access polices that require user password remediation. If you were waiting for GA to enable this feature, now is the time to do so to make user risk policies easier to manage. Visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock#allow-on-premises-password-reset-to-remediate-user-risks-preview">Remediate risks and unblock users in Entra ID Protection</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User Risk Investigation Copilot in public preview</p>
<p>Learning more about a user’s risk level and recommendations on how to mitigate a user’s risk is easier than ever with the introduction of the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-adds-identity-skills-to-copilot-for-security/ba-p/4081857">which is available in public preview as a part of Copilot for Security</a>. This skill summarizes the risk history of the user, how to remediate risk for that user, and how to scale and automate response and remediation to identity threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved Threat Prevention and Remediation Capabilities 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple new detections have been introduced to Entra ID Protection that protect against new and emerging attack vectors, like anomalous graph usage, token theft, and attacker in the middle (AitM) attacks. In addition, hybrid tenants can now be confident that user risk is resolved when a password is reset on-premises, and all tenants can benefit from our new functionality that takes your feedback into account when determining if an event is risky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspicious API traffic detection (general availability)</p>
<p>When entering an environment, attackers often search for information about users and tenant configuration to prepare for further exploitation. ID Protection will now change a user’s risk level if we observe them making an abnormally high number of calls to MS Graph and AAD Graph compared to that user’s baseline, which will help identify both compromised users and insider threats scavenging for intel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detecting token theft in real-time and post-breach</p>
<p>With token-based attacks on the rise, you need detections that help you identify and protect against this emerging threat. Two new detections in ID Protection help you do this. Our industry-first Real-time Anomalous Token Detection automatically disrupts token replay attacks in real-time when paired with a risk-based Conditional Access for sign-ins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also built an offline detection that extends coverage of Microsoft 365 Defender’s Attacker in the Middle signals. This detection will flag the impacted user with high risk to prompt the configured Conditional Access user risk policy, allowing customers to confirm or dismiss the risk on the user. The session token is also revoked in cases where Continuous Access Evaluation is enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about our new detections at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks">What are risk detections?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Admin feedback on detections trains our ML 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hold our detections in Entra ID to a very high standard, but occasionally we do issue a false positive detection. You can now help train our ML models by acting on risky sign-ins. You can confirm a sign-in as risky, safe, or dismiss risk. Each of these will send information back to our ML model and optimize future detections for your organization. You can learn more about giving Entra ID Protection risk feedback <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-risk-feedback#how-does-microsoft-entra-id-use-my-risk-feedback">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your organization can benefit from these new detections and features and that you will revisit the positive impact that risk-based Conditional Access can have on your organization's security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>Recent research from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52597">IDC found that</a> 85% of CEOs who were surveyed cited digital capabilities as strategic differentiators that are crucial to accelerating revenue growth. However, IT decision makers remain concerned about the risks associated with their digital infrastructure and the impact they might have on business outcomes, with data breaches and security concerns being the biggest threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rapid growth of XaaS consumption models and the integration of AI and data at the forefront of every business plan, we believe that protecting data security is pivotal to success. It can also help clients simplify their data compliance requirements as organizations&nbsp;to fuel their AI and data-intensive workloads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Automation for efficiency and security&nbsp; 



<p>Data is central to all AI applications. The ability to access and process the necessary data yields optimal results from AI models. IBM® remains committed to working diligently with partners and clients to introduce a set of automation blueprints called deployable architectures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These blueprints are designed to streamline the deployment process for customers. We aim to allow organizations to effortlessly select and deploy their cloud workloads in a way that is tailor-made to align with preset, reviewable security requirements and to help to enable a seamless integration of AI and XaaS. This commitment to the fusion of AI and XaaS is further exemplified by our recent accomplishment this past year. This platform is designed to enable enterprises to effectively train, validate, fine-tune and deploy AI models while scaling workloads and building responsible data and AI workflows.&nbsp;</p>



 Protecting data in multicloud environments&nbsp; 



<p>Business leaders need to take note of the importance of hybrid cloud support, while acknowledging the reality that modern enterprises often require a mix of cloud and on-premises environments to support their data storage and applications. The fact is that different workloads have different needs to operate efficiently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that you cannot have all your workloads in one place, whether it’s on premises, in public or private cloud or at the edge. One example is our work with CrushBank. The institution uses watsonx to streamline desk operations with AI by arming its IT staff with improved information. This has led to improved productivity and , which ultimately enhances the customer experience. A custom hybrid cloud strategy manages security, data latency and performance, so your people can get out of the business of IT and into their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This all begins with building a hybrid cloud XaaS environment by increasing your data protection capabilities to support the privacy and security of application data, without the need to modify the application itself. At IBM, security and compliance is at the heart of everything we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recently expanded the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-09-06-IBM-Expands-Cloud-Security-and-Compliance-Center-to-Help-Clients-Protect-Data-and-Assess-Risk-Across-Hybrid,-Multicloud-Environments">IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center</a>, a suite of modernized cloud security and compliance solutions designed to help enterprises mitigate risk and protect data across their hybrid, multicloud environments and workloads. In this XaaS era, where data is the lifeblood of digital transformation, investing in robust data protection is paramount for success.&nbsp;</p>



 XaaS calls for strong data security&nbsp; 



<p>IBM continues to demonstrate its dedication to meeting the highest standards of security in an increasingly interconnected and data-dependent world. We can help support mission-critical workloads because our software, infrastructure and services offerings are designed to support our clients as they address their evolving security and data compliance requirements. Amidst the rise of XaaS and AI, prioritizing data security can help you protect your customers’ sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Professor William McCarthy teaches accounting and information systems at Michigan State University and is the innovator of a new way of accounting called Resources-Events-Agents (REA).&nbsp;</p><p>In this exclusive interview, Professor McCarthy talks about how traditional accounting systems have a hard time keeping track of value flows and supporting practices that help the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>He says that the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp?ref=blog.holochain.org">double-entry bookkeeping method</a>, which started in Venice in the 1400s, makes it harder to understand the real economy and work towards sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>So as companies face challenges with modern supply chains and the need for more sustainable economies, Professor McCarthy's work on REA offers an interesting take on the future of accounting.</p><p>Let’s dive in.&nbsp;</p> Limitations of Traditional Accounting <p>For hundreds of years, accountants have used a method called double-entry bookkeeping. This method was first used by merchants in Venice, Italy, in the 1400s. They used math and wrote things down on paper to keep track of their business deals.</p><p>But Professor McCarthy says this old way of accounting doesn't work well anymore. It doesn't show the whole story of what's really happening in the economy. When something happens, like when two companies trade goods, traditional accounting quickly turns it into simple numbers and accounts, stripping away the context and rich data of the transaction. It doesn't keep all the important details.</p><p>This makes it hard for companies to understand their supply chains and how their actions impact the environment. The old accounting method is like telling a story but leaving out key parts. And Professor McCarthy thinks it’s time for change.&nbsp;</p> The REA Accounting Model <p>Professor McCarthy has a different idea. He calls it Resources-Events-Agents, or REA for short. REA is like a new language for accounting that focuses on telling the whole economic story. "We often characterize REA as economic storytelling," Professor McCarthy explains.</p><p>In REA, instead of just writing down numbers, accountants keep track of all the important stuff. They look at the resources being traded, the events happening, and the people or companies involved. It's like writing a detailed story that doesn't leave anything out. "I found a new way of [telling economic stories] using Entity Relationship modeling, and later other things, that was called R E A, because “R” means the two resources that they were going to swap; “A” means to two agents who are at arm's length with each other; and “E” very simply means the process of sending things across this way." Professor McCarthy explains.</p><p>With REA, it's easier to see how things are connected. For example, if a company sells something, REA would keep track of what was sold, who bought it, and how it affects things like inventory and contracts. This gives a clearer picture of the economy. Imagine a visual story… "You have a customer called Charlie who will make a sale of inventory. And we put an object into the system, and it's described as a sale or shipment," Professor McCarthy elaborates.</p><p>Professor McCarthy says REA is like building a big, detailed map of how a company works. This map can help companies make better decisions and understand their impact on the world around them.</p> Implications for Regeneration and Sustainability <p>REA accounting could be a game-changer for companies trying to be more sustainable and regenerative. By tracking the flow of resources, events, and agents across a supply chain, REA provides a more comprehensive picture of a company’s environmental and social impact. "The best example I've seen of the supply chain example is Lynn Foster's examples for an apple pie," Professor McCarthy says, referring to a <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/assets/ValueFlows-Story.pdf?ref=blog.holochain.org">case study</a> on the Valueflows <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/?ref=blog.holochain.org">website</a>.</p><p>Traditional accounting makes it hard to see how business actions affect the environment, discounting “externalities”. But REA keeps track of important details that show the full impact.</p><p>Additionally, professor McCarthy believes that REA accounting is becoming increasingly important as customers and regulators demand more information about how products are made. People want detailed information about the origin and processing of the products they buy, from the farming and dyeing of cotton to the processing of olive oil. They want assurances about the absence of certain chemicals in the soil and the testing done at various stages of production.</p><p>It’s this demand for transparency driven by a growing awareness of the social and environmental impacts of business that has customers shifting to companies which are optimizing for sustainability rather than profit.</p><p>In response to these concerns, we are seeing changes in regulations, particularly in the EU and North America, that require companies to provide more detailed information about their supply chains. REA accounting is well-suited to meet these requirements because it allows for the flow of contextualized data, not just numbers on ledgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, changing accounting systems is not easy. "The biggest barrier to all of my work for years has been computational viability," Professor McCarthy admits. But with new technologies and a shift in mindset, REA could help companies tell a richer story of their impact on the world.</p> Innovating for the Future of Accounting <p>Despite the challenges, Professor McCarthy sees hope for the future of accounting innovation. He believes that new technologies, like Holochain, could help make REA accounting more viable.</p><p>In many ways, Holochain is an ideal technology for REA accounting because of how it leverages decentralized data storage — making it affordable and easy for smaller players in a supply chain to participate.</p><p>Professor McCarthy believes that small, innovative groups could lead the way in changing accounting. These nimble, environmentally and socially aware organizations might be able to make a real impact.</p><p>However, he also acknowledges the challenges ahead, particularly from large, established players in the accounting software industry. These companies may be resistant to change and could even try to acquire innovative startups to maintain their dominance.</p><p>As the accounting profession faces a choice between evolution and obsolescence, the work of visionaries like Professor McCarthy and the potential of new technologies like Holochain offer a glimpse of a more regenerative and sustainable future. The path forward may not be easy, but the stakes are too high to cling to the status quo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) represents a once-in-a-lifetime <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/change-management">change management</a> opportunity that might decide who wins and loses across every industry. As the AI era takes shape through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> initiatives, executives and employees alike are contemplating how it affects employment and the skills needed to stay ahead. This is where AI upskilling and reskilling come into play.</p>



 How executives and employees view the era of AI 



<p>An IBM Institute for Business Value report found that <a href="https://ibm.co/hr-generative-ai">more than 60% of executives</a> say that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a> will disrupt how their organization designs customer and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/employee-experience">employee experiences</a>. Employees need to change to meet those needs. Many are turning to AI <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/upskilling">upskilling</a>, the act of preparing the workforce with skills and education to empower them to use AI to do their jobs.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/609320/no-fear-obsolete-upskilling-revolution.aspx">2024 Gallup poll</a> found that nearly 25% of workers worry that their jobs can become obsolete because of AI, up from 15% in 2021. In the same study, over 70% of chief human resources officers (CHRO) predicted AI would replace jobs within the next 3 years.</p>



<p>The World Economic Forum estimated that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> will displace 85 million jobs by 2025, and 40% of core skills will change for workers in its <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2023.pdf">Future of Jobs Report 2023</a>. AI will usher in a new era of productivity and value, and business leaders in the C-suite should make employees part of that future.</p>



<p>Every organization is responsible for providing its workforce with the requisite skill sets and education to use AI in their daily jobs. CHROs, specifically, should take a leading role in decision-making when it comes to what skills technology automates and which ones remain mission-critical skills handled by employees.</p>



<p>The rise of AI is fundamentally remaking corporate strategy. Executives must enhance AI capabilities, such as using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a> tools, throughout the workforce. They must provide opportunities to develop employees’ skills as the AI takes on some of the previous tasks handled by humans.</p>



<p>Employees are interested in learning advanced technical skills that can harness the power of AI to make their jobs more efficient and their career paths more successful. Organizations have a vested interest in upskilling their employees to better use new technologies such as AI in their daily activities to enhance productivity and improve problem solving.</p>



 Upskilling versus reskilling 



<p><a href="https://online.stanford.edu/what-upskilling-and-reskilling">Upskilling </a>and reskilling are <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/what-upskilling-and-reskilling">separate</a> but important components of an organization’s approach to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-development">talent development</a> and skill building. The first, upskilling, is the process of improving employee skill sets through training and development programs. The goal is to minimize skill gaps and prepare employees for changes in their job roles or functions.&nbsp;An example of upskilling is customer care representatives learning how to use generative AI and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a> to better answer customer questions in real time with prompt engineering.</p>



<p>Reskilling refers to learning an entire set of new skills to do a new job. For example, someone who currently works in data processing might need to embrace reskilling to learn web development or advanced data analytics.</p>



<p>Executives estimate about 40% of their workforce needs to reskill over the next 3 years, according to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ai-skills-for-all-how-ibm-is-helping-to-close-the-digital-divide/">IBM Institute for Business Value.</a> But what about upskilling?</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-a-new-era-of-human-resources/">Read more about reskilling your workforce in the time of AI</a>



 AI upskilling opportunities in disciplines and industries 



<p>Like other groundbreaking technologies before it, the evolution of AI is creating opportunities for new industries, new jobs and new approaches to existing jobs. To prepare their people and businesses, organizations must ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills for tomorrow without disrupting today’s business. This is where a range of upskilling use cases are critical for success.</p>



 Customer service 



<p>Customer service is most CEOs’ top discipline for deploying generative AI, according to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service">IBM Institute for Business Value report</a>. AI can handle some of the initial queries by customers, but customer service representatives (CSRs) also need to use the tools when issues get escalated to them. CSRs need to improve their ability to do <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/prompt-engineering">prompt engineering</a> and talk to customers while searching through AI-built databases.</p>



 Financial services 



<p>Employees in finance increasingly have enhanced tools to help them make better investments on behalf of their clients. Nearly 70% of financial services leaders believe at least half of their workforce requires upskilling in 2024. It requires not only learning how to use these new technologies, but also feeling they can trust the results from AI technologies, even if they cannot completely understand them.</p>



 Healthcare 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-benefits-of-ai-in-healthcare/">Hospitals and healthcare providers are incorporating AI technologies</a> into their back offices and diagnostic care facilities. For example, healthcare companies are starting to use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> technologies to improve and speed up <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8950225/">medical diagnoses</a>. Understanding what these technologies can and cannot do remains critical for healthcare professionals to make the right decisions.</p>



 Human resources (HR) 



<p>Organizations are beginning to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-a-new-era-of-human-resources/">use AI in HR</a>—to process job applications and help find the right candidates. HR representatives need to learn how to use this technology to spot potential biases or other uncertainties, so they find valuable prospects.</p>



 Web development 



<p>Generative AI and other advanced technologies are creating massive opportunities for efficiency in web development. Developers can use it to convert one coding <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/modernizing-mainframe-applications-with-a-boost-from-generative-ai/">language into another</a>. One such example: applications can refactor <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/modernizing-mainframe-applications-with-a-boost-from-generative-ai/">COBOL code for mainframes</a> into modular business service components.</p>



 How AI can supercharge upskilling opportunities 



<p>Organizations can use AI technologies to enhance the AI learning experience itself.</p>



 Online learning and development 



<p>Using generative AI chatbots and personalization can create more <a href="https://www.ibm.com/training/artificial-intelligence">customized learning opportunities</a> for each employee. It can create <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/training-development">training programs</a> that combine the foundational AI education any employee needs with specific instruction tailored to the learners’ jobs. As a result, the employee has a robust and tailored set of AI skills that helps them maximize their job capabilities.</p>



<p>Here’s a sample course load for an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/ai-academy">AI upskilling development</a> program that IBM offers:</p>



 
 Strategic essentials, such as the rise of generative AI for business and how to become a value creator with generative AI. 
 



 
 Elements of enterprise AI, such as using data management and generative AI foundation models to drive added value. 
 



 
 Putting AI to work for specific disciplines, such as marketing, coding or talent development. 
 



 On-the-job training 



<p>Employees can improve their knowledge and expertise in AI tools by using AI applications while doing their jobs. Using generative AI tools, for instance, can help them answer questions they have about certain processes, while teaching them how to improve their prompts.</p>



 Skill-gap analysis 



<p>Organizations can input a ton of information about their employees’ performance and certifications and use machine learning to identify areas where they need more training. This approach is a more efficient way to identify gaps than through guesswork or asking employees where they need help.</p>



 Mentorship 



<p>AI can help large organizations better identify mentors and mentees based on various criteria, such as backgrounds, interests and what they want out of that relationship. An AI program that automatically matches mentors and mentees eliminates a laborious task and drives stronger connections across the organization.</p>



 Career path development 



<p>Organizations can help employees identify where they want their careers to progress by using AI. It can suggest potential career paths and have them cycle through options until their ideal job.</p>



 Why AI upskilling provides added value for organizations 



 It combines institutional knowledge with advanced capabilities 



<p>While AI and other technologies can create opportunities for organizations to automate many processes, they still need employees to provide valuable context. Helping existing employees remain valuable to the organization serves a dual purpose of using their hard-won experience to improve decision-making.</p>



<p>One way to incorporate AI into employee work is using IBM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/info/ibm-consulting-advantage">role-based AI assistants</a> with conversation-based interfaces that can support key consulting project roles and tasks.</p>



 It fills important gaps 



<p>Many AI technologies require humans to operate them or interpret the results. Organizations that try to deploy these technologies without worker assistance can either fail to maximize results or make incorrect decisions.</p>



 It improves employee retention 



<p>Employees are unlikely to stay at organizations that don’t prioritize the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/employee-experience">employee experience</a>, which should now include AI skill development. One reason is that they expect their employees to provide lasting skills for their jobs and careers. A second reason is that organizations that are not prioritizing AI are likely to fall behind their competitors.</p>



 It embraces the democratization of web development 



<p>AI is driving a massive change in web development. The age of AI ushers in a wave of generative AI code development that enables <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ai-code-generation/">nondevelopers</a> to build code as well. But only if an organization invests in educating its employees on how to use it.</p>



 It’s the right thing to do 



<p>Organizations owe their employees every chance to remain valuable in a rapidly changing talent landscape. The future of work can leave many unprepared employees behind. Training employees in AI skills helps the organization today, but also provides those employees with a roadmap for future success.</p>

			 Adrian Corcoran is Head of Sales UK&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I love sports and have been active all my life. For the last 15 years, I played rugby but hung-up my boots last year because recovering on Sundays was getting too hard! Now, I play squash most early mornings and do Muay Thai 3 or 4 times a week with my youngest son. Between my girlfriend and I, we have 4 boys, aged between 17 and 23 years old. They certainly keep us busy! </p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as Head of Institutional Sales for a FinTech, and prior to that, I led Institutional Sales and Partnerships at a decentralized data cloud storage start-up. Before entering the Web3 space, I owned my own headhunting business for over 12 years, focusing on Wealth Management and Private Banking, with a notable crossover into Investment Banking.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is both challenging and rewarding. There’s never a dull moment, as our fast-paced environment ensures that there is always something to do. Our industry is very dynamic and innovative, so there are always plenty of opportunities to learn. Being part of Tokeny means being at the forefront of tokenization tech, which I get to explore with a diverse and talented team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are too many to name, but if I had to choose just three, they would be:</p>
 
 Family. My sister and I come from a very close-knit family, and those values have carried over into our own families. 
 Work. I now know what I want to be when I grow up! 🙂 Many people spend years searching for their true passion; I consider myself fortunate to have found mine. 
 Sports. I get irritable when I don’t play sports because staying fit and healthy is important to me. Plus, it’s a great way to release stress and maintain balance. 
 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I’m already living the dream! I am very lucky and have a great life; there’s not much I would change.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>If you’re passionate about Web3 and Tokenization and you apply yourself, you’ll do really well.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Tokenization is the future, and Tokeny is at the forefront with its innovative platform. As we move towards standardization and wider adoption, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>VDA token holders can earn up to 20% APY by participating in Verida’s initial lending pools and incentivized liquidity programs.</p>  Token staking and lending programs represent core long-term elements of the Verida network, offering token holders utility while ensuring access to capital for the network’s storage&nbsp;nodes.  Lending pool rewards will grow inline with growth of the Verida mainnet storage utilization, aligning network utility with participant rewards.  Users can securely participate in VDA pools, monitor status and earn rewards for participation in these programs via the <a href="https://pools.verida.network">Verida Network Pools Dashboard</a>.   Overview <p>The Verida network provides decentralized infrastructure for encrypted, authenticated, self-sovereign database storage for the individual, private data of Verida users. Verida empowers users to direct data storage locations in accordance with geographic preferences and regulatory needs, and to securely manage permissioned, direct sharing, or deletion requests. The protocol puts users firmly in control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>In an effort to further familiarize the community with the Verida Network’s core mechanisms, the Verida Foundation is delighted to announce V1 of its staking pool program. In connection with the upcoming listing of its VDA Storage Credit Token, Verida is instituting a stake-based liquidity structure that will provide token holders with immediate utility and opportunities to earn additional VDA Storage Credit&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>The launch of this staking pool program will highlight the critical role that Storage Node Operators play in the Verida Network. Operators must stake VDA to provide storage capacity to the network, secure data, and receive rewards. This program reflects the Verida Foundation’s commitment to allowing all users to participate in core network operations without the need for advanced technical expertise.</p><p>During this initial period the Verida Network will reward VDA Token stakers with bonus rewards while they familiarize themselves with the network’s functionalities and participate in these staking opportunities. Reflecting the long-term importance of these lending pools in supporting Verida Storage Node Operators and the network’s growth and expansion, the Verida Foundation has authorized the use of a portion of the <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-announces-200m-vda-token-long-term-reward-program-9c9ca5d6c280">200 million VDA Token Network Growth Rewards</a> pool to fund these initial staking&nbsp;pools.</p><p>A second program Verida will introduce, as a complement to the above single-sided staking programs, is a liquidity staking program intended to allow users to earn additional VDA while helping support liquidity for the VDA token. This will assist the market to establish a fair price for VDA and allow users to earn bonus VDA rewards on top of the trading fees received for their contribution to the liquidity pools. VDA rewards for the Liquidity Staking Program will be funded from a dedicated allocation of the VDA token supply intended to support token launch activities.</p> Storage Node Lending Pool&nbsp;Program <p>Verida’s Storage Node Lending Pool program will ultimately function as a dedicated lending resource for Verida’s network of decentralized storage nodes that will be operated by a diverse set of institutional and individual operators. This lending pool helps ensure that node operators have access to capital to fund their stake requirements, expansion costs, and operating expenses at attractive rates that will ultimately enable the Verida network’s rapid expansion. The program will also enable Verida token holders to earn a return on their token holdings while supporting the network’s growth. Yield will be dynamic, adjusting with demand and the pace of the network’s expansion.</p><p>During the Verida Network’s initial operations all network nodes will be operated by the Verida Foundation. Verida currently has approximately 20 nodes operating across multiple geographies, and is continuing to expand the number of active nodes. Throughout the second half of 2024 these nodes are expected to be gradually phased out as a decentralized set of node operators comes&nbsp;online.</p><p>While the lending pool is open for deposits and for lenders to earn yield, the borrowing function will not initially be enabled. In this initial phase, this lending pool will work more like a staking pool, where Verida will dedicate the rewards that are intended to be shared with decentralized node operators to pool stakers. This will introduce immediate utility to the Verida token, allow token holders to familiarize themselves with the network’s structures and operations, and earn additional VDA they will be able to use to offset future storage&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Additionally, during this interim period, the Verida Foundation’s continuing expansion of the number of nodes on the Verida network will ensure the network is able to meet the demand for storage along with a sufficient buffer for growth. As the number of nodes on the network grows, so too will the volume of VDA in the staking reward pool, commensurate with the additional nodes on the network. The Verida Foundation plans to double the number of global nodes by Q3&nbsp;2024.</p><p>This mechanism allows users to earn attractive yields while familiarizing themselves with the Verida crypto economic model. This interim pool structure will be replaced by a future V2 lending pool implementation that will be entirely driven by market demand, allowing the Verida Foundation to gradually reduce its nodes as private operators come&nbsp;online.</p><p>Staking will occur via Verida Network’s Staking Interface, which provides users with an easy-to-use staking dashboard. Several lending pools will be created, with each pool having a fixed APY that will vary in association with the pool’s particular lock-up&nbsp;period.</p><p>Additional details on how to access and participate in the Verida Staking program will be provided in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Liquidity Staking&nbsp;Program <p>Verida’s Liquidity Staking Program offers liquidity providers an opportunity to provide stablecoin and VDA liquidity and stake the LP tokens that result, all while earning regular trading fees as well as VDA rewards from a pool dedicated exclusively to the Liquidity Staking Program. Users will fund the pool with equal amounts of USDT and VDA and agree to lock their deposits for a minimum period of&nbsp;time.</p><p>The Liquidity Staking APY will be 20%, compounded daily. As compared to comparable staking programs across the industry, Verida’s Liquidity Staking Program offers compelling rates of return while also allowing contributors to reinforce liquidity and enable price discovery for Verida’s VDA Token. See the below analysis across key blockchain sectors for additional information.</p><p>The above classifications were performed utilizing CF Benchmark’s Digital Asset Classification System, where applicable. Staking data from <a href="https://stakingrewards.com/">https://stakingrewards.com/</a>, accessed on April 22,&nbsp;2024.</p> User Control and Verida’s Storage Node Network Topography <p>The Verida protocol provides an open source <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted, authenticated database storage for Verida accounts on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Storage Node network is global with a region-aware design. It empowers users to control their data storage location in accordance with their geographic preference and regulatory needs.</p><p>By default, the <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> selects storage nodes in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users also have the freedom to change these default nodes, or even host their own, allowing for true data sovereignty.</p><p>Verida’s technology also enables the “right to be forgotten.” Users can delete their data from storage nodes or remove their identity and data entirely from the network.This level of control over data storage and deletion is unprecedented, and vital for the widespread adoption of self-sovereign technology in mature, regulated industries. For instance, social media and health&nbsp;care.</p><p>Storage nodes are currently operated across multiple global regions by the Verida Foundation. Node statistics can be tracked on Verida’s <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">Network Explorer</a>. This has allowed the Verida team to monitor performance, gather analytics, and rapidly improve reliability on the <a href="https://news.verida.io/the-decentralized-verida-acacia-testnet-is-live-81503c119d9f">Acacia Testnet</a>.

<p>Business leaders risk compromising their competitive edge if they do not proactively implement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a>&nbsp;(gen AI). However, businesses scaling AI face entry barriers. Organizations require reliable data for robust AI models and accurate insights, yet the current technology landscape presents unparalleled data quality challenges.</p>



<p>According to International Data Corporation (IDC),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US49759222">stored data is set to increase by 250% by 2025</a>, with data rapidly propagating on-premises and across clouds, applications and locations with compromised quality. This situation will exacerbate data silos, increase costs and complicate the governance of AI and data workloads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The explosion of data volume in different formats and locations and the pressure to scale AI looms as a daunting task for those responsible for deploying AI. Data must be combined and harmonized from multiple sources into a unified, coherent format before being used with AI models. Unified, governed data can also be put to use for various analytical, operational and decision-making purposes. This process&nbsp;is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;data integration, one of the key components to a strong data fabric. End users cannot trust their AI output without a proficient data integration strategy to integrate and govern the organization’s data.&nbsp;</p>



 The next level of data integration 



<p>Data integration is vital to modern data fabric architectures, especially since an organization’s data is in a hybrid, multi-cloud&nbsp;environment and multiple formats. With data residing in various disparate locations, data integration tools have evolved to support multiple deployment models. With the increasing adoption of cloud and AI, fully managed deployments for integrating data from diverse, disparate sources have become popular.&nbsp;For example, fully managed deployments on IBM Cloud enable users to take a hands-off approach with a serverless service and benefit from&nbsp;application efficiencies like automatic maintenance, updates and installation.</p>



<p>Another deployment option is the&nbsp;self-managed approach, such as a software application deployed on-premises, which offers&nbsp;users full control over their business-critical data, thus lowering data privacy, security and sovereignty risks.</p>



<p>The remote execution engine is a fantastic technical development which takes data integration to the next level. It combines the strengths of fully managed and&nbsp;self-managed deployment models to provide end users the utmost flexibility.</p>



<p>There are several styles of data integration. Two of the more popular methods,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/etl">extract, transform, load (ETL</a>) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/elt">extract, load, transform (ELT)</a>, are&nbsp;both&nbsp;highly performant and scalable. Data engineers build data pipelines, which are called data integration tasks or jobs, as incremental steps to perform data operations and orchestrate these data pipelines in an overall workflow. ETL/ELT tools typically have two components: a&nbsp;design time&nbsp;(to design data integration jobs) and a&nbsp;runtime&nbsp;(to execute data integration jobs).</p>



<p>From a deployment perspective, they have been packaged together, until now. The remote engine execution is revolutionary in the sense that it&nbsp;decouples&nbsp;design time and runtime, creating a separation between the control plane and data plane where data integration jobs are run. The remote engine manifests as a container that can be run on any container management platform or natively on any cloud container services. The remote execution engine can run data integration jobs for cloud to cloud, cloud to on-premises, and on-premises to cloud workloads. This enables you to keep the design timefully managed, as you deploy the engine (runtime) in a&nbsp;customer-managed&nbsp;environment, on any cloud such as in your VPC, any data center and any geography.</p>



<p>This innovative flexibility keeps data integration jobs closest to the business data with the&nbsp;customer-managed&nbsp;runtime. It prevents the&nbsp;fully managed&nbsp;design time from touching that data,&nbsp;improving&nbsp;security and performance while retaining the&nbsp;application efficiency&nbsp;benefits of a fully managed model.</p>



<p>The remote engine allows ETL/ELT jobs to be designed once and run anywhere. To reiterate, the remote engines’ ability to provide ultimate deployment flexibility has compounding benefits:</p>



 
 Users reduce data movement by executing pipelines where data lives. 



 Users lower egress costs. 



 Users minimize network latency. 



 As a result, users boost pipeline performance while ensuring data security and controls. 
 



<p>While there are several business use cases where this technology is advantageous, let’s examine these three:&nbsp;</p>



 1.&nbsp;Hybrid cloud data integration 



<p>Traditional data integration solutions often face latency and scalability challenges when integrating data across hybrid cloud environments. With a remote engine, users can run&nbsp;data pipelines&nbsp;anywhere, pulling from on-premises and cloud-based data sources,&nbsp;while still maintaining high performance. This enables organizations to use the scalability and cost-effectiveness of cloud resources while keeping sensitive data on-premises for compliance or security reasons.</p>



<p>Use case scenario:&nbsp;Consider a financial institution that needs to aggregate customer transaction data from both on-premises databases and cloud-based SaaS applications. With a remote runtime, they can deploy ETL/ELT pipelines within their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vpc">virtual private cloud (VPC)</a>&nbsp;to process sensitive data from on-premises sources while still accessing and integrating data from cloud-based sources. This hybrid approach helps to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements while taking advantage of the scalability and agility of cloud resources.</p>



 2.&nbsp;Multicloud data orchestration&nbsp;and cost savings 



<p>Organizations are increasingly adopting multicloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in and to use best-in-class services from different cloud providers. However, orchestrating data pipelines across multiple clouds can be complex and expensive due to ingress and egress operating expenses (OpEx). Because the remote runtime engine supports any flavor of containers or Kubernetes, it simplifies multicloud data orchestration by allowing users to deploy on any cloud platform and with ideal cost flexibility.</p>



<p>Transformation styles like TETL (transform, extract, transform, load) and SQL Pushdown also synergies well with a remote engine runtime to capitalize on source/target resources and limit data movement, thus further reducing costs. With a multicloud data strategy, organizations need to optimize for data gravity and data locality. In TETL, transformations are initially executed within the source database to process as much data locally before following the traditional ETL process. Similarly, SQL Pushdown for ELT pushes transformations to the target database, allowing data to be extracted, loaded, and then transformed within or near the target database. These approaches minimize data movement, latencies, and egress fees by leveraging integration patterns alongside a remote runtime engine, enhancing pipeline performance and optimization, while simultaneously offering users flexibility in designing their pipelines for their use case.</p>



<p>Use case scenario:&nbsp;Suppose that a retail company uses a combination of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting their e-commerce platform and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for running AI/ML workloads. With a remote runtime, they can deploy ETL/ELT pipelines on both AWS and GCP, enabling seamless data integration and orchestration across multiple clouds. This ensures flexibility and interoperability while using the unique capabilities of each cloud provider.</p>



 3.&nbsp;Edge computing data processing 



<p>Edge computing is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare and IoT. However, traditional ETL deployments are often centralized, making it challenging to process data at the edge where it is generated. The remote execution concept unlocks the potential for edge data processing by allowing users to deploy lightweight, containerized ETL/ELT engines directly on edge devices or within edge computing environments.</p>



<p>Use case scenario:&nbsp;A manufacturing company needs to perform near real-time analysis of sensor data collected from machines on the factory floor. With a remote engine, they can deploy runtimes on edge computing devices within the factory premises. This enables them to preprocess and analyze data locally, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements, while still maintaining centralized control and management of data pipelines from the cloud.</p>

				  Know-your-Customer (KYC) processing just became easier and less expensive. With new decentralized identity technologies important client information is collected once, and can be reused repeatedly by using verifiable credentials to hold and share data.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>What is KYC?</p>
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) refers to the data collection process that financial institutions do to authenticate customer or client identity, assess financial risk, and attempt to avoid fraud. establish</p>
<p>KYC can be broken down into three steps that most financial institutions will take when opening an account or qualifying a customer for a loan.</p>
 
 Customer Identification Program 
 
<p>Financial firms must obtain four pieces of identifying information about a client: name, date of birth, address, and identification number (usually taxpayer identification number).</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence 
 
<p>This is the process where all of a customer’s documents are collected to verify their identity and evaluate their risk profile for suspicious account activity.</p>
 
 Enhanced Due Diligence (optional) 
 
<p>Sometimes additional information is collected for customers that are suspected to be at a higher risk of infiltration, terrorism financing, or money laundering.</p>
<p>KYC is also regulated by several government agencies to reduce money laundering, and is often associated with Anti-Money Laundering policies (AML).</p>
<p>The drawbacks of traditional KYC</p>
<p>KYC’s main drawback is that it is time consuming to do, and becomes even more time consuming when you have to do it multiple times for multiple applications or organizations. For example a bank will need to do KYC to open an account for a customer, and then need to do it again to approve them for a loan. If the bank needs to refer this customer to a partner organization that organization will also need to do their own KYC to verify that customer. This is a lot of documentation for the applicant to collect and repeatedly submit, and takes considerable time, effort, and expense to repeatedly verify.</p>
<p>Each instance of KYC costs a financial institution <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=A%20single%20KYC%20verification%20can,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year.">between $13 and $130 per customer, with </a>corporate clients costing considerably more —&nbsp;one survey reported between <a href="https://resources.fenergo.com/blogs/the-cost-of-kyc-compliance-in-finance-how-digitalization-helps">$1,501 and $3,500 per review</a>. With banks having thousands of customers, and each customer potentially needing to do KYC multiple times, the average spending on KYC per bank hovers around <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=A%20single%20KYC%20verification%20can,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year.">60 million dollars annually.</a></p>
<p>The time it takes to do KYC for a customer or client can be anywhere from 31 to 180 days.</p>
<p>Re-usable KYC through Decentralized Identity&nbsp;</p>
<p>KYC is necessary (and regulated by the government) so it’s not going away, but we can make it much more efficient by reducing the amount of duplication.</p>
<p>The key value proposition presented by decentralized identity is that once you have verified the relevant financial data that same data can be verified repeatedly with the same level of assurance. How is this possible?</p>
<p>Once the KYC process has been conducted satisfactorily, a financial institution issues their customer or client with a verifiable credential containing all the details and relevant data from the initial KYC process. This information is digitally signed.</p>
<p>When the customer or client wants to share their KYC data with another party (or even the same financial institution), the authenticity of the credential is verified through cryptography (by checking a record on a distributed ledger) and the digital signatures provide proof that the data presented in the credential hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is like a cryptographic wrapper that can seal any kind of information. Try to change the information and the seal is broken. The nature of decentralized identity is that the source of the wrapper can always be known and cryptographically verified, which means if you trust the source’s KYC process — such as that of a financial institution — you can trust the information presented by the credential holder.</p>
<p>A KYC credential can contain all kinds of information that could be necessary for a financial institution to have, but annoying or time consuming for a customer to acquire, for example: Proof of address, government ID number, proof of employment, proof of annual income, and more.</p>
<p>Once this process is more automated with decentralized identity, this information only needs to be collected one time or if the credential is set to expire. We can remove the need for partner organizations or other departments to re-do work that has already been done, saving customers time and stress, and organizations millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Collect once, verify often.</p>

<p>In recent years, cloud adoption services have accelerated, with companies increasingly moving from traditional on-premises hosting to public cloud solutions. However, the rise of hybrid and multi-cloud patterns has led to challenges in optimizing value and controlling cloud expenditure, resulting in a shift from capital to operational expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-09-gartner-says-more-than-half-of-enterprise-it-spending#:~:text=By%202025%2C%2051%25%20of%20IT,up%20from%2057.7%25%20in%202022.">According to a Gartner report</a>, cloud operational expenses are expected to surpass traditional IT spending, reflecting the ongoing transformation in expenditure patterns by 2025. FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that aims to maximize business value in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. But without a thorough understanding, adopting FinOps can be challenging. To maximize benefits and realize the potential of FinOps, organizations must forge a clear path and avoid common mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Enhanced capabilities to drive growth&nbsp; 



<p>FinOps is closely intertwined with DevOps and can represent a radical transformation for many organizations. It necessitates a revised approach to cost and value management, challenging organizations to move beyond their comfort zones and embrace continuous innovation. To achieve this, development teams, product owners, finance, and commercial departments must come together to rethink and reimagine how they collaborate and operate. This collective effort is essential for fostering a culture of innovation and driving meaningful change throughout the organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FinOps enables your organization to control costs and enhance consistency by managing average compute costs per hour, reducing licensing fees, decreasing total ownership costs, and tracking idle instances. It also drives improved outcomes and performance through enhanced visibility and planning, which includes comparing actual spending against forecasts, ensuring that architecture aligns with business and technological objectives, and increasing automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These improvements lead to faster decision-making, quicker demand forecasting, and more efficient “go” or “no-go” decision processes for business cases. Also, FinOps helps align business and IT goals, fostering an environment where enterprise goals are interconnected, and business cases are developed with clear, quantifiable benefits. This alignment ensures that both existing and new capabilities are enhanced, supporting strategic growth and innovation.&nbsp;</p>



 Challenges and common mistakes when adopting FinOps&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Organizations should develop a phased approach over time instead of attempting to implement everything from day one. Having the right people, processes, and technology in place is essential for validating changes and understanding their impact on the consumption model and usability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s crucial to lay out a clear journey path by defining the current state, establishing the future state, and devising a transition plan from the current to the future state with a clear execution strategy. To ensure repeatability across different organizations or business units within your organization, it’s essential to establish well-defined design principles and maintain consistency in adoption. Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential to track progress effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many organizations are already considering FinOps approaches today, although often not in the most cost-effective manner. Rather than addressing root causes, they apply temporary fixes that result in ongoing challenges. These temporary fixes include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Periodic Reviews: IT teams convene periodically to address performance issues stemming from sizing or overspending, often in response to complaints from finance teams. However, this reactive approach perpetuates firefighting rather than proactive self-optimization.&nbsp; 



 Architecture Patterns: Regular updates to architectural patterns based on new features and native services from hyperscalers may inadvertently introduce complexity without clear metrics for success.&nbsp; 



 External SMEs: Bringing in external subject matter experts for reviews incurs significant costs and requires effort to bring them up to speed. Relying on this approach contributes to ongoing expenses without sustainable improvements.&nbsp; 
 



<p>To avoid these pitfalls, it’s crucial to establish well-defined KPIs, benchmarking, and processes for real-time insights and measurable outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some organizations assign FinOps responsibility to a centralized team for monitoring spending and selecting cloud services. This approach can create silos and hinder visibility into planned changes, leading to dissatisfaction and downstream impacts on service delivery. Federating FinOps activities across the organization ensures broader participation and diverse skills, promoting collaboration and avoiding silos.&nbsp;</p>



 The next steps in your FinOps journey&nbsp; 



<p>Regardless of where you are in your cloud journey, it is never too late to adopt best practices to make your cloud consumption more predictable. IBM Consulting®, along with Apptio as a product, can help you adopt the right architectural patterns for your unique journey. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Seventy-five percent of cybersecurity professionals say the current threat landscape is the most challenging it has been in the last five years, according to the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2023/10/ISC2-Reveals-Workforce-Growth-But-Record-Breaking-Gap-4-Million-Cybersecurity-Professionals">2023 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a>. You’re probably on the hook to secure access for your organization – preventing identity attacks and securing least privilege access. And we know it’s intense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the ways we strive to assist you is by providing accurate, reliable, and timely information to monitor and optimize the strength of your identity and network access security posture. This transparency gives you visibility that’s necessary to assess performance, tenant health, and your plan for improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, we’ve released a series of innovations reinforcing our commitment to transparency. This blog recaps these improvements for you in three parts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Transparency in updates: Helping you know what’s new and coming soon for Microsoft Entra;&nbsp; 
  Transparency in adoption: Providing recommendations and license utilization insights; and&nbsp; 
  Transparency in operations: Tailored insights on SLA performance, scenario health, and sign-ins. &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, all features highlighted in this blog are demonstrated in our video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1ruDHdFdWk">Trust via Transparency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>  <p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope these added capabilities help maximize the value you receive from Microsoft Entra as you consider, deploy, and measure the progress of your Zero Trust approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in updates 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world of technology, change is constant. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-s-top-50-features-of-2023/ba-p/3796392">In 2023, we released over 100 Microsoft Entra updates and new capabilities</a> and communicated this information across announcements, quarterly blogs, and multiple docs locations. Our first investment area of transparency aims to streamline this communication, helping you find and filter the product update information most relevant to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s New hub in Microsoft Entra admin center 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>”What’s New” in Microsoft Entra gives a clear and complete view of Entra product innovation so you can stay informed, evaluate the latest innovations, and eliminate the need to manually track updates. Product updates are categorized into Roadmap and Change Announcements. The roadmap includes public previews and recent general availability releases, while Change Announcements detail modifications to existing features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in adoption 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second investment area, transparency in adoption, focuses on helping you get more value from your Microsoft Entra licenses, giving you visibility to intelligent recommendations for improving configurations and protecting your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra license utilization insights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra license utilization insights help you optimize your Entra licenses, as well as stay compliant by getting insights into the current usage. Today, you can see usage and licenses for Entra ID capabilities such as Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access. In the future, we will expand the license utilization insights to other products in the Microsoft Entra product line.&nbsp;</p>

 Microsoft Entra recommendations 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra recommendations can serve as a trusted advisor for enhancing your security posture and improving employee productivity. With Microsoft Entra recommendations, you get personalized and actionable insights based on best practices and industry standards to help you secure your organization.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in operations 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency in operations focuses on what we're doing to help customers see how available and resilient Microsoft Entra really is, to hold us accountable when issues arise so we can keep improving, and to understand when they have actions to take within their tenant to improve its health. Let’s look at recently announced functionality in reporting, health, and monitoring:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant-level SLA reporting 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monthly tenant-level SLA reporting enables you to monitor your tenant's performance against our Entra ID SLA promise of 99.99% availability in authenticating users and issuing tokens within your tenant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Precomputed health metric streams 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new health metrics isolate relevant signals from activity logs and provide pre-computed, low-latency aggregates every 15 minutes for specific high-value observability scenarios. The first scenarios we’ve enabled are multifactor authentication (MFA), sign-ins for managed or compliant devices, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) sign-ins. We're starting with authentication-related scenarios because they are mission-critical to all our customers, but other scenarios in areas like entitlement management, directory configuration, and app health will be added in time, along with intelligent alerting capabilities in response to anomalous patterns in the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Copilot-assisted assessments 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our third example of our commitment to transparency in operations, we can help you understand how users interact with your organization's resources. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/copilot-security-entra">Microsoft Copilot for Security is embedded in Microsoft Entra</a> so you can more efficiently assess identities and access, plus investigate and resolve identity risks and even complete complex tasks. A great example of this assistance is asking Copilot to give you sign-in logs for a specific user for a specific amount of time, saving you the reporting time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tell us what you think 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my team, transparency isn’t a buzzword; it’s our commitment. As we continue to enhance Microsoft Entra, earning your trust through transparency remains our guiding star.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to you trying these new capabilities and hopefully making them part of your ongoing experience to reduce complexity and effectively manage your identity and network access security solutions.

 The post Where to begin: 3 IBM leaders offer guidance to newly appointed chief AI officers appeared first on IBM Blog.

<p>The number of chief artificial intelligence officers (CAIOs) has almost tripled in the last 5 years, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/rise-in-number-of-chief-ai-officers-5981036/">according to LinkedIn</a>. Companies across industries are realizing the need to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into their core strategies from the top to avoid falling behind. These AI leaders are responsible for developing a blueprint for AI adoption and oversight both in companies and the federal government.</p>



<p>Following a recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=(a)%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20must%20be,they%20are%20put%20to%20use.">executive order</a> by the Biden administration and a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-trends/">meteoric rise</a> in AI adoption across sectors, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a <a href="https://ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AI-in-Government-Memo-Public-Comment.pdf">memo</a> on how federal agencies can seize AI’s opportunities while managing its risks.</p>



<p>Many federal agencies are appointing CAIOs to oversee AI use within their domains, promote responsible AI innovation and address risks associated with AI, including generative AI (gen AI), by considering its impact on citizens. But, how will these CAIOs balance regulatory measures and innovation? How will they cultivate trust?<br><br>Three IBM leaders offer their insights on the significant opportunities and challenges facing new CAIOs in their first 90 days:</p>



 1. “Consider safety, inclusivity, trustworthiness and governance from the beginning.”  



 —Kush Varshney, IBM Fellow 



<p>The first 90 days as chief AI officer will be intense and speed by, but you should nevertheless slow down not take shortcuts. Consider safety, inclusivity, trustworthiness, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">governance</a> from the beginning rather than as considerations to be tacked on to the end. But do not allow the caution and critical perspective of your inner social change agent to extinguish the optimism of your inner technologist. Remember that just because AI is here now, your agency is not absolved of its existing responsibilities to the people. Consider the most vulnerable among us, when specifying the problem, understanding the data, and evaluating the solution.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to reframe fairness from simply divvying up limited resources in some equitable fashion to figuring out how you can care for the neediest. Don’t be afraid to reframe accountability from simply conforming to regulations to stewarding the technology. Don’t be afraid to reframe transparency from simply documenting the choices made after the fact to seeking public input beforehand.</p>



<p>Just like urban planning, AI is infrastructure. Choices made now can affect generations into the future. Be guided by the <a href="https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/seventh-generation-principle">seventh generation principle</a>, but do not succumb to long term existential risk arguments at the expense of clear and present harms. Keep an eye on harms we’ve encountered over several years through traditional machine learning modeling, and also on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/E5KE5KRZ">new and amplified harms</a> we’re seeing through pre-trained foundation models. Choose smaller models whose cost and behavior may be governed. Pilot and innovate with a portfolio of projects; reuse and harden solutions to common patterns that emerge; and only then deliver at scale through a multi-model <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">platform</a> approach.</p>



 2. “Create trustworthy AI development.”  



 —Christina Montgomery, IBM Vice President and Chief Privacy and Trust Officer 



<p>To drive efficiency and innovation and to build trust, all CAIOs should begin by implementing an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-governance">AI governance</a> program to help address the ethical, social and technical issues central to creating trustworthy AI development and deployment.</p>



<p>In the first 90 days, start by conducting an organizational maturity assessment of your agency’s baseline. Review frameworks and assessment tools so you have a clear indication of any strengths and weaknesses that will impact your ability to implement AI tools and help with associated risks. This process can help you identify a problem or opportunity that an AI solution can address.</p>



<p>Beyond technical requirements, you will also need to document and articulate agency-wide ethics and values regarding the creation and use of AI, which will inform your decisions about risk. These guidelines should address issues such as data privacy, bias, transparency, accountability and safety.</p>



<p>IBM has developed trust and transparency principles and an “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/ethics/">Ethics by Design</a>” playbook that can help you and your team to operationalize those principles. As a part of this process, establish accountability and oversight mechanisms to ensure that the AI system is used responsibly and ethically. This includes establishing clear lines of accountability and oversight, as well as monitoring and auditing processes to ensure compliance with ethical guidelines.</p>



<p>Next, you should begin to adapt your agency’s existing governance structures to support AI. Quality AI requires quality data. Many of your existing programs and practices — such as third-party risk management, procurement, enterprise architecture, legal, privacy, and information security — will already overlap to create efficiency and leverage the full power of your agency teams.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The December 1, 2024 deadline to incorporate the minimum risk management practices to safety-impacting and rights-impacting AI, or else stop using the AI until compliance is achieved, will come around quicker than you think. In your first 90 days on the job, take advantage of automated tools to streamline the process and turn to trusted partners, like IBM, to help implement the strategies you’ll need to create responsible AI solutions.</p>



 3. “Establish an enterprise-wide approach.”  



 —Terry Halvorsen, IBM Vice President, Federal Client Development 



<p>For over a decade, IBM has been working with U.S. federal agencies to help them develop AI. The technology has enabled important advancements for many federal agencies in operational efficiency, productivity and decision making. For example, AI has helped the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/irs-ai-automation/">speed up the processing</a> of paper tax returns (and the delivery of tax refunds to citizens), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) <a href="https://fedscoop.com/veterans-benefits-ai-mail-processing/">decrease the time it takes to process</a> veteran’s claims, and the Navy’s Fleet Forces Command <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ai-is-delivering-for-american-sailors-in-the-chow-line/">better plan and balance food supplies</a> while also reducing related supply chain risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM has also long acknowledged the potential risks of AI adoption, and advocated for strong governance and for AI that is transparent, explainable, robust, fair, and secure. To help mitigate risks, simplify implementation, and take advantage of opportunity, all newly appointed CAIOs should establish an enterprise-wide approach to data and a governance framework for AI adoption. Data accessibility, data volume, and data complexity are all areas that must be understood and addressed. ‘Enterprise-wide’ suggests that the development and deployment of AI and data governance be brought out of traditional agency organizational silos. Involve stakeholders from across your agency, as well as any industry partners. Measure your results and learn as you go – both from your agency’s efforts and those of your peers across government.</p>



<p>And finally, the old adage ‘begin with the end in mind’ is as true today as ever. IBM recommends that CAIOs encourage following a use-case driven approach to AI – which means identifying the targeted outcomes and experiences you hope to create and backing the specific AI technologies you’ll use (generative AI, traditional AI, etc.) from there.</p>



 CAIOs leading by example 



<p>Public leadership can set the tone for AI adoption across all sectors. The creation of the CAIO position plays a critical role in the future of AI, allowing our government to model a responsible approach to AI adoption across business, government and industry.</p>



<p>IBM has developed tools and strategies to help agencies adopt AI efficiently and responsibly in various environments. We’re ready to support these new CAIOs as they begin to build ethical and responsible AI implementations within their agencies.</p>

<p>This blog series demystifies enterprise generative AI (gen AI) for business and technology leaders. It provides simple frameworks and guiding principles for your transformative artificial intelligence (AI) journey. In the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/enterprise-generative-ai-made-simple/">previous blog</a>, we discussed the differentiated approach by IBM to delivering enterprise-grade models. In this blog, we delve into why foundation model choices matter and how they empower businesses to scale gen AI with confidence.</p>



 Why are model choices important? 



<p>In the dynamic world of gen AI, one-size-fits-all approaches are inadequate. As businesses strive to harness the power of AI, having a spectrum of model choices at their disposal is necessary to:</p>



 
 Spur innovation: A diverse palette of models not only fosters innovation by bringing distinct strengths to tackle a wide array of problems but also enables teams to adapt to evolving business needs and customer expectations. 



 Customize for competitive advantage: A range of models allows companies to tailor AI applications for niche requirements, providing a competitive edge. Gen AI can be fine-tuned to specific tasks, whether it’s question-answering chat applications or writing code to generate quick summaries. 



 Accelerate time to market: In today’s fast-paced business environment, time is of the essence. A diverse portfolio of models can expedite the development process, allowing companies to introduce AI-powered offerings rapidly. This is especially crucial in gen AI, where access to the latest innovations provides a pivotal competitive advantage. 



 Stay flexible in the face of change: Market conditions and business strategies constantly evolve. Various model choices allow businesses to pivot quickly and effectively. Access to multiple options enables rapid adaptation when new trends or strategic shifts occur, maintaining agility and resilience. 



 Optimize costs across use cases: Different models have varying cost implications. By accessing a range of models, businesses can select the most cost-effective option for each application. While some tasks might require the precision of high-cost models, others can be addressed with more affordable alternatives without sacrificing quality. For instance, in customer care, throughput and latency might be more critical than accuracy, whereas in resource and development, accuracy matters more. 



 Mitigate risks: Relying on a single model or a limited selection can be risky. A diverse portfolio of models helps mitigate concentration risks, helping to ensure that businesses remain resilient to the shortcomings or failure of one specific approach. This strategy allows for risk distribution and provides alternative solutions if challenges arise. 



 Comply with regulations:The regulatory landscape for AI is still evolving, with ethical considerations at the forefront. Different models can have varied implications for fairness, privacy and compliance. A broad selection allows businesses to navigate this complex terrain and choose models that meet legal and ethical standards. 
 



 Selecting the right AI models 



<p>Now that we understand the importance of model selection, how do we address the choice overload problem when selecting the right model for a specific use case? We can break down this complex problem into a set of simple steps that you can apply today:</p>



 
 Identify a clear use case: Determine the specific needs and requirements of your business application. This involves crafting detailed prompts that consider subtleties within your industry and business to help ensure that the model aligns closely with your objectives. 



 List all model options: Evaluate various models based on size, accuracy, latency and associated risks. This includes understanding each model’s strengths and weaknesses, such as the tradeoffs between accuracy, latency and throughput. 



 Evaluate model attributes: Assess the appropriateness of the model’s size relative to your needs, considering how the model’s scale might affect its performance and the risks involved. This step focuses on right-sizing the model to fit the use case optimally as bigger is not necessarily better. Smaller models can outperform larger ones in targeted domains and use cases. 



 Test model options: Conduct tests to see if the model performs as expected under conditions that mimic real-world scenarios. This involves using academic benchmarks and domain-specific data sets to evaluate output quality and tweaking the model, for example, through prompt engineering or model tuning to optimize its performance. 



 Refine your selection based on cost and deployment needs: After testing, refine your choice by considering factors such as return on investment, cost-effectiveness and the practicalities of deploying the model within your existing systems and infrastructure. Adjust the choice based on other benefits such as lower latency or higher transparency. 



 Choose the model that provides the most value: Make the final selection of an AI model that offers the best balance between performance, cost and associated risks, tailored to the specific demands of your use case.

<p>CFOs are the stewards of investment capital, orchestrating a movement with transformative technology and innovation to evolve businesses, accelerate revenue streams and drive meaningful outcomes.</p>



<p>The current business environment has CFOs facing headwinds for decision-making in less-than-ideal conditions with rapidly shifting regulations, tedious reporting standards, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/esg-frameworks">ESG</a> requirements and inflationary pressures; however, the need for growth and profit expansion remains, and as CEOs look for ways to increase productivity, the CFO is emerging as a new advisor on technology and innovation. Despite the headwinds, there are tailwinds in which we can use new technology to enable CFOs to perform in their business partnering roles and drive productivity, cost take out, accuracy, control and business value.</p>



<p>Through new approaches to financial management that incorporate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a>, this advanced technology can help CFOs make more informed, data-driven decisions for their organization that can have major financial implications. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/c-suite-study/ceo">IBM Institute for Business Value CEO study on decision-making in the age of AI</a> found the top priorities for CEOs are technology modernization and productivity, while the three biggest challenges are technology modernization, sustainability and security. Enter the CFO, whose role is more substantial than ever to unlock value and to scale and fund a technology they are still trying to fully understand.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/ceo-ai-finance">Read the report: CEO’s guide to AI in finance</a>



 Unlocking the value 



<p>CFOs are not expected to be technology experts. That said, they do need to understand how to measure the business value created from generative AI across the organization while also using the technology to augment their own skills and capabilities. This new technology can help CFOs do their job better, faster and smarter, in addition to increasing productivity and opening new revenue streams.</p>



<p>The recent IBM Institute for Business Value report <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/ceo-ai-finance">CEO’s Guide to Generative AI on Finance </a>report found “success depends on how quickly finance can turn data into actionable insights.” Generative AI not only opens the door to other revenue streams but also it unlocks value for the finance workforce. The IBM report found that, on average, AI adopters attribute 40% of finance function FTE redeployment to AI.</p>



<p>Augmenting our day-to-day lives with generative AI and creating a digital version of ourselves allows for the AI to essentially become our assistant. There are benefits to being a consumer of AI but far greater benefits for being a value creator. A generative AI agent or assistant can ingest and summarize structured and unstructured data from internal and external sources, parse through it and generate insights and patterns for financial information that can drive business value and potentially identify untapped revenue streams. This frees up a significant amount of time where finance professionals were previously knee deep in spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Those organizations that have already adopted AI have helped reduce sales forecast errors by 57%, reduce uncollectable balances by 43%, and cut monthly close cycle time by 33%, according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/ceo-ai-finance">the IBM Institute for Business Value report</a>. By embracing these technologies CFOs can drive efficiencies and better user experiences for internal and external stakeholders.</p>



 New operating model, skills and competencies 



<p>Generative AI is changing the way that we do business. The office of the CFO needs to adapt to these new ways of working. The combination of a human and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-worker">digital workforce</a> creates a new operating model in addition to new skills and competencies required for the finance organization. CFOs are not expected to be data scientists, but they are expected to understand how the enablement of this technology can drive business value.</p>



<p>While finance functional skills are still needed, a new suite of skills to optimize adoption and consumption of digital services are also required. By augmenting the workforce with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent">virtual assistants</a> that free up capacity, finance professionals can focus their time on higher-skilled capabilities. Instead of spending a significant amount of time in Excel spreadsheets, one might spend some of their time building AI tools that help derive insights and provide better planning and forecasting.</p>



<p>The good news: it is likely easier to teach a finance professional how to use the technology to drive value than it is to teach a data scientist those finance skills. The finance workforce should be value creators and experience designers, enhancing their analytical and technical skills to be able to train and prompt their assistants—fine-tuning, adjusting and improving the digital service. In addition, senior finance executives need to have higher communication and storytelling skills as business partners for CEOs. &nbsp;</p>



 Governance and controls 



<p>Trust is paramount for finance leaders, and CFOs must be able to trust the data needed to make critical business decisions and for required financial and ESG reporting. Technologies like generative AI can spark feelings of skepticism or mistrust of the accuracy of data, particularly for organizations that are reliant on manual processes. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">Data governance</a> is crucial to ensuring a lack of bias or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-hallucinations">hallucinations</a>, establishing greater trust in data and giving CFOs the assurance needed to stand behind their reporting. The findings from the IBM Institute for Business Value report suggest that building governance structures across the finance organization can “[…] bridge governance gaps and develop ethical guidance that will support the ethical adoption of generative AI.”</p>



<p>No matter the task, organizations that embrace generative AI should know that with the right governance in place, CFOs and human employees can free up their time to embrace innovation instead of being averse to the changes that are impending.</p>



 Getting started with generative AI 



<p>It’s important to remember that many organizations are still in early adoption stages and some are hesitant to dive in. But research shows that the further along organizations are in their AI journey, the more value that is delivered.</p>



<p>If your organization is looking to explore generative AI, consider starting with a labor-intensive task, like identifying and mitigating errors in your financial reporting. A good starting point is from a hybrid cloud environment. While most organizations make the shift, cloud infrastructure can become expensive; but with enterprise-scale generative AI, those costs might be compounded. As the report points out, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/finops">FinOps</a>, or financial management for cloud-based investments, “[…] should play a big part in generative AI investment decisions.”</p>



<p>While implementing new technologies can seem overwhelming, not having a technology strategy in place or avoiding adoption might put an organization at risk of losing the competitive business advantage. CFOs are the strategic transformation partners CEOs need to ensure swift and successful generative AI adoption.</p>

<p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the capacity to create new opportunities, disrupt how we work, and change how we think about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2024/03/ai-regulation-at-a-crossroads/">AI regulation</a>. Some predict it will be as disruptive, if not more so, than the widespread adoption of the internet. But with new opportunities come new challenges and threats. While GenAI continues to dominate the attention of businesses, the media, and regulators, it’s also caught the attention of fraudsters.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances mean it’s never been cheaper or easier to be a fraudster. In this brave new digital-first world, fraudsters have more tools at their fingertips than ever before. And it’s set to cost. Online payment fraud losses are <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/fraud-identity/online-payment-fraud-research-report/">predicted to increase</a> from $38 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2028.</p>
 The rise of the GenAI fraudster 
<p>Fraudsters generally fall into two groups: 1. the lone amateur and 2. organized criminal enterprises. Traditionally the latter, with more resources at their disposal, has posed a higher threat to businesses. But GenAI offers even the most amateur fraudsters easy access to more scalable and increasingly sophisticated types of fraud.</p>
<p>The evidence is in the data. Over the last few years, less sophisticated or “easy” fraud dominated. Proprietary data from <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/entrust-completes-acquisition-of-onfido">Onfido, an Entrust company</a>, found that between 2022 and 2023, 80.3% of fraud caught fell into this category. The remainder was classed as “medium” (19.6%) or “hard” (0.1%). But recently there’s been an increase in more sophisticated fraud. Comparing these figures to data from the last six months finds a jump in both medium fraud (accounting for 36.4%) and hard fraud (accounting for 1.4%).</p>
 How fraudsters are using generative AI 
 deepfakes 
<p>GenAI programs have made it easy for anyone to create realistic, fabricated content including audio, photos, and videos. Deepfake videos in particular, sophisticated synthetic media where a person’s likeness is replaced with someone else’s, are becoming increasingly common and convincing. Fraudsters have started using deepfakes to try and bypass biometric verification and authentication methods. These videos can be pre-recorded or generated in real time with a GPU and fake webcam, and typically involve superimposing one person’s face onto another’s.</p>
<p>This type of attack has surged in recent years. Comparing 2023 with 2022, there’s been a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/identity-fraud-report-2024">3,000% increase</a> in deepfake attempts. This is particularly concerning in the realm of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/digital-onboarding">digital onboarding</a> and identity verification, where the integrity of personal identification is paramount.</p>
<p>Currently, a few fraudsters are responsible for creating deepfakes at scale. But the growing popularity of “fraud-as-a-service” offerings (where experienced fraudsters offer their services to others), combined with improvements in deepfake software, suggests their volume and sophistication will increase in 2024.</p>
 Document forgeries 
<p>Many customer due diligence processes involve the authentication of identity documents. But image manipulation software, and the emergence of websites such as OnlyFakes — an online service that sells the ability to create images of identity documents it claims are generated using AI —&nbsp;have made it easier for fraudsters to fake documents.</p>
<p>There are four different ways for fraudsters to create fake documents:</p>
 
 Physical counterfeit: A fake physical document created from scratch 
 Digital counterfeit: A fake digital representation of a document created from scratch (i.e., in Photoshop) 
 Physical forgery: An existing document that is altered or edited 
 Digital forgery: An existing document that is altered or edited using digital tools 
 
<p>Historically, most fake documents were physical counterfeits (fake documents fraudsters created entirely from scratch). In 2023, Onfido identified that 73.2% of all document fraud caught was from physical counterfeits. In the last six months, that’s dropped to 59.56%, with digital forgeries accounting for a larger proportion of document fraud than prior years (34.8%).</p>
<p>This increase in digital forgeries can be attributed to the emergence of websites such as OnlyFakes. Fraudsters have wised up to the fact it’s a faster, cheaper, and more scalable way to create fake documents.</p>
 Synthetic identity fraud 
<p>Synthetic identity fraud is a type of fraud where criminals combine fake and real personal information, such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and names, to create a new identity. This new, fake identity is then used to open fake accounts, access credit, or make fraudulent purchases.</p>
<p>Generative AI tools offer a way for fraudsters to generate fake information for synthetic identities at scale. Fraudsters can use AI bots to scrape personal information from online sources, including online databases and social platforms, before using this information to create synthetic identities.</p>
<p>With synthetic identity fraud projected to generate <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2023/financial-institutions-synthetic-identity-fraud.html?id=us:2el:3dp:wsjspon:awa:WSJRCJ:2023:WSJFY24%3Fid%3Dus:2el:3dp:wsjspon:awa:WSJRCJ:2023:WSJFY24">$23 billion USD in losses</a> by 2030, businesses are adopting advanced fraud detection and prevention technologies to root out synthetic fraud. Keeping fraudsters from entering in the first place with a reliable identity verification solution at onboarding is the foundational element in this detection framework.</p>
 Phishing 
<p>During phishing attacks, fraudsters reach out to individuals via email or other forms of communication requesting they provide sensitive data or click a link to a malicious website, which may contain malware.</p>
<p>Generative AI tools offer fraudsters an easy way to create more sophisticated and personal social engineering scams at scale. For example, using AI tools to write convincing phishing emails or for card cracking. Research has found that the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-breach-identity-fraud-trends-reveal-deepfake-and-generative-ai-threats">top tools used by bad actors</a> in 2023 include the dark web, fraud as a service, and generative AI. This includes the tool wormGPT, which provides a fast method for generating phishing attacks and malicious code.</p>
 Combatting GenAI fraud with… AI 
<p>The advancement in GenAI means we’re entering a new phase of fraud and cyberattacks. But the good news is that any technology fraudsters can access is accessible to those building fraud detection solutions. The best cyber defense systems of tomorrow will need AI to power them to combat the speed and scale of attacks. Think of it as an “AI versus AI showdown.”</p>
<p>With the right training, AI algorithms can recognize the subtle differences between authentic and synthetic images or videos, which are often imperceptible to the human eye. Machine learning, a subset of AI, plays a crucial role in identifying irregularities in digital content. By training on vast datasets of both real and fake media, machine learning models can learn to differentiate between the two with high accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of using AI to fight deepfakes and other GenAI fraud is its ability to continuously learn and adapt. As deepfake technology evolves, so too do the AI algorithms designed to detect them.</p>

<p>Today’s healthcare relies on digital health ecosystems—a network of interconnected digital services. These ecosystems need to accommodate any type of user to support a variety of digital healthcare use cases and innovation. User types not only include consumers, providers, workforces, and partners, but also connected IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) such as remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices, wearables, and medical equipment. And now in the age of artificial intelligence, users also include AI sessions and agents. Digital health ecosystems also include cloud services and third-party partnerships and application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interoperability is a fundamental pillar within this intricate digital web. As healthcare systems evolve, the seamless exchange of health information across diverse digital ecosystems and stakeholders—such as providers, payers, pharmacies, patients/members—is critical. It’s been proven that shared data exchange improves care by informing clinical decisions that result in better patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Healthcare interoperability refers to the ability of different health information technologies to communicate, exchange, and use health information in a coordinated manner, both within and across organizational boundaries, in order to improve healthcare delivery. As discussed below, multiple regulations mandate interoperability. And achieving it is a complex endeavor. For example, interoperability relies on advanced cybersecurity capabilities, a standard called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for data formats and APIs, legal agreements for data sharing, and governance models to manage the data exchange of medical records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interoperable systems are essential to optimize patient care and streamline healthcare delivery. Health information exchange across digital health ecosystems hinges on secure integrations and access management of clinical data, such as electronic health records (EHRs), across various information systems and interfaces. At the heart of this endeavor lies identity and access management (IAM). Healthcare IAM (also known as healthcare identity management) is a crucial component for both achieving healthcare data interoperability and complying with the regulations that mandate it.</p>

   The EU's Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) offers a starting point for digital wallets. It aims to support user control over personal data while meeting legal and cybersecurity requirements. But to get there from here, you need to know what you don't know: the functional and non-functional requirements, along with interfaces and integration points for digital identity wallets

<p>Digital wallets and the credentials they hold are ALL the rage these days. Understanding how to make them work in today’s world is where the EU’s Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) comes in.</p>



<p>If you’ve read my posts about verifiable credentials (<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">this one</a> and <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/15/more-on-the-options-and-diversity-of-verifiable-credentials/">this one</a>), the next logical step is to discuss how those credentials are stored in a digital wallet.</p>



 What’s a Wallet? 



<p>OK, so digital identity wallets may be all the rage, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that people—even techies—have a common understanding of what they are. According to the Open Wallet Foundation:</p>



<p>“A digital wallet is a container where you can store and access digital assets, credentials, and other useful items, such as tickets and keys. Another software component, most often called an agent, can put items into a wallet, take items out of a wallet, or process items in a wallet. While the wallet is the container, the agent is the mover and shaker.” — Gordon Gram, “<a href="https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/LF%20Research/OpenWallet%20Open%20Digital%20Wallet%20-%20Report.pdf?hsLang=en">Why the World Needs an Open Source Digital Wallet Right Now</a>,” Open Wallet Foundation, February 2023.</p>



<p>That’s a good functional definition, though it doesn’t quite help determine the standard technical specifications for the container. But that’s a topic for a future blog post.</p>



 A Framework for Many Moving Parts 



<p>Governments, businesses, and individuals are all concerned with how to give an individual agency over their personal data. This concern is a natural response to the privacy laws that have rolled out worldwide in the last 5+ years. That said, coming up with a structure that supports user agency over their own data while still supporting other legal and cybersecurity-based requirements is a challenge. There are just SO MANY moving parts!</p>



 
 There are the entities that are responsible for the wallets themselves (i.e., the Holders). 



 There are the entities that are responsible for the data that goes into the credentials stored by the wallet (i.e., the Issuers). 



 There are the entities that want to ask for the credential (or some of the data that the credential holds) (i.e., the Verifiers). 
 



<p>But wait, there’s more! There are device manufacturers that have to have equipment capable of managing the cryptography associated with complex digital signatures. Services responsible for building a trusted registry of entities participating in this ecosystem. Entities providing audit services to make sure everything is running securely and according to current legal requirements and best practices. And so on.</p>



<p>With so many moving parts and personal data, is it any wonder the EU decided that further guidance was necessary? How many ways this can go wrong is more than a bit terrifying. And yet, the promises of privacy, security, and agency can’t be ignored. And the ARF is where that work starts.</p>



 Enter the EUDI Architecture Reference Framework 



<p>The ARF is an outline that provides the first blush of a framework for how digital wallets will work in the EU. The European Commission kicked off the work through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/26/european-digital-identity-eid-council-adopts-legal-framework-on-a-secure-and-trustworthy-digital-wallet-for-all-europeans/">Commission Recommendation</a>&nbsp;from June 2021 that urged Member States to develop common standards, technical specifications, and best practices in response to the eIDAS 2.0 regulation. EU Member States sent their experts to join a collaborative process to build the framework.</p>



<p>The work was done very openly via a public&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework">GitHub repository</a>, letting people see and comment on the changes as the work developed.</p>



<p>While using the framework isn’t required to comply with eIDAS 2.0, it’s still the best way to help meet the goal of an interoperable environment for digital wallets. Other countries and companies should see this as a great place to start.&nbsp;</p>



 Highlights 



<p>The ARF isn’t a particularly long document—it’s a comprehensive outline, after all, not the complete guidance— but it is dense with information! Here are a few highlights:</p>



<p>1. Functional Requirements Are A Thing: If your organization is exploring using digital verifiable credentials, then you could do worse than start here. And if you are interested in using digital verifiable credentials AND have a presence in the EU, then you REALLY want to start here. A wallet needs to be able to do a variety of things. From the ability to perform electronic identification, store and manage qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes, and provide mutual authentication capabilities, this isn’t something you want to get wrong. Given that, the level of detail in the ARF is great kickstarter guide for developers and stakeholders on the technical expectations and capabilities required for the EUDI Wallet. It’s an opportunity to mitigate “you don’t know what you don’t know” when making plans in the digital wallet world.</p>



<p>2. It’s Not All Technical Details: The ARF outline includes space for non-functional requirements, including guidance on security, privacy by design, and user control over personal data. Having a presence in the EU and a reliance on government-issued credentials means playing in the digital wallet and verifiable credential landscape. The ARF puts the framework in a context that will help you comply with the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks while providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>



<p>3. But if You Want to Talk about Interfaces and Integration Points: The framework will specify various interfaces and integration points for a digital identity wallet (specifically the EUDI Wallet) with external entities like Member States’ infrastructures, identity cards, and trusted registries. You probably could go a trial-and-error route to figure out how to integrate with this digital ecosystem, but life is too short. Use the guidance to save time; it’s freely available.</p>



 What Happens Next? 



<p>As with any v1.0, you can expect changes. The ARF will evolve from an outline to a complete Architecture and Reference Framework. The authors intend to expand this outline into a comprehensive framework as set out in the Commission Recommendation, and it will be aligned with the outcomes of the legislative negotiations regarding the proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As noted earlier, the ARF has its own GitHub repository, and you are free to offer feedback if you have ideas and experience that will help improve the framework.</p>



 How Globally Applicable is the ARF? 



<p>If you ask me (and it’s my blog), deployers can and should use the ARF as the basis for large-scale wallet deployments worldwide. But others may not agree. The US, in particular, is much more chaotic regarding wallet deployments as each US State is deciding independently of others whether they will build their own or use ones from Google or Apple. The US Federal Government’s Department of Homeland Security is also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2023/06/22/st-seeks-solutions-privacy-preserving-digital-credential-wallets-verifiers">doing amazing work</a> in the verifiable credential and digital wallet space. Still, they don’t have the same level of mandate that regulations like eIDAS2, GDPR, etc, provide in the European Union.&nbsp;</p>

It highlights the necessity of transitioning from legacy systems that are ill-equipped for the demands of cloud computing and diverse user groups, towards more agile, scalable, and integrated IAM solutions. This transition is not merely technical but strategic, ensuring IAM systems can support a wide array of identities, from employees to customers and devices, and play a critical role in securing digital interactions across various platforms and services.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>As I was writing about Oracle’s new <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/oracle-sql-firewall">SQL Firewall</a> some time ago, I had no idea it will be published on the same day the company officially announced the general availability of its flagship database product, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/">Oracle Database 23ai</a>. What a coincidence! And what a twist with the new name!</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the name, by the way. On the one hand, it appears to be the most unnecessary, marketing-driven change ever. I can vividly imagine thousands of DBAs, developers, consultants, journalists, and other IT professionals rolling their eyes and scratching their heads. Now they must update all their documentation and writings to reflect it, and that time could have been spent on more productive things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in contrast to many other vendors throwing “AI” into their product names, Oracle does have quite a lot to show for it. Artificial intelligence was, of course, a substantial part of the database for quite some time already. The concept of the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/for-oracle-the-future-is-autonomous">Autonomous Database</a> was introduced back in 2017. Machine learning algorithms have been a part of the database core for years as well. However, in 2024, the only kind of AI everyone is talking about is Generative AI. And so, among over 300 major new features, the new release introduces several new ones crucial for not just enabling GenAI capabilities for business applications, but implementing them in a universal, globally scalable, secure and, last but not least, compliant manner.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most notable addition is <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/ai-vector-search/">AI Vector Search</a>, a set of capabilities to enable native support for generating, storing, indexing, and querying vector data directly in the database. This is, of course, a crucial requirement for implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the accuracy of large language model responses with additional information from external sources (such as an organization’s own sensitive information that it does not want to share with LLM operators in any other way).</p>
<p>Now Oracle Database 23ai can natively support storing vector embeddings for unstructured content in the same table as existing relational data. This allows for creating complex queries across them, combining traditional SQL with semantic search, as well as geospatial information, graphs, and so on – which is impossible with a standalone vector database. In contrast, Oracle’s converged database approach keeps all data in a single location, where it is uniformly protected by layers of data security controls, including the SQL Firewall.</p>
<p>When running on the Oracle Exadata platform, its underlying smart storage technology will even natively accelerate vector search operations to run AI applications at a massive scale. Curiously, even if you are not yet ready to migrate your application to the 23ai release, it is still possible to replicate existing data from other sources using the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/integration/goldengate/">GoldenGate 23ai</a> service and let Oracle Cloud handle the AI operations for you.</p>
<p>Another major feature introduced in the new release is <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/json-relational-duality/">JSON Relational Duality</a>, a technology that aims to solve the decades-long debate between the fans of the relational and the document data models. Until now, the developers were forced to make an early design decision between the efficiency and consistency of SQL and the simplicity and flexibility of NoSQL, and to resort to additional middleware layers to address the shortcomings of both approaches.</p>
<p>With JSON Relational Duality Views (what a mouthful of a name!), developers no longer need to make this choice. It is now possible to store data in relational format but access it in the form of JSON documents. A view can be declared across multiple tables with a structure described using the familiar GraphQL syntax. The database then takes care of all the rest, including automated table updates when documents are modified, lock-free concurrency control to support stateless operations, and making the data available across a range of APIs, from SQL to REST or even MongoDB.</p>
<p>While the idea might sound somewhat trivial in hindsight, implementing it in a scalable, reliable, and standardized way has required years of research and development. But now the capability is officially available, and developers are encouraged to try it – even the free edition of the database includes the feature, along with the similarly improved Property Graph Views.</p>
<p>I have no intention to mention every of the 300 features introduced in the new release, but one thing that is especially close to me both as an analyst covering data security and compliance solutions and as a citizen of the European Union is Oracle’s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/distributed-database/">Globally Distributed Database</a>. With the introduction of built-in RAFT-based replication, the new release brings the concept of database sharding to a new level of scalability and performance. A global, hyperscale database that is distributed and replicated across multiple geographical locations in real-time is now a reality – and the data within it can be transparently localized according to complex rules.</p>
<p>For example, all information linked to EU citizens will be stored only in datacenters located in Germany, enforcing the EU data sovereignty regulations, while the data related to Indian citizens will be only kept within the borders of India. And yet, for business applications, the entire customer base will appear as a single table, enabling efficient but still compliant transactions and analytics. With new privacy regulations being introduced constantly, adapting existing applications becomes a matter of just adding new sharding rules to the database – no need to change anything in the business logic.</p>
<p>All these new capabilities are now officially available in the Oracle Cloud, both in their public regions and in the Cloud@Customer private cloud, as well as in Microsoft Azure as a part of Oracle’s and Microsoft’s joint <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-at-azure/">Oracle Database@Azure</a> offering. The on-prem availability is yet to be announced.</p>

<a href="https://yeshid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Onboarding-Template-9-May-2024.mp4">https://yeshid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Onboarding-Template-9-May-2024.mp4</a> 
<p>YeshID’s mission is to deliver identity &amp; access solutions that are simple, secure, and trustworthy. Today, we’re releasing our first AI agent. It’s designed to simplify onboarding and offboarding workflows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why onboarding and offboarding? These workflows are mandatory for SOC2 compliance. Crafting playbooks for specific roles often becomes a major source of IAM admin friction and frustration.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshlist/">YeshList blog post</a>, we discussed how we tackled this problem when we created task templates. The first templates we made were for onboarding and offboarding. Introducing AI takes it a step further and makes it even easier.</p>
<p>Simply describe the type of playbook you need, and our AI will suggest a workflow optimized to meet SOC2 standards. This gives you a solid foundation, making editing and customization faster than starting from scratch.</p>
<p>Why this matters to you:</p>
 
 Save time: Focus on the strategic aspects of IAM, not repetitive tasks. 
 Reduce risk: Get AI-driven help to craft comprehensive playbooks, minimizing errors. 
 Gain confidence: Every action is transparent and auditable, building trust in the process. 
 
<p>Experience YeshID LLM by visiting <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/tasks-templates">task templates in YeshID</a> and learn how it can enhance your employee onboarding workflows. (Coming soon–support for offboarding and the messy middle.)</p>
 The Power of AI, Guided by Our Principles 
<p>We’ve been experimenting with LLMs for a while. We saw their potential to revolutionize identity and access management. Incorporating LLM reasoning capabilities will be a productivity multiplier, resulting in a better, more secure, and seamless experience for IAM managers and employees alike. We have a lot planned, and our plans are rooted in our core principles:</p>
 
 Simple: We believe technology should make your life easier, not harder. 
 Secure: Protecting your data is our utmost priority. 
 Trustworthy: We build on a firm foundation of transparency and reliability. 
 
 Responsible AI: Balancing Innovation with Caution 
<p>AI can reason and use tools to intelligently evaluate and automate access requests, enforce security policies, perform audits, handle employee onboarding and offboarding, resolve integration issues, provide real-time support, optimize spending, and more. Much more. It’s a powerful tool that can work 24/7, reduce human error, and provide invaluable insights.</p>
<p>But, as we have all learned, there are problems. AIs can hallucinate, be tricked, and create disaster at scale. That’s why we will only ship AI-powered features when we’re confident they are secure, reliable, and work as you expect them to.</p>
 AI as Your Trusted Partner 
<p>We believe in a future where AI empowers IAM managers to be more effective and secure. It’s a future where routine tasks are handled seamlessly, and you can focus on what matters most. Our commitment to our principles means we’ll bring you these innovations quickly and responsibly, ensuring your experience with YeshID remains simple, secure, and trustworthy. We move fast, and much more is coming soon.</p>
<p>If you’d like to see how YeshAI can help you make better onboarding decisions, check out the bot on our website <a href="https://yeshid.com/yeshid-copilot/">here</a>. </p>
<p>However, if you are ready to experience the power, security, and compliance of an AI-enhanced IAM, then <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/tasks-templates">signup</a> to get started with YeshID for free.</p>

				  In a new <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/complete-zero-trust-with-decentralized-identity/">White Paper</a> from Indicio, Trevor Butterworth, Chase Cunningham, and Will Groah explain the importance of understanding how identity and security are connected and that a Zero Trust strategy for security can only be fully realized through a decentralized approach to identity.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Zero Trust and Decentralized Identity</p>
<p>The concepts of Zero Trust and Decentralized Identity emerged in the early 2000s as responses to the escalating problems around data breaches and identity theft.</p>
<p>Zero Trust meant what it said: trust no one and continuously verify for narrow access to network resources.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity tackled the underlying reason digital identities couldn’t be trusted: the architecture of identity access and management couldn’t offer the privacy and security protection needed to protect personal data.</p>
<p>Any network defense could be broken if the identity of a user was compromised, and a system of storing user identity in centralized databases and using passwords for access was an endless source of risk.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity completes Zero Trust because it creates a seamless, cryptographic way to verify identity without centralizing personal data or needing logins and passwords, meaning that a network could always be certain of the identity of those trying to access their systems and could manage continuous verification in a maximally frictionless way.</p>
<p>Why then has Zero Trust largely ignored Decentralized Identity? Because security and identity teams often have different organizational responsibilities when a strong security posture means that both are inextricably linked. The authors argue, however, that without decentralized identity, Zero Trust cannot be fully embraced and implemented.</p>
<p>How can you get started?</p>
<p>The first step is to read the latest <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/complete-zero-trust-with-decentralized-identity/">White Paper</a> on this topic. The authors show how zero trust and decentralized identity can work together and the benefits your organization can receive.</p>

<p>The team here at 1Kosmos is excited to announce the release of 1Kosmos 1Key, a phishing-resistant biometric security key that supports authentication for unlimited users per device. The 1Key reduces costs and defeats security vulnerabilities associated with lost, stolen, and shared keys.</p>
<p>Safeguarding sensitive information with passwordless multi-factor authentication is difficult to deliver for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF), manufacturing clean rooms, customer help desks, higher education labs, retail bank branches, healthcare providers, and other restricted environments because access to mobile devices is not permitted and we are addressing these challenges head-on. 1Key is a FIDO-compliant innovative biometric security key designed to revolutionize access control in secure facilities, shared workstations, and kiosks.</p>
<p>The 1Key is the latest 1Kosmos authentication method that organizations can use to address their security challenges. In this instance, we are delivering a FIDO-compliant innovative biometric security key designed to revolutionize access control in secure facilities, shared workstations, and kiosks. The experience is seamless, includes Windows login support, and is compatible with any WebAuthn service or application.</p>
<p>The benefits of the 1Key are significant as security teams no longer need to assign every user a physical key, provide a cost advantage over conventional keys, and eliminate other forms of MFA (multi-factor authentication). Organizations can now easily defeat unauthorized access due to key sharing and improve cycle time for customer-facing business processes, especially where login to multiple systems is required.</p>
<p></p>
 The 1Kosmos Advantage 
<p>1Key is a FIDO2 passkey and CTAP2 compliant, providing interoperability across various systems and delivering the following capabilities:</p>
 
 Users will register their biometrics at the time of onboarding and will then have passwordless access to any supported desktop. The register once-use-anywhere improves onboarding and eliminates passwords for enrolled users. 
 Open, scalable, and interoperable passwordless authentication for organizations whose workers are dynamically assigned a workspace. 
 User/role specific access control policies that improve the authentication experience and allow enrolled employees to use their biometrics to log in to secured desktops without a password. 
 Phishing-resistant passwordless access to any supported desktop, once users have registered their biometrics. 
 Optionally combine NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) 800-63-3 IAL2-certified identity to the authentication experience. 
 
<p></p>
<p>With cybersecurity threats on the rise, it is more important than ever for organizations to prioritize security, no matter the environment. That is where 1Kosmos excels, and 1Key offers a revolutionary approach to authentication, combining the convenience of passwordless access with the security of biometric technology. For organizations looking to enhance their security posture in multi-user and restricted environments, 1Kosmos 1Key is the answer.</p>

 We spoke with Sébastien Marteau, Chief Commercial Officer at <a href="https://european-index.fluctuo.com/">Fluctuo</a>, about the latest trends in carsharing, decarbonization in the transport sector, the future of the industry and the challenges it faces. 



 Are carsharing services becoming increasingly popular? If so, what factors are contributing to their success? 



<p>Yes, certainly. Carsharing is a cost-effective way of ensuring that you only pay for a car when you really need one. The economic benefits are real when you factor in all the costs associated with a car (purchase, maintenance, fuel, insurance, etc.).</p>



<p>In times of inflation, carsharing services represent a real gain for the consumer. They make it possible to share a vehicle. What’s more, carsharing is seen as an inclusive mode of transport, facilitating access to cars for people who don’t always have the means to own one.</p>



<p>Last but not least, carsharing services respond to ecological imperatives that are increasingly resonant in today’s society.</p>



<p>On a European scale, carsharing services saw strong growth in 2023. Data from our latest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/european-shared-mobility-index-2023-flucto/">European Shared Mobility Index 2023</a> on free-floating services, which covers 115 cities in Europe, shows an increase in the size of shared car fleets of 25%, while the number of journeys has risen by 39%, especially with very dynamic countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Norway.</p>



 
   
     
                     European Shared Mobility Index 2023 – by Fluctuo. 
                     Learn more about the future of shared mobility, including a country-specific break-down of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/whats-propelling-the-mobility-industry/">mobility trends</a>&nbsp;and the increasing importance of identity verification technology.

 How is the carsharing economy shaping up today? 



<p>The carsharing market is a mix of two types of players: private players, often linked to carmakers and positioned on free-floating services; and associations or user groups covering station-based services. The latter are sometimes partly financed by public authorities to enable them to develop.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, costs remain one of the major issues in the carsharing economy, such as those inherent in parking or vandalism.</p>



<p>To <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/whats-propelling-the-mobility-industry/">develop this economy</a>, there is a real need for operators to collaborate and share data, so as to develop the use of carsharing. The aim is to unite in order to give visibility to this emerging industry and contribute to the sector’s economic growth.</p>



 What do you see as the future of green mobility? 



<p>The future of green mobility is linked to the reduction in the number of private cars and the development of a modal shift toward active, low-carbon modes such as walking, cycling and public transport. According to the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the car still accounts for the majority of home-to-work journeys of less than 2km (52.9%), so we absolutely must accelerate the modal shift to low-carbon modes.</p>



<p>If Europe is to achieve its objectives of climate neutrality by 2050 and a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 levels, emissions from the transport sector will have to fall by almost 80% by 2040.</p>



<p>Decarbonizing road transport, switching to zero-emission vehicles and improving public transport and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> will also have a direct impact on air quality and, consequently, on the health of all Europeans. The transition to climate neutrality implies the promotion of sustainable and affordable mobility, thanks to appropriate urban planning, which will be important in enabling more public transport, carsharing, car-pooling and active mobility such as walking and cycling for short-distance journeys. Ensuring <a href="https://northsearegion.eu/share-north/news/translating-shared-mobility-for-rural-areas-the-rosetta-stone-for-car-sharing-in-small-towns/">access for all</a> to affordable and accessible net-zero energy and mobility solutions will be an essential part of the transition. Carsharing will also need to be integrated into public transport plans and develop multimodality if it is to be democratized.</p>



 As more and more cities realize the importance of zero-emission mobility and take steps in this direction, how can carsharing services contribute to green mobility? 



<p>Carsharing is a gas pedal of de-motorization: By offering a simple, accessible solution for journeys requiring a car, carsharing enables its users to replace their personal vehicle. In the case of an individual vehicle, it is estimated that it remains stationary 95% of the time. Taking France as an example, we estimate that a “loop” carsharing vehicle replaces between 5 and 8 private vehicles. In some countries, it can even replace 12-15 cars. So there’s a real need to reduce the number of private vehicles to cut carbon emissions.</p>



<p>Carsharing also accelerates multimodality: carsharing users make greater use of public transport (+18%), trains (+29%), bicycles (+22%) and walking (+38%). The integration of carsharing services in rail and bus stations is very important.</p>



 Do carsharing operators have to comply with any specific regulations today? 



<p>A carsharing operator is often required to obtain a license to operate in a given territory, as well as to pay for the parking of its fleet. From the user’s point of view, the operator is also obliged to check that <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">the user has a valid license</a>, and ultimately to verify the user’s identity.</p>



<p>Cities and transport authorities have found it difficult to regulate carsharing. Regulations have often been too restrictive, limiting the operational capabilities of these services and affecting their business model. They have tended to focus on limiting the impact of the system, rather than working with operators to maximize the overall benefits of the mobility system. In some cases, the limits imposed on zone access and parking have led operators to withdraw.</p>



 What are the main challenges facing carsharing operators today? 



<p>Carsharing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">operators face a number of challenges</a>:</p>



  Vandalism is having a real impact on the profitability of some operators, resulting in very expensive insurance policies. In the UK, for example, it seems that no private insurers are entering this market any more. Detecting incidents is therefore essential, so that the user is reimbursed for any damage caused;  Migration to electric vehicles. Only 11% of cars in stations in France are electric, compared with 79% for free-floating. This migration will involve educating users about their mode of operation;  Profitability. Many have struggled to become profitable due to high operating costs, poor coordination with competitors, narrow scope of action and unfavorable sharing models with municipalities (inadequate parking agreements).  



 What solutions are carsharing operators looking for to facilitate and secure the use of their services? 



<p>With the explosion in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">generative AI</a>, driver’s license fraud and document forgery are on the rise. Given their strong growth, there is a major challenge around the identification and authentication of users in vehicles. It is vital for operators to integrate very strict <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">identity verification solutions</a>, at the risk of undermining the profitability of their business model.</p>

 The CIAM Market (Customer Identity and Access Management) is undergoing significant transformations. As businesses increasingly recognize CIAM’s critical role in securing and managing customer identities on digital platforms, this market is poised for substantial growth—from <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/customer-identity-and-access-management-buyers-guide-2024/">$6.2 billion in 2024 to $10.8 billion by 2028</a>. This growth underscores the evolution of CIAM solutions from basic tools to essential, strategic business solutions. 



 







 



<p>Despite substantial ROI from CIAM—such as operational cost reductions and revenue growth—organizations face challenges with their existing systems. A significant issue is siloed and unauthoritative identity data management, further complicated by data privacy regulations that disrupt identity management across organizational divisions. This challenge is magnified by the need to balance stringent security with a fluid user experience, rendering traditional, inflexible CIAM solutions less effective.</p>



<p>With the market’s maturity, dissatisfaction with standard, non-customizable CIAM solutions is growing. About 49% of respondents, particularly from financial services, are considering switching providers to seek more advanced, customizable solutions that better integrate across applications and manage identities seamlessly. This drive for innovation is fueled by emerging security and compliance challenges and the necessity to support scalable operations and enhance customer engagement and retention effectively.</p>



<p>The CIAM market is shifting towards more flexible, customizable, and integrative solutions.

<p></p> 
<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-external-authentication-methods-in-microsoft/ba-p/4078808">Microsoft announced</a> the public preview of external authentication methods (EAM) for Entra ID. As a close partner, HYPR has worked extensively with Microsoft on the new offering and we are excited to be one of the first external authentication method integrations. This means organizations can now choose HYPR phishing-resistant authentication for their Entra ID MFA method, use it in Entra ID Conditional Access policies, Privileged Identity Management, and more.</p>  
<p>Our goal at Microsoft Security is to empower our customers with cutting-edge security solutions. The integration of Entra ID external authentication methods with HYPR reflects this mission, providing our customers with the flexibility to employ their preferred MFA methods, including phishing resistant MFA, to defend their environments against evolving threats."</p> 
<p>– Natee Pretikul, Principal Product Management Lead, Microsoft Security</p> 
 What Are Entra ID External Authentication Methods?  
<p>The external authentication methods feature was developed to replace the current Entra ID custom controls capability. The EAM solution uses industry standards and supports an open model, and provides far greater functionality than custom controls. With EAM, organizations can use their preferred authentication provider to satisfy MFA policy requirements, managing it the same way as Microsoft-native authenticators.</p> 
 Key Benefits of the HYPR and Microsoft External Authentication Methods Integration  
<p>The new integration benefits both HYPR and Microsoft customers on multiple levels.</p> 
<p>How the HYPR Entra ID external authentication method integration works</p> 
 Greater Flexibility and Choice For Your Entra ID Environments&nbsp;  
<p>With the HYPR–EAM integration, organizations can seamlessly use HYPR as an Entra ID authentication method to meet multi-factor authentication requirements, without the need for federation. Unlike federation configurations, the user identity is established and managed in Microsoft Entra ID. Essentially, HYPR’s leading phishing-resistant MFA becomes a like-native authentication option in the Entra ID ecosystem, and can be invoked to satisfy MFA requirements for Conditional Access policies, Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Identity Protection sign-in risk policies.</p> 
 Consolidate and Unify Authentication Processes  
<p>Many enterprises have complex IT environments with multiple identity providers and sign-in processes. These systems operate in silos, creating security blind spots, inefficiencies, and inconsistent user experiences. By choosing a platform-agnostic solution like HYPR, organizations can use the same secure, phishing-resistant authentication across IAM systems and workflows. HYPR already provides tight integrations with Microsoft Entra ID; the new EAM feature expands that connection. It empowers organizations to further consolidate their identity security and create consistent, unified MFA experiences for their users across all Microsoft and non-Microsoft environments.</p> 
 Improve Visibility and Control  
<p>The Microsoft external authentication method integration puts some additional powerful tools into the hands of HYPR customers. Administrators and security teams can view all HYPR authentication events in the Entra ID admin center when HYPR is used as an EAM method.</p> 
<p>Teams also can define highly granular Conditional Access controls, based on the type of authentication factor a user applies as they authenticate with HYPR. For example, access policies can vary depending on whether someone uses a fingerprint, facial recognition or PIN, to add even stronger levels of security assurance for specific use cases or resources.</p> 
 Learn More About HYPR as a Microsoft Entra ID External Authentication Method  
<p>Microsoft Entra ID EAM is now in public preview. Read <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">Microsoft’s technical documentation</a> for more details about how this feature works.

<p>We’ve got a follow-up to Holochain 0.2.6, which was a big one (it was the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-2-is-here/">first recommended release</a> in the 0.2 line). This one brings a new ability to manage clone cells from a coordinator zome (yes, you read that right!), and the Rustdoc is now building again (a blessing to any devs who have needed to read the 0.2 documentation). There are some breaking changes, but only for those who are using the conductor APIs directly rather than through a client.</p><p>I also want to mention The Weave, a project that my colleague Eric and a few close collaborators have been working on in various forms over the years. Originally <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2022_pauldaoust_1866">demoed</a> as a groupware container called We, the <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2022/07/26/id-390?ref=blog.holochain.org">philosophy</a> behind it has matured into a full vision for end-user-composable applications. What the heck does that mean? Skip to the bottom of this article to find out.</p> Holochain 0.2.8: Fix WebSocket binding <p>Release date: 30 April 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x (upgrade to 0.2.7 or newer to get the new features)<br>JS client compatibility: 0.16.x<br>Rust client compatibility: 0.4.x</p><p>This is a patch release that fixes the port binding issue in 0.2.7 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/3731?ref=blog.holochain.org">#3731</a>). We now recommend this release for general development.</p> Holochain 0.2.7: Backend clone management, Websocket fixes, documentation <p>NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE<br>Release date: 9 April 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x (upgrade to 0.2.7 to get the new features)<br>JS client compatibility: 0.16.x<br>Rust client compatibility: 0.4.x</p><p>NOTE: We’re not recommending this release for development work or distribution to end-users. We introduced a change to how Holochain binds the conductor API websocket to local interfaces, which caused it to get confused when the local interface supports both IPv4 and IPv6. If you scaffolded a hApp with Holochain 0.2.7, we recommend you run <code>cargo update</code> and <code>nix flake update</code> right away to save yourself some hassle.</p><p>That said, there are some interesting changes in here that you should know about!</p><p>The first big news is that clone management API functions, which were previously only available in the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/?ref=blog.holochain.org">app and admin APIs</a>, are now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/clone/index.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">available as HDK functions</a>. There are a few differences:</p>  <code>create_clone_cell</code> only takes an existing cell ID, not a role ID.  <code>delete_clone_cell</code> was previously only available to the admin API.  <p>The second point probably needs a bit of explaining. Unlike <code>disable_clone_cell</code>, <code>delete_clone_cell</code> is a somewhat destructive operation, because it makes it impossible to bring a clone cell and its data back to life (although the data is still technically recoverable if you know how to open up the database). That’s why it’s never been part of the app API where any old client could access it. These new HDK functions, by contrast, can only operate on the hApp that the calling cell lives in. We’re working on locking down the app API so only clients authorised to access an app can actually access it, which means we could safely make <code>delete_clone_cell</code> available to clients, but in the meantime this gives you a way to securely clean up cells once they’re no longer needed.</p><p>If you think you’d find it useful to manage clones from the back end, we’d like you to try out these new HDK functions and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues?ref=blog.holochain.org">tell us what you think</a>. We may, for instance, change <code>create_clone_cell</code> to match how the corresponding app API function works in 0.3 or 0.4.</p><p>The other big news is that we’ve <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/3372?ref=blog.holochain.org">cleaned up</a> the WebSocket code, so the app and admin APIs should have fewer bugs such as dropped connections (particularly when the conductor hits 100% CPU consumption). This does result in breaking changes, but only if you’re writing a Rust-based app that consumes the <code>holochain_websocket</code> crate directly. Anyone who calls the conductor APIs instead (which is most of you, including those who use the officially supported JavaScript and Rust clients) won’t be affected. If you don’t know whether you should care about the breaking changes, then you’re one of the ones who shouldn’t 🌝</p><p>Lastly, <code>holochain --build-info</code> now tells you the Lair keystore version.</p><p>Read about it all in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.2.7/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">changelog</a>, and make sure you scroll down because all the above updates happened in the two RCs before this release.</p> Holochain 0.1 retiring, 0.3 entering RC phase, 0.4 release cycle started <p>Now that Holochain 0.2.8 is the recommended release, the 0.1.x series won’t receive any more updates, and we’ll eventually shut down the centralised infrastructure that supports 0.1. We don’t have a specific time for shutting it down, but it should be considered end-of-life. We’re recommending that all developers still using Holochain 0.1 update their hApps to Holochain 0.2.8 now and distribute the update to their users as soon as possible.</p><p>Now, on to Holochain 0.3. Most hApp devs are already using a weekly release of Holochain 0.3 in their work, for instance Moss (see below). It contains a lot of stability and performance improvements that will be a welcome upgrade for devs and users.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve decided it’s time to acknowledge this reality and put an API freeze on Holochain 0.3.x. The first release candidate should be out soon. The <code>develop</code> branch of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>holochain/holochain</code> repo</a>, and the weekly channel of Holonix, are now tracking the 0.4.x release series. If you’re already on 0.3, you’ll want to change the channel from <code>weekly</code> to <code>0_3_rc</code> so you don’t get bumped accidentally to 0.4 on your next nix flake update:</p> <code>// ...&nbsp; inputs = {
	versions.url&nbsp; = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/0_3_rc";
// ...</code> <p>Once the first 0.3 release is recommended for general use, 0.2.x will go into maintenance mode, only receiving critical bug fixes as needed.</p><p>Note: Some devs may have seen a 0.3.0 release on crates.io or GitHub. This was an automation error, and we’ve removed it from crates.io, so the first official version of Holochain 0.3 will be 0.3.1 or higher.</p> The Weave: growing thrivable social fabric <p>I’m a big fan of tools. That’s why I like using my computer: it’s an infinite box of tools that I can use to get work done, communicate with friends and colleagues, create art, organise family memories, etc. And I like tools that feel like tools — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy?ref=blog.holochain.org">small programs that do one thing</a>, do it well, work well with each other, and use common data formats. This is brilliant, if you ask me, and it makes me feel like I have superpowers whenever I need to do something complicated.</p><p>I am not a big fan of silos. It frustrates me that my colleagues and I have to log into six or seven different cloud platforms just to get a Dev Pulse published. And each of them has its own separate content organisation system, discussion system, etc, etc. We end up having to recreate the same structures in multiple places. (And so do the developers — if you’re creating a kanban app, you can’t just drop Slack into it and get commenting for free; you have to write your own commenting feature from scratch.)</p><p>As far as I can tell, this silo thing isn’t designed to serve my colleagues and me. Perhaps it isn’t even designed. It’s probably just an accidental outcome of companies working with what they know. Or maybe it’s some business folks deciding they can only make money if they hold their customers tight. But whatever the reason, it’s wasteful and annoying.</p><p>That’s why, when my colleague Eric showed me what he and the <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Lightningrod Labs</a> team were doing with <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we?ref=blog.holochain.org">We (now called Moss)</a> in February, it was like he’d opened the door in a stuffy room. This was exactly how I’d wished my applications worked for at least fifteen years. Sure, it was a little rough around the edges — Eric acknowledged that — but I could see the potential lying just beyond the bugs and unimplemented features.</p> The vision of The Weave: a protocol for social spaces <p>I won’t get too deep into the philosophy — I’ll let <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Weave’s new website</a> do that — but I’ll give you a little teaser: what HTTP did for information, Holochain is trying to do for social spaces. But HTTP alone wasn’t enough. It needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an experience that people would want to use. In a similar way, the Weave is a formal specification that overlays a set of design principles to make Holochain more accessible for devs building social tools.</p><p>HTML introduced pages and, most importantly, hyperlinks as a way to connect them together. This made the Web make sense. It was just enough structure for developers to run with, and it resulted in an explosion of creativity that gave us the web of today. But neither HTTP nor HTML gave us open standard for social spaces, so these concepts got enclosed by big players like Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Holochain gives us open standards for permissionless social spaces. And what HTML et al did for HTTP, the Weave does for Holochain: assets that belong to your group can be linked together with ease.</p><p>How does this work?</p>  A tool is something that a group can install, and it gives them the power to work with assets of a certain type (chat threads, images, files, folders, kanban cards, calendar entries, etc).  Wherever it makes sense, an asset can have links on it that connect to other assets provided by the same tool — or some other completely different tool.  <p>And that second point is what changes everything. Now I can add a conversation thread to a calendar entry if I like. I can drop links on my kanban card that point to cells in a table (there’s already an Airtable clone available). We can drop cards, boards, emails, messages, conversations, and drawings into a folder hierarchy that’s shared across all our tools. Or three or four independent folder hierarchies, if we like.</p> Why do I care about this? <p>I get excited about this as both a user and a developer. As a user, I’m not constrained by the walls that others have created for me — I can stitch together tools in ways that make sense for me. As a practical example, my team can gather all the stuff pertaining to one Dev Pulse into one place. (Or will be able to, once someone comes up with a replacement for Canva.) I expect this will smooth out a lot of the bumps we face when we’re working on a written piece.</p><p>As a developer, it means I won’t have to reinvent everything when I eventually make my <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/scaffolding-my-first-happ-in-10-minutes/">seed swapping hApp</a> into an awesome working product. I won’t have to re-create messaging, reputation, user profile, or categorisation features — I can just focus on the core thing that matters, a way to let people find each other’s seed packet offerings.</p><p>Eric believes this sort of easy composability means that developers will feel empowered to create that little tool they’ve always wished existed. When you only have to focus on your core thing, the task seems much less frightening.</p><p>I think that part of the reason more great tools don’t get built is that people think you have to have a full-featured app, a team of devs to handle feature requests, and a business model in place for when your user base (and your cloud hosting costs) scale 100×.</p><p>But what would you create if you only had to think about one little thing, the thing you care about most? What is that thing for you?</p><p>I’d love it if you shared your little tool ideas in the <a href="https://discord.gg/jNCtnNVVGC?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Weave channel on our Discord</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://theweave.social/moss?ref=blog.holochain.org">download Moss, the first ‘frame’ implementing The Weave</a>, try some of the early stage tools, and <a href="https://theweave.social/?ref=blog.holochain.org">read the spec</a> to get an understanding of how tools in The Weave are made for composability.</p><p>(Fun fact: the equivalent of a ‘browser’ in The Weave is called a ‘frame’, a word that my lovely bride — a weaver — contributed! A frame loom is a special kind of weaving loom used for making tapestries. Kinda fitting for a program for groups weaving a shared story, don’t you think?)</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alandelacruz4?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">ALAN DE LA CRUZ</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-white-sweater-lying-on-bed-3irPFKfB0o0?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Here we go again.....</p><p>Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the largest health insurer in the U.S., just revealed to a congressional committee that a significant data breach had occurred. The intrusion was traced back to a subsidiary, Change Health Systems, which was compromised by the notorious Russian hacker group, BlackCat. This breach underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional security measures, which often rely on single-factor authentication mechanisms and centralized data storage.</p><p>Two months ago, the hackers exploited a stolen password to infiltrate Change Health Systems, gaining access to an extensive array of sensitive patient data. During the testimony, Witty estimated that the personal data of potentially a third of all Americans could have been exposed, highlighting the enormous impact of the breach.</p><p>The incident spiraled when BlackCat, having seized control of Change Healthcare’s systems, demanded a $22 million ransom. Witty confirmed the payment of the ransom, a move made independently in a desperate bid to mitigate the damage. The breach not only affected UnitedHealth's customers but also reached non-customers due to Change Healthcare’s role in processing over 15 billion transactions annually.</p><p>UnitedHealth is now committed to a rigorous data review and is taking proactive steps to support those affected. This includes establishing a dedicated website for information dissemination and offering two years of free credit monitoring services. The company has expressed its determination to bolster defenses and provide necessary aid to both consumers and providers shaken by this event.</p> How Bloom Could Have Helped <p>This incident once again brings to light the critical need for robust, resilient security solutions like those provided by <a>Bloom</a>. Bloom’s cutting-edge self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials solutions are designed to prevent such breaches.</p><p>At <a>Bloom</a>, we advocate for the implementation of decentralized identity solutions that eliminate single points of failure, such as those exploited in the UnitedHealth incident.</p> The Broader Impact of Ransomware <p>The rise in ransomware attacks is a growing concern globally, with payments to hackers in 2023 reaching a record $1.1 billion. These attacks are increasingly sophisticated and are carried out by a diverse array of actors, from large criminal networks to solo perpetrators. The trend underscores the urgent need for comprehensive security strategies that include advanced technological defenses and proactive risk management practices.</p><p>In response to these challenges, Bloom encourages a shift towards more secure, decentralized frameworks that not only protect against such threats but also provide individuals with the tools they need to manage their own digital identities safely and effectively. By prioritizing security and privacy, we can better safeguard our digital ecosystems against the escalating wave of cybercrime.</p>

Airdrop 2 continues this series of airdrops to early Verida participants, adding another 2.2 million VDA Tokens to the campaign and increasing the cumulative allocated award amount to 3.2 million VDA Tokens. This airdrop rewards those who participated in Verida’s Galxe and Zealy campaigns in 2023 and early&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Note that while these initial Zealy and Galxe campaigns are completed and stakeholders can no longer earn rewards for their participation, Verida does have an <a href="https://app.galxe.com/verida">ongoing campaigns operating on Galxe</a> that remains open for participation.</p><p>More details on checking your Airdrop 2 eligibility and claiming rewards will be shared in the coming week, so stay&nbsp;tuned.</p> 2,200,000 VDA Token Airdrop&nbsp;Details <p>Participants in Verida’s initial Zealy and Galxe campaigns will be eligible for rewards for actions completed during these campaigns. Participants who engaged with campaigns on both platforms will also be eligible for a reward boost for their early committed efforts.</p><p>On Galxe, users engaged with Verida’s Acacia and Mainnet launch campaigns and were able to earn limited edition Galxe OATs after undertaking a range of activities. More than 11,000 unique wallets participated in these campaigns and will be eligible for airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>In addition, Verida conducted a campaign on Zealy, where nearly 20,000 wallets participated, with roughly 10,000 individual wallets earning more than 450 Zealy Points during this campaign. Of this group, the approximately 3,600 wallets in the 60th percentile and above, effectively those wallets earning at least 1,485 Zealy Points, will be eligible for VDA airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>All of these users, pending eligibility checks based on residency and other compliance obligations, will be eligible for VDA Storage Credit Token&nbsp;rewards.</p> Zealy Points&nbsp;Campaign <p>A total of 9,991 wallets earned more than 24 million Zealy points during the Zealy campaign. Verida expects to award 1,000,000 VDA tokens to members of this group who earned at least 1,485 Zealy&nbsp;Points.</p><p>Participating wallets in this campaign were grouped by Zealy points, with over 1,000 wallets earning nearly 12 million Zealy points, or almost half the total amount earned, and will be rewarded with 400 VDA tokens per wallet. The remainder of the rewards dedicated to this Zealy campaign will be distributed proportionally between the two lower tiers of wallets, as illustrated in the table&nbsp;below.</p> Galxe Testnet and Mainet Launch Campaigns <p>Additional campaigns on Galxe, where users received Galxe OATs for completing tasks on both the Verida mainnet and testnet, received equally impressive participation. More than 9,000 wallets completed tasks on the Verida testnet enabling them to earn a Galxe OAT, and another 2,000 wallets completed similar tasks following Verida’s transition to&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Of the above two groups, 475 wallets completed the steps to earn a Galxe OAT on both mainnet and testnet, and will receive 200 VDA Tokens. Both mainnet and testnet OATs will earn participants 100 VDA Tokens, and the overall reward amount is over 1.1 million VDA Tokens, as illustrated below.</p> Bonus Allocation for Participants in Both Zealy and Galxe Campaigns <p>In addition to the above reward allocations, Verida has included a bonus reward for participants in both campaigns.</p><p>As seen below, three bonus reward tiers were established, based on a combination of Zealy campaign participation as well as earning a Galxe OAT for either testnet, mainnet, or both stages of the campaign.</p> Combined Airdrop Award&nbsp;Amounts <p>Collectively, airdrop awards for these two campaigns, in addition to the bonus award for wallets participating in both campaigns, bring the total for Verida’s Airdrop 2 to over 2.2 million VDA&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>These awards bring the total announced airdrop reward amount, when combined with airdrop 1, to more than 3.2 million VDA Tokens across Verida’s two initial airdrops. Verida intends to announce the details of additional airdrop and reward programs prior to its upcoming token&nbsp;listing.</p> The Airdrop 2 VDA Reward&nbsp;Pool <p>2.2 million VDA Storage Credit Tokens have been allocated to this airdrop, and will be distributed between all qualified wallets based on verified activities and after a final analysis of all completed records has concluded and points tallied, after which reward amounts will be finalized. Airdrop tokens will be claimable 60 days after the&nbsp;TGE.</p><p>After claiming the tokens, holders will be able to use their VDA within the network to <a href="https://community.verida.io/verida-token-vda/vda-token-utility">pay for data storage and to access other ecosystem initiatives</a>. In addition, Verida has developed a novel delegated staking program enabling users to earn a variety of rewards including VDA tokens and discounts on services for staking their VDA&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>More information about the details of the staking program will be forthcoming, as will additional announcements about airdrops and reward programs targeting different stakeholders within the Verida ecosystem, including node operators, app developers and&nbsp;others.</p> Looking ahead <p>Beyond these initial rewards programs, Verida is embarking on a journey to cultivate a thriving ecosystem through a variety of future initiatives, such as staking, grants, and incubator programs, all accompanied by tokenized incentives. These initiatives will act as catalysts, driving the network’s expansion and enhancing its utility as the decentralized private data storage layer for the new self-sovereign data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Designed to foster innovation, creativity, and active participation, these initiatives encourage users, node operators, dApp builders, and developers to contribute to a more equitable data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>By participating in these opportunities, users can reclaim control over their personal data, ensuring its security, encryption, and decentralization, thereby mitigating risks associated with <a href="https://medium.com/bankless-dao/web3-can-solve-the-data-hack-crisis-814c962849b0">data breaches</a>.

<p>Historically, the insurance industry hasn’t had a reputation for being quick to adopt new technologies. However, ongoing regulatory pressures, rising competition, and changing policyholder demands have created new challenges for insurers, which digital transformation can help to address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, leading insurance companies have become much more policyholder-centric, catering to the unique needs, behaviors, and preferences of consumers rather than offering a one-size-fits-all approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These high-touch, personalized customer experiences have driven better policyholder satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, all of which support insurers’ bottom line. However, adopting a digital insurance model generates new concerns around policyholder data protection and online account security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog will explore the ongoing digital transformation of the insurance market, how the customer experience has been impacted, and what traditional insurers can do to deal with market headwinds and orchestrate a seamless experience for policyholders. </p>

<p>In the past year, Bluesky has grown from 40K users to 5.6M users. We’ve made it possible to create custom algorithms, introduced community-driven moderation, and opened up federation. This has laid the foundation for a social protocol that can exist long after Bluesky the app does.</p>
<p>What’s coming next? Over the next few months, we’ll be putting more of our energy into the application. This includes a lot of “Quality of Life” improvements and some long-requested features. The biggest changes will be:</p>
 
 DMs 
 Video 
 Improved Custom Feeds 
 Improved anti-harassment features 
 OAuth 
 
<p>We’re very excited to deliver these features you’ve been asking for. We don’t have exact timelines, but you can expect to see all of these in the next few months.</p>
 DMs (direct messages) 
<p>Historically, all bluesky posts have been public. But there’s a world of interactions that are opened up when users can directly message each other. Making personal connections, finding job opportunities, organizing events, workshopping posts – there’s a lot of reasons to slide into the DMs.</p>
<p>We’re currently working on a DM service that will integrate into the Bluesky app. This service will be “off protocol” at first so we can develop iteratively. We’ll use what we learn to land protocol-driven DMs in the future. For an update on what’s next for the protocol, <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap">see our protocol roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>The v1 of DMs will be one-to-one. You’ll be able to restrict who can DM you (open, followed users only, and disabled). If you’ve used DMs on other social networks, it should feel familiar.</p>
 Video 
<p>Our devs keep getting told about cute animal videos which our users can’t share. The guilt is terrible.</p>
<p>We’re still finalizing the details, but it’s looking like the v1 of video integration on Bluesky will be 90-second clips that you can share on your posts.</p>
 Improved Custom Feeds 
<p>“Custom Feeds” are one of the best features of Bluesky, allowing users to completely customize their timeline, but they’re still pretty tough to work with. Our community has done an incredible job filling in the gaps, but we want to finally invest some more energy into making Feeds better.</p>
<p>Here’s the list of ideas in the works:</p>
 
 In-app feed creation. 
 The ability to submit posts to feeds, curate the submissions, and manually moderate what’s included. 
 Better feed discovery, and a way to see trending feeds. 
 New feedback mechanisms which the algorithmic feeds can request, such as “show more” and “show less” buttons, and a way to track which posts have been seen to stop duplicates from showing so often. 
 The ability to move “Following” out of the leftmost tab of your homepage. 
 Feed “following” to drive superfeeds which show what’s happening in each of your communities. 
 Better caching strategies to improve performance. 
 
<p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">Algorithmic choice</a> has been a key goal of Bluesky from the start, and we can’t wait to move Custom Feeds forward. It’s incredible how much our community has done with them already, and we think a little extra love will enable you to go even further.</p>
<p>What you see on social media is mostly determined by algorithms, and giving you the power to control your algorithms like this is one of the most important things we do.</p>
 Improved Anti-harassment Features 
<p>Public social networks unfortunately all have to deal with the problem of users who want to troll, harass, and just make other people’s lives miserable. Over the past year, we’ve <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/6-23-2023-moderation-proposals">implemented tooling</a> like reply controls for threads, user lists, and community-driven moderation through labeling, but there is still more work to be done.</p>
<p>In the months to come, we’ll be doing another pass over moderation tooling, with a focus on anti-harassment mechanisms. We’ll be publishing more on this soon.</p>
 OAuth 
<p>You know those “Log in with Facebook” or “Log in with Google” buttons you see in apps? What if there was a “Log in with Bluesky” button? We think there should be! OAuth is the internet standard that makes that possible, and we’re bringing it to Bluesky and atproto.</p>
<p>OAuth is especially important for third-party clients – it’ll make signing in easier and safer for users. You never share your password with other clients, and “App Passwords” will no longer be required.</p>
<p>Once OAuth lands, we’ll expand on our 2FA model to enable more factors than email (which landed last week).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0004-oauth">read about our technical design here</a>.</p>
 See you on Bluesky! 
<p>If you haven't tried Bluesky yet, <a href="https://bsky.app/">sign up here</a> and give it a spin. We'll see you there!</p>

   Today we’re announcing that Platform SSO for macOS is available in public preview with Microsoft Entra ID. Platform SSO is an enhancement to the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices that makes usage and management of Mac devices more seamless and secure.

  <p>Today we’re announcing that Platform SSO for macOS is available in public preview with Microsoft Entra ID. Platform SSO is an enhancement to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices</a> that makes usage and management of Mac devices more seamless and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of public preview, Platform SSO will work with Microsoft Intune. Additional mobile device management (MDM) providers will be added during the public preview. Please contact your MDM provider for more information on support and availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this release, we’re introducing Microsoft Entra Join for macOS. This feature uses the Enterprise SSO plug-in to create a hardware-bound device record in Entra ID. Entra Join requires the use of an Entra ID organizational account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we’re making three new ways to authenticate available, all configurable with MDM and available as part of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra ID Free</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Passwordless authentication with Secure Enclave: Like Windows Hello for Business, this method allows the user to interactively sign in to the desktop with their local account and password. Once the user signs in, a hardware-bound cryptographic key stored in the device’s Secure Enclave can be used as a trusted credential with Entra ID, giving the user SSO across applications that use Entra ID for authentication. This method allows users to go passwordless with Touch ID to unlock their device and be signed into Entra ID under the hood using a device-bound key. It can save organizations money by removing the need to purchase security keys, card readers, or other hardware. For information on our security and compliance standards, please see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/standards/nist-authenticator-types">this guide</a>.  
 Passwordless authentication with smart cards: With this method, the user signs into the Mac using an external smart card (or smart-card-compatible hard token like Yubikey). Once the device is unlocked, the smart card is further used with Entra ID to grant SSO across apps that use Entra ID for authentication.  
 Password synchronization with the local account: This method enables the user to interactively sign into the local machine account with their Entra ID password, granting SSO across apps that use Entra ID. The user no longer needs to remember separate passwords, and any changes to the Entra ID password are synchronized to the local machine.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting today, you’ll find updated documentation and tutorials for Platform SSO for macOS on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/macos-psso">Microsoft Learn</a> to guide you through setup, deployment, usage, and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, you’ll want to take the following steps to help your organization prepare:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-company-portal-macos">Update devices to use Company Portal 5.2404.0 or newer.</a> 
 Deploy the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin">Enterprise SSO plug-in</a>. 
 Ensure users are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy">registered for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication</a>. For the best experience, we recommend using Microsoft Authenticator.  
 For Google Chrome users, install the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/windows-accounts/ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji?pli=1">Microsoft Single Sign On extension</a>. 
 Update macOS devices to macOS 13** (Ventura) or later. macOS 14 (Sonoma) is recommended for the best user experience and feature set.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Note that migration from non-shared keys on macOS 13 to shared keys (supported on macOS 14+) requires user re-registration of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Even more capabilities on the way 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through incremental releases over public preview, we’ll gradually introduce additional controls, reports, audit, and sign–in logging capabilities, plus APIs in Microsoft Graph to configure, query, and manage them. Please note that like Windows Hello for Business, some features may require a premium Entra ID license. </p>

 Universal Basic Nutrient Income — Institutional Infrastructure for 2040 Food Preparedness <p>This blog post marks the starting point of our work on the Universal Basic Nutrient Income (UBNI) policy instrument in Sweden. This speculative design project is part of our ongoing efforts within DM Food Systems Mission to deliver <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darkmatterlabs_%3F%3F%3F%3F-%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F-%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F-activity-7180940750669381635-WpnX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">real-world options for the new life-ennobling economy</a>, and the umbrella “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/102411013/admin/feed/posts/">9 out of 10” Protein Shift Innovation Platform</a> sponsored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Vinnova</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/102411013/admin/feed/posts/">.</a> It continues our work from the <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab">Rapid Transition Lab</a> on food system resilience, and <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/the-dark-matter-of-food-farmacy-374436f092fe">food repricing in Sweden</a>. We will collaborate on this with local partners <a href="https://miljomatematik.se/">MiljöMatematik</a>.</p><p>The project proposes the introduction of Universal Basic Nutrient Income as a model for alleviating barriers to a large-scale shift towards more sustainable and healthy diets, as well as for preparing Sweden for an increasingly uncertain future through stimulating resilient local production. The realisation of such a system will be explored through a radical repricing mechanism based on true cost accounting. Furthermore, the new institutional infrastructure around such instrument needs to be aided by an increased, and coordinated ecosystem investment capacity in adequate portfolios of system interventions that can respond to different futures (e.g. 2 deg., 8 deg., supply chain collapse futures).</p><p>The prototyping phase will be carried out in Malmö where we aim to engage in food environment mapping to address affordability, accessibility, barriers and enablers to local sustainable consumption. We will test the role of UBNI under multiple future risk scenarios, and live-demonstration with citizens which will further inform dietary recommendations, policy design and municipal food system preparedness levels.</p> Consider the following scenario <p>The year is 2040. Sweden is now faced with the consequences of planetary ecological collapse due to the collective failure of transforming vital systems to meet the urgent demands of sustainability in the speed and scale required. The nation is now standing at a critical societal tipping point where the self-sufficiency agendas and local food systems’ sustainability intersect with the welfare of the citizens.</p>Fig 1. “Angry birds” escaped from a flooded peri-urban farm due to an abrupt rain event in 2035 (Image by the authors — Midjourney)Fig 1b. Heavy rain events flood agricultural fields in southern Sweden in 2040 (Image by the authors — Midjourney)<p>The new reality of constantly increasing volatility in global markets, unstable pricing, scarce resources and extreme weather conditions has put immense pressure on the reliability of global food systems and societal functions. Seasonal food shortages, export bans and disruptions in global supply chains have caused Sweden to rapidly reassess its own food system. Inspired by some of the tests from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income_pilots">previous decades</a>, the Swedish government has introduced a Universal Basic Nutrient Income model (UBNI) and adjusted the taxation system in an attempt to safeguard the food system and ensure equitable access to healthy and sustainable food within planetary boundaries.</p>Fig 2. Food prices linked to true cost accounting of environmental, health, societal, and resilience impacts (Image by the authors — Midjourney)<p>An elaborate <a href="https://www.wwf.de/fileadmin/fm-wwf/Publikationen-PDF/Landwirtschaft/studie-true-cost-accounting-englisch.pdf">true cost accounting</a> model relating to dietary patterns enabled the creation of a mechanism where food pricing is linked to capacity of ecological restoration, carbon storage, multi-scalar crisis resilience, as well as <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/more-than-calories-a-deep-code-transformation-of-our-food-systems-1e8c2e0ff5d3">healthcare cost savings</a>, promoting <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">mental wealth and preventive healthcare through nutrition</a> (see the blog post - <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/more-than-calories-a-deep-code-transformation-of-our-food-systems-1e8c2e0ff5d3">“More than calories: a deep code transformation of our food systems”, 2022</a>) Building on principles of regenerative economy, Swedes are now paying a dynamically changing Universal Basic Nutrition tax, composed through multiple instruments including increased VAT rates on foods with high costs to nature and environment. Through implementing this new taxation system, every Swedish citizen is now entitled to a provision of “free food” making the basic human right of equal access to sustainable and healthy foods a vital part of the new Swedish welfare&nbsp;system.</p>Fig 3.

The available products and recipes are based on seasonal occurrence, local availability, current global markets, or resilience. In order for foods to be UBNI-eligible, they need to have high nutritional value and be sourced in a sustainable manner with low climate impact while ensuring both human and animal welfare. Furthermore, the FoodBank’s sensing function is responsible for addressing changing supply conditions, crisis preparedness and adequate adaptation of its food composition.</p>Fig 4.

Weekly/monthly meal plan made free of charge due to its environmental, and health benefits — becoming part of the welfare infrastructure in Sweden,&nbsp;2040.<p>Through accessible digital tools, the recipe bank allows for easy customization of meal plans, recipes and guides supporting citizens in exploring new foods and generation of shopping lists making sustainable consumption effortless and time effective. The illusion of choice is maintained and prevents the scheme to be labeled as governmental food rationing. Actors such as retailers gradually adapt to the scheme through building on existing infrastructures of membership cards, <a href="https://pressrum.coop.se/coop-blir-forst-med-att-visa-matens-hallbarhetsavtryck/">impact accounting</a>, continued improvement of environmental and health performance of their products, resilient foods stock increase, data sharing as well as collaboration for increased localized, agroecological production and prosumer networks.</p>Fig 6. UBNI instrument and its Tranformation Fund resulting in new primary production territories (Image by the authors — Midjourney) System demonstrator — Purpose, Vision, and&nbsp;Goals <p>The purpose of Universal Basic Nutrient Income demonstrator is tofurther utilize the strong Swedish welfare infrastructure as a driver for large-scale dietary change, and societal resilience. Through perceiving equal access to sustainable and healthy foods as basic human rights and a vital part of the welfare system, barriers such as financial constraints, socio-economic context and attitudes might become less impactful in restricting the desired, society-wide dietary&nbsp;shifts.</p><p>The Universal Basic Nutrient Income model enables a rapid inclusion of less affluent socio-economic groups into healthy and sustainable dietary habits. By reducing the financial burden for citizens of accessing sustainable foods, it addresses a critical aspect of social&nbsp;equity.</p><p>Furthermore, recognizing the uncertain 2040 future, and continuous shrinking of actionable and safe operating space for humanity, the UBNI instrument with its FoodBank needs to be seen through the lens of preparedness. Supply side changes, global market disruptions, or an ecological collapse may alter the Bank’s composition. In the context of increasing volatilities, the dynamically changing base recommendation on what foods are considered resilient, sustainable and healthy will need to be supported by an institutionalized sensing and citizen support infrastructure informing what foods should be subsidized and which taxed, and in collapse scenarios, which ones rapidly produced or imported for resilience.</p><p>Hence, the vision behind this demonstrator is to shift the mindset from consumers being the main agents of change towards acknowledging the potential which lies in strong civic incentive mechanisms and multi-actor coordination infrastructure as means for achieving large-scale transformation and food sovereignty for all within multiple future possible scenarios.</p><p>Recognizing the power of <a href="https://www.ipes-food.org/_img/upload/files/PlatetoPlanetEN.pdf">local actor levels and governments</a> in spearheading action towards promoting healthy and sustainable diets, the FoodBank will deal not only as a base for UBNI but also as an organization for transparent and decentralized coordination (<a href="https://dao.biggreen.org/home">see: DAO</a>) between private, public and civic actors to co-curate and decide (e.g. through <a href="https://www.citydao.io/news/the-citydao-journal-3-how-could-citydao-use-quadratic-voting">quadratic voting</a>) on societal-scale portfolios of investments for preparedness, moving beyond short-return cycles, or grant making. In return, the institutionalized food programme will not be seen as a food rationing governmental initiative but a <a href="https://www.ipes-food.org/_img/upload/files/tippingthescales.pdf">democratization of “who decides what we&nbsp;eat?”</a></p><p>The main goal is to co-design and test the possibility of the Universal Basic Nutrient Income model. This will entail design incl. food-related true cost accounting models (TMG &amp; WWF, 2021), taxation and subsidies targeting dietary patterns (Röös et al, 2021), as well as foresight methodologies concerning the spectrum of future changes to dietary recommendations and food system risks endangering nutritional needs.</p> Prototype <p>The idea behind the prototype is to collaboratively develop a Universal Basic Nutrient Income Framework — an incentivising system that sees equal access to sustainable foods as a fundamental human right while addressing future uncertainties in the food&nbsp;system.</p><p>Refinement of the concept will be done through a collaborative foresight workshop with local food system actors based on Malmö municipality as test bed. Testing, and the tangible live demonstration will be done through an experiment with engagement of four local citizens scouting their local food environment in search for FoodBank sustainable foods and following a nutritional recommendation according to four future scenarios.</p>Fig 8.

Let’s work together towards a healthier, greener&nbsp;future!</p><p>A bit about us and our first seminar with sustainable consumption stewards</p><p>Innovation platforms for sustainable food&nbsp;future</p><p>The current Swedish food system places immense pressure on the environment, contributing to climate change by greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and biogeochemical flows. It is evident that a transformation is crucial in order for the food system to become more sustainable for both people and the environment. This transformation requires a systems approach. To accelerate this transformation, Vinnova is financing eight innovation platforms to drive innovation at the system level for a sustainable and competitive food system. The work is based on eight bold and inspiring missions, for a sustainable food system. Based on the missions, coordinating actors must mobilise resources and commitment from across the Swedish food system and its actors to identify levers for&nbsp;change.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rise-research-institutes-of-sweden/">RISE Research Institutes of Sweden</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/darkmatterlabs/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sisp---swedish-incubators-&amp;-science-parks/">SISP — Swedish Incubators &amp; Science Parks</a>, makes up one of the eight platforms, aiming towards a 2040 future where the Swedish food system is sustainable and within a safe operating space for both humans and the planet. We call ourselves.</p><blockquote>9outof10 — Powering the shift towards sustainable Swedish protein production and consumption.</blockquote> Seminar I — Foresight seminar with Swedish food system actors working with sustainable consumption frameworks. <p>Being in an explorative phase, we have so far consulted some of the most knowledgeable actors on climate assessment frameworks in Sweden to help us map and make sense of the complex landscape of the Swedish food system. Furthermore, to get a better understanding of the vast number of dietary guidelines available, and the level of alignment within this space, we organised an introduction seminar with researchers and representatives of the different guidelines developed to meet both climate and nutritional goals.</p><p>In addition to discussing the frameworks, we consulted the seminar participants on our mission that “ 9/10 meals in Sweden should be within planetary boundaries by 2040”, with a specific focus on shifting our protein consumption. Using foresight exercises and with this in mind, we discussed enablers and barriers to get closer to our mission statement. Through our conversations, we quickly discovered some issues with this mission, one being the difficulty to measure where we currently sit and how to measure future&nbsp;success.</p> Lack of standardisation in climate assessment guidelines <p>One of the main reasons behind this is the lack of standardisation within climate assessment frameworks that applies to all food products, produce and services. Part of the reason for this seems to be the difficulty, and/or inability, to properly measure the actual impact of certain products. Another large contributing factor to this is the large share of imported foods. Here, the environmental impact of production has been ‘outsourced’ to other places in the world, which additionally makes it difficult to assess and collect data for both the local and the wider environmental impacts.</p> Inaccessibility to&nbsp;data <p>Prominent research institutions like RISE as well as actors such as CarbonCloud and Coop, have conducted thorough analyses on the diverse impacts of food on climate change. These databases are comprehensive and valuable. However, due to the high cost of creating such data sets, access to data is not readily available, nor free of charge. This prevents smaller organisations and SMEs from assessing the climate impact of their products and services. The participants therefore highlighted the need for open access data in order to enable equal access to ensure comparative standards, to reach a common&nbsp;mission.</p> Primary production as part of the&nbsp;solution <p>It is clear that there is insufficient focus on how to make the transition for primary production a viable business model — finding these models is key to enable the transition. The demands on primary production to transition to sustainable practices do not currently seem to level with the amount of support given to producers. It therefore carries a lot of risk particularly for smaller producers. Furthermore, the great potential our arable land holds is not sufficiently recognised. Not only is it important in terms of food production capacity, but it is also important in terms of enabling crucial ecosystem services. Updated policies, business models and impact investments are needed to enable this change. The food system today accounts for 20–30% of the GHG emissions but attracts only 7% of the impact investments.</p> Consumer behaviour <p>Although much of the responsibility lies with politicians to ensure that primary production and food producers stay within planetary boundaries, the power of consumer behaviour should not be ignored. The role of food, being both culturally contingent, traditional and habitual, plays an enormous role for what is being produced, and what we expect to see produced. Changing this behaviour, be it through nudging, hard policies or soft incentives, is crucial to enable a system change. Figuring out how to approach consumers will be paramount to reaching the&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Based on these conversations, it is evident that the main impetus is on policy makers, primary production and consumer behaviour for enabling our mission statement. By collecting knowledge and input from various parts of the value chain, we hope to garner enough information to tease out a path towards a more sustainable Swedish food system. The work now proceeds by bringing these main issues into a conversation with actors and industry organisations from the primary production side, as well as representatives from the consumer side, to further understand where innovation and restructuring must happen in order to achieve a sustainable and inclusive transition.</p><p>Sweden has significant potential to enhance its innovation capacity so that the food system contributes to preserving both the environment and human health, while also providing us with food, jobs, and quality of life. How to do this will be part of our upcoming workshop series exploring different key questions: How do we ensure that primary protein production is within planetary boundaries by 2040? How do we ensure that protein consumption is both socially, economically and environmentally just, while also healthy and good for the planet? Can we get key actors to unstick their minds from their daily work and contribute to this process by exploring future pathways towards reaching a sustainable food system by 2040, using foresight and scenario building exercises?</p><p>Intrigued yet? Good. Let’s keep in touch. Follow our page to see how our story unfolds while we explore different ways of using scenarios for unlocking the potential of Swedish future&nbsp;foods.</p><p>We’d also love your input, so feel free to comment, share, and engage with our posts now and in the&nbsp;future!</p> Contact <p>This blog post was written by Alex Hansten (Dark Matter Labs) and Mari W.

 The “maximize accuracy” game is now outcompeting the “50/50 maximize stake”&nbsp;game  Introduction <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. In Predictoor’s rewards formula, the more accurately you predict and the more you stake, the more you earn; you’re always in competition with others and their predictions.</p><p>From this rewards formula, we recognized that accuracy should be the key value proposition. It was a natural fit: staking caused accountability, and the game around it could nudge up accuracy over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Alas, “maximize accuracy” wasn’t happening. Rather, another game emerged that didn’t help Predictoor’s value proposition.</p> Observing the “50/50 High Stake”&nbsp;Game <p>People started running bots that used a “50/50” strategy, where at “prediction” the bot would stake exactly half its OCEAN up, and half down. This was popular, because it was nicely profitable and relatively safe.</p><p>To maximize $ earned, the 50/50 bot-runners simply maximized stake. Competition among 50/50 bot runners led staking volume to grow exponentially, to nearly $1B per month from $0 at launch six months earlier&nbsp;😲.</p><p>These people had found that optimizing on stake (with no value-add to accuracy) was more profitable than optimizing on accuracy.</p><p>While the high volumes were exciting to see, they weren’t helping accuracy. And ultimately it was accuracy that mattered for Predictoor’s long-term success. What held back the model-based bots from competing? What could we do about it? Did it&nbsp;work?</p> Identifying the&nbsp;Problem <p>Was anyone running model-based prediction bots? We knew this answer to be “yes” because we were among them! Nothing like eating your own dog&nbsp;food:)</p><p>And, we found that it was hard to be profitable with model-based bots. Here’s why: it’s easier to be profitable predicting on both up &amp; down, rather than just one&nbsp;side.</p><p>Let’s elaborate.</p>  The 50/50 bots staked on both sides, for each prediction. They were always there to catch the good and the bad. Having both sides is predictable, and helps profitability.  In contrast, the model-based bots staked on just one side: up or down, but not both at once. Each time a prediction was wrong (almost but not quite 50% of the time), it was slashed its full stake amount. This meant high variance in winnings from epoch to epoch: big win or big loss. High variance hurts profitability.  <p>We also recognized that higher prediction accuracy could help compete against the 50/50 bots. So we continued our diligent line of research to increase model accuracy.</p><p>If you can’t be profitable, then you can’t stake meaningful amounts to optimize profitability.</p> Addressing the&nbsp;Problem <p>We did two things to address the problem: two-sided prediction bots, and higher accuracy&nbsp;models.</p><p>Two-sided prediction bots. We <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor-introducing-two-sided-prediction-bots-66bbbb53be1b">introduced</a> these a couple months ago. They made it easy to run bots that submit both up *and* down predictions based on model confidence.</p><p>Here’s an example. If the bot calculates up=30% chance, and therefore down=70%, and has 1000 OCEAN to stake, then the bot stakes 0.30*1000 = 300 OCEAN to up, and 700 to down. Critically, the bot is always on both the winning side and the losing side. This reduces its variance and increases its profitability. The image below illustrates.</p>prediction bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”.<p>Model accuracy research. We continued to improve our own internal models’ accuracy. We also learned that for models with 52% accuracy, two-sided bots could compete against 50/50 bots, but one-sided could not. For models of 56% accuracy, even one-sided bots could compete, and two-sided did not&nbsp;help.</p> What Happened Next? Accuracy Went&nbsp;Up <p>We rolled out two-sided model-based bots, and provided affordances for more accurate&nbsp;models.</p><p>What happened&nbsp;then?</p><p>New predictoors armed with two-sided bots and more accurate prediction models joined the game. These new model-based bots drove aggregate prediction accuracy up, nicely above&nbsp;50%.</p><p>The image below shows accuracy for each of the ten 5-minute feeds from April 8, 2024 until May 1, 2024. Most notable is in the right 1/3 of the image where all accuracies trend upwards&nbsp;nicely.</p>Accuracy vs time for each 5-minute&nbsp;feed<p>The following image shows accuracy for each of the ten 1 hour feeds from April 8, 2024 until May 1, 2024. As with 5min, accuracies trend up&nbsp;nicely.</p>Accuracy vs time for each 1 hour&nbsp;feed Then, What Happened? “50/50 Maximize-Stake” Game&nbsp;Faded <p>As accuracy increased, the 50/50 strategy became unprofitable, because the accurate model-based bots ate the stake of the 50/50 bots. Let’s elaborate:</p>  In an environment where every predictoor has a 50% accuracy, using a 50/50 strategy means a predictor will be right as often as wrong. Each correct prediction offsets the loss from a wrong one, while also earning a share of the rewards based on the stake&nbsp;amount.  However, in an environment, where some predictors have accuracy sufficiently higher than 50%, they will win part of the losses incurred by the 50/50 strategy. Consequently, the gains from correct predictions in the 50/50 strategy do not fully cover the losses from incorrect ones, rendering it unprofitable.  <p>With “50/50 maximize-stake” strategy, becoming unprofitable, the 50/50 bot runners left or sharply reduced their&nbsp;stake.</p><p>The image below illustrates. Below:top shows stake for each of the ten 5-minute feeds from April 8, 2024 until May 1, 2024. It dropped from 4000 OCEAN / feed / epoch to &lt;1000 OCEAN. As of May 6 there’s about 700 OCEAN /&nbsp;feed.</p><p>Below:bottom shows a similar trend for 1 hour feeds. It also dropped similarly.</p>Stake vs time for each 5-minute feed (top), and 1h feed&nbsp;(bottom) Discussion / Learnings <p>Accuracy is rewarded. At its heart, Predictoor is built on the principle of “reward accuracy”. The system rewards predictoors who make accurate predictions and penalizes those who don’t. We just had to reduce friction for making this&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Predictoors must adapt. From the above graphs, it can be seen that after 50/50 predictoors quit the game, the rest of the predictoors have lowered their stake amounts to maximize their revenue. Adapting to these changes and employing smarter strategies is a key part of the game. Understanding these dynamics is essential to maximizing your potential returns in the game. So, dive into it, tweak your strategies, and watch your profits&nbsp;improve!</p> Conclusion <p>In this article, we described how Predictoor rewards for accuracy and stake, and with a main value proposition of accuracy. We then described how the “50/50 maximize-stake” strategy was nicely profitable, alas, optimizing for stake not accuracy. We described steps we took to help make model-based predictions more profitable: two-sided predictions and more accurate models. Finally, we showed positive results of how accuracy has increased and the “50/50 maximize-stake” bots have been&nbsp;leaving.</p><p>The game is now firmly “maximize accuracy” and that’s a great&nbsp;thing.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

The guide starts with installation and running the agents using Docker containers. The guide then provides a script to showcase the use of Signify and KERIA agents, including procedures for creating autonomic identifiers (AIDs), signing messages, and verifying signatures.</p> Signify &amp;&nbsp;KERIA <p>Signify &amp; KERIA are open-source projects developed for building client-side identity-wallet applications using the KERI protocol. Signify-KERIA identity wallet utilizes the hybrid edge-cloud wallet architecture where Signify provides a lightweight edge wallet component whereas KERIA provides a heavier cloud wallet component. Signify and KERIA were designed based on the principle of “key at the edge (KATE)”. That is, essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Some resources for Signify &amp; KERIA can be found&nbsp;here</p>  The Signify-KERIA protocol by Philip Feairheller: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md</a>  KERI API (KAPI): <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md</a>   Signify Edge&nbsp;Agent <p>Signify provides an edge agent for a KERI identity wallet and is used primarily for essential cryptographic operations including key pair generation and digital signature creation. Signify utilizes the hierarchical deterministic (HD) key algorithm. For example, a Signify application could safeguard a single master seed which is used to generate and manage any number of AIDs. Signify is designed to be lightweight so as to support devices with limited capabilities.</p><p>Signify is currently available in Typescript and&nbsp;Python</p>  SignifyPy (Python) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy</a>  Signify-TS (Typescript) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts</a>   KERIA Cloud&nbsp;Agent <p>KERI Agent (KERIA) provides a cloud agent for a KERI identity wallet and is used for, e.g., data storage, agent-to-agent communications, and verification of KERI key event logs (KELs). KERIA is engineered to handle the heavy lifting for users, allowing their edge devices to stay lightweight while maintaining high security by performing all essential cryptographic operations at the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>A KERIA agent is cryptographically delegated by a Signify agent using the KERI delegation protocol. All instructions from a user are signed at the edge by a Signify agent and subsequently verified by a KERIA cloud agent. KERIA is currently available in Python: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria</a></p> Installation Guide for Node and&nbsp;NVM <p>In this guide, we will be using Node.js to run Signify-TS (Typescript) with a KERIA server running on a Docker container.</p> Install Node.js <p>Visit the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> website to download&nbsp;Node.js.</p> Install NVM on Linux or&nbsp;MacOS <p>To easily switch between different versions of Node.js, you could use Node Version Manager (NVM). NVM on Linux and macOS may be installed using&nbsp;curl</p> curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash <p>Alternatively, we could use&nbsp;wget</p> wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash  Install NVM on&nbsp;Windows <p>On Windows, NVM may be installed from the <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases">GitHub releases&nbsp;page.</a></p><p>Note: After installing NVM, do not forget to restart your terminal. Alternatively, you can refresh the available commands in your system path by executing source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh</p> Using NVM <p>To ensure that NVM is correctly installed, you can check its version&nbsp;with:</p> nvm ls <p>To install Node.js version 18.18.2,&nbsp;run:</p> nvm install v18.18.2 <p>Here, we use v18.18.2 in this guide. This is not a requirement and other versions of Node.js should work with Signify-TS.</p> Install Dependencies and Run a KERIA&nbsp;Server <p>To install dependencies for the tutorial, you could clone this repository <a href="https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria">https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria</a> and run the following script</p> git clone https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria<br>cd tutorial-signify-keria<br>npm install<br>docker-compose up -d <p>where docker-compose up -d runs a KERIA server in a Docker container. Alternatively, you could get a Docker image for running a KERIA server from Docker Hub <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria">https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria</a>.</p> Running Signify-TS Scripts <p>Here, we demonstrate Signify-TS Scripts for signing and verifying an arbitrary message. Here, a signer, called Allie, signs a message “Hello Brett” and sends it to a verifier, called Brett. Brett subsequently obtains Allie’s key event log (KEL) and uses it to verify the signature on the&nbsp;message.</p> Connecting Signify clients to the KERIA&nbsp;server <p>First, Allie and Brett must boot and then connect to a KERIA server with their Signify (edge) clients. Each boot command creates a separate agent and a database in the KERIA server. see <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Typically, Allie’s and Brett’s Signify scripts should run on separate devices, but here we put them in the same Typescript file for simplicity. Allie’s and Brett’s Signify clients may also connect to different KERI servers at different service endpoints. In this tutorial, both clients connect to a KERIA server running on the local host for simplicity.</p> await signify.ready();<br><br>const url = 'http://127.0.0.1:3901';<br>const bootUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:3903';<br>const bran1 = signify.randomPasscode();<br>const bran2 = signify.randomPasscode();<br><br>const allieClient = new signify.SignifyClient(<br>    url,<br>    bran1,<br>    signify.Tier.low,<br>    bootUrl<br>);<br>await allieClient.boot();<br>await allieClient.connect();<br><br>const brettClient = new signify.SignifyClient(<br>    url,<br>    bran2,<br>    signify.Tier.low,<br>    bootUrl<br>);<br>await brettClient.boot();<br>await brettClient.connect(); <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  signify.randomPasscode() generates a random string with 126-bit entropy using libsodium  new signify.SignifyClient(…) creates a new Signify instance, initialized with the newly generated passcode  allieClient.boot() creates a KERIA agent and a corresponding database at the KERIA server via port&nbsp;3903  allieClient.connect() connects a Signify agent to the corresponding KERIA agent that has been&nbsp;booted.  <p>Signify uses a passcode to generate cryptographic keys using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function (KDF)</a> where signify.Tier specifies how much the passcode is stretched.</p> Allie creates an&nbsp;AID <p>Before Allie can sign a message with the KERI protocol, she must first create an <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifier (AID)</a> with a key inception event in a <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7c43">Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL)</a>.</p> const icpResult1 = await allieClient<br>    .identifiers()<br>    .create('aid1', {});<br>await waitOperation(allieClient, await icpResult1.op());<br><br>const rpyResult1 = await allieClient<br>    .identifiers()<br>    .addEndRole('aid1', 'agent', allieClient!.agent!.pre);<br>await waitOperation(allieClient, await rpyResult1.op()); <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  allieClient.identifiers().create('aid1', {}) creates an AID where the Signify agent signs the inception event and sends the event along with its signature to the KERIA agent. Here, the AID is given an alias&nbsp;'aid1'.  allieClient.identifiers().addEndRole(...) cryptographically authorizes the KERIA agent to operate on behalf of the AID’s controller.  waitOperation(...) waits for the KERIA agent to complete its operation.  <p>addEndRole stands for “adding endpoint role authorization”. This is a mechanism in the KERI protocol where the controller of an AID cryptographically authorizes—by signing with a private key associated with the AID—a service endpoint of a KERIA agent to operate on the AID’s behalf. Another agent that needs to communicate with the authorized KERIA agent can then verify the authorization signature.</p> Brett resolves Allie’s&nbsp;AID <p>Allie and Brett may exchange their KELs using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-3-oobi-and-ipex-2e6b222f4b87">Out-Of-Band Introduction (OOBI)</a> protocol. Allie may generate her OOBI URL that points to her KERIA agent’s service endpoint (which has been authorized in the previous step) as&nbsp;follows:</p> const oobi1 = await allieClient.oobis().get('aid1', 'agent'); <p>The generated OOBI URL could be sent to Brett via an out-of-band channel such as email, messaging apps, or scanning QR code. Subsequently, Brett may ask his KERIA agent to resolve Allie’s OOBI to obtain the AID’s KEL from Allie’s KERIA&nbsp;agent:</p> const oobiOp = await brettClient.oobis().resolve(oobi1.oobis[0], 'aid1');<br>await waitOperation(brettClient, oobiOp);  Allie signs the&nbsp;Message <p>To sign a message, Allie may use the Signify<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/keeping.ts"> </a><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/keeping.ts">KeyManager class</a> as&nbsp;follows:</p> const aid1 = await allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1');<br>const keeper1 = await allieClient.manager!.get(aid1);<br>const message = "Test message";<br>const signature = await keeper1.sign(signify.b(message))[0];<br>console.log('signature', signature); <p>which generates the following <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR-encoded</a> signature:</p> signature AAAnBe-VPfBU9-3eb7aM5GNwr_NBuoJzA8vm9AFPmgj3I4LIv1mup2bwPDlbIQ6gAgtaEZg5rwE1_fTVVTmPo0oI <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1') retrieves the information about the AID with alias 'aid1' from the KERIA&nbsp;agent  allieClient.manager!.get(aid1) creates an instance from the KeyManager class called a keeper that signs an arbitrary byte string with keeper.sign()  signify.b() turns a text string into a byte&nbsp;string.  <p>When a Signify agent creates an AID, it uses a salt together with its passcode to generates cryptographic keys associated with the AID. The salt is then encrypted and sent to the KERIA agent. allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1') also retrieves and decrypts the salt where the KeyManager could use the salt to regenerate the key for signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Brett verifies Allie’s signature <p>After Allie sends the message to Brett, Brett wants to make sure the message is really from Allie by verifying the signature on the message. Brett may retrieve Allie’s KEL and the corresponding <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">key state</a> of her AID to verify the signature as&nbsp;follows:</p> const aid1StateBybrettClient = await brettClient.keyStates().get(aid1.prefix);<br>const siger = new signify.Siger({qb64: signature});<br>const verfer = new signify.Verfer({<br>    qb64: aid1StateBybrettClient[0].k[0]<br>});<br>const verificationResult = verfer.verify(siger.raw, signify.b(message));<br>console.log('verificationResult', verificationResult); <p>which gives the following output:</p> verificationResult true <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  brettClient.keyStates().get(aid1.prefix) retrieves the key state of the Allie’s&nbsp;AID  signify.Siger({qb64: signature}) is a signature-wrapper instance of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/siger.ts">Siger class</a>, initialized with the Allies’ signature on the&nbsp;message.  signify.Verfer(...) is a verifier-wrapper instance of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/verfer.ts">Verfer class</a>, initialized by the Allie’s public&nbsp;key  verfer.verify(...) then verifies the message and its signature using Allie’s public&nbsp;key  <p>The verification of the signature against the message indicates that the signature is valid. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the message that Brett received from&nbsp;Allie.</p> Conclusion <p>This tutorial gives a brief introduction for using the KERI protocol with the Signify and KERIA agents, which provide a footing for building client-side KERI-based applications. Signify provides libraries for building KERI edge agents whereas KERIA provides libraries for building companion cloud agents. These agents follow the principle of “key at the edge (KATE)” where essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is still the early days for these two projects, and there are not many educational materials around as of May 2024. To dive deeper into these two projects, I recommend studying their integration scripts at <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-tutorial-sign-and-verify-with-signify-keria-833dabfd356b">KERI Tutorial: Sign and Verify with Signify &amp; Keria</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The Microsoft Entra team is looking forward to connecting with you next week at <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/usa">RSA Conference 2024</a> (RSAC) from May 6 to 9, 2024, in San Francisco! As we enter the age of AI and there are more identities and access points to protect, identity security has never been more paramount. From protecting workforce and external identities to non-human identities—that outnumber human identities 10 to 1—the task of securing access and the interactions between them requires taking a more comprehensive approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help customers protect every identity and every access point, I’d like to highlight recent innovations that we’ll be showcasing at this upcoming event:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Expanded passkey support for Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra ID external authentication methods&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra External ID general availability&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration general availability&nbsp; 
 Our vision for cloud access management to strengthen multicloud security&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be demonstrating these new innovations and sharing more about how to take a holistic approach to identity and access at RSA Conference 2024 (see the table at the end of this blog for more information).&nbsp;Now, let’s take a closer look at Microsoft Entra innovations that we’ll be showcasing at RSAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Expanded passkey support for Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to supporting sign-ins via a passkey hosted on a hardware security key, Microsoft Entra ID now includes additional support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android. This will bring strong and convenient authentication to mobile devices for customers with the strictest security requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A passkey is a strong, phishing-resistant authentication method you can use to sign in to any internet resource that supports the W3C WebAuthN standard. Passkeys represent the continuing evolution of the FIDO2 standard aimed at creating a secure and user friendly passwordless experience for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about using passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app, <a href="https://aka.ms/AuthappPasskey">check out this blog.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra ID external authentication methods&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While organizations increasingly choose to unify their multifactor authentication and access management solutions, thus, simplifying their identity architectures, some organizations have already deployed MFA and want to use their pre-existing MFA provider with Microsoft Entra ID. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-external-authentication-methods-in-microsoft/ba-p/4078808">External authentication methods</a> allow organizations to&nbsp; leverage any MFA solution to meet the MFA requirement with Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At launch, external authentication methods integrations will be available with the following identity providers: Cisco, ENTRUST, HYPR, Ping, RSA, SILVERFORT, Symantec, THALES, and TrustBuilder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">documentation</a> to learn more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra External ID general availability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our next-generation, developer friendly customer identity access management (CIAM) solution, <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID</a> will become generally available on May 15, 2024. Whether you're building applications for partners, business customers, or consumers, External ID makes secure and customizable CIAM simple. External ID enables you to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all identities with a single platform&nbsp; 
 Streamline secure collaboration&nbsp; 
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
 
<p>Learn more about External ID by reading our <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDGABlog">announcement blog!</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration general availability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become the norm. Ensuring the security of cloud applications and infrastructure requires integrating identity and permission insights into the overall security strategy. This objective is achieved through the integration of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which will soon be generally available in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration streamlines access and permission insights into other cloud postures through a unified interface. Customers benefit from recommendations on mitigating risks within the MDC dashboard, including unused identities, overprivileged permissions, and unused super identities. This facilitates the enforcement of least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Our vision for cloud access management to strengthen multicloud security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become common in today’s business landscape. At Microsoft, we have long prioritized the protection of customers’ environments, regardless of the number of clouds they use or the providers they choose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent <a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/2024-State-of-Multicloud-Security-Risk-Report.pdf">2024 State of Multicloud Security Risk Report</a> reconfirms the importance of securing access in multicloud and presents valuable findings based on one year of actual usage data to enhance organizations’ understanding of their risks and facilitate the development of effective mitigation strategies. Key findings related to access and permissions include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Only 2% of the 51,000 permissions granted to human and workload identities in 2023 were utilized, with 50% of these permissions classified as high-risk.&nbsp; 
 More than 50% of identities are identified as super identities, indicating they have access to all permissions and resources within the multicloud environment.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, this report confirms that the complexity of multicloud risk continues to grow. Coupled with the increase in cyberattacks targeting identities, especially those assigned to non-human entities, security teams are overwhelmed. Consequently, organizations are shifting priorities from infrastructure protection to actively monitoring and securing interactions between human and workload identities accessing corporate cloud resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe Microsoft can help address these challenges with our new vision for cloud access management, offering visibility into all identities and permissions in use, along with proactive risk detection to enhance protection and management of your environment. We will continue our journey to secure access to resources anywhere by developing a new converged platform that encompasses four key solution areas critical for organizations, based on our continuous engagements with customers:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)&nbsp; 
 Privileged Access Management (PAM)&nbsp; 
 Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)&nbsp; 
 Workload Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned to learn more about our vision in the coming weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Insights: 
 
 Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are gaining momentum as governments seek to improve service quality, combat fraud, and streamline identity verification processes. 
 Organizations like AAMVA and NIST play crucial roles in setting standards and governance for mDL implementation. 
 Interoperability is a key challenge, with the ISO standard for mDLs emerging as a widely adopted solution. 
 Governments must decide between issuing mDLs through their own wallets or leveraging third-party wallets like those from Apple, Google, and Samsung. 
 mDLs could enable seamless online identity verification for industries like banking, notary services, and access management, reducing transaction abandonment rates. 
 Potential monetization models for issuers and verifiers are being explored, as the value of mDLs lies primarily in the verification side. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Governments are implementing legislation to allow for the acceptance of digital forms of state-issued identities, including mDLs. 
 AAMVA’s Digital Trust Service aims to facilitate cross-state verifications by providing the necessary public keys to read mDLs. 
 Facial biometrics and liveness detection are expected to become more prevalent in conjunction with mDL verification for enhanced security. 
 Governments and industry stakeholders are exploring ways to vet and register verifiers to ensure responsible use of mDL data.

 Claim your rewards now. Predictoor DF Forges Ahead. More DF streams to&nbsp;come  Summary <p>This article starts by reviewing Ocean Data Farming (DF), the ASI Alliance, and how an ASI “yes” vote would affect Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>The “yes” happened. This triggered the follow-up actions:</p>  We just completed an airdrop to veOCEAN holders. You can now claim OCEAN via the DF Webapp (<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>)  We have retired Passive &amp; Volume&nbsp;DF.  Predictoor DF continues, with room to scale up Predictoor DF and introduce new incentive streams.   1. Background  1.1 Ocean Data&nbsp;Farming <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program. Rewards are weekly. DF has traditionally had three streams / substreams:</p>  Passive DF. Users lock OCEAN for veOCEAN. The longer you lock or the more OCEAN you lock, the more OCEAN you get. Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings. 150,000 OCEAN/week.  Volume DF. Users allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high data consume volume (DCV), in a curation function. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake. Up to 112,500 OCEAN/week.  Predictoor DF. Run prediction bots to earn continuously. 37,500 OCEAN/week.  <p>Most user DF interactions are via the DF webapp at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">df.oceandao.org</a>.</p> 1.2 ASI&nbsp;Alliance <p>Ocean Protocol has been working with Fetch.ai and SingularityNET to form the <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/artificial-superintelligence-alliance">ASI Alliance</a>, with a unified token $ASI. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-is-joining-the-superintelligence-alliance-767c82693f24">This Mar 27, 2024 article</a> describes the key mechanisms. It needed a “yes” vote from the Fetch and SingularityNET communities.</p> 1.3 ASI Alliance Impact on&nbsp;DF <p>If the event of a “yes”, there were important implications for Ocean Data Farming and veOCEAN. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/superintelligence-alliance-updates-to-data-farming-and-veocean-68d7b29c5100">Mar 29, 2024 post</a> describes them. From that&nbsp;post:</p><blockquote>To be ready for either outcome [yes or no], we will pause giving rewards for Passive DF and Volume DF as soon as the DF82 payout of Thu Mar 28 has completed. Also in preparation, have taken a snapshot of OCEAN locked &amp; veOCEAN balances as of 00:00 am UTC Wed Mar 27 (Ethereum block 19522003)&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Predictoor DF will continue regardless of voting&nbsp;outcome.</blockquote><p>And the section “Actions if ‘yes’ “ held the following key information about veOCEAN, Passive DF, and Volume&nbsp;DF.</p><blockquote>veOCEAN will be retired.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Passive DF &amp; Volume DF will be&nbsp;retired.</blockquote><blockquote>People who have locked OCEAN for veOCEAN will be made whole, as&nbsp;follows.</blockquote><blockquote>Each address holding veOCEAN will be airdropped OCEAN in the amount&nbsp;of:</blockquote><blockquote>(1.25^years_til_unlock-1) * num_OCEAN_locked</blockquote><blockquote>In words: veOCEAN holders get a reward as if they had got payouts of 25% APY for their whole lock period (and kept re-upping their lock). But they get the payout soon, rather than over years of weekly DF rewards payouts. It’s otherwise the same commitment, expectations and payout as&nbsp;before.</blockquote><blockquote>This airdrop will happen within weeks after the “yes”&nbsp;vote.</blockquote><blockquote>That same address will have its OCEAN unlocked according to its normal veOCEAN mechanics and timeline (up to 4 years). After unlock, that account holder can convert the $OCEAN directly into $ASI with the published exchange&nbsp;rate.</blockquote><blockquote>Any actions taken by an account on locking / re-locking veOCEAN after the time of the snapshot will be ignored.&nbsp;…</blockquote><p>The post also held key information about psdnOCEAN, predictoor DF, and the future of&nbsp;DF.</p><blockquote>psdnOCEAN holders will be able to swap back to the OCEAN with a fixed-rate contract. For each 1 psdnOCEAN swapped they will receive &gt;1 OCEAN at a respectable ROI.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Predictoor DF continues.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Ocean Protocol Foundation will re-use the DF budget for its incentives programs. These can include: scaling up Predictoor DF [and&nbsp;more].</blockquote><p>(We added bold font to help cross-referencing with the “actions” section&nbsp;below.)</p> 2. A “Yes”&nbsp;Happened <p>As of Apr 16, the vote had concluded. <a href="https://twitter.com/ASI_Alliance/status/1780221024082047381">The result was a&nbsp;“yes”</a>.</p> Artificial Superintelligence Alliance on Twitter: "🎉 It's official! The ASI Alliance is launching - the world's largest decentralized network for accelerating AGI and ASI.Stay tuned for updates on our multi-billion token merger and the incredible things to come!@SingularityNET @Fetch_ai @oceanprotocol pic.twitter.com/Ewh99LlOIY / Twitter" <p>🎉 It's official! The ASI Alliance is launching - the world's largest decentralized network for accelerating AGI and ASI.Stay tuned for updates on our multi-billion token merger and the incredible things to come!@SingularityNET @Fetch_ai @oceanprotocol pic.twitter.com/Ewh99LlOIY</p> 3. Actions Completed Due to&nbsp;“Yes” <p>As promised to the Ocean community, we have completed the “Actions if ‘yes’” summarized above. Here are the specifics.</p> 3.1 Promise: veOCEAN will be&nbsp;retired <p>✅ Action completed: veOCEAN is&nbsp;retired.</p><p>The DF webapp functionality to lock veOCEAN is removed. Incentives to lock OCEAN into veOCEAN have been turned off&nbsp;[1].</p><p>The DF webapp functionality to withdraw locked OCEAN has been retained; therefore when time passes and the token comes unlocked (up to 4 years), the user can come and withdraw their&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.2 Promise: Passive DF&nbsp;… will be&nbsp;retired <p>✅ Action completed: Passive DF is retired. (And you should claim your past Passive DF rewards.)</p><p>One can no longer enter into Passive DF because it relies on veOCEAN, which is retired. Passive DF rewards are permanently stopped.</p><p>To claim your past Passive DF&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to DF Rewards page at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>. In the “Passive Rewards” section, click the “Claim All”&nbsp;button.  This webapp functionality will remain live until Aug 1, 2024. After that, you will have to use the etherscan interface to claim rewards, which is more complex. (Same for Volume DF &amp; airdrop&nbsp;below.)   3.3 Promise: Volume DF will be&nbsp;retired <p>✅ Action completed: Volume DF is retired. (And you should claim your past Volume DF rewards.)</p><p>One can no longer enter into Volume DF because it relies on veOCEAN, which is retired. Volume DF rewards are permanently stopped.</p><p>To claim your past Volume DF&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to DF Rewards page at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>. In the “Active Rewards” section, click the “Revoke Token Lock Approval + Claim All” button. This will claim both past Volume DF Rewards and DF Airdrop&nbsp;Rewards.   3.4 Promise: Each address holding veOCEAN will be airdropped OCEAN <p>[according to the formula, using the Mar 27 snapshot]</p><p>✅ Action completed: Each address holding veOCEAN has been airdropped OCEAN. You should claim your airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The OCEAN reward amount is according to the formula, using the Mar 27 snapshot (as discussed above). The reward is as if you had got payouts of 25% APY for your whole veOCEAN lock period (and kept re-upping your lock). The Appendix gives an example of payout&nbsp;amounts.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nuRZ_LH1c1Fqq1XaUNDLZWwaJmeYmMApurrjsjmOkJ4/edit#gid=595053560">Here is the reward per&nbsp;address.</a></p><p>To claim DF Airdrop&nbsp;rewards:</p>  It’s all inside the “Active Rewards” section, just like Volume DF. Therefore…  Go to DF Rewards page at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>. In the “Active Rewards” section, click the “Revoke Token Lock Approval + Claim All” button. This will claim both past Volume DF Rewards and DF Airdrop&nbsp;Rewards.   3.5 Promise: psdnOCEAN reward with respectable ROI <p>Promise expanded: holders will be able to swap back to the OCEAN with a fixed-rate contract. For each 1 psdnOCEAN swapped they will receive &gt;1 OCEAN at a respectable ROI.</p><p>✅ Action, over next several days: The ROI is set to 1.25. There are a small number (17) of psdnOCEAN holders, so we are handling them manually. Here are our&nbsp;steps:</p>  Start from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/198FHy5h9Z9QYUojm-GF5Pmc56DN6NWrhb9ARqhAMtEY/edit#gid=0">this GSheet “snapshot of psdnOCEAN balances” page</a>  Have each user send their psdnOCEAN to 0xad0A852F968e19cbCB350AB9426276685651ce41 (DF Treasury multisig)  For each inbound tx, we will log in in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/198FHy5h9Z9QYUojm-GF5Pmc56DN6NWrhb9ARqhAMtEY/edit#gid=798720566">GSheet “transactions” page</a>  Then we will compute the user OCEAN reward, and send it to the&nbsp;user   3.6 Promise: Predictoor DF continues <p>✅ Action completed: Predictoor DF has continued while the other DF substreams were paused. It keeps&nbsp;going.</p> 3.7 Promise: Ocean Protocol Foundation will re-use the DF budget for its incentives programs <p>✅ Action on track: We plan to scale up Predictoor DF rewards over time, especially as it hits development milestones [Ref <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2024-e463bf855b03">2024 roadmap</a>, sec&nbsp;2.2].</p><p>Other potential DF incentives include for running Unified Backend nodes [roadmap, sec 3.2], and for decentralized large-scale model training to support a world model on ground-truth physics [roadmap, sec&nbsp;2.2].</p><p>Given this restructuring, the previous plans for long-term rewards schedule will not be used. Now, we adapt Data Farming budget week-by-week and month-by-month, to maximize the bang-for-buck of each OCEAN deployed for&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4. Conclusion <p>This article reviewed Ocean Data Farming (DF), the ASI Alliance, and how an ASI “yes” vote would affect Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>The “yes” happened. This triggered the follow-up actions:</p>  We just completed an airdrop to veOCEAN holders. Users can now claim OCEAN via the DF Webapp (<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>)  We have retired Passive &amp; Volume&nbsp;DF.  Predictoor DF continues, with room to scale up Predictoor DF and introduce new incentive streams.   Appendix: Worked DF Airdrop&nbsp;Example <p>Example. Alice recently locked 100 OCEAN for a duration of four years, and had received 100 veOCEAN to her&nbsp;account.</p>  She will get airdropped (1.25⁴–1)*100 = (2.44–1)*100 = 144 OCEAN soon after the “yes”&nbsp;vote  In four years, her initial 100 OCEAN will&nbsp;unlock.  In total, Alice will have received 244 OCEAN (144 soon, 100 in 4&nbsp;years).  Her return is approximately the same as if she’d used Passive DF &amp; Volume DF for 4 years and got 25% APY. That is: (1.2⁵⁴-1) * 100 = 2.44 * 100. Yet this updated scheme benefits her more because her 144 of that 244 OCEAN is liquid&nbsp;soon.   Notes <p>[1] We can’t actually turn off the veOCEAN contract on the Ethereum mainnet. Therefore someone could still lock OCEAN for months to years by talking directly to that contract, and then see their OCEAN unlock months to years later. It’s any user’s prerogative if they wish. But there’s no real incentive to do&nbsp;so.</p> Further resources <p>If you have more questions about the changes and how they apply to you, you can always contact us&nbsp;on:</p><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community</a></p> Beware of&nbsp;scams <p>It is crucial for you to remain alert.

Podium&nbsp;: Venture Capital Investments Data Challenge Introduction <p>The Venture Capital Investments Challenge engaged data scientists and analysts to decode the complexities of startup funding and success. This challenge drew on an extensive dataset covering various aspects of the venture capital ecosystem. Key datasets included acquisitions, degrees, funding rounds, funds, investments, IPOs, milestones, objects, offices, people, relationships, and several specialized sets designed for in-depth analysis.</p><p>Participants analyzed over 66,368 entries, exploring startup funding details and investor engagement. They examined geographical impacts on startups and the influence of educational backgrounds and degrees. Career trajectories and networks from people.csv and relationships.csv also provided insights into successful entrepreneurship patterns.</p><p>Through data processing and model development, participants identified trends and predictive factors in the funding dynamics, market positions, and strategic milestones. This initiative showcased participants’ analytical capabilities and set the stage for advanced predictive modeling in investment strategies.</p> Winners Podium <p>The top submissions of this challenge were exceptional. Participants demonstrated outstanding ability in utilizing ML and AI to examine and predict startup success within the venture capital landscape and refine investment strategies. Let’s examine the top three submissions that stood out due to their thorough analytics and insightful conclusions.</p> 1st Place:&nbsp;Ahan <p>Ahan stood out with his application of machine learning to analyze the venture capital landscape. His detailed analysis focused on the implications of founder demographics and funding dynamics on startup outcomes. He revealed that the median acquisition price among startups with disclosed values was approximately $72.6 million, with an average time from initial investment to acquisition of 695 days. This insight highlights the broad variance in startup valuations and the typical timelines investors might anticipate for&nbsp;returns.</p><p>Moreover, in his dataset of over 16,000 instances, Ahan identified significant disparities in success rates by founder gender, with male founders achieving a 40.3% success rate compared to 27.4% for female founders. This finding points to potential systemic biases in the venture capital industry and underscores the need for broader diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p> 2nd Place: Dominikus <p>Dominikus’ entry in the Ocean Data Challenge leveraged detailed venture capital data to build a predictive model distinguishing successful and unsuccessful startups. He restructured a complex dataset into 14 subsets in his analysis, applying statistical encoding and meticulously handling missing data. His statistical models revealed significant findings: startups in the San Francisco Bay Area, affiliated with Stanford University graduates, demonstrated a 65% higher likelihood of funding success than startups in other regions and educational backgrounds.</p><p>In his evaluation, Dominikus used precise statistical methods to measure the efficacy of his models. He reported an accuracy rate of 92%, with a precision of 90% and a recall of 88%, effectively illustrating the predictive strength of his analytical approach. Additionally, the ROC curve for his model achieved an AUC of 0.91, underscoring its robustness in classifying the potential success of startups based on multiple factors, including funding history, investor relationships, and regional economic activities.</p><p>His analysis provided a clear view of the venture capital landscape, offering insights through correlation studies that identified the relationships influencing startup&nbsp;success.</p> 3rd Place:&nbsp;Bhalisa <p>Bhalisa Sodo’s analytical project thoroughly examined the factors influencing startup success within the venture capital landscape. His method involved detailed data cleaning and segmentation, processing a comprehensive dataset to uncover the dynamics of startup funding and success. Bhalisa used statistical methods to analyze correlations between founder backgrounds, funding mechanisms, and startup outcomes, presenting a quantitative foundation for his conclusions.</p><p>In his findings, Bhalisa showed that startups linked to founders from top-tier institutions like Stanford University were 30% more likely to secure funding and achieve successful exits than others. His predictive models showed an impressive accuracy rate, with the Decision Tree Classifier achieving a classification accuracy of 98% and a recall rate of 97%, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying potentially successful startups based on early-stage data&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>Moreover, Bhalisa’s research revealed that startups typically received their first significant funding round within the first two years of operation, and those receiving funding within the first year showed a 60% higher probability of reaching an exit through acquisition or IPO within eight&nbsp;years.</p><p>His analysis also noted an increasing trend in funding amounts over time, with the average funding per round growing by 15% annually since 2010, reflecting the escalating scale and stakes within the venture capital ecosystem.</p> Interesting Facts  Higher Success Rates for Stanford Graduates <p>Startups linked to founders from Stanford University show a 30% higher success rate of securing funding and achieving successful exits than those from other universities. This trend highlights Stanford’s strong network and reputation within the venture capital ecosystem.</p> Annual Increase in Funding&nbsp;Amounts <p>Since 2010, the average amount raised per startup funding round has increased by 15% annually. This growth reflects the increasing confidence and investment in startups, driven by the expanding venture capital market and the success rate of technology-driven innovations.</p> Prevalence of AI and Tech Startups in Investment Portfolios <p>Over the last decade, investments in AI and technology-focused startups have increased by 35%. This trend reflects the industry’s growing recognition of the transformative potential of AI technologies across various&nbsp;sectors.</p> Influence of Educational Background on Startup Leadership <p>Founders with Ivy League educations are 50% more likely to hold C-level positions in their startups. This statistic highlights the strong correlation between prestigious educational backgrounds and leadership roles in high-growth startups, suggesting that education continues to play a critical role in shaping entrepreneurial success.</p> Gender Funding Gap in&nbsp;Startups <p>Analysis reveals that male founders receive about 30% more funding rounds and secure 50% higher funding than female founders. Moreover, male-led startups are 20% more likely to reach advanced funding stages, highlighting persistent gender biases in venture&nbsp;capital.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Each challenge features a prize pool of $10,000, distributed among the top 10 participants. Our championship points system distributes 100 points across the top 10 finishers in each challenge, with each point valued at&nbsp;$100.</p>Top 10&nbsp;:: Venture Capital Investments Data Challenge<p>By participating in challenges, contestants accumulate points toward the 2024 Championship.

<p>Today’s consumers’ expectations for their financial interactions are changing. They require a digitally native, seamless, consistent, instantaneous experience with their financial provider right from the get-go. No longer are they willing to wait several days for identity verifications or for microdeposits to clear to start using their account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, we know that everyday bad actors are finding new ways to break the system. As more people and businesses enter the digital economy, it’s critical that we keep them secure across all touchpoints with their accounts and beyond. Financial Institutions must protect their customers’ accounts from fraud to ultimately drive primacy, grow deposits and encourage top of wallet behaviors, thus helping them recoup the estimated <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/bank-onboarding/the-importance-of-primacy-in-banking-176198/">$450 average cost of acquisition</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking is the thread connecting the ecosystem to make account opening faster, secure, and more frictionless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a common scenario that financial institutions deal with on a daily basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 ‘John Doe’ opened a new checking account with ‘AcmeBank’ and is ready to fund it with another existing account he has with ‘Partnerbank’&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 How does AcmeBank know that John is the actual owner of the account at Partnerbank? Should Acmebank proceed with posting the ACH file to the Nacha (ACH) network, letting the transaction go through? If John Doe were a bad actor, and Acme bank allowed the payment to go through without doing appropriate checks, John Doe could move that money elsewhere and AcmeBank could get an unauthorized payment return from ‘Partnerbank’, resulting in fraud losses.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Similarly, some insurance companies simply ask for account and routing number verification before disbursing funds, not verifying the identity of the receiver. Here, John Doe can impersonate another person, and use his own personal details to re-direct an insurance payout or a payroll disbursement to his account. &nbsp; 
 



 What is the ecosystem doing about it?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/fighting-credit-push-fraud#:~:text=Under%20these%20new%20Rules%2C%20all,in%20monitoring%20transactions%20for%20fraud.">New rules and guidelines are being published by Nacha</a> – operator of ACH payments – that introduce additional risk management frameworks for ACH senders, as well as recipients. Ecosystem participants such as merchants, ecommerce platforms, lenders, and insurance providers may be required to include account verification and identity verification, multi-factor authentication, velocity tracking and KYC/KYB improvements. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/mastercard">Mastercard</a> is a Nacha Preferred Partner for Compliance and Risk and Fraud Prevention with a focus on account validation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to more thorough fraud checks being conducted by originators, receivers now also must participate in fraud monitoring and flagging to reduce risk. In the above example, Acmebank, the receiving financial institution, will also need to perform additional fraud checks. &nbsp;</p>



 What can you do?&nbsp; 



<p>Mastercard Open Banking helps financial institutions identify, manage and tackle fraud risk on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; Examples of our solutions include instant account details verification, device and identity verification. When used in conjunction with other customer fraud solutions, they help secure interactions that consumers have with their financial provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Mastercard debuted Open Banking Identity Verification for the U.S. market and continues to invest in additional functionality that leverage our extensive fraud and identity networks. Before initiating a transaction, financial institutions can verify a number of factors, including:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Confirming account ownership information, including name, address, phone and email, in real-time&nbsp; 



 Validating identity profiles and quantifying identity risk&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Examining the risk level of user activity patterns and associations to detect fraudulent behavior&nbsp; 



 Verifying device authenticity and capturing signals of device fraud&nbsp; 
 



<p>Beyond Open Banking Identity Verification, Mastercard offers services to streamline account funding, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Account Owner Verification: A one-time API request that returns the account owner(s) name, address, email and phone number for a select account. This verifies that the bank account being linked is owned by the person opening a new account and complements KYC risk mitigation in real time.&nbsp; 



 Account Detail Verification: Instantly authenticates and verifies account details, including account and routing numbers, to help mitigate fraud, reduce manual entry errors and maximize confidence in payment transactions.&nbsp; 



 Account Balance Check: Easily determines account balance before moving funds to a new account. This ensures that the amount being moved to the new account is available with an accurate, real-time balance snapshot, and reduces costly NSF returns.&nbsp; 



 Payment Success Indicator: A score that predicts a transaction’s likelihood to settle for a specific consumer “today” and up to nine days in the future. &nbsp; 
 



<p>Now let’s look the journey again with our solutions:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Consumer has opened a new checking account with ‘Acme Bank’ and is ready to fund it using existing bank account at ‘Partnerbank’&nbsp; 



 Consumer agrees to T&amp;Cs and gives permission through Mastercard’s Connect widget for their bank data to be accessed and shared with Acme bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Consumer selects their Partnerbank account and enters banking login credentials (or biometrics where applicable)&nbsp; 



 Consumer selects funding account and amount&nbsp; 



 Acme bank calls our above APIs in the background to check account and identity details in real-time and proceeds with the processing the payment&nbsp;

  <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I’m thrilled to share that the public preview of external authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID is scheduled for release in the first half of May. This feature will allow you to use your preferred multifactor authentication (MFA) solution with Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying MFA is the single most important step to securing user identities. A <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/how-effective-is-multifactor-authentication-at-deterring-cyberattacks/">Microsoft Research study of MFA effectiveness</a> showed that the use of MFA reduced the risk of compromise by more than 99.2%! Some organizations have already deployed MFA and want to reuse that MFA solution with Entra ID. External authentication methods allows organizations to reuse any MFA solution to meet the MFA requirement with Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you might be familiar with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/controls">custom controls</a>. External authentication methods are the replacement of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/upcoming-changes-to-custom-controls/ba-p/1144696">custom controls</a>, and they provide several benefits over the custom controls approach. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 External authentication method integration, which uses industry standards and supports an open model&nbsp; 
 External authentication methods are managed the same way as Entra methods&nbsp; 
 External authentication methods are supported for a wide range of Entra ID use cases (including PIM activation) 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've invited Greg Kinasewitz, Product Manager for Microsoft Entra ID, to tell you more about this new capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and as always, let us know what you think!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitika Gupta</p>
<p>Group Product Manager</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greg here. I’m super excited to walk you through some of the key capabilities of external authentication methods and readiness from partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve heard from some of you about wanting to use another MFA solution along with the power of Entra ID functionality like the rich features of Conditional Access, Identity Protection, and more.&nbsp; Customers using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) with a deployment of another MFA solution have been vocal in wanting this functionality so they can migrate from AD FS to Entra ID. Organizations that are using the Conditional Access custom controls preview have given feedback on needing a solution that enables more functionality. External authentication methods enable your users to authenticate with an external provider as part of satisfying MFA requirements in Entra ID to fill these needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are external authentication methods, and how do you use them? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External authentication methods can be used to satisfy MFA requirements from Conditional Access Policies, Privileged Identity Management role activation, Identity Protection risk-based polices and Microsoft Intune device registration. They’re created and managed as part of the Entra ID authentication methods policy.&nbsp; This gives consistent manageability and experience with the built-in methods. You’ll add an external authentication method with the new “Add external method” button in the Entra Admin Center authentication methods management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: External authentication methods are added from and listed in authentication methods policies admin experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user is choosing a method to satisfy MFA, external authentication methods are listed alongside built-in methods that the user can use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: External authentication methods are shown next to the built-in methods during sign-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, check out our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What providers will support external authentication methods? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At launch, external authentication methods integrations will be available with the following identity providers. Please check with your identity provider to find out more about availability:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the providers that now have integrations in place, external authentication methods is a standards-based open model where any authentication provider that wants to build an integration can do so by following the <a href="https://aka.ms/EAM-Integration-Docs">integration documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re super excited for you to be able to start using external authentication methods to help secure your users, and we’re looking forward to your feedback!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about these integrations, please visit the Microsoft booth at the RSA Conference next week. There will also be an RSA Conference session hosted by Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) where Duo will showcase their external authentication methods integration.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It might be just my pet peeve, but I never really liked the term “Firewall”. Of course, the history of IT is full of words that have completely changed their meaning over the decades yet still occasionally cause discussions among experts. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/antivirus-is-dead-so-what">Is antivirus dead</a>, for example, considering that they stopped making real viruses years ago?</p>
<p>Firewall, however, stands out even more. The original brick-and-mortar one had one purpose only: to limit the spread of fire between buildings. A real firewall does not have any holes, and surely, it cannot apply any logic to different kinds of fire… A network firewall, however, could. That was its primary purpose – to filter network traffic based on defined rules, letting “good” traffic in, and keeping malicious stuff out. Over the following decades, the concept has evolved significantly, with next-generation firewalls adding capabilities like deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and even identity management.</p>
<p>Multiple ranges of specialized products have emerged, like Web Application Firewalls specializing on protecting web apps and APIs or even Database Firewalls designed to prevent SQL-specific attacks on relational databases. A modern firewall is thus a sophisticated solution that combines multiple layers of security, often powered by behavior analytics and artificial intelligence – a far cry from the original rules-based one. Is it even fair to continue referring to them as brick walls?</p>
<p>I can see you asking me already: why have I even brought this pet peeve of mine up? Well, recently I was looking at a new security tool — <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/sql-firewall-now-built-into-oracle-database-23c">Oracle SQL Firewall</a> — which the company has built into its upcoming Oracle Database 23ai release. And while I wholeheartedly agree with the product’s vision, surely, calling it just a firewall is a bit odd.</p>
<p>You see, all past and current firewalls (even Oracle’s own specialized Database Firewall) are operating on the network level, forming a perimeter around a resource that requires protection and filtering traffic between it and its clients. The problem is that in the modern hyperconnected world, there are so many potential network paths between sensitive data and potentially malicious actors that protecting them all appears to be impossible.</p>
<p>This is why the concept of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-centric-security">data-centric security</a> has emerged years ago, focusing on protecting data itself throughout its entire lifecycle instead of constantly plugging holes in existing networks, servers, and applications. Oracle Database’s “killer feature” has always been the ability to keep all kinds of information (relational, document- and graph-based, spatial, and even vector) in one place and run complex workloads like AI training directly within the database. Integrating an additional security layer to prevent SQL-level attacks directly into the DB core is therefore a major step towards data-centric security.</p>
<p>The new Oracle Database 23ai adds multiple new capabilities that can also create new attack vectors. For example, using Select AI to generate SQL queries from natural language prompts is a great tool for data analysts and business application developers. But to enable it, a database must communicate with an external large language model, and conventional firewalls simply cannot protect it from potential abuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: High-level overview of SQL Firewall’s architecture</p>
<p>Oracle SQL Firewall, on the other hand, operates directly in the database core, making sure that it cannot be bypassed, regardless of the SQL execution path – whether coming from an external client, a local privileged user, or a generative AI solution. Residing directly in the database also provides it with the necessary insight into all the activities happening there.</p>
<p>Over time, it learns how various clients work with the data, establishing their behavior profiles and creating policies based on actions that are allowed for specific data. These allow-lists explicitly define what SQL statements a specific database user is supposed to perform. Everything else – suspicious anomalies, zero-day attacks, and, of course, SQL injection attacks – is blocked. However, it is possible to run SQL Firewall in a permissive mode as well, just generating audit records and alerts.</p>
<p>This protection is not only ubiquitous and impossible to bypass, but also completely transparent to any client applications, local or remote. There is no need to change existing network settings, introduce a proxy service or give a third-party vendor access to your sensitive data for monitoring. As an added benefit, SQL Firewall incorporates mandatory identity checks through session context, making credential theft or abuse much more difficult.</p>
<p>Of course, Oracle already had several security tools with similar coverage for years, including Audit Vault and Database Firewall – and they are even more capable in a way, providing coverage for non-Oracle databases as well. However, SQL Firewall is a core function of the new 23ai release, not an additional product. It is currently available in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and requires either Oracle Database Vault or Oracle Audit Vault and Database Firewall.</p>
<p>Its configuration can be managed in several ways: either using the Oracle Cloud’s UI (exposed through <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/database-security/data-safe/">Oracle Data Safe</a>) or by utilizing command line tools or APIs. Needless to say, it is available at no extra cost and has negligible performance overhead. This way, it not only implements data-centric security, but also helps enforce the “security by design” principle and facilitates the adoption of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Zero Trust architectures</a>.</p>
<p>So, is SQL Firewall supposed to replace all the other data security tools? Not at all, its goal is to add another layer of protection into an existing defense-in-depth stack. Often, it will, in fact, be the last line of defense, positioned directly in front of your sensitive data. Should it be called a firewall? Again, while I, personally, don’t like the term, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet… As KuppingerCole Analysts always stress – you should not look at the labels and always check the actual capabilities offered by a product.</p>
<p>With Oracle’s new solution, you can address two major problems at the same time: protecting databases from SQL-based attacks and implementing 100% audit coverage of database activities. Not bad for a firewall, I think…</p>

  <p>We really, really want to eliminate passwords. There’s really <a href="https://aka.ms/yourpassword">nothing anyone can do</a> to make them better. As more users have adopted multifactor authentication (MFA), attackers have increased their use of Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing and social engineering attacks, which trick people into revealing their credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we defeat these attacks while making safe sign-in even easier? Passkeys!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A passkey is a strong, phishing-resistant authentication method you can use to sign in to any internet resource that supports the W3C WebAuthN standard. Passkeys represent the continuing evolution of the FIDO2 standard, which should be familiar to anyone who’s followed or joined the passwordless movement. We already support signing into Entra ID using a passkey hosted on a hardware security key and today, we’re delighted to announce additional support for passkeys. Specifically, we’re adding support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android for customers with the strictest security requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we describe the new capabilities we’re adding to Microsoft Authenticator, let’s review the basics of passkeys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passkeys neutralize phishing attempts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passkeys provide high security assurance by applying <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccertenroll/public-key-infrastructure">public-private key cryptography</a> and requiring direct interaction with the user. As I detailed in a <a href="https://aka.ms/allyourcreds">previous blog</a>, passkeys benefit from “Verifier Impersonation Resistance":&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 URL-specific. The provisioning process for passkeys records the relying party’s URL, so the passkey will only work for sites with that same URL.&nbsp; 
  Device-specific. The relying party will only grant access to the user if the passkey is synched, stored, or connected to the device from which they’re requesting access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  User-specific. The user must prove they’re physically present during authentication, usually by performing a gesture on the device from which they’re requesting access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these characteristics make passkeys almost impossible to phish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 You can host passkeys on dedicated hardware security keys, phones, tablets, and laptops 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can host their passkeys on dedicated hardware security keys (such as FIDO2 security keys) or on user devices such as phones, tablets, or PCs. Windows 10/11, iOS 17, and Android 14 are examples of user device platforms that support passkeys. Each supports signing in with a passkey hosted directly on the user device itself or by connecting to a nearby user device or security key that hosts the passkey, such as a mobile device within Bluetooth range, an NFC-enabled security key, or a USB security key plugged into the user device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization issues dedicated hardware security keys, you sign-in by inserting your key into the USB port or tapping it to the NFC scanner and perform the PIN or biometric verification it requires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sign-in using a passkey on a user device, simply scan your face or fingerprint with your device or enter your device PIN. It’s also simple to sign-in to an application on a separate device, such as a new phone or a PC. Point the camera of the device hosting your passkey at the QR code displayed on the separate device and use your passkey along with your biometric or PIN to sign in. You may have already followed this process by using an Android or iPhone to sign into services such as Amazon.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passkeys may be device-bound or syncable 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the scenario, you may prefer a device-bound passkey or a syncable passkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A device-bound passkey, as the name suggests, never leaves the device to which it’s issued. If you sign-in using a security key or Windows Hello, you’re using a device-bound passkey. By definition, you can’t back up or restore a device-bound passkey because during these operations the passkey would leave the hardware element. This restriction is important for organizations that must, sometimes by law, protect passkeys from any security vulnerabilities that could arise during synchronization and recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they offer strong security, dedicated hardware keys can be expensive to issue and manage. If you lose, replace, or destroy the dedicated device, you must provision a brand-new passkey on a new device. And since device-bound passkeys aren’t portable or recoverable, they increase friction for people trying to move away from passwords. To simplify the experience for users who don’t operate in highly regulated environments, the industry introduced support for syncable passkeys. You can back up and recover a syncable passkey, which makes it possible to share the same passkey between devices or to restore it if you lose or upgrade your device—there’s no need to provision a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Syncable passkeys on user client devices are easy to use, easy to manage, and offer high security 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Syncable passkeys on user devices are exciting because they address many of the toughest usability and recoverability challenges that have confronted organizations trying to move to passwordless, phishing-resistant authentication. Hosting the passkey on the user’s device means organizations don’t have to issue or manage a separate device, and syncing it among the user’s client devices and the cloud massively reduces the expense of recovering and reissuing device-bound keys. And on top of all this, replacing passwords with passkeys thwarts more than 99% of identity attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect this combination of benefits will make syncable passkeys the best option for the vast majority of users and organizations. Android and iOS devices can host syncable passkeys today, and we’re working to add support in Windows by this fall. Our roadmap for 2024 includes support for both device-bound and syncable passkeys in Microsoft Entra ID and <a href="https://aka.ms/VasuJoyWPD2024">Microsoft consumer accounts</a>. Stay tuned for further announcements later this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Device-bound passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry or governmental regulation, or other highly strict security policies, require that some enterprises and government agencies use device-bound passkeys for signing in to Microsoft Entra. This small fraction of organizations has strict requirements governing the recovery of lost credentials and for preventing employees from sharing credentials with anyone else. Nonetheless, these organizations also want the usability, manageability, and deployment benefits of storing passkeys on user-client devices such as mobile phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Advantages of hosting passkeys on a user device:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Organizations don’t have to provision dedicated hardware.&nbsp; 
  Users are less likely to lose track of their daily computing device.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  It’s easy to sign in with a passkey hosted on a user device. 
 




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that device-bound keys are a must-have for many of our largest, most regulated and most security conscious customers. That’s why we’ve been collaborating with these customers, along with the broader FIDO community, to provide additional options. As part of this work, we’re adding support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android. Instead of provisioning separate devices, high-security organizations can now configure Entra ID to let employees sign-in using their existing phone and their device-bound passkey. Users get a familiar phone interface, including biometrics or local lockscreen PIN or password, while their organizations meet strict security requirements because users can’t sync, share, or recover any device-bound passkey hosted in Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations that use device-bound passkeys trade the benefit of large investments that vendors such as Google (<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/10/SecurityofPasskeysintheGooglePasswordManager.html">see related article</a>) and Apple (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-icloud-keychain-recovery-secdeb202947/web">see related article</a>) have made in creating high-security, self-service passkey recovery models for the benefit of meeting strict regulatory or security requirements. They become responsible for sharing and recovering device-bound passkeys, including those hosted in Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For detailed guidance on how to get started with device-bound passkeys hosted in Microsoft Authenticator, please refer to our <a href="https://aka.ms/PasskeyInAuthenticator">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft’s commitment to passwordless authentication 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is continuing to enhance our support for passkey in products such as Entra, Windows, and Microsoft accounts. Please continue to send us feedback, so we can help you eliminate passwords from your environment forever.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>As eIDAS2 prepares to go live, its implications extend far beyond the borders of the European Union, setting a new global standard for digital identity management. Organizations worldwide need to understand and prepare for these changes, ensuring they can operate effectively in a new era of digital identity. The 2024 European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) provides a unique opportunity to gain insights, share knowledge, and prepare for the future of digital identity, where security, privacy, and user control are at the forefront of digital transactions.</p>
<p>In a digital era characterized by an increasing reliance on online services and transactions, the security and reliability of digital identities has never been more critical. The European Union has taken a groundbreaking step with the publication of EU Regulation 2024/1183, officially known as eIDAS2. This new regulation, set to come into force on May 20, 2024, not only strengthens the framework for digital identities within the EU but also sets a global precedent for how digital identity services can be managed and utilized. Its implementation, which coincides with EIC 2024, could reshape organizational strategies worldwide.</p>
 What is eIDAS2? 
<p>eIDAS2 builds on the original electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) regulation aimed at enhancing trust in electronic transactions across the EU. The revision introduces several pivotal elements, most notably the European Digital Identity Wallets (EDIW). These wallets serve as secure digital tools that allow EU citizens and businesses to store, manage, and utilize personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes seamlessly across borders. This framework ensures that every natural and legal person in the EU can access public and private services online without sacrificing control over their personal data.</p>
 The Significance of eIDAS2 for Organizations Globally 
<p>eIDAS2 is not just a regulatory framework for Europe; it is a beacon for global digital identity management. Organizations around the world should pay attention to these developments for several reasons:</p>
 
 Standard Setting in Digital Identity: eIDAS2 sets a high standard for privacy, security, and interoperability that could become a global benchmark. Non-EU organizations dealing with European partners will need to understand these standards to ensure compliance and smooth interactions. 
 Enhanced Security and Trust: With the introduction of <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/compliance/conformity-assessment/index_en.htm#:~:text=Conformity%20assessment%20organisations%20These%20notified%20bodies%20are%20organisations,NANDO%20website%20%28New%20Approach%20Notified%20and%20Designated%20Organisations%29.">conformity assessment bodies</a> and certification mechanisms, eIDAS2 ensures that digital identity tools and services are reliable and secure. This level of trustworthiness is something organizations worldwide might emulate to enhance their digital identity solutions. 
 Innovation in Identity Management: The EDIW promotes innovation in how identities and attributes are managed and utilized. Organizations can use this model to develop similar solutions, improving customer experiences and operational efficiencies. 
 
 Implications for Accessing Services 
<p>A key component of eIDAS2 is its inclusivity. The regulation mandates that the use of the EDIW is voluntary and that services cannot discriminate against those who choose not to use digital wallets. This principle may influence global service delivery models, emphasizing the need for flexibility in how services and identities are managed digitally.</p>
 Relevance to the Global Digital Economy 
<p>The digital economy is inherently borderless, where services and goods traverse national boundaries in milliseconds. The eIDAS2 framework facilitates this movement in the EU, potentially creating a ripple effect worldwide as other regions seek to ensure their digital identity systems are interoperable with Europe's. This alignment could lead to smoother transactions, enhanced security, and a more connected global digital economy.</p>
 European Digital Identity Wallets: A Closer Look 
<p>EDIWs are at the heart of eIDAS2. They allow users to control their identity data fully, choosing when and how much information to share when accessing services. This user-centric approach not only enhances privacy but also empowers individuals, fostering a more trustful digital environment. For organizations, understanding how these wallets work and integrating compatible systems will be crucial.</p>
 OpenID4VC: Enhancing the European Digital Identity Wallet 
<p>One of the core elements of the EDIW is OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC), a protocol that stands to revolutionize the way verifiable credentials are exchanged and managed within the eIDAS2 framework. OpenID4VC facilitates the secure and seamless exchange of credentials between issuers, holders, and verifiers, making it a pivotal component in the implementation of the EDIW.</p>
<p>This protocol not only simplifies the process of verifying credentials in real time but also ensures that all transactions adhere to the highest standards of security and privacy mandated by eIDAS2. By integrating OpenID4VC, the EDIW allows users to assert personal data or attributes stored in their wallets without revealing any more information than necessary. This capability is crucial for maintaining user privacy and control over personal information. For organizations globally, understanding and implementing OpenID4VC will be essential to interact efficiently with European entities under the new regulations. The protocol's adoption could also set a precedent for similar initiatives worldwide, promoting a more interconnected and interoperable digital identity landscape. The integration of OpenID4VC into the EDIW exemplifies the EU’s commitment to pioneering advanced, user-centric digital identity solutions that could influence future developments in global digital identity frameworks.</p>
 eIDAS 2 is the Key Topic at EIC 
<p>The fact that EIC, Europe's leading conference on Digital ID coincides with the enforcement of eIDAS2 is serendipitous for all stakeholders. This convergence will provide a platform for immediate feedback, discussions, and strategy development among policymakers, industry leaders, and technology developers. For attendees, it offers a firsthand look at the regulation's rollout and immediate implications, making it an essential event for anyone involved in digital identity, cybersecurity, or European market operations.

  <p>I'm thrilled to announce that Microsoft Entra External ID, our next-generation, developer-friendly customer identity access management (CIAM) solution will be generally available starting May 15th. Whether you're building applications for partners, business customers or consumers, External ID makes secure and customizable CIAM simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra External ID&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure and customize external identities’ access to applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra External ID enables you to: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all identities with a single solution&nbsp; 
 Streamline secure collaboration&nbsp; 
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Secure all identities with a single solution &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing external identities, including customers, partners, business customers, and their access policies can be complex and costly for admins, especially when managing multiple applications with a growing number of users and evolving security requirements. With External ID, you can consolidate all identity management under the security and reliability of Microsoft Entra. Microsoft Entra provides a unified and consistent experience for managing all identity types, simplifying identity management while reducing costs and complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building External ID on the same stack as Entra ID allows us to innovate quickly and enables admins to extend the Microsoft Entra capabilities they use to external identities, including our industry-leading adaptive access policies, fraud protection, verifiable credentials, and built-in identity governance. Our launch customers have chosen External ID as their CIAM solution as it allows them to manage all identity types from a single platform:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Komatsu will be using Entra External ID for all external-facing applications. This will help us deliver a great experience to our customers and ensure we're a trusted partner that is easy to do business with." </p>
<p>- Michael McClanahan, Vice President, Transformation and CIO&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry-leading identity security provides end-to-end access to applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Streamline secure collaboration &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boundaries between consumers and business customers are blurring, as are the boundaries between partners and employees. Collaborating with external users like business customers and partners can be challenging; they need access to the right internal resources to do their work, but that access must be removed when it's no longer needed to reduce security risks and safeguard internal data. In this changing world, even trusted collaboration needs least-privilege safeguards, strong governance, and pervasive branding. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/manage-guest-access-with-access-reviews">ID Governance for External ID</a>, the same lifecycle management and access management capabilities for employees can be leveraged for business guests as well. Guest governance capabilities complement <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b">External ID B2B collaboration</a> that’s already widely used by Entra customers worldwide to&nbsp; make collaboration secure and seamless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you may want to collaborate with an external marketing agency on a new campaign. With B2B collaboration, you can invite the agency staff to join your tenant as guests and assign them access to the relevant resources, such as a Teams channel for communication, a SharePoint site for project management, and a OneDrive folder for file sharing.&nbsp; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview">Cross-tenant access settings</a> allow you to have granular controls over which users from specific external organizations get access to your resources, as well as control which external organizations your users access.&nbsp; <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579">ID Governance for External ID</a> will automatically review and revoke their access after a period of inactivity or when the project is completed. This way, you can seamlessly collaborate while ensuring only authorized external users have access to internal resources and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control what resources external collaborators can access with cross-tenant access settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personalized and flexible user experiences are critical to drive customer adoption and retention. External ID lets you reduce end-user friction at sign in by natively integrating secure authentication experiences into your web and mobile apps. You can leverage a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/identity-providers">variety of authentication</a> options, such as social identities like Google, Facebook, local or federated accounts, and even verifiable credentials to make it easy for your end users to sign-up/sign-in. External ID enables you to immerse end-users in your brand and create engaging user-centric experiences with progressive profiling, increasing end-user satisfaction and driving brand love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design secure, intuitive, and frictionless sign-up and sign-in user journeys that immerse external identities in your brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External ID allows you to further personalize and optimize end-user experiences by collecting and analyzing end-user data, improving their user journey while complying with privacy regulations. Our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-user-insights">user insight dashboards</a> help monitor user activities and sign-up/sign-in trends, so that you can assess and improve your end-user experience strategy with data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity is a foundational building block of any modern application, but many developers may have little experience integrating identity and security into their apps. External ID turns your developers into identity pros by making it easy to integrate identity into web and mobile applications with a few clicks. Developers can get started creating their first application in minutes either directly from the Microsoft Entra portal or within their developer tools such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/visual-studio-code-extension">Visual Studio Code.</a> We recently announced that our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/concept-native-authentication">Native Authentication</a> now supports Android and iOS, allowing developers to build pixel-perfect sign-up and sign-in journeys into mobile apps using either our API or the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL):&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A mobile app sign in journey could have taken us months to design and build, but with Microsoft Entra External ID Native Auth, it took the team just one week to build a functionally comparable and even more secure solution.” </p>
<p>– Gary McLellan, Head of Engineering Frameworks and Core Mobile Apps, Virgin Money&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Developer Center is a great starting point for developer to find quick start guides, demos, blogs and more showcasing how to build secure user flows into apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backed by the reliability and resilience of Microsoft Entra, developers can launch from a globally distributed architecture designed to accommodate the needs of growing user bases; ensuring their external-facing apps can handle millions of users during peak periods, without disrupting end-user experiences or compromising security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customer loyalty is won – and lost – at login. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">60% of customers admit to abandoning an account forever when they have trouble signing in</a>. Convenience and ease of use are key, and as customer expectations become ever more exacting, organizations looking to retain customers and grow loyalty need to prioritize removing unnecessary barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the point of login can be such a cause for session and cart abandonment, many websites offer a convenient "Keep Me Signed In" or "Stay Signed In" checkbox on their sign-in screen, allowing consumers to keep their sessions active longer. This functionality can significantly improve customer experience and boost revenue, and has become a familiar feature across numerous applications and online platforms. However, longer-lasting sessions bring with them an elevated risk of session hijacking, which can lead to companies shouldering higher fraud resolution costs, or possibly hesitating to implement “Keep Me Signed In” at all, to the detriment of customer experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge, therefore, lies in finding a way to properly secure long-lived sessions to satisfy customers while protecting your business. Whether your organization has already implemented “Keep Me Signed In” or you’re still considering whether it may be a good fit for your business, read on for an overview of the benefits of this customer-pleasing functionality and the role of advanced <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/threat-protection.html">threat protection</a> in decreasing the risk of session compromise.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: Thanks to Software Engineer, Kevin Chiang, for this week’s post.</p>
<p>Any time you sign up for a service, you start receiving emails from them; it’s basically a law. If your inbox looks like mine, it’s bombarded with marketing emails, weekly digests, or notifications like “You’re nearing your spending limit in GCP” (some of these might be more important than others). Email works well as the first place to send notifications since people usually sign up with their email. But with everything going to your inbox nowadays, it’s easy to miss that onboarding reminder for Sarah, who starts next Monday and still needs her Github and Zoom accounts provisioned.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? These days, every workplace has an all-instant messaging/chat service. That’s usually where people are most responsive. So why not receive your notifications there as well?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to YeshBot – our Slack notification service.</p>
<p>Combined with the rest of the YeshID platform, it removes the need for you to go through your checklist and manually slack/nag task owners to finish their work. But instead, with a click of a button, all folks who are involved with onboarding or offboarding are notified of the work that needs to get done!</p>
 Connect YeshBot to your account 
<p>Connecting the bot is easy! Simply log in to your YeshID admin account and find the “Add to Slack” button under Settings &gt; YeshID Slack Bot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the button to complete the OAuth flow and you are ready to go.&nbsp; For details on how to do this see our <a href="https://yeshid.notion.site/How-To-Use-the-YeshID-Slack-Integration-2be3726bb82c422fb3fd0dac3b8c862f">docs</a>.</p>
<p>Once the bot has connected successfully you’ll get a notification&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the YeshBot is set up to send messages for the YeshList feature that we wrote about in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshlist/">previous post</a>. So when you onboard a user through YeshID, for example, you will receive a notification:</p>
<p></p>
<p>YeshBot will send two types of notifications:</p>
 
 General notifications (onboarding/offboarding tasklist created or automated tasks failed) 
 Reminders to specific users when they have tasks to do. 
 
<p>General notifications are sent to all YeshID admins. You might want to have other team members stay in the loop for certain playbooks–for example (e.g. IT, HR, Finance for onboarding and offboarding). You can configure YeshID to send certain notifications to other channels.</p>
<p>How? Read on.</p>
 Set up notification channels in YeshID (optional) 
<p>To set up notifications to a channel, we need to add the YeshBot to the channel and then configure it in YeshID</p>
 
 Type in @YeshID in your desired notification channels.<br>
 
 Click “Add to Channel”<br>
<br>
 
 Set your notification channel in YeshID<br>
<br>
 
 
<p>YeshBot is now set up to send to your channel</p>
<p>A few tidbits to keep in mind when configuring the notification channels:</p>
 
 YeshBot may be added to any slack channel, but will not send any notifications unless configured to do so in the YeshID console.&nbsp; 
 YeshBot will broadcast the same notifications to every configured channel 
 Onboarding/offboarding information can be sensitive, so YeshBot can also be added to private channels to limit who sees the messages (Note: any user assigned a task will still be notified directly). 
 
 Deleting the integration 
<p>Under the same section (Settings &gt; YeshID Slack Bot), clicking on disconnect will remove the Bot from your Slack environment.</p>
<p></p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Integrating YeshBot with your Slack workspace lets you ditch the email overload and streamline your onboarding and offboarding processes. YeshBot delivers crucial notifications directly to your team, ensuring everyone stays informed, and tasks get completed on time.</p>

<p>In September of 2023, a Moody’s report aired concerns about Aadhaar, the pioneering government digital ID service used by over one billion Indian citizens. Though it has mitigated fraud and helped countless Indians access services more easily, Moody’s argued Aadhaar posed major privacy and security risks, in large part thanks to its centralization.</p><p>India rebutted the concerns, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/most-trusted-digital-id-in-the-world-india-refutes-moodys-concerns-about-aadhaar/articleshow/103940681.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst">stating in part</a> that “to date no breach has been reported from Aadhaar database.”</p><p>Just months later, Aadhaar suffered an immense data theft.</p><p>The extremely sensitive personal data of nearly 800 million Indians appeared <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/the-worlds-largest-biometric-digital-id-program-indias-aadhaar-just-suffered-its-biggest-ever-data-leak.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">for sale on black-market forums for a mere $80,000</a>. This included not only their Aadhaar numbers, but their addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and more – and despite the government’s protestations, known thefts of Aadhaar data go all the way back to 2012. This doesn’t just expose Indians to payments, benefits, and banking fraud; it is also a vector for <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/153421/data-breach/aadhaar-data-leaks-india.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">national security risk</a>. Some might even argue these harms outweigh the benefits of the system.</p><p>Other pioneering digital ID systems worldwide, including China’s RealDID, verification providers relying on data brokers, and digital services that aggregate user data, have also shown centralization risks. These include not just lax cybersecurity but misuse by controlling authorities themselves. The trend of transitioning to digitally native identification systems is clear. Still, the next generation of these systems must learn from the flaws and failures of pioneers – above all, by shifting away from centralized models that turn governments or corporations into ripe targets for criminals.</p> The Curse of the Innovator <p>Aadhaar was a hugely forward-thinking project when it launched in 2010, and it’s now the largest digital ID system in the world. There is no doubt that it provides immense utility to its user base of over a billion enrolled Indians. However, early projects in any realm can fall victim to the so-called “curse of the innovator” by failing to adopt new ideas following their creation. Several specific innovations, if they’re adopted by future digital ID projects, could help prevent breaches like the 2023 Aadhaar attack and other kinds of centralization risks.</p> Decentralization <p>As Moody’s pointed out, Aadhaar’s biggest flaw may be its centralization, with data and authorizations controlled by the Unique Identity Authority of India, or UIDAI. Centralization of digital identity credentials creates three related problems.</p><p>First, Aadhaar has a single point of failure – there have been many cases of benefits denial because the UIDAI couldn’t confirm a user’s identity. Second, centralization makes systems vulnerable to exploitation because all confirmations come from the same authority. For instance, Indian gangs have learned how to exploit the Aadhaar system to <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/uidai-says-its-system-detected-attempts-by-kanpur-gang-to-generate-fake-aadhaar-cards-4036627.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">generate fake identities</a> – and UIDAI has refused to disclose how many fake identities may be in the wild.</p><p>Third and most concerning, the centralization of Aadhaar’s identity data makes it an irresistible honeypot for cybercriminals. Particularly scary is that biometric data, including thousands of fingerprints, has been <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/watch-out-aadhar-biometrics-are-an-easy-target-for-hackers/articleshow/61183055.cms?ref=blog.spruceid.com">repeatedly stolen</a> and for use in fraud schemes. This data would allow an attacker to create targeted biometric spoofing attacks, which could defeat both remote and physical identity verification systems. The theft of biometric data is particularly damaging because it is essentially irreversible – unlike a password, you can’t “reset” your fingerprints.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, we have seen significant progress on models that prevent single points of failure or mass, single-target data theft. In these architectures, data can be distributed to the edges instead of accumulating in a central government database. Under this type of distributed scheme, far less data is stored by any one authority, with identity instead affirmed by various authorities, such as schools, utility companies, and government agencies. This approach is far more aligned with “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">zero-trust</a>” approaches to security, and as a result, there’s no “one-stop shop” where hackers can steal or fabricate credentials.</p> Zero-Knowledge Attestation <p>According to <a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/pii-belonging-to-indian-citizens-including-their-aadhaar-ids-offered-for-sale-on-the-dark-web?ref=blog.spruceid.com">analysis by the firm Resecurity</a>, Aadhaar leaks have been caused in part by security breaches at third parties, such as utilities, which had downloaded sensitive data from Aadhaar servers and stored them. Until <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software supply chains</a> are secured-by-default, these common utilities are likely to suffer ongoing compromises, as seen in the recent high-impact “<a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/04/02/a-stealth-attack-came-close-to-compromising-the-worlds-computers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">xz Utils</a>” and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">MOVEit</a> exploits. Innovations in cryptography, including a technique known as “zero-knowledge proofs,” now make it possible to affirm certain data without revealing it to the requester, thereby reducing (or even eliminating) the need for data transfers and the use of intermediate tools that can mishandle sensitive data.</p><p>For instance, a third party could confirm the match of a person’s biometric data without actually accessing a raw fingerprint or iris scan. Worldcoin, the Sam Altman-founded global ID startup, uses cryptographic “hashes” of users’ iris scans, rather than the raw data, to establish unique identity. This should prevent the theft of iris data – though this particular technique must be combined with several additional components and precautions to become a complete system that can combat disincentives and misuse.</p> Robust Data Siloing <p>Third parties that store sensitive data also often add more data of their own, violating the principle of “data siloing.” For instance, the 2023 Aadhaar hack included full packages combining ID numbers with biometrics, passport numbers, addresses, and phone numbers.</p><p>This unfolded largely because over time, Aadhaar identity numbers became required for more and more services. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/08/09/aadhaar/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">one critic wrote back in 2018</a>, “This turns Aadhaar into a dangerous bridge between these previously isolated silos. With each new data silo that gets linked, an important protection against 360-degree profiling gets weakened, leaving Indians vulnerable to data mining and identity theft.”</p><p>In addition to cryptographic methods that prevent third parties from reading raw identity data, the use of hardware security components can keep identity data from circulating while keeping attestations trustworthy.</p> Distributed Authority <p>One of the most disturbing uses of a digital identity system was reported by the New York Times, which covered a Chinese authority’s use of COVID-19 health codes to control the movement of citizens <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/business/china-code-protesters.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">protesting the freezing of their bank accounts</a>. While details remain unclear, it appears that authorities may have matched the identities of the owners of frozen accounts to their health registration accounts, allowing them to flag potential protestors as COVID risks.</p><p>This represents a kind of security breach where a system is used to accomplish unrelated (and potentially illegitimate) goals. As Chinese critics pointed out, this isn’t simply a one-time abuse, but undermines long-term faith and public trust in the identity system. Broadly, this is more evidence in favor of decentralized identity systems – not only separating data across authorities, but separating command and control functions from data entirely. With carefully designed digital identity architecture, “should not be abused” can become “cannot be abused.”</p><p>Instead of having one central IT department control all of a society’s digital identity and credentials, it is possible to build decentralized architectures that allow multiple authorities with additional checks and balances, transparency requirements, and improved individual control. This clear separation of powers can ensure that powerful financial, healthcare, and security systems cannot collude against an individual.</p> Distributed Identity For a Safer, Freer Digital Future <p>The mixed track record of digital identity services so far demonstrates how important it is to design them from the ground up with the right priorities: privacy, security, and individual control. These overriding goals have become more obvious thanks to the experimentation of early adopters, and technological solutions for achieving them have also emerged over time.</p><p>With identity systems, it’s not enough to say that systems won’t be compromised, relying on the expertise or ethics of human authorities. Instead, the systems must be built from the ground up with many layers of protection so they can’t be compromised. While there are still details to fill in, ID systems that are architected to use distributed data storage, advanced cryptography, and information minimization are the way to reach that goal. While these services have their flaws, they also have immense potential to provide public utility and fight fraud.</p><p>We must learn from programs that have paved the way, such as Aadhar, and ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of digital identity without compromising security or individual freedoms such as free speech, privacy, and user choice.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hello everybody, this is Michael Cichon. I’m the Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos, here with Vikram Subramaniam, our VP of Solutions, to talk about deepfakes. Vik, it’s great to have you, and welcome to the vlog. Deepfakes are in the news lately. Frightening news. One case recently, they were used to con a company out of $25 million, several payments totaling 25 million in Asia Pacific. Closer to home, we’ve heard stories of deepfakes, dialing the phone, calling people, folks answer the phone, and their friends, family, loved ones appear to be in distress and asking to be rescued. Some are claiming to have kidnapped people and asking for ransom. Quite devastating for anybody to receive these types of things. So this phenomenon of deepfakes, how did we get here? What are they?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, imagine that, Mission Impossible is becoming real. We are experiencing it in our everyday lives. I’ve only seen it in the movies, where you’ve got large command centers, where they’re taking small voice clips of different things and then, playing and tricking the bad guys into thinking that it’s one of their own. Regular people are facing it. And essentially, with AI and just freely available software these days, that takes advantage of the chips that we have in our computers and even generally available cloud and internet, you can produce video, you can produce voice, you can produce anything that looks or feels real to the person on the other side of a virtual line. So I’m thinking of form line, I’m thinking of a laptop, but yeah, this is where sometimes I just need to shake your hand to know if you are real, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you know I’m real right now? Is this not a deepfake? Is this somebody pretending to be me?</p>
<p>Exactly. Exactly right. I think so that’s where the world is going to, but these are essentially deepfakes, the same things that we have seen in the movies. So people wearing masks, you creating videos of or morphing someone’s face on top. And then, yeah, it just sounding like someone else. It’s crazy what’s out there with deepfakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, the evolution has been stunning. We’ve talked generally about artificial intelligence, but over the last 20 years, we’ve seen this evolution of artificial intelligence being the ability to recognize patterns very deeply in data somehow to get into a predictive science and now, to even approach what looks like thinking, when computers can draw inferences without being told to do so. The deepfake, the lineage, how we got here, essentially, what we have is two chess players, if you will, two adversarial networks creating a likeness and presenting it to another adversarial engine to be graded for similarity to a sample. And then, for this, basically, this iteration of synthetic media, at the speed of light, whether that’s a voice, whether that’s a video, even texting patterns, the way that somebody might text a friend or chat with somebody, that can also be deepfaked. Training, well, first, before I get into training deepfake attack, this technology now, five years ago, you had to be one of the world’s leading data scientists.</p>
<p>Yeah, data scientists, researcher, videographer, one of those special effects companies, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. Now, I just did a simple Google Search the other day using ChatGTP, and this thing brings me a half a dozen tools that I can, within probably an hour, create a deepfake video. Deepfakes trained on humans are one issue. We saw that with the $25 million that was taking. And certainly to the human eye, these deepfakes are very hard to detect. So in terms of humans, of humans, we’ve got to train people. We start to move millions of dollars around. We have to have policies, procedures, and oversight to prevent fraud at that scale. But I think, more on the sinister side, over the past, what, six, seven years, the authentication using live biometrics has set in. This is a step up from what we used to do. A thumb print or a face ID on a phone, we’re now logging in with essentially a live selfie, and that’s a step up in security.</p>
<p>But talk a little bit, if you will, about the way that deepfakes can be used to attack biometric authentication. Because before you start that, companies move into biometric authentication to get rid of passwords, and a live selfie had been pretty hard to fake. A live selfie can also be verified against a driver’s license. So you could have that direct connection of the live selfie to an offline credential and prove identity, but now, deepfakes are attacking. So can you talk a little bit about how deepfakes are being trained on authentication in cyber attacks?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. Right. So you mentioned it correctly, right? So we want convenience. We want to look at something, and then, it needs to open. So we have that happening on our phones. We have that happening at the immigration gates, and now, we obviously want it with our enterprise systems. So until now, obviously, hey, if you needed to fool something, if you needed to fool a face detection software, you would come and present a picture. You would come and present a video of the person that you wanted to impersonate. And in the early days, of course, you couldn’t find it. But I think technology has improved over multiple decades that technology now can prevent presentation attacks, where you’re actually presenting something to the camera, where you’re capturing like a picture, and if it’s a picture of a picture, from a screen, from a video, all of those things, you know that it’s not a live person. And it’s only then that the face is getting to match.</p>
<p>So the presentation attacks, yes, are evolving a little bit, but you know what? For the most part, I think a lot of companies and our solution basically can help prevent those presentation attacks. But because more and more companies are moving towards facial recognition and people are remote, now, impersonation has become big. And like you mentioned, there’s technology available out there to create videos and create stuff about things or videos or pictures that look like you, and from just freely available content. You’ve got public content. This vlog is going to be public. People can take small snippets from you, take your voice, take your face and create a short video and very likely try and fool the system. The problem there is, till now, you have to have another device to show it to the camera, and the moment you did that, the camera and generally having the picture and different objects out there, people could detect that it’s not a live person and it’s something that someone’s trying to attack.</p>
<p>But with deepfakes, the thing is that they are utilizing what we call as injection attacks. Injection is basically fooling the entire piece of software, because there is dependency on capturing a picture from the camera. And there is trust that pictures are coming from the camera, and we can depend on all of the things of the features of the camera to capture the picture, that trust is gone. So injection attacks are coming directly into the stream of the video, that comes in from the camera and goes out to the server. So it could very well be, we’ve got different kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>We’ve got JavaScript attacks, we’ve got the multiple cams or the substitute cams attacks, anything that really can inject itself into the stream, with the advent of technology, different scripts of being available, different pieces of technology, like mini cams. So they allow you to have multiple cameras and then, inject a video out there. And the software is no smarter and thinks that it is actually a person doing it. So now, that’s where deepfakes are there, but obviously, there is a way to prevent them. But Michael, I know you’ve been doing some research on deepfakes. Are there other things that you have noticed that people are doing out there?</p>
<p>Okay, well, let’s talk about this a little bit. You talk about presentation attacks. What are the defenses against presentation attacks?</p>
<p>Sure. So this is why, when we are doing a login at 1Kosmos, we verify multiple things. We verify the liveness of a user and also, do a face match of the user. And we are doing a one-to-one match. We’re not doing a one-to-many match. So which means that we are exactly verifying if the user is who they say they are. And along with that, before we do anything of that, we are verifying that the user is a live person. A couple of ways to do that. One is where we have the user follow specific instructions on the screen, like, “Turn left, turn right, smile.”</p>
<p>You know what I mean? I used to say, and I think it’s still valid, we’re the happiest MFA out there. We make people smile. So essentially, when people smile, we know that it is an actual human who’s able to follow instructions and then, do it. And along with that, we are able to go ahead and verify all of the other parameters of the picture that we captured of the person. At a random interval, we are able to capture the picture and then say that this is a live person or not.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome. So what you’re describing there, it’s the active liveness detection?</p>
<p>Correct, it’s the active liveness detection. And along with that, now, technology has evolved and we have evolved, where we have brought out the passive liveness. Passive liveness, we can determine the liveness of a person just by means of taking a selfie. There are a couple of attributes about the picture that we can utilize to go ahead and determine that the person is indeed who they say they are. And the very fact that they’re even coming in to take a selfie and just look, once they look at the screen, we are able to go ahead and determine that they are who they say they are. We are not waiting for them to upload a picture or something like that. We’re substituting or we’re actually doing active liveness, without the need of spoiling the user experience.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. All right. So then, on the injection side, we’re monitoring for what? Virtual cameras? External cameras?</p>
<p>So see the thing is, injection side, you’re injecting into the stream, which means that something needs to sit on the client or something needs to sit on at the place where the picture is getting captured or where the video is getting captured to determine liveness. Because that’s exactly where all of these other pieces of software are sitting. Now, that means that this piece of code or this SDK that sits at the browser layer or at the client is able to determine, “Do you have multiple cameras out there? Are you using something that is plugged into the USB? Or is it using something that is virtual?”</p>
<p>And also preventing something from injecting random pieces of information in the stream that is going out to our server. So what that means is that, yes, cracking that in is going to be highly improbable, and we’ll see, obviously, there are different avenues to go ahead and improve the technology. But right now, we are able to go ahead and determine, at the point where the picture is getting captured that, “Hey, is there an injection attack that’s happening?” And this could be done even on the mobile device, right? So no problem.</p>
<p>Okay, all right. All right. So when we talk about identity verification, at the very highest levels of assurance, we’re essentially talking about an enrollment process, where somebody presents themselves to a camera, and that likeness is verified against an offline credential, something like a state-issued ID, driver’s license, a passport. So for this to happen, at the point of enrollments, we’re doing several things, correct? We’re doing a passive likeness, we’re doing an active likeness, we’re checking for injection attacks, then somebody presents a credential, and we’re also inspecting that credential for signs of manipulation. “Has the photograph been manipulated? Is it a valid credential, with,” for example, “the databases that contain the driver’s license information from the states?” Only when it passes that, all those tests, all those inspections, has somebody then successfully registered. Once that process, the enrollment process, is completed, now folks are using this biometric to log in. So again, at the point where a access request is being made, we’re again inspecting for signs of manipulation, being liveness, passive, active, and then, the injection attacks.</p>
<p>This is where authentication is changing for the enterprise, constantly changing for the customers. We are definitely, the entire space is evolving, because now earlier enrollment used to be, hey, you have a username, password, and then, get in. Max, you do an MFA. Now, enrollment can happen really quick, self-service, just by utilizing your credential, that’s powerful. You’ve already gotten a credential, you can do this remotely. And the consuming, either company, it’s an enterprise, or whether it’s a customer piece of software, can trust what is happening. Then on, as a customer, now, like you mentioned, I have the ability to authenticate using my face, and we are able to go ahead and say confidently, “Know what, you’re a live person, I know who you are, Vikram. Welcome.” Wouldn’t you like that experience?</p>
<p>I certainly would. So at 1Kosmos, we talk and we have talked a long time about certifications, and for some, that’s a snoozer topic, “Why are we talking about certifications?” So what’s the role of certifications in this? It’s one thing for any number of companies to claim that, “We do this stuff,” but what proves that we do this stuff?</p>
<p>Right, yeah, I think you’re right. So certifications, even the clients where we have implemented, they’ve said, “Okay, you know what? I really want to test out your software. I want to bring a picture in there. I want to put a mask on me. I want to put a video out there, and I’ll test it.” And we say, “All right, go test it. But that’s exactly why we do the certifications.” We’re doing this, because there are third parties who go through and try and break the system. We do pen testing. So it’s very important. It’s something that our clients can utilize and take it to their auditors and go, “Hey, I’ve gotten a certified system, which has been through the ringer, and now, I can just cut my timeline short, implement it, and get my users to actually use it and focus on what’s important for improving the business.”</p>
<p>Got it. So in terms of these certifications, just real briefly, ISO has a set of presentation attack defense specifications. So that’s a set of certifications where the system has to be rigorously tested, that it cannot be fooled, for example, by a 3D mask or by a mask with the eyes cut out. There are, with the NIST certifications, the 800-63 certification, this what certifies the biometric. Talk a little bit about NIST.</p>
<p>Yeah, the NIST has the FRVT certification, and essentially, now, they’re calling it FRTE. And of course, this the organization iBeta, which actually is dedicated towards testing biometrics. So we go through all of these agencies to make sure that we are not only complying with their tests, but also, standards and regulations that rule the use of biometrics. It’s one thing to be able to capture it and do it correctly, but can you do it in a privacy preserving way? I think that differentiates us.</p>
<p>All right. That’s bringing up another thing. Okay. But real briefly, what the UK version, the UK…</p>
<p>DIATF.</p>
<p>Right? So that’s there. FIDO2 is there. I know I’m forgetting a couple, but you mentioned privacy. So biometric, now that’s a pretty personal piece of information, along with my birthday and social security number, everything, right? So talk about privacy. What’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know we’re on the topic of trying to figure out liveness, are you live person and everything. But yeah, once you capture it, where are you storing it? How are you storing it? So this is where the 1Kosmos’ architecture comes into play wherein we have the key for the private key that is always in possession of the user. Now, this could be a pin or this could be a private key that is there that is stored within their device. Or really, what we are able to do is to calculate a key right at the edge by using your face. Your face is your key. That is what opens the door. So it is really amazing, that amazing technology that we’re able to do, wherein we are able to do that, manage your wallet for you, and think about what a wallet is.</p>
<p>It is just like your physical wallet, where you put different things, and you can put in your face, you can put in your fingerprint, you can put in all the other biometrics that are in there, along with your FIDO credential and your smart car credential. If you want to put your legacy password, you can put it in there. It’s simply a wallet that is in your possession, that can be opened up only by using certain keys.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that. Vik, that means two things to me. It means that, as a consumer, I control the data. I want to delete the data, I delete it. I want to use it, I determine, at the point of use, exactly what information I’m going to share, I feel comfortable sharing. The other thing it means is for the IT and security people, it’s not introducing another vulnerability, because you’ve introduced a better way to authenticate. And that point of vulnerability is this honeypot of customer information. Why have it when you don’t have to have it? So eliminating that honeypot to me is important, and I think it should be important to IT and security people. Have we left anything out? This feels like a pretty good conversation. One thing, we do have a new white paper coming out. It’s called Biometric Authentication Versus the Threat of Deepfakes. It’ll be on our website here shortly, so look out for that. Any parting shots, Vik, any stone unturned on deepfakes?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would just say, look out for them. And just be sure, just like, earlier, it was with the phishing emails, now it’s with deepfakes, make sure that you’re doing something real. Do your due diligence, and yeah, if you need help, talk to 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Yeah. I see deepfakes is kind of the latest salvo from the cybercrime community to attack one of the creators of value on the digital side, that creators of value is getting workers quick access to systems, plugging the holes, so that account takeover doesn’t lead to data breach or ransomware. A lot of news about ransomware recently. So yeah, some really interesting developments. And once again, here at 1Kosmos, we’re trying to stay ahead of that with our innovative solutions. So Vik, thanks for spending time with me today. Very much appreciate your time.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Thanks, Michael. That was great.</p>

 Armin Bauer, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Technology and Security Officer at IDnow, explains all about the German Federal Ministry of Finance’s new draft bill on the Money Laundering Video Identification Ordinance (GwVideoIdentV), what the amendments would mean for banks and financial service providers, and why IDnow has been driving these developments for years and welcomes the revisions. 



<p>Germany is lagging behind in its digital transformation efforts compared to the rest of Europe, despite its technological expertise. For example, as the first country to accept video identification procedures, Germany took on a pioneering role, but has subsequently lost this position due to &nbsp;its inactivity and inability to approve successor solutions at national level. </p>



<p>The current basis for video identification in the banking sector continues to be rules contained in the Circular (“Rundschreiben”), which was issued by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) in 2017.</p>



<p>There have been few updates to video identification procedures in the German financial sector in recent years, with automation, modernization and user-friendliness all seemingly often in competition with security concerns. There were also inklings from Berlin that coordination on the GwVideoIdent regulation was tough.</p>



<p>However, an exciting breakthrough came in mid-April 2024: the Federal Ministry of Finance published the <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Gesetzestexte/Gesetze_Gesetzesvorhaben/Abteilungen/Abteilung_VII/20_Legislaturperiode/2024-04-18-GwVideoIdentV/0-Gesetz.html">draft bill for the ordinance on money laundering identification by video identification</a>.</p>



 What changes does the draft envisage? 



  Classic VideoIdent procedures are now to be regulated by ordinance, and no longer just by the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Rundschreiben/2017/rs_1703_gw_videoident_en.html">BaFin Circular from 2017</a>.  Companies whose services and products fall under the Money Laundering Act (GWG) and which use the existing VideoIdent procedure must offer mandatory identification using the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German online ID function</a> (German ID card with activated online function and NFC-enabled smartphone, eID for short) in addition to other solutions. According to the draft, this must be equivalent to other procedures: “In particular, providers must not deliberately mislead the person to be identified into preferring the video identification procedure via the user interface design”. The draft will create more use cases for the electronic ID card (eID) in the financial sector. The spread of the online ID function among the population is expected to increase. According to a PwC study, only seven percent of Germans would decide against using eID, while 70 percent are prepared to use the online ID card for transactions with banks and in legal matters.  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/experten-gefuehrte-identitaetsueberpruefung/">Partially automated procedures for identity verification</a> are to be permitted. Partially automated means that parts of the identification process can in the future be automated, but there are still parts that may not. In addition, a direct (not downstream) check by a human must be part of the verification process. IDnow’s &nbsp;“VideoIdent Flex” solution offers a clever combination of AI-supported, expert-led identity verification.  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/automatisierte-identitaetspruefung/">Fully automated solutions for identity verification</a> could also be approved for up to two years, subject to certain requirements (equivalence to a human check) – after a maximum six-month registration phase for testing under the supervision of the BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, Federal Office for Information Security). The BSI retains the final decision power regarding approval.  



 How IDnow became a pioneer for secure and intuitive identification processes in the financial sector. 



<p>IDnow presented the idea of partially and fully automated video identification to the Ministry of Finance back in 2020. We therefore welcome the fact that legislation is now to follow the existing technical possibilities and that further identification procedures are to be approved. IDnow’s fully automated process has been setting industry standards for a long time, is certified in accordance with various industry standards (e.g. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-among-first-etsi-ts-119-461-certification/">ETSI TS 119 461</a>) and is already used for money laundering-compliant identification in other European countries.</p>



<p>Since IDnow was founded, the Munich-based IT company has worked closely with regulatory authorities and other market participants to drive progress and always ensure the highest level of security for identity verification. We believe that security does not have to come at the expense of intuitive design and user-friendliness. Our solutions provide customers with secure, reliable and straightforward identity verification processes.</p>



 Security, innovation and trust in digital identity management. 



<p>IDnow is a leading platform provider for identity verification and a German pioneer in digital applications and innovations – both in sensitive parts of the administration and in highly regulated areas, such as the financial sector.</p>



<p>We offer users a reliable, secure and seamless solution from a single source that meets the relevant regulatory requirements and security levels and protects against misuse, such as fraud, identity theft or forged signatures.</p>



 Creating a high level of security and sovereignty in the digital space. 



<p>In our view, clear rules and standards for digital identification procedures are the basis for ensuring trust, security and privacy. In fact, secure forms of digital identification can strengthen the sovereignty of citizens in the digital space and in the financial sector.</p>



<p>We have the expertise to meet the diverse range of security requirements, which vary depending on the industry and sensitivity of the use case. Germany must always strive to provide its citizens with the most secure, innovative and usable solutions and play a pioneering role in digitalization – this is what IDnow stands for with its broad portfolio of solutions.</p>



<p>We offer secure and powerful identity verification and fraud prevention solutions, including:</p>



  Automated identity verification (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, AI-supported and GwG-compliant),  Video verification solutions (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, a GwG-compliant verification with high security requirements via video chat, supported by AI technology; and VideoIdent Flex, a customizable version),  Chip-based identity verification, utilizing the German electronic ID card (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">eID</a>) and NFC-enabled smartphones.

				  Indicio Proven® offers a simple three-step process for integrating its decentralized identity solution into existing systems, ensuring efficient data sharing and security with support from the Indicio team.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Aashi Srivastava</p>
<p>In today’s fast-changing digital world, the demand for fast data you can trust has never been more pressing. Indicio Proven® is a reliable decentralized identity solution that can help organizations create more efficiency around the complexities of data sharing and security. Let’s explore how you can easily incorporate Indicio Proven into your existing systems.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is not a rip-and-replace solution. Instead, it’s designed to seamlessly complement your existing systems, offering a flexible approach to enhance data security. By integrating Proven into your infrastructure, you retain control of your data while gaining the benefits of decentralized identity solutions, allowing you to implement verifiable credentials. This flexibility enables you to use the power of Proven without disrupting your current operations, enabling you to adapt and evolve your data management practices to meet the demands of today’s digital landscape.</p>
<p>You don’t need a platform. You want control, making existing investments better.</p>
<p>Integrating Indicio Proven into your existing systems might seem daunting, but it can be broken down into a simple three-step process. Every step of this integration process can be done on your own or in collaboration with the Indicio team to ensure a hassle-free experience.</p>
<p>Step 1: Installation of Proven Issuer Software Agent</p>
<p>The process begins with installing the Proven Issuer software agent on your server. This software agent is the backbone of your credential issuance process and connects seamlessly to your data source or service via standard REST APIs.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is designed to meet your comprehensive data security needs while ensuring regulatory compliance, offering a robust solution that covers all essential aspects of decentralized identity management. It prioritizes compliance with industry regulations, providing peace of mind and confidence in navigating the complex landscape of data governance.</p>
<p>Step 2: Connection and Issuance of Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Once the Proven Issuer software agent is installed, API integration allows for a seamless system connection from your server to the Issuer agent. The next step is to connect the Issuer agent to the data’s intended recipients or holders, including customers, employees, employers, and partner organizations. You can start issuing verifiable credentials to the recipients using an invitation URL (often in a QR code) to connect to the holder’s agent. The holder agent is a software app downloaded by the holder to their mobile device (Indicio Proven has a Mobile SDK for incorporating agent functionality into existing mobile applications). Your Issuer agent is connected to the Holder agent with a secure encrypted channel, ensuring the smooth transmission of credentials. These credentials contain encrypted data securely stored in a wallet under the holder’s control and typically on their mobile device.</p>
<p>Step 3: Verification and Transmission of Data</p>
<p>When connecting the Indicio Proven Verifier application to the holder via an invitation URL, holders can consent to share their data securely and selectively. The application generates a presentation of the data for their credentials, allowing the verifier application to receive and verify the data. The verifier application can also be connected via APIs to other services or systems to transmit the verified data and share the trust established by the systems, protocols, and cryptography.</p>
<p>Through the integration process, Indicio’s team of industry veterans will be by your side, ready to provide support. There are several options for assistance, including onsite, personalized training, virtual office hours, or collaborative coding sessions. Indicio ensures that integration is not a barrier but an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>Integrating Proven into your existing systems does not have to be an intimidating task. It’s a step towards greater data efficiency, security, and trust.</p>

 We sit down with the owner of a UK fraud consultancy firm to discuss how fraud has changed over the years, why fraud has become so pervasive in the UK, and the role of organizations in protecting their customers from fraud attacks. 



 



 Despite very quickly reaching the rank of CID officer, you were with the police for a comparatively short time – just shy of eight years; what were the main reasons for you moving to the private sector?&nbsp; 



<p>My police career was short but busy. I became a CID officer within about three years, which is unusual, and worked in a very dynamic and young CID office. Fraud had always been my passion and the police were increasingly turning their back on it to focus on other priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was apparent at that time that people were disposing of their own cars and then making fraudulent insurance claims, and unfortunately, in many cases, it didn’t lead to prosecution, as the insurance companies were unable to detect it. I decided to take a risk and set up my own specialist fraud investigation business Taylor &amp; Moore Investigations. At the time it was the first of its kind and within 18 months we had 22 people working for us and half the top 10 UK insurance companies as clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What specific experience from your years in the police best prepared you for the transition to work as a fraud investigator for insurance companies?&nbsp; 



<p>The business I set up was based on a good CID office. I began by intelligence gathering to understand how insurance fraud worked. I then produced a cost-effective system to detect and investigate insurance fraud. I built a whole training system based around what was needed, including criminal and insurance law. I also made great use of the intelligence we uncovered about those frauds. So, even back then we took a strategic approach of prevention, detection, containment, and analysis that is still used today by most of the industry. &nbsp;</p>



 Obviously, fraud investigation techniques have changed dramatically since you started in the ‘80s, but what were some of the major differences in how you approached fraud investigation in the police and in the private sector?&nbsp; 



<p>There are of course advantages in having a warrant card, a power of arrest, and the huge resources police have available. </p>



<blockquote><p>However, there are also advantages to not being a police officer. I have never seen this mentioned by anyone else, but people were more willing to speak and tell me things than they had been when I was a police officer. </p>Peter Taylor, owner of fraud consultancy firm.</blockquote>



<p>As my specialism was interviewing that made my life much easier. I am not sure folks realise the extent to which suspects and witnesses clam up when talking to figures of authority like the police.</p>



 What about fraud investigation techniques in general, how have they changed over the years?&nbsp; 



<p>Interviews, data, and forensics in that order were the core of investigations at the time I left the police. Our business model was based on the same principles. The evolution of fraud and counter fraud has seen development in all three areas but particularly in data and forensics. A simple view is that the order in which they are relied upon has changed now to be data, forensics, and then interviews last.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gathering intelligence is much easier nowadays because of the widespread use of the internet and the volume of data now routinely available to investigators. In some cases, the interview is still very much part of gathering evidence but can often just be there to make sure we are not making a mistake by giving the people involved the opportunity to explain things that look suspicious.</p>



 Fraud and fraud prevention has always been a hotly contested game of cat and mouse. Was there any period of history where the ‘game’ was more one-sided?&nbsp; 



<p>The numbers tell the story. When I started out, fraud was around 1% of all crime and we were definitely the cats and the criminals, the mice. That slowly changed around the year 2000. I believe the web enabling criminals to easily communicate with each other and reach targets within a much wider circle has been the main catalyst.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another factor that fuelled the fire was policing in the UK and other countries had massive funding cuts whilst having to focus on other especially important stuff like terrorism, domestic violence, and grooming. Fraud is now running at 40% of all crime, much of it does not get reported so it is hard to claim anything other than that the criminals now have the upper hand. That will change but not any time soon.</p>



 
   
     
                     The future of fraud and digital identity verification in the UK. 
                     Our experts explore the current situation around fraud in the UK, how fraudsters are carrying out their nefarious activities at scale, and how technology can both help and hinder the fight against fraud. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/fraud-digital-identity-verification-uk/">Watch now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Technology is often regarded as a double-edged sword when it comes to fraud. What impact has the proliferation of technology had on the fraud landscape in the UK, and wider market? Is there a danger of ceding too much control, and outsourcing too much of the process to artificial intelligence?&nbsp; 



<p>When we introduce new technology, there tends to be three stages of adoption:&nbsp;</p>



  Stage one: What can we do with this?<br>  Stage two: Can we make it safe?<br>  Stage three: Can we make sure it is legal?&nbsp;  



<p>Then it becomes a cycle of constant development and fixing things that we never quite catch up on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You cannot efficiently deal with any volume of crime without technology. For example, you would not try to run a bank or any other business without it, and countering fraud is no exception. AI in some ways is just the latest standard, albeit like adding a turbo charger to an already fast car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Routine process should go through automation wherever practical, and we should use all the tools available. The dangers come from ignoring people who can see it is not working properly, and we have to be objective enough to actually listen to accused people who say it was not working properly too. Hence the Post Office Scandal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest worry I have right now though is complacency around data accuracy. If the data is inaccurate or the AI poorly trained, then it will get things wrong. For me technology must be supervised rather than supervise important decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The UK is often referred to as the fraud capital of Europe, why do you think this is? What changes do you think need to be implemented to address this?&nbsp; 



<p>In many ways illicit trade follows the same paths as legitimate trade. Although we are no longer part of the EU, the UK has for many decades been a hub and gateway to the EU for the US and other countries and vice versa. As the English language is also used across so many nations as a primary or secondary language, it is therefore familiar and a sort of lingua franca to many of those who commit crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also important to recognize that as the UK was present in many other nations through trading, colonialism, and military conflict for hundreds of years, there is also a perception abroad that we are all wealthy as individuals and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This all makes the UK a target for overseas fraudsters, but we cannot ignore the reality that many fraudsters are based in the UK too. I often hear of us referred to as the butler to the world because of our involvement in laundering foreign wealth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organized fraud sits within three areas: white collar crime, organized cybercrime, and organized crime. The UK criminals are prolific in all three areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes needed are wholesale and we do at last seem to be making progress, but it will take time. What we need are:&nbsp;</p>



  Consequences for committing fraud i.e. arrests and convictions.<br>  A long-term strategy ideally within education that encourages young people to stay away from cybercrime, and to know how to protect themselves from financial crime and risk.<br>  A focus on ethics and not just profit across government, public services, education, and the private sector.&nbsp;  



  A way of confirming who people are and what age they are without having to submit documents like passports and driving licences.&nbsp;  



 What part does consumer awareness play in the fight against fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Educating consumers as to the risks they face and how to protect themselves from fraud is a vital element of fraud prevention. Making people aware of what may happen and giving them clear advice helps. I am not convinced we do enough across the board to provide a remedy for them when an attempt is made, or a successful fraud occurs. However, this is only one side of the coin, organizations must also use technology to protect the consumer too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many attacks can be stopped through good anti-virus software, as well as good standards of multi-factor authentication. I foresee the day when all this functionality will automatically be included on every device sold. Look at cars for example. They all now have transponders, dead locks, and alarms built in. Car thefts are rising again right now but until recently they were reducing year on year having hit around a million thefts per annum in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>



 How can organizations educate their customers on the dangers of fraud more effectively?&nbsp; 



<p>I would like to see some sort of reward system for those who thwart serious fraud attempts, such as authorised push payment. It could be monetary, or it could be some other benefit but to acknowledge that the consumer has done the right thing could go a long way to prevent fraud. With the banks being expected to compensate customers who lose money to fraud then the banks benefit from fraudsters not getting away with it rather than the consumer. No good deed, however, goes unpunished and there would inevitably be attempts to cheat any such system.&nbsp;</p>



 You deliver training in fraud prevention across a wide range of verticals, including insurance, banking, lending, online retail, workplace fraud, and organised cyber fraud, are there any similarities in fraud attacks across the industries, and conversely, what are the main differences?&nbsp; 



<p>The UK Fraud Act 2006 clearly sets out the main fraud offences and the way frauds can be committed happen across all industries. People like to give names to different types of fraud based on the method and the target. I understand that and do it too and it can help with statistics, data, and analysis. Despite there being hundred of categories of fraud, the reality is there are a only handful of ways that fraud is committed e.g. false representation, not disclosing information, obtaining services by deception, abuse of position, and making or supplying articles for use in fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are other financial crimes that come into play, such as bribery and corruption, money laundering, and theft, but most, if not all, frauds involve the above. The similarities far outweigh any specifics for different industries, which is why around 80% of the training I deliver is generic with the remainder being specific to the delegates taking part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From my experience of working with prolific career fraudsters they commit fraud across the board. One person I interviewed about his life of crime committed card fraud, insurance fraud, bank fraud, benefits fraud, and tax fraud. That surely shows that the same methods are adapted across different sectors and that it is the same fraudsters targeting different sectors too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How can organizations better protect themselves and their customers from the threat of fraud? 



<p>I have found that much like charity, protection from fraud and cybercrime starts at home. I have just worked with a client who has allowed me to train and educate all their staff on how fraud and cybercrime works, how they are at risk, and how to protect themselves from it. Get that done first and then they will automatically protect their organization and their customers in the same way. Feedback and engagement with the delegates has been tremendous. They were not just trained they changed what they do.</p>

The Verida Network provides private storage, sources of personal data and expandable infrastructure to make this future a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Let’s dive into each of these areas in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Private storage for personal AI&nbsp;models <p>The Verida network is designed for storing private, personal data. It is a <a href="https://news.verida.io/revolutionizing-web3-storage-a-deep-dive-into-ipfs-and-verida-dbstore-7a15745dd118">highly performant, low cost, regulatory compliant solution</a> for storing structured database data for any type of application.</p><p>Data stored on the network is protected with a user’s private key, ensuring they are the only account that can request access to, and encrypt their data (unless they provide permission to another account).</p><p>This makes the Verida Network ideal for storing private AI models for end users. The network’s high performance (leveraging P2P web socket connections), makes it suitable for high speed read / write applications such as training&nbsp;LLMs.</p> Source of data for training AI&nbsp;models <p>We’ve all heard the saying “garbage in, garbage out” when it comes to data. This also applies to training AI models. They are only as good as the data they are fed for training purposes.</p><p>The Verida ecosystem provides a broad range of capabilities that make it ideally suited to being a primary source of highly valuable data for training AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Verida has been developing an API data connector framework that enables users to easily connect to existing API’s of centralized platforms and claim their personal data, that they can securely store on the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>Users on the Verida network will be able to pull health activity data from the likes of Strava and Fitbit. They can pull their private messages from chat platforms, their data from Google and Apple accounts. This can all then be leveraged to train AI models for exclusive use by the user, or that data can be anonymized and contributed to larger training&nbsp;models.</p><p>Establishing a data-driven token economy offers a promising avenue for fostering fairness among all stakeholders. Eventually, major tech and data corporations may introduce a token system for service payments, thereby incentivizing users to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>For an example; individuals could leverage their anonymous health data to train AI models for healthcare research and receive token rewards in return. These rewards could then be utilized for subscribing to the service or unlocking premium features, establishing a self-sustaining cycle where data sharing leads to increased service access as a reward. This model fosters a secure and equitable relationship between data contribution and enhanced service access, ensuring that those who contribute more to the ecosystem reap greater benefits in&nbsp;return.</p><p>Users could also use their personal data to train AI models designed just for them. Imagine a digital AI assistant guiding you through your life. Suggesting meetup events to attend to improve your career, suggesting a cheaper greener electricity retailer based on your usage, suggesting a better phone plan or simply reminding you of an event you forgot to add to your calendar.</p> Expandable infrastructure <p>As touched on in “<a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/how-web3-and-depin-solves-ais-data">How web3 and DePIN solves AI’s data privacy problems</a>”, privacy preserving AI will need access to privacy preserving computation to train AI models and respond to user&nbsp;prompts.</p><p>Verida is not in the business of providing private decentralized computation, however the Verida identity framework (based on the DID-Core W3C standard) is expandable to connect to this type of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN).</p><p>Identities on the Verida network can currently be linked to three types of DePIN; Database storage, Private inbox messages, Private notifications. This architecture can easily be extended to support new use cases such as “Private compute” or “Personal AI prompt&nbsp;API”.</p><p>With the appropriate partners who support decentralized private compute, there is a very clear pathway to enable personalized, privacy preserving AI leveraging a 100% DePIN technology stack.</p><p>This is incredibly exciting, as it will provide a more secure, privacy preserving solution as an alternative to giving all our data to large centralized technology companies.</p> About Chris <p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network that empowers individuals to control their digital identity and personal data. Chris is an Australian-based technology entrepreneur who has spent over 20 years developing innovative software solutions, most recently with Verida. With his application of the latest technologies, Chris has disrupted the finance, media, and healthcare industries.</p> <p><a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-is-enabling-the-privacy-preserving-ai-tech-stack-7e9558f822f3">Verida is enabling the privacy preserving AI tech stack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.io">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, the Chief Marketing Officer here at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with Sid Gandhi, the Chief operating Officer of our Asia Pacific region. Sid, welcome to the vlog. I invited you here today to talk about the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, the new guideline. There are some pretty interesting implications for online payments. You’re familiar with those. Can you talk about them a bit?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Sure, absolutely, Michael. Pleasure to be here. Thank you so much for inviting me for the v-log. So yes, interesting times for us at 1Kosmos. The Reserve Bank of India recently announced a guideline which talks about principle-based framework for authentication of digital payment transactions. And very interestingly, I believe that the RBI or the Federal Bank of India has done a fantastic job over the years, not just to well manage the monetary policies, but they also do look at technology and security aspects and provide guidelines for the BFSI sector.</p>
<p>The recent one is interesting for a few reasons why. Number one is RBI has always spoken about having second factor as an authentication for internet banking. So while SMS-based OTP has been very commonly used today across the globe and in India, but interestingly, RBI has also mentioned there are three forms of authentication, right? Something that the user knows, which is a user ID password and a PIN. Something that the user has, which is their credit card, their ATM card, their phone, or something that the user is, which we all are aware is their biometric characteristics like their fingerprint, their facial features, or perhaps even their iris.</p>
<p>Now very interestingly, I was going through some of the content that RBI has published over time. It does call out saying that a true multifactor authentication requires at least two or more factors. However, what the industry has largely done is that they have gone with something that the user knows, which is the user ID password, and gone with the second factor of something that the user has, which is the SMS-based OTP and that has been around probably as long as I can remember for a few decades. This is the first time RBI has now said that you need to start looking beyond SMS based OTP, thanks to all the technological advances or the innovation that are emerging in the recent years. And we are here today ready to offer that to the industry as alternate factors.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. All right, so let’s take a step back here. As consumers, we’re all familiar with step-up authentication now. We might not know that it’s called that, but whenever I try to buy something online, I get the code, will you please key in this code to prove that this is legitimate? So it’s that built-in lack of trust in the password that got me to the shopping cart or the payment transaction and then I prompted for the code. So what’s wrong with the code? Why change?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Why change for the, I think more than one reason, Michael. Today SMS-based codes are considered as weak form of second factor. Why? Because of man-in-the-middle attack or SMS interception. You have dependency on having a SIM card. You have dependency on having the network with you to receive those codes. And you also have challenges around expiration or delivery delays. Especially in the recent few years we’ve seen SIM swapping also take place, which is again a big concern and increasing number of breaches happening even with a second factor like SMS-based OTP available. And for that reason is why I believe RBI is also indicating and telling the banks that you must start looking beyond.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. All right, so this is the kind of what I would call proxies for identity, right? You are you because you knew the password, you are you because you’re able to key in this code that I just sent you on your phone. You are you because your SIM card matches what we thought it would be. So all these are kind of guesses or approximations, it get us closer to identity, but it is almost what silly human tricks, can you go through these calisthenics to prove you are who you are. So not only are they not specific, they’re not exact, they’re guesses still. They’re clumsy, right? You want to buy something, you’re going to pay for something, and now you got to go to your inbox or go to your message folder, look at the code, remember the code, key the code in, hopefully key it in right. If you’re not, you got to go back, look at again, key it in again. So a lot of implications here, but there’s more to this principle-based framework than just convenience. There’s a privacy angle, right?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Correct, yes. There’s a privacy angle and there’s a security angle. You spoke about how do you prove who you are and absolutely with the credentials and SMS-based OTP, it’s really hard to prove. I could share my credentials with you. I could give you my OTP and you could still transact on my behalf as a friend, but what if you are not my friend? You get hold of my credentials in the dark web. You could very well go ahead and take the money away from me and that’s being reported every single day.</p>
<p>What we are able to do at 1Kosmos is prove who the user is based on our platform capabilities of identity verification and proofing, which is based on global standards. And along with that, we have multiple other capabilities of bringing in advanced biometric. We have our IP, something called Live ID, where we actually ask the user to showcase features by blinking, smiling and asking them to prove they are real person. And also the platform capabilities have a private and a permission blockchain, which even makes it even more secure. The idea is not just providing a second factor to the user, but how you deliver it to the user and how the authentication happens throughout that journey till conclusion of the transaction also plays a very, very critical goal.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right. Well, so this is interesting to me because it seems like what the Reserve Bank of India has done, it’s the latest iteration or the latest generation of guidelines that have surfaced around essentially the 1Kosmos business model or architecture, if you will. Dating back to whatever 2016, 2017 we saw in the United States, the NIST guidelines come out, the 800-63. We saw FIDO2, if you want to do biometric authentication, there’s a FIDO2 spec for that. We have the specification in the United Kingdom. And now here is the Reserve Bank of India coming up with the latest guidelines on what sounds like how you need to deploy this technology so we get to a higher level of both integrity, trust, and security in the transaction, but also privacy and security of the user’s information as well.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Exactly, Michael. You’re absolutely right. And not to forget at the end of the day, user convenience as well. So we are not only just providing security, privacy by default, but the experience of the user is very seamless. It’s very elegant by when you provide password-less experience to the user, they would enjoy transacting on the platform instead of trying to figure out or recall their eight, 12, 16 character passwords, waiting on the second factor, which may or may not arrive. So you’re absolutely right. I think we’ve been talking about it for the last few years and some of the BFSI customers do use our platform today and we are very happy and very excited with the recent announcement from RBI.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, sure, because the guideline points to specific capabilities that we’ve been supporting for a while now. So when you step away from what you know to the who you are, there’s a range of possibilities there, right?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Correct. You are absolutely right. So we are able to bring in various factors that we’ve already discussed about, and these are based on global standards. I think that’s very important that the industry understands this. We spoke about FIDO certification from a privacy standpoint, we do, are able to meet global privacy standards like GDPR. India now has a DPDPA. And the interesting thing about our architecture is that we don’t store specifically any user information, which makes us very unique compared to some of the other players in the market and which is what customers or customer like banks would want, where they are safeguarding their customer data.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So specifically in terms of the biometrics that are used for this, what I would call step-up authentication, they range from device biometrics, for example, what we’re all familiar with a thumb or a face ID on your device all the way up to a live biometric, correct?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
That is correct, yes. So I would probably turn it a little bit in terms of how to think of it. So yes, we definitely want to bring in something that the user is by bringing in the biometrics. At the base level, you probably may want to use the device biometrics, which include the fingerprint or the face ID.</p>
<p>RBI in general also talks about risk-based authentication where the, for example, higher amount of transaction, you want to ensure that you are able to step-up. In our case, the way we look at step-up is that we bring in a Live ID where we are going to ask the person to blink, smile, turn left, right on a random basis to prove that the person is real. Alternately, yes, this does bring in a little bit of dependency on the phone, but we also as part of our platform capability can offer an additional alternate form of authentication, which is app-less. So if a customer is sitting on the laptop, he could use his camera to still provide those facial features or what we call as passive liveness to authenticate as well. Worst case scenario, you have time-based OTP, which is still more secure, I would say, than SMS or an email-based OTP.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, so this is interesting. So not only do the guidelines specify or indicate that there’s a range of biometrics that might be appropriate based on the risk of the transaction for a low-value transaction, maybe a thumb or a face ID on the phone. It’s thousands of dollars, might require that you blink and smile and turn your head.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Correct. Yes. That’s what we are offering, Michael. I don’t think the guidelines would specifically talk about what the bank should be doing based on risk based or step-up. Guidelines are broad guide norms that they’re asking the banks to adhere to. The interpretations are left to the bank in terms of what and how they want to adopt it.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right. Well, that’s important too. I mean, there’s new developments, there’s the new shiny objects, but no one organization magically use the magic wand and all of a sudden everything is the latest and greatest. So being able to support this mix of authentication or step-up authentication use cases is super important and we’ve done that for a while with our platform.</p>
<p>Well, Sid, I know that we’re working extensively with some large financial institutions in Asia Pacific. Is it fair to talk a little bit about what we’ve done that aligns with these guidelines for those organizations?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Absolutely. I think so. Unfortunately because of the NDA, I am not going to be able to take names of the customers, but we can definitely talk about what we’ve done for them. So we are working with a few banking and financial institutions in India in the Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>One of the private sector bank has been our customer for the last or three years. It’s a known fact that RBI does audit the banks and the financial institutions on a yearly basis so we undergone the audit without any major challenges. The bank use us for their internal workforce to protect their internal enterprise applications and data, but also the customers are using it and we are having some very interesting conversation with some of the other banks that are there.</p>
<p>For one of the digital-only bank in Southeast Asian market, we are providing them with our liveness capability as part of our platform where the users are actually authenticating for transaction with the liveness factor, which kind of prevents any fraud that may potentially happen and ensuring that the customer data, the transactions, and the payment transactions are happening in a secure manner.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well that’s awesome. Well, Sid, I appreciate you spending time with us today. It’s, from my perspective, really gratifying to see these principle-based guidelines emerge in step with where 1Kosmos has been for the last couple of years. So it’s good to get some validation that we’ve been on the right track and remain on the right track.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Yes, absolutely, Michael. We’ve been talking about it for the last few years, so it’s very heartening to see the RBI coming out and asking the industry to start looking at the alternate factors of authentication. And we at 1Kosmos are sure ready to assist anyone who needs assistance with the guidelines.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Indeed, we are. All right, thank you very much, Sid.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Thank you so much, Michael.</p>

<p>Remember your first username? If you were anything like me in the early 2000s—too young to surf the web but excited about the possibilities of connecting with the rest of the world—your username probably makes you cringe today.</p>
<p>Self-expression is the main driver for my internet usage. Over the years, I've created various usernames representing different parts of me at distinct periods of my life. From <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Millsberry">Millsberry</a> to <a href="https://myspace.com/">Myspace</a>, each new website meant a new profile, leading to a fragmented experience. The most annoying part is that there's no connection between my profiles or "identities", so I have to remember all my passwords or rely on a password manager. Unfortunately, password managers are susceptible to <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/how-password-managers-can-get-hacked">security breaches</a>.</p>
<p>This fragmentation of identity on the web poses a significant challenge: How do we manage these scattered identities efficiently and securely?</p>
<p>Many organizations are working hard to answer this question. Some are going passwordless via passkeys. Others, like the <a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID</a> (ORCID), implemented digital identifiers to associate publications, research, and open source contributions with a particular researcher.</p>
<p>Companies focused on advancing identity tech and self-sovereign identity are embracing <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> as a solution. DIDs are globally unique, alphanumeric, immutable strings representing who you are across the decentralized web.</p>
<p>Speaking of DIDs -- did you know that Decentralized Identifiers are one of the pillars of Web5?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this post, we'll explore nine more things you may not have known about Decentralized Identifiers.</p>
 1. DIDs are a W3C Standard<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#1-dids-are-a-w3c-standard" title="Direct link to 1. DIDs are a W3C Standard">​</a> 
<p>In 1994, Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C is made up of groups of people focused on setting the best practices and standards for building the web. For example, the W3C develops and maintains standards for HTML, CSS, Web Accessibility, and Web Security. In July 2022, The W3C officially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">published standards for Decentralized Identifiers</a>. This way, technologists would have blueprint for building and managing digital identities as we make the shift towards controlling your own identity on the internet.</p>
 2. DIDs can represent more than just humans<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#2-dids-can-represent-more-than-just-humans" title="Direct link to 2. DIDs can represent more than just humans">​</a> 
<p>While DIDs represent people across the web, they can also represent organizations such as manufacturers, businesses, or government agencies. Technologists are exploring using <a href="https://www.arcadian-iot.eu/iot-decentralized-identity-arcadian/">DIDs to represent IoT devices</a> like smart hubs, smart thermostats, or autonomous cars, allowing you to maintain control over your data usage! Here's a taboo but realistic use case that might make you blush— DIDs can even represent sex tech devices! 😳</p>
 3. It's nearly impossible for someone to steal your DID<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#3-its-nearly-impossible-for-someone-to-steal-your-did" title="Direct link to 3. It's nearly impossible for someone to steal your DID">​</a> 
<p>A common question people often ask me is, "Can someone steal my DID?" DIDs are alphanumeric strings, so they may give people the impression that DIDs are top-secret passwords or API keys. But that's not the case; you can share your DID with anyone without compromising your safety. It's nearly impossible for someone to steal your DID and pretend to be you because DIDs are all cryptographically signed.</p>
<p>What does 'cryptographically signed' mean?</p>
<p>Cryptographically signed means that each DID has a unique digital fingerprint generated by a fancy, complicated algorithm. Two keys—a public key and a private key—make up the digital fingerprint. Your public key shows other people that the DID legitimately belongs to you, but the private key needs to remain private. The private key is like your master key. Someone can only steal your DID, tamper with your DID, or impersonate you if they have access to your private key. Fortunately, it's not easy to access your private key because it is protected by encryption and multiple layers of security. Some <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#5-every-did-has-a-did-method">DID methods</a> even support key rotation meaning you can update your cryptographic keys to reduce the risk of compromise.</p>
<p>Store your DID in an authenticated digital wallet</p>
<p>In addition to all these security algorithms that protect your DID from being stolen, users typically store their DIDs in an authenticated digital wallet (similar to how your Apple Wallet or Google Wallet stores your debit card information). Storing your DID in a digital wallet provides an additional layer of security because you often have to use a form of authentication like Face ID or a passcode to access items stored in the wallet.</p>
<p></p>
 4. Your DID is more than a string<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#4-your-did-is-more-than-a-string" title="Direct link to 4. Your DID is more than a string">​</a> 
<p>While your DID is a string, it's part of a larger JSON object called a DID document. In addition to the DID string, the DID document includes metadata like:</p>
 
 Cryptographic keys to prove ownership 
 Rules about how your DID can be used, managed, or modified 
 
<p>Below is an example of a DID document:</p>
   <code>{<br><br>  "@context": [<br><br>    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",<br><br>    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"<br><br>  ]<br><br>  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br><br>  "verificationMethod": [{<br><br>    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",<br><br>    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020", <br><br>    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br><br>    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"<br><br>  }, ...],<br><br>  "authentication": [<br><br>    "#key-1"<br><br>  ]<br><br>}<br></code>

<p>Learn more about DID documents <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/did_document">here</a>.</p>
 5. Every DID has a DID method<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#5-every-did-has-a-did-method" title="Direct link to 5. Every DID has a DID method">​</a> 
<p>Let's examine the anatomy of a DID method.
</p>
<p>Every DID:</p>
 
 Starts with the schema <code>did:</code> 
 Followed by a word or acronym representing the did method 
 Then, ends with a did method-specific identifier in the form of an alphanumeric string 
 
<p>A schema and a DID method together may look like <code>did:web</code> or <code>did:jwk</code>.</p>
<p>What are DID methods?</p>
<p>DID methods define the rules for creating, managing, and deactivating DIDs.</p>
 6. There are over 100 DID methods<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#6-there-are-over-100-did-methods" title="Direct link to 6. There are over 100 DID methods">​</a> 
<p>Anyone can create a DID method. Companies, individuals, or communities may create a custom DID method to fit a specific use case or live on a specific type of ledger. However, to ensure the DID method is recognized, interoperable, and meets the correct standards, it's strongly recommended to include the DID method on the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries">W3C DID Spec Registry</a>.</p>
 7. TBD created its own DID method<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#7-tbd-created-its-own-did-method" title="Direct link to 7. TBD created its own DID method">​</a> 
<p>We (TBD) created our own DID method called DID:DHT. DHT stands for Distributed Hash Table indicating the use of Mainline DHT. You can learn more about DID:DHT via the <a href="https://did-dht.com/">spec</a> and this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht">blog post</a> written by TBD’s Director of Open Standards, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohengabe">Gabe Cohen</a>.</p>
<p>At TBD, we colloquially call DID:DHT, DID THAT.</p>

 8. You don't have to use blockchain; we use BitTorrent<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#8-you-dont-have-to-use-blockchain-we-use-bittorrent" title="Direct link to 8. You don't have to use blockchain; we use BitTorrent">​</a> 
<p>When I hear the words, "decentralized" or "immutable", I immediately think of blockchain and cryptocurrency. I don't think that train of thought is in the minority.</p>
<p>For instance, to ensure DIDs have no central authority and that individual users can own them, folks typically anchor DIDs on an immutable ledger.</p>
<p>What does anchoring a DID mean?</p>
<p>Anchoring a DID means recording DID transactions on a distributed ledger.</p>
<p>DID:DHT uses BitTorrent; not blockchain</p>
<p>At TBD, we actually took a blockchain-less approach. We anchored DID:DHT to BitTorrent. As mentioned above, DID:DHT uses a Mainline DHT, which is a distributed hash table used by the <a href="https://github.com/bittorrent/bittorrent.org">BitTorrent protocol</a>.</p>
 9. You can create a DID with the Web5 SDK<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#9-you-can-create-a-did-with-the-web5-sdk" title="Direct link to 9. You can create a DID with the Web5 SDK">​</a> 
<p>You can use the Web5 SDK to <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did">create a DID</a>!</p>
 <code>Web5.connect()</code><a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#web5connect" title="Direct link to web5connect">​</a> 
<p>You can generate a DID using the Web5.connect() method with the following steps:</p>
<p>Install the web5/api package</p>
 
 <code>npm install @web5/api</code> 
 
<p>Import the package</p>
 
 <code>import { Web5 } from '@web5/api';</code> 
 
<p>Call Web5.connect()</p>
 
 <code>const { web5, did: myDid } = await Web5.connect();</code> 
 <code>console.log(myDid)</code>

<p>Gone are the days of delegating technology and cybersecurity concerns to be solved solely by the IT department. With artificial intelligence (AI), post-quantum (PQ), and an intensifying threat landscape, senior leadership teams and boards must make the right investments and provide strategic guidance to help keep the organization, employees, customers, and other key stakeholders safe. If that’s not enough incentive, federal agencies are continuing efforts to accelerate <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/sec-cyber-disclosure-rules-enforcement-timeline/692446/">breach disclosures</a> and hold executives liable for security and data privacy incidents. This is why pursuing an enterprise-wide <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework?edc_sfid=7015Y000003dRWZQA2&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU78IhLzN7Zgxf6ga0wROR5TnGvrInZctKnGfXrquicZEBwdRyL_gufRoCeq4QAvD_BwE">Zero Trust</a> strategy is critical for strong corporate governance and increasingly a board-level priority.</p>
<p>Reinforcing this strategic link between Zero Trust and governance is NIST’s recently released <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework">Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0</a>. The renewed CSF provides guidance and examples for adopting Zero Trust and adds “Govern” to the other five key critical framework functions of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. While governance was implied in earlier CSF iterations, it is now codified to ensure an organization’s strategy is directly linked to cybersecurity roles and responsibilities, informing the business what it needs to do to address the other five functions. NIST’s focus on governance reinforces that the entire leadership team is in this together and really calls out the fiduciary responsibilities of the board.</p>
<p>All this focus on governance is key to minimizing business risk and protecting shareholder value, but also puts tremendous pressure on leadership teams to effectively communicate cyber risks to their board and meet regulatory requirements. This is where Zero Trust comes in.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is not a product to buy or a box to check. As an executive officer or director, you should understand it’s a strategic approach. Zero Trust improves cyber resilience and can also serve to increase an organization’s agility, reduce cost of compliance, decrease IT complexity and total cost of ownership, and of course strengthen corporate governance. CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model 2.0</a> provides a roadmap to pursue a Zero Trust strategy with updated guidelines around the five key pillars of Identity, Devices, Networks, Data, and Applications and Workloads. Like the CSF 2.0, governance is front and center in this latest version. CISA’s updated guidelines reinforce that governance of cybersecurity policies, procedures, and processes within and across the five pillars is essential to improving cyber resilience and maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. While long considered a cybersecurity best practice, pursuing a Zero Trust strategy is now also an express requirement from both NIST and CISA for strong corporate governance.</p>

<p>As a leading provider of identity management solutions, 1Kosmos is excited to announce our new capability as a Credential Service Provider (CSP) for government agencies. This development represents a significant step forward in our mission to revolutionize the way organizations of any type can manage digital identities and secure access to critical resources.</p>
 What is a Credential Service Provider (CSP)? 
<p>A CSP is a trusted entity, in this case 1Kosmos, responsible for ID verification, onboarding and delivery of strong phishing resistant credentials. 1Kosmos acts as a managed service, verifying and authenticating citizens and residents accessing government data and services. From initial registration to ongoing authentication, the 1Kosmos CSP plays a vital role in ensuring secure access.</p>
<p>There are five main considerations a full service a CSP can deliver:</p>
 
 Security: A CSP must have robust security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats. This includes advanced encryption protocols, secure storage of credentials, and continuous monitoring for suspicious activity. 
 Compliance: Meeting stringent regulations and standards – some industry, some governmental – is a fundamental requirement for any CSP. 
 User Experience: While security is paramount, a seamless user experience is crucial for user adoption and operational efficiency. A user-centric approach ensures that the authentication process is intuitive and easy to navigate. 
 Privacy: Privacy and security of citizen biometrics and other personal identifiable Information (PII) is critical to comply with 230+ similar privacy regulations around the world, including California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It is also important to give residents the assurance they need that their information is not accessible without their explicit consent. 
 Access for All: Providing equality in access to all citizens and residents is complicated, while much of the population may have access to mobile devices and desktops, that will not be the case for some, and therefore alternate use cases will need to be considered and addresses 
 
 Why is a CSP Needed? 
<p>Demands by residents for digital government services have resulted in rampant identity fraud, costing taxpayers millions. Stopping fraud means blocking synthetic and stolen identities during the application process and securing resident accounts from phishing and social engineering attacks aimed at account takeover. Delivering these services is no easy task. Investment in hardware, software, and management resources is high, with little return. Additionally, each agency would need to invest in delivering these services, creating a drain on taxpayers’ dollars while providing an experience that differs across all agencies.</p>
<p>Government agencies face unique challenges in implementing and maintaining effective identity management solutions. From the complexity of integrating with existing IT systems to stringent compliance requirements, these challenges can often hinder the adoption of robust identity management solutions. This is where a CSP solves these unique problems.</p>
 Elevating Government Identity Management with 1Kosmos 
<p>As a leading provider of identity management solutions, 1Kosmos is uniquely positioned to elevate the way government agencies approach credential service and identity management. By leveraging the capabilities available in the 1Kosmos Credential Service Provider (CSP) solution, government agencies can unlock a range of benefits that set 1Kosmos apart in the market.</p>
 
 Robust Identity Proofing and Credential Issuance 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP solution enables government agencies to perform Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) identity verification and issue Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credentials that are certified to NIST 800-63-3 standards. This ensures a high level of confidence in the identity of citizens and residents accessing services and resources.</p>
 
 Secure and Decentralized Identity Management 
 
<p>The 1Kosmos CSP leverages a “privacy by design” approach, empowering residents with complete control over their personal information. By utilizing a private and permissioned distributed ledger, the solution decentralizes data storage and eliminates the risk of a centralized “honeypot” of personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
 
 Combating Fraud and Phishing 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP incorporates advanced security measures to combat phishing and fraudulent activities targeting citizens and residents. The solution offers a streamlined, self-service identity verification process and leverages phishing-resistant authentication methods, such as FIDO passkeys and biometric authentication, to enhance the overall security posture, safeguarding citizen and resident accounts.</p>
 
 Seamless Integration and Interoperability 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing government IT systems and infrastructure, reducing the complexity and time required for implementation. Additionally, the solution’s adherence to open standards ensures interoperability across different government agencies and systems, enabling a unified approach to identity management.</p>
 
 Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness 
 
<p>The 1Kosmos CSP is highly scalable, allowing government agencies to accommodate growing user and transaction volumes without incurring significant additional costs. By automating identity enrollment and authentication processes, the solution also helps to reduce IT management overhead and operational expenses.</p>
 
 Non-Biased Decisioning and Access for All 
 
<p>1Kosmos adopts an innovative approach to identity proofing and authentication based on deterministic verification of an individual to truly identify the user behind a device rather than assuming identity based on how closely they resemble a static, unverified biometric. 1Kosmos utilizes government-issued identification documents and live biometrics to identify and authenticate citizens and residents. At no time is anyone compared to others in a database. Their real, live biometrics and government issued IDs are used to verify their identities digitally, just as they would be verified in person, but without human error.</p>
 
 Privacy-Preserving Identity Management 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP is designed with a strong focus on privacy protection. The solution employs advanced cryptographic techniques, cryptographically paired public-private key architectures and zero-knowledge proofs, to enable citizens to selectively disclose only the necessary information required for authentication, without revealing their full identity details. This ensures that personal data is kept secure and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.</p>
<p>By choosing 1Kosmos as their credential service provider, government agencies can leverage these key benefits to enhance the security, efficiency, and user experience of their identity management initiatives. As agencies strive to modernize their identity management capabilities and comply with evolving regulatory requirements, 1Kosmos’ CSP delivers a complete full-service solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by the government sector.</p>

<p>For companies developing products in the booming identity and privacy space, our CTO, Dr Paul Ashley, has this simple but powerful advice:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 “Have a way into your app that’s free, then have tiers starting cheaply; for example, 99 cents. Users tend to go up sub levels as they embrace and rely on the app.”&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Focus on uses cases more than features: “Use cases are interesting to users.”&nbsp; 
 



 
 Listen to users through support. “Get stuff out to real users; get it in production so you can learn what’s right and wrong.”&nbsp; 
 



 
 Look for processes where you’re “using paper or have tricky integration challenges” and apply future-focused decentralized identity technology to find a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley should know: not only is he in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/12/why-dr-paul-ashley-is-in-demand-on-the-decentralized-identity-speaking-circuit/">demand on the decentralized identity speaking circuit</a>, he has been at the helm of privacy pioneer, <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Anonyome Labs</a>, alongside <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">CEO JD Mumford</a> for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley gave the advice on a recent episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-ashley-will-consumers-pay-for-an-identity-product/id1672163418?i=1000606281000">Future of Identity podcast</a> with host Riley Hughes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the episode, Dr Ashley takes the listener through the history and success of Anonyome Labs’ all-in-one privacy app <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, as well as our enterprise platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> (for which MySudo is an exemplar application), and explains how our products link to and enable <a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">decentralized identity</a>—the biggest privacy breakthrough of the next decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Riley says, “This is a conversation that will interest anyone who has a passion for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and safety online and will be very insightful for anyone building a consumer identity product.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-ashley-will-consumers-pay-for-an-identity-product/id1672163418?i=1000606281000">Listen to the episode now</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from product development advice, the episode covers 6 topics:&nbsp;</p>



 
 What’s the WHY for MySudo?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley explains how the erosion of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> online and the rise of <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a> led Anonyome Labs to create our innovative ID tech product, <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You could see the user really had very little hope of protecting themselves. We wanted to offer tech for everyday users that provides them greater privacy, greater safety and security and our mission was to deliver product in that space,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now highly regarded as the world’s only all-in-one privacy app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a> allows users to create secure digital profiles or personas called <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>, with unique disposable <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/08/the-shocking-privacy-facts-our-co-ceo-told-naomi-brockwell-about-cell-phones%ef%bf%bc/">phone numbers</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">emails</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">credit cards</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/06/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handles</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browsers</a> to use across the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As host Riley points out, with hundreds of thousands of users, “MySudo has defied conventional wisdom that consumers won’t pay for identity services, making it among a handful of successful, sustainable ID tech businesses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/">Discover MySudo</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 What’s the history of MySudo?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley says Anonyome Labs realized early the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/dr-paul-ashley-presents-on-how-to-solve-the-privacy-problem/">privacy problem</a> was an identity problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The identity problem was that when you went out into the world and did different things, it was always you with the same identifiers and it made it very simple for the trackers to follow you around. That was because users were using their single, real identity to do everything. Then, if there was a sale or theft of that info, the user was in trouble,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, Anonyome Labs came up with the idea of a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, based on the concept of a pseudonym, and then applied the concept of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>. MySudo leverages compartmentalization by allowing the user to have multiple Sudo digital identities or personas—one digital identity for shopping, one for dating, one for selling on classifieds, one close to the user’s legal identity for booking airline tickets, and so on. See how a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/see-how-a-mysudo-user-applies-the-app-to-their-busy-life/">MySudo user applies the app to their busy life</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MySudo we know today is actually a combination of two previous app iterations: Sudo app for communications and Sudo Pay which introduced Anonyome Labs’ virtual cards to meet the need for limitless virtual payment card options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr Ashley told Riley Hughes, “Users can go out with a whole bunch of different personas to do different things. Each persona has its own attributes plus can have a VPN profile, virtual credit card and so on—all the things you need to be different in situation A and situation B.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“MySudo has been out there for three to four years now [as] a consumer ID product for creating personas for people to use throughout their life online,” Dr Ashley summarized.&nbsp;</p>



 
 How does Anonyome Labs market MySudo?&nbsp; 
 



<p>In the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-ashley-will-consumers-pay-for-an-identity-product/id1672163418?i=1000606281000">podcast episode</a>, Dr Ashley breaks down how Anonyome Labs has succeeded by taking a practical product approach and by talking about <a href="https://mysudo.com/category/use-cases/">use cases</a> more than <a href="https://mysudo.com/features/">features</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important use case for MySudo is the user logging in with a separate Sudo email and phone number rather than their personal ones. Most MySudo users apply that capability to online shopping, selling, dating, and travel. Users can also do <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/08/this-is-why-you-should-be-careful-how-you-set-up-2fa/">2FA with MySudo</a>, Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;</p>



 
 How does decentralized identity fit into our product roadmap?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley outlines some of the opportunities and challenges in the “nascent space” of <a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">decentralized identity</a> (DI), including navigating the complex technology landscape, how to find good problems for decentralized identity to solve first, and how Anonyome Labs’ experience building what some would call a “web2 identity product” (MySudo) is informing the way we tackle the UX of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley says DI is a natural accompaniment to Sudos: “We came at MySudo from the privacy direction—a toolkit of privacy tools. Then we saw decentralized identity come along and we said straight away it’s a tech that’s 100% designed for privacy and safety,” Dr Ashley explains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs has been active in the DI space ever since: helping to run three DI blockchains, actively contributing to DI standards, contributing source code back to the DI open source community, and building DI capabilities into <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> for enterprises to leverage, including <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallets</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DI is the future-leaning part of the business and we’re 100% behind it,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 How will Anonyome Labs take the DI concepts to the people?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley says in the past four years DI has boomed, including around standards and what he calls “<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">the killer feature of DI</a>, verifiable credentials”, which has led to the need for an <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>: “There’s no question that having that stack is correct,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley then runs through many use cases for DI, including the big one: selective disclosure around digital proof of identity, where “we’re already seeing lots of great government uses such as licenses,” and everyday applications such as gym memberships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have got to stop people having hundreds of different passwords in a password manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even just managing the log-in problem will be a marvelous thing for the world,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read our whitepaper: <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Riley Hughes that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">Sudos are a bridge</a> between the old and new worlds of identity management: “This technology is absolutely perfect for Anonyome Labs and fits into the Sudo perfectly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And interest from enterprise is booming: “All of a sudden there are a lot of organizations wanting to do projects in this area. We have a lot of expertise over four-plus years, plus two years of project experience. A lot of enterprises are saying this tech looks good. The timing is great; the wave is cresting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But we’re not looking at boiling the ocean. It’s about making processes more efficient— replacing paper-based systems [with] simpler, cheaper [processes] using verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Enterprises should look for processes where [they’re] using paper or have tricky integration challenges. They should also listen to users through support. Get stuff out to real users; get it in production so you can learn what’s right and wrong,” Dr Ashley advises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get more advice on getting started with DI <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 What does the future of identity look like to Dr Ashley?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>The podcast episode ends with this hope from Dr Ashley: “We have got to put the user back in control and swing the pendulum back. It’s not easy because of the trillion dollar companies like Meta and Google not wanting that. But enterprises are going back to respecting user data and only using what they need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the next 10 years, there’ll be a tussle but hopefully the user will win and get their privacy back, and hopefully the big data companies will have just faded away,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to announce the general availability of Microsoft Entra ID multi-tenant organization platform capabilities!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As your organization evolves, you may need to integrate multiple tenants to facilitate collaboration; for example, your organization may have recently acquired a new company, merged with another company, or restructured with newly formed business units. With disparate identity management systems, it can be costly and complex for admins to manage multiple tenants while ensuring users across tenants have access to resources to collaborate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable application sharing across tenants, many of you have already deployed features like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b">B2B collaboration</a> to grant application access across tenants in your organization, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/collaborate-more-securely-with-new-cross-tenant-access-settings/ba-p/2147077">cross-tenant access settings</a> to allow for granular access controls, and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/seamless-application-access-and-lifecycle-management-for-multi/ba-p/3728752">cross-tenant synchronization</a> to manage the lifecycle of users across tenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further improve employee collaboration across your tenants, many of you have asked for unified chat across tenants in Microsoft Teams and seamless cross-tenant employee engagement and community experiences in Viva Engage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/overview">Entra ID multi-tenant organizations</a> to improve the cross-tenant collaboration experience in Microsoft Teams and Viva Engage. The capabilities are now generally available with Microsoft Entra ID P1 in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/public-sector-blog/understanding-compliance-between-commercial-government-and-dod/ba-p/3258326">M365 commercial cloud</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multi-tenant organization capabilities:&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Get started with Entra ID multi-tenant organizations:&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, we’ll follow Contoso EMEA and Contoso APAC, two divisions of Contoso Conglomerate. Employees from Contoso EMEA and APAC are already using Microsoft Entra to share apps across tenants. Now they need to communicate across tenants using <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/announcing-more-seamless-collaboration-in-microsoft-teams-for/ba-p/3901092">Microsoft Teams</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/what-s-new-for-viva-engage-ignite-edition/ba-p/3981897">Viva Engage</a>. Leaders in the organization need to share announcements and storylines across the organization and employees need to chat using Teams. Let’s look at how the admins at Contoso configure their multi-tenant organization to meet these needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1 – Form a multi-tenant organization&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tenant administrators of Contoso EMEA and Contoso APAC agree to form an Entra ID multi-tenant organization, facilitated by an invite-and-accept flow between them. The Contoso EMEA admin navigates to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/set-up-multi-tenant-org?view=o365-worldwide">M365 admin center</a> and initiates the process, while the Contoso APAC admin confirms. This results in a mutually agreed upon multi-tenant organization of two tenants in both directories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams and Viva Engage applications in Contoso EMEA (APAC) will now interpret any external member users of identity provider Contoso APAC (EMEA) as employees of the multi-tenant organization with corresponding improved collaboration experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Caption] A multi-tenant organization or two tenants in M365 admin center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2 – Provision external member users at scale&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams improved collaboration experience relies on reciprocal provisioning of collaborating users. So, Alice of Contoso EMEA should be provisioned as an external member user into Contoso APAC, while Bob of Contoso APAC should be provisioned as external member user into Contoso EMEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viva Engage improved employee engagement experiences rely on centralized provisioning of employees into a central tenant, say Contoso EMEA. As such, Bob of Contoso APAC should be provisioned as an external member user into Contoso EMEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-tenant synchronization is the ideal tool to accomplish this at scale, via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure">Entra admin center</a> for complex identity landscapes, or via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/plan-multi-tenant-org-overview?view=o365-worldwide">M365 admin center</a> for simplified setups. If you already have your own at scale user provisioning engine, you can continue using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3 – Complete requirements by Microsoft Teams or Viva Engage&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Microsoft Teams requirements such as using the new Teams clients can be found under <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/plan-multi-tenant-org-overview?view=o365-worldwide">M365 multi-tenant collaboration</a>, while any Viva Engage configuration requirements can be found under <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/Viva/engage/mto-setup">Viva Engage for multi-tenant organizations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your requirements for Microsoft Teams and/or Viva Engage have been completed, your employees will be able to collaborate seamlessly across your organization of multiple tenants, with unified chat experiences in Microsoft Teams and seamless conversations in Viva Engage communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does multi-tenant organization licensing work?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entra ID multi-tenant organization license requirement - Your employees can enjoy the new multi-tenant organization platform benefits with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/multi-tenant-organization-overview#license-requirements">Microsoft Entra ID P1 licenses</a>. Only one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required per employee per multi-tenant organization. For Microsoft Teams and Viva Engage license requirements, please review the <a href="https://aka.ms/M365MTOBlog">M365 multi-tenant organization announcement</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m very excited for this milestone which helps your multi-tenant organization achieve better collaboration and communication experiences for your employees! Go and plan your multi-tenant organization rollout today. We love hearing from you and look forward to your feedback on <a href="https://feedback.azure.com/d365community">Azure forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Overheating<br>The most obvious impact of a warming planet is higher summer temperatures and heatwaves, which are intensified by urban heat island effect (UHIE). Heat islands produce unequal impacts, and profoundly accelerate existing inequalities; people living in deprived areas, peoples of colour, those with underlying health conditions, as well as those with limited access to green space will face the worst adverse outcomes. In the UK, by 2080, the chances of exceeding 40ºC will be similar to today’s chance of reaching 32ºC. By 2030 Birmingham’s summers will consistently exceed 40ºC (<a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/spf/west-midlands-city-pack_august-2022.pdf">Met Office↗</a>), hugely increasing the risk of hospitalisation and death, as well as the failure of basic services and infrastructure<a href="https://www.ukclimaterisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technical-Report-The-Third-Climate-Change-Risk-Assessment.pdf">↗</a>. To address this we will need to implement neighbourhood sites for dealing with heat related emergencies, to adapt our homes, as well as to create greater access to and quality of green and blue infrastructure<a href="https://ukgbc.org/news/what-does-the-recent-ipcc-report-mean-for-the-built-environment-and-how-can-we-build-resilience/">↗</a>.

Droughts in the UK are already chronic — not only reducing the availability of water for drinking and agricultural use, but also increasing the risks of wildfires, encouraging tree disease, and undermining the ability of forests, wetland and peatland areas to store and sequester carbon, and in some cases turning them into carbon sources<a href="https://www.ukclimaterisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technical-Report-The-Third-Climate-Change-Risk-Assessment.pdf">↗</a>.<br>Drought has a big knock-on effect on food security, by limiting both the ability of the UK to import food (on which the UK is heavily reliant), as well as threatening home-grown food production. Addressing drought will require a much greater use and reuse of rainwater, as well as a bias for local food produce and creating habitats for pollinators<a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/drought-and-climate-change">↗</a>.  Flooding<br>For every 1ºC of temperature rise, air can hold up to 7% more moisture <a href="https://tyndall.ac.uk/news/uk-rain-going-get-heavier/#:~:text=At%201.4%C2%B0C%2D4.6,resulting%20in%20more%20intensified%20rainfall.&amp;text=Further%20intensified%20rainfall%20also%20increases%20risk%20of%20flooding.">↗</a>, making rainfall and flash flooding much more likely across the UK in the future.

Food shortage and price inflation<br>The world is already experiencing a food production and affordability crisis, with the UK food prices having inflated by almost a third in the last two years, and the CCC estimating that GMST rises could increase food price inflation by a further 20% by 2050.<br>In 2020, the UK’s wheat yield dropped by 40% due to a mix of heavy rain and drought. Biodiversity loss and species extinction are further degrading the overall soil health needed to grow food.<br>Food shortages and food inflation will exacerbate our existing inequalities in food security and access to a nutritional diet. Droughts across the globe will exacerbate food insecurity, particularly the price and availability of fresh food needed to sustain a healthy&nbsp;diet.  Climate migration<br>Over the next three decades the combined impacts of environmental migration (estimated 1.2 billion people by 2050 <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/stories/frequently-asked-questions-climate-change-and-disaster-displacement">↗</a><a href="https://www.zurich.com/en/media/magazine/2022/there-could-be-1-2-billion-climate-refugees-by-2050-here-s-what-you-need-to-know">↗</a>) and predicted global population rise (we expect an increase of 20–25% by 2050) will place more responsibility on the UK to resettle and shelter millions of climate migrants and refugees. The UK’s historical and per capita emissions disproportionately impact areas of the world that are likely to experience extreme heat. By 2050, the number of people suffering from a month of inescapable heat could further grow to a staggering 1.3 billion.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/pakistan-extreme-heat-health-impacts-death?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">↗</a>  Increased cost of living<br>The cost of energy (particularly heating over colder months) will remain a problem for many homes in the UK, driven by old, poorly performing homes as well as rising gas &amp; electricity costs.<br>On a more macro level, drought and flooding will make trade and access to our current energy and food supplies more difficult and expensive, further exacerbating the price of energy and its health and social care costs. Droughts and harvest failures already account for 30% of euro-area inflation volatility between 1961 and&nbsp;2016<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2022/2022-q4/climate-change-possible-macroeconomic-implications">↗</a>.   The current energy transition isn’t&nbsp;viable <p>Many of our most optimistic climate targets are still built around projections of transitioning to a clean energy system, yet much of what’s embedded in both committed policy and net-zero goals doesn’t address the systemic extraction and overuse of natural resources. This is a problem embodied by the material demands of shifting our energy&nbsp;system.</p><p>The climate activist Nate Hagens refers to this as our ‘energy blindness’; as global GDP is almost entirely tethered to the energy we use (99%) and the amount of materials we consume (100%), a global energy transition without a decoupling of growth and material consumption, and developing a meaningful circular economy, will only give us clean energy for one single generation, and ignores the wider systemic environmental destruction this&nbsp;creates.</p><p>Current economic forecasts predict a doubling of our energy and material use every 25 years (material use up 60% by 2060 <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/44902/GRO24_Summary_for_Policymakers.pdf?sequence=3">↗</a>). Despite impressive technological and efficiency gains, what’s known as the <a href="http://The%20Jevons%20paradox%20for%20energy%20consumption%20in%20the%20EU-27,%201995-2019">rebound effect</a> (improvements in technological efficiency prompting increased demand and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/there-is-no-planet-b/1C152963CE739459C346D76B439A0272">greater resource consumption</a>) means that absolute decoupling of GDP from energy on a global scale is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919302831">yet to materialise</a>. Studies have shown no evidence that technological progress will lead to a reduction of material use&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/technological-progress-alone-stem-consumption-materials-0119">↗</a>.</p><p>When we talk about a clean energy transition, what we’re actually talking about is a rapid increase in the supply of a number of critical minerals — lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite, which are crucial for batteries; rare earth elements, used in permanent magnets in wind turbines and electric motors; copper and aluminium for electricity networks.</p><p>By 2030, demand for lithium could reach fifteen times current levels. By 2050 it will require a 600% increase in copper production. This, alongside other transition materials, will require a historical increase in mining and processing, one of the most carbon intensive activities on the planet. Even meeting net-zero targets by 2050 would require six times more mineral input over the next two decades than&nbsp;today.<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">↗</a></p><p>Production and processing capacity of these materials are predominantly located in countries of instability, corruption and conflict.<a href="https://www.iisd.org/story/green-conflict-minerals/#group-Interactive-Map-y7ktykHmkL">↗</a> What’s more, their locations often overlap with Earth’s most vital carbon sinks and where the need for restoration is greatest.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2784-9">↗</a></p><p>The geographical concentration of these minerals (lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements) means that three-quarters of global output comes from just three nations. Alongside this, complex global supply chains increase the risks of disruption, trade restrictions or other geopolitical tensions<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">↗</a> associated with extraction. Yet most crucially to the question of accelerating our energy transition, whilst there may theoretically be enough materials for our transition, the average mine takes 16.5 years to move from discovery to production.</p><p>Our material economy is the main cause of environmental damage globally, with 90% of biodiversity loss and water stress being caused by resource extraction and processing <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/biodiversity/overview#:~:text=Today%2C%20more%20than%2090%25%20of,consume%20our%20products%20and%20food.">↗</a>. These same activities contribute to about half of global greenhouse gas emissions <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector">↗</a>.</p>Cumulative per capita emissions — the minority world has already consumed far beyond their own carbon budgets, and robbed the majority world of&nbsp;theirs. +1.5ºC is a New Age of Imperialism <p>Our agreed global climate target of limiting average temperature rise to 1.5ºC fundamentally sacrifices billions of lives to conflict, trauma and deadly climates<a href="https://globaia.org/habitability">↗</a>.</p><p>Yet even the sum total of current global policies and policy commitments means we are locked-in to surpassing +1.5ºC within the next&nbsp;decade<a href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/one-point-five-pathways/index.html">↗</a>.</p><p>Embedded in the global north’s most ambitious climate action plans, from net zero commitments to the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, are contemporary structures of colonialism. Successful outcomes in the pledges laid out by global minority governments (inc. the UK) rest on extractivism, externalisation of ecological impacts in key decision-making processes, and the continued dehumanisation of the global south. The growth mandate that defines western democratic economies doubles down on the accumulation of wealth rooted in our colonial legacy: the existing form and discourse around climate commitments exacerbates historic violence while feeding local and global injustices.</p><p>As a result, the UK’s current national strategies are centred around decarbonisation (e.g. mass retrofit and energy transition) and are undertaken from a green growth, carbon-centric and material consumptionist mindset. Most materials and minerals essential to the transition, such as cobalt, lithium, and other rare earth minerals, exist in their highest concentrations in global south nations ranking high on the corruption index, and with documented abuses associated with their mining industries. For example, cobalt, on which many “zero emissions” scenarios rely, is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where atop highly unregulated and extractive mining practices, European corporate influences are entangled with political instability in the region, as well as corruption and genocide, contributing to a contemporary form of imperialism.</p><p>The regions of the world that will enable our attempts to balance the earth’s systems and enable future thriving are those that have been profoundly over extracted and exploited historically, while seeing little or no regeneration in return. Often these modes of extraction are justified as a means of maintaining (GDP) growth at a macroeconomic scale — yet they directly and indirectly impact countries that already are and will continue to be most impacted by climate breakdown, alongside the cascading and compounding impacts of the polycrisis.</p><p>This de-facto way in which we can understand and rationalise the UK’s climate action plans, and its role in a wider just climate transition, makes its current approach problematic for two&nbsp;reasons:</p><p>The first is that if we attribute the emissions of colonised nations during the years of colonialism to the colonising nation, the UK has one of the highest per capita emissions rates in the world, already blowing the UK’s remaining carbon budget by 230%. This matters because it represents the stolen time and carbon budget from countries that it has historically oppressed and impoverished, all of which fall well below the per capita carbon allowance for limiting global temperatures to below&nbsp;+1.5ºC.</p><p>The second is that we are already seeing greater emphasis being placed on energy security, and the importance of securing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/G_sd1okac_s?si=SxFxl3AiOkZwliip">critical minerals</a> and raw materials needed to make that a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>However, climate breakdown and global temperature rise are symptoms of a problem, not the problem itself. Regardless of our decarbonisation efforts, we need strategies that can address the root causes of climate breakdown and environmental destruction.</p><p>We need to adopt practices and ways of being that change how we relate to the world. In many cases, these ideas exist in non-western cultures, among peoples who have been in kinship with land as opposed to relating to it primarily by extraction. These are ideas and practices that aren’t new, but represent a ‘<a href="https://www.susted.com/wordpress/content/the-re-indigenization-of-humanity-to-mother-earth-a-learning-platform-to-cultivate-social-ecological-resilience-and-challenge-the-anthropocene_2018_01/">re-indigenisation</a>’ of how our infrastructures and institutions function.</p><p>This is not abstract for many UK residents who have direct family and friendship connections to the global geographies and lands that are presently, and in the future, set to be most impacted by the polycrisis, and from whose indigenous and local communities we might relearn how to relate to the&nbsp;planet.</p> Re-imagining our Fundamentals <p>The UK’s carbon budget is 2.32 GtCO2e, meaning we will need around a 20% reduction each year between now and&nbsp;2050*.</p><p>So what does a radically different built environment look&nbsp;like?</p>Sources: <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/contentwbc/download/15653/227132/1">ARUP↗</a>, <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/contentwbc/download/15653/227132/1">LETI↗</a>, <a href="https://carbonbudgetcalculator.com/">Carbon Budget Calculator↗</a>, <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors/buildings">SBTi↗</a><p>The embodied carbon emissions alone for the UK’s new build housing is approximately 16.7 MtCO2e/yr**, meaning at current pace we have 5 more years of carbon budget for building new homes at their average current embodied carbon.

Whilst immediate actions to adapt to the impacts of global temperature rises remain necessary, the focus on this alone risks only dealing with climate breakdown on a purely symptomatic level, and in some cases creates new industries of growth and extraction.</p><p>Alongside confronting the consequences of a warmer planet we need to actively reimagine how our neighbourhoods and economies function. Following on from work done by Dark Matter Labs that outlined the <a href="https://www.irresistiblecircularsociety.eu/news/invitation-paper-a-new-european-bauhaus-economy-designing-our-futures">foundational shifts</a> needed for a future regenerative economy in the built environment, what follows is six re-imaginings at the neighbourhood scale that look to highlight possibilities for shifting how we build, organise, and own our neighbourhoods.</p> Recoding comfort for a +3ºC&nbsp;planet Creating the civic infrastructure and building standards for a hotter and wetter&nbsp;climate.<p>As we can see through the heat vulnerability study (above), the future risks of a warmer planet will be huge accelerators of existing inequalities in society. People living in poor quality housing, who suffer from poor air quality, and have little or no access to green space are already indicators of the structural wealth and racial inequality in British&nbsp;society.</p><p>This means resilience will need to become a core driver of how we look to adapt our built environment and social networks in response to the future risks of a warmer&nbsp;planet.</p><p>On the physical upgrade of our streets and buildings, this means the fabric of the UK’s neighbourhoods will need to deal with flooding and overheating as primary objectives, as well as catering for the knock-on impacts these may&nbsp;create.</p><p>At the street scale this means investing and building things like solar shading; from urban trees to temporary covers and shelters. It means looking at how those same infrastructures can double up as sites for urban flood protection and water retention. It means developing neighbourhood-based and regional warning systems and emergency response sites as a key part of responding to more localised climate events. Norms will have to change, too: our expectations around convenience and comfort, which rely upon consumption patterns rooted in imperialism and ongoing extraction, can be reconfigured at a neighbourhood level to reflect sensitivity to this&nbsp;moment.</p> Regenerative resources Rewiring neighbourhood resource flows to encourage longevity, bio-materials and reuse as a&nbsp;default.<p>Materials, water and nutrient cycles will need to shift to be bio-based and circular in their production, consumption and reuse as far as possible.</p><p>This is a reimagination of our neighbourhoods as metabolic systems; with the resource flows already present and active within it needing to become as self-sustaining as possible, and for their maintenance to be regarded as paramount. Reimagining nutrient and water cycles will build capacity for local, low-carbon and nutritious food systems supported by local water systems and practices.</p><p>At the scale of our homes, the bricks, steel and timber in existing buildings should be treated as carbon and material stores that need to be reused as much as possible. We need to collectively rethink what it means to live regeneratively in our neighbourhoods, by establishing alternative ownership and stewardship models for buildings and their materials, and using policy to increase specification of long-life and bio-based materials.</p><p>It also means that civic and public spaces need to be geared towards supporting this reality and helping to make it happen; creating the spaces, infrastructures and new commodity flows for dealing with bio-based production and circular resource&nbsp;use.</p> Retrofit &amp; densification Supporting neighbourhoods to maximise the space and materials that already&nbsp;exist.<p>In the UK we already know that our current yearly housing need would eat through our entire national carbon budget in the next five years (not factoring in the historic bias built into UK’s carbon budget, suggesting that our allowance should be much lower, as discussed above). The status-quo of how we deliver and build new homes is, for this reason and others, untenable.</p><p>Campaigns such as ‘<a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/retrofirst">RetroFirst</a>’, with the design and construction industry, promote the necessity of biassing the adaptation and extension of existing buildings and infrastructure in order to make the most effective use of resources (both past and present). In alignment with this, in reimagining our neighbourhoods, new build housing and infrastructure, as well as site demolition, will become an exception and the creation of housing will need to be designed to become carbon positive and fully circular by&nbsp;design.</p><p>This transformation can be influenced at the governance level through policy and regulation to support densification and vertical extensions of building, while limiting new builds. In our communities, we’ll organise and design to normalise space sharing and the fractional leasing of spaces, to make the most of the buildings we have. These processes contribute to a revaluation of our built surroundings to treat them as a further form of shared community infrastructure to be cared for and made to last&nbsp;longer.</p> Renewable energy&nbsp;systems Building the physical and institutional infrastructure for just local energy transitions.<p>An energy transition through full electrification will need to be married with a strategy of reduced mineral and material consumption in order to fully transition away from fossil&nbsp;fuels.</p><p>This will mean changing how local energy demands are managed, and by whom, through new energy services and leasing contracts as well as demand reduction. Community-owned, and distributed renewable energy systems and heating and cooling networks will build neighbourhood agency around the transition, developing a universal basic energy provision. We should move away from renewable energy existing as a luxury for only the ‘able to pay’ market, and instead use community energy schemes to lower bills for those most in need, reducing inequality in our neighbourhoods.</p><p>We can expand this reimagination to shared ownership models for zero-carbon mobility networks and last-mile logistics, transforming our streetscapes into urban green corridors to reflect this reimagination.</p> Rewilding the&nbsp;city Finding opportunities for supporting civic-led blueand green infrastructure<p>Rewilding urban neighbourhoods is a primary strategy for maximising overlapping co-benefits associated with adapting to a 3ºC scenario. Targeting indicators like improving biodiversity, soil health and air quality, we can bring about a huge range of cascading, positive outcomes associated with thriving blue and green infrastructure, while reducing critical risks associated with floods and urban heat&nbsp;islands.</p><p>This will mean adapting private green space into shared allotments and green social space, as well as opportunities for community planting and care of urban trees and vegetation that will make up a street forest with increased canopy cover and permeable paving surfaces. In existing parks, wildflower meadows and bioswales support the entangled benefits of biodiversity and mitigation of the direct impacts of climate breakdown.</p><p>Rewilding the city will support neighbourhood-scale financial health in the long-term, but its benefits will be felt, too, in improved physical and mental wellbeing and growing practices around neighbourhood care.</p> Re-infrastructuring Rebuilding the social and organisational networks for a more unpredictable world<p>Central to reducing our overall demand for resource consumption and building our capacity for further reimagination of neighbourhood fundamentals is the reintroduction and sustenance of communal spaces and social infrastructures, as well as the civic networks and hosting organisations that bring them to&nbsp;life.</p><p>This kind of re-infrastructuring, which operates on a definition of ‘infrastructure’ that looks far beyond the physical, will empower our neighbours in the governance, decision-making, and investment processes involved in the transition. Community institutions and ways of organising can expand access and learning to those who may feel shut out of existing ways of participating, using digitally- and socially-enabled tools. Adapting our existing local infrastructures–our homes, streets and civic spaces–to play host to communal dining, caring, growing, and working is a fundamental shift for reducing further resource extraction and waste. At the same time, neighbourhood learning and upskilling programmes will ensure that our neighbourhoods and next generations are not left behind in future transition phases and crises, but rather are equipped with important skills for living and working in a 3ºC, or other,&nbsp;world.</p><p>This work and research is ongoing, and was written in collaboration with, and in support of, CIVIC SQUARE’s Neighbourhood Public Square initiative.</p><p>For more information follow CIVIC SQUARE on <a href="https://x.com/CIVIC_SQUARE">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/civic_square/">instagram</a>.</p>This work forms part of the Neighbourhood Public Square publication by <a href="https://medium.com/u/dc984fafe130">CIVIC&nbsp;SQUARE</a>

 Decentralized Identity in the Age of Wearable Technology <p>The rise of wearable technology, as detailed by Luis Quintero in his insightful article on The Conversation, presents an exciting yet daunting evolution in how we interact with digital devices. Wearables now extend beyond fitness trackers to include devices capable of monitoring a broad spectrum of physiological data, from heart rates to brain activity. While these devices promise enhanced personal health monitoring and more immersive digital experiences, they also raise significant privacy concerns. This piece aims to explore how decentralized identity (DID) can provide robust solutions to these concerns.</p><blockquote>Wearable devices are now becoming a more significant element in this discussion due to their ability to collect continuous data, without the wearer necessarily being aware of it. — <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-wave-of-wearable-devices-will-collect-a-mountain-on-information-on-us-we-need-to-get-wise-about-the-privacy-implications-226537">Read the full article by Luis Quintero on The Conversation</a></blockquote> Continuous and Invasive Data Collection <p>Quintero adeptly highlights the dual-edged nature of wearable technologies: while they offer personalized health insights, they also pose risks due to the continuous and often non-consensual collection of personal data. This data collection can become invasive, extending into areas we might prefer remained&nbsp;private.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>Decentralized identity systems empower users by ensuring they maintain control over their personal data. Through DIDs, users can effectively manage who has access to their data and under what conditions. For instance, they could grant a fitness app access to their workout data without exposing other sensitive health information. This selective sharing mechanism, enforced through blockchain technology, ensures data privacy and security by&nbsp;design.</p> The Exploitation of Sensitive Data <p>The potential for exploiting personal data collected by wearables for commercial gain is a pressing issue. Without stringent controls, companies could misuse this data, affecting user privacy and autonomy.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>Implementing DIDs can safeguard against such exploitation. By using encryption and blockchain, each user’s data remains securely under their control, accessible only through permissions that they can grant or revoke at any time. This approach not only secures data against unauthorized access but also provides a transparent record of who accesses the data and for what&nbsp;purpose.</p> Enhanced AI Capabilities and Privacy&nbsp;Risks <p>As AI integrates more deeply with wearable technologies, the scope for analyzing this data expands, leading to enhanced capabilities but also increased privacy&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>DIDs can mitigate these risks by enabling the creation of anonymized datasets that AI algorithms can process without accessing directly identifiable information. This allows users to benefit from advanced AI applications in their devices while their identity and personal data remain protected.</p> Addressing Emerging Technologies <p>With wearable technologies becoming capable of more deeply intrusive monitoring — such as tracking brain activity or emotional states — the need for robust privacy safeguards becomes even more critical.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>The flexibility of DIDs is key here. They allow users to set specific, context-based permissions for data access, which is essential for technologies that monitor highly sensitive physiological and mental data. Users can ensure that their most personal data is shared only when absolutely necessary and only with entities they trust explicitly.</p> Conclusion: Empowering Users Through Decentralized Identity <p>The integration of wearable technology into our daily lives must be approached with a strong emphasis on maintaining and enhancing user privacy. Decentralized identity offers a powerful tool to achieve this by putting control back in the hands of users, thus enabling a future where technology serves humanity without compromising individual privacy.</p><p>As we move forward, it is crucial for policymakers, technology developers, and consumers to come together to support the adoption of decentralized identity solutions. By fostering an environment where privacy is valued and protected, we can ensure that the advancements in wearable technology will enhance our lives without endangering our personal information.</p> Join Us in Shaping the Future with Decentralized Identity <p>Interested in solving the complex privacy challenges such as those posed by wearable technology?

			<p>Luxembourg, 25 April 2024 – Capital markets technology firms <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leader in tokenization technology for capital markets assets, and <a href="https://globacap.com/">Globacap</a>, a world leader in the automation of private markets operational workflow, have partnered to expand the DINO Network and transform the distribution landscape for tokenized private assets.</p>
<p>Private capital markets have witnessed robust growth over the past decade, surpassing global public markets’ expansion by 1.7 times. Tokenization has emerged as a key enabler of accessibility, efficiency, transparency, and liquidity for the private market by providing a unified and programmable infrastructure.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges in tokenized private assets distribution is enforcing post-issuance compliance and ensuring interoperability with distribution platforms. ERC-3643, the token standard for tokenized securities, addresses these issues by restricting token interactions to eligible users while maintaining compatibility with applications supporting ERC-20 tokens.</p>
<p>Globacap is now part of the DINO Network initiative, an interoperable distribution network for digital securities leveraging the ERC-3643 token standard, to expand the reach of its marketplace. Tokeny acts as a connector provider between Globacap and the DINO Network. Combined with Globacap’s workflow automation software, this partnership aims to bring public market-like efficiency to private markets, enabling greater execution capabilities in secondary markets, streamlining workflows, and ensuring robust record integrity.</p>
<p>Globacap digitizes the workflow and execution across the entire private markets journey, from primary raises through vehicle and investor management and the execution and settlement of secondary transactions. Its technology has been used to host over 150+ primary placements, digitize over $20bn in investment vehicles, and execute and settle over $600m in secondary transactions of private assets.</p>
<p>Tokeny, with six years of experience in tokenization and €28 billion in assets tokenized, is the initial creator of the ERC-3643 standard, advancing market standardization in tokenization. After having built a robust tokenization engine for financial institutions, Tokeny is now helping the ecosystem to build blockchain-based distribution rails.</p>

		 
	 
    The DINO Network leverages ERC-3643 to enhance liquidity by ensuring compliance and interoperability across platforms. Together with leading platforms like Globacap, we are revolutionizing private markets distribution, making it efficient, transparent, and liquid.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny       Despite the size and importance of private markets which have over $13 trillion AUM, for years they have lacked the infrastructure and transparency necessary for efficient transactions. Globacap provides rails that accelerate transaction capability in private markets while significantly reducing operational overheads. The combination of our offering with Tokeny is immense and will help to drive private markets innovation and growth forward.  Myles MilstonCo-founder and CEO of Globacap

			 BlackRock’s Influence and the Future of MMFs 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>In the world of finance, innovation acceleration often requires the endorsement of industry giants. BlackRock’s embrace of Tokenized Money Market Funds (MMFs) represents a monumental milestone towards the widespread adoption of tokenized securities.&nbsp;This drives financial institutions to kick off the tokenization of real use cases,&nbsp;fueled by a touch of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).</p>
<p>By leveraging public blockchains, BlackRock not only demonstrates the viability of blockchain technology in finance but also sets the stage for a transformative shift towards decentralized and open financial solutions. This instills greater confidence in&nbsp;institutions to embrace public blockchains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund successfully attracted $245 million in its first week of operations, underscoring&nbsp;the robust appetite from the buy side. This success also indicates the appeal of the&nbsp;24/7/365 availability, a compelling feature for tokenized forms of highly liquid assets like MMFs. For instance, Ondo Finance’s OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries) token, previously limited to traditional market hours with a T+2 subscription and redemption time, now allows&nbsp;instant settlement&nbsp;by moving $95 million of assets to BlackRock’s BUIDL.</p>
<p>In addition, prominent&nbsp;players in the web3 space are starting to create solutions to support tokenized funds. For example, Circle’s latest smart contract feature allows BUIDL holders to exchange shares for its stablecoin USDC, enabling effortless 24/7 transfers on the secondary market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, BlackRock initially utilized only one specific marketplace for tokenized MMFs distribution, whereas the future vision for tokenized MMFs and other securities extends far beyond singular centralized platforms.&nbsp;The next frontier is broader distribution across diverse trading platforms and DeFi protocols. As a result, tokenized MMFs can be distributed to any distributor platform and serve as collateral for lending smart contracts or liquidity pool deposits within automated market makers, unlocking accessibility, utility, and ultimately liquidity.</p>
<p>Enabling this expansion requires advanced smart contracts and robust token standards such as&nbsp;ERC-3643 to ensure compliance at the token level. Excitingly, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/history-of-erc-3643?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ULLY8IV_FhOkMaU2j1GgvwNrhbxwy1OzBIqBbHcxflZYck_CIvRS9tWNT-sexvatm4D7T">ERC-3643 standard has gained significant traction&nbsp;</a>through the push of the community-formed non-profit association. For several years at Tokeny and now with the association, we’ve had the privilege of presenting this standard to several regulators, including the SEC (US), CSSF (Luxembourg), BaFin (Germany), DFSA (Dubai), FSRA (Abu Dhabi), and MAS (Singapore). More and more, the framework’s ability to uphold existing security laws is now recognized globally.</p>
<p>With the market readiness and industry-wise recognition of the standard, top-tier institutions are now approaching us for assistance in tokenizing MMFs. Last month, we announced our partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/moreliquid-partners-with-tokeny-to-tokenize-hsbc-euro-liquidity-fund/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ULLY8IV_FhOkMaU2j1GgvwNrhbxwy1OzBIqBbHcxflZYck_CIvRS9tWNT-sexvatm4D7T">Moreliquid to tokenize the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund using ERC-3643</a>. This is just beginning, and we’re excited to share major announcements with the market very soon. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) form a staple of the modern work environment. VPNs provide an essential layer of protection for employees working remotely or across multiple office locations, encrypting data traffic to stop hackers from intercepting and stealing information. Usage of VPNs skyrocketed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and remains high — 77% of employees use VPN for their work nearly every day, according to the 2023 VPN Risk Report by Zscaler.</p> 
<p>Their widespread popularity has put VPNs squarely in the crosshairs of malicious actors. The recent ransomware attack on UnitedHealth Group, which disrupted payments to U.S. doctors and healthcare facilities nationwide for a month, has now been linked to compromised credentials on a remote system access application. This follows on the heels of a large-scale brute force attack campaign against multiple remote access VPN services, reported by Cisco Talos.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, these attacks are not an anomaly. The VPN Risk Report found that 45% of organizations experienced at least one attack that exploited VPN vulnerabilities in the last 12 months. So what can organizations do to protect this vulnerable gateway? Here we’ll cover the top VPN security best practices every organization should follow.</p> 
 How Does a VPN Work?  
<p>A VPN creates an encrypted connection between a user’s device and the organization’s network via the internet. Using a VPN, companies can grant remote employees access to internal applications and systems, or establish a unified network across multiple office sites or environments.</p> 
<p>An employee typically initiates a VPN connection through a client application installed on their device, connecting to a VPN server hosted within the organization. This connection creates a secure "tunnel" that encrypts all data transmitted between the employee's device and the corporate network. With the VPN connection established, the user's device is virtually part of the organization's internal network and the employee can access internal applications, databases, file shares, and other resources that are typically only accessible within the corporate network. Authentication between VPN clients and servers occurs through the exchange of digital certificates and credentials, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) a means to provide an additional layer of security.</p> 
<p>While VPNs provide some measure of remote access security, they also make a soft target for attackers. Moreover, VPN attacks pose an outsized risk — once attackers gain entry through a VPN, they often get direct access to&nbsp; a broad swath of an organization's networks and data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Common VPN Attack Vectors  
<p>Before we explore VPN security best practices, it’s important to understand how attackers exploit system vulnerabilities to gain access.</p> 
 Authentication-Related Attacks  
<p>Attacks on VPNs often revolve around authentication and credential-related weaknesses. These include:</p> 
  
  Credential Theft and Brute Force Attacks: Attackers target VPN credentials through phishing, keylogging malware, or brute force techniques to gain unauthorized access.  
  Session Hijacking: Hijacking active VPN sessions by stealing session cookies or exploiting session management vulnerabilities allows attackers to impersonate users and access VPN-protected resources.  
  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Exploiting weak authentication or compromised certificates, attackers intercept and manipulate VPN traffic to eavesdrop or modify data.  
  
 Vulnerability Exploits  
<p>Security flaws in VPN solutions themselves are another common route of attack. A recent analysis by Securin showed that the number of vulnerabilities discovered in VPN products increased 875% between 2020 and 2024. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities in VPN client software or server-side VPN components to gain unauthorized access to VPN endpoints. This can lead to complete compromise of the endpoint or enable attackers to intercept VPN traffic. In fact, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) itself was recently breached by hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the agency’s VPN systems.</p> 
 Five VPN Security Best Practices  
<p>With the growing assault on VPNs, organizations must adopt proactive security strategies to protect this major point of vulnerability. The following measures are recommended best practices to strengthen your VPN security posture.</p> 
 Regularly Update VPN Software and Components  
<p>Patch management is crucial for maintaining a secure VPN infrastructure. Regularly update VPN client software, servers, gateways, and routers with the latest security patches and firmware to mitigate vulnerabilities and defend against emerging threats. Establish procedures for emergency patching to promptly address critical vulnerabilities and ensure the ongoing security of your VPN environment.</p> 
 Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication  
<p>As one of the primary avenues of attacks on VPN, strong authentication protocols are critical. The remote access application that was breached In the UHG attack lacked multi-factor authentication controls. Massive leaks of stolen credentials, and crude but effective techniques such as password spraying and credential stuffing, make it trivial for attackers to gain entry to VPN when only a username and password stand in the way. Organizations should deploy, at the very least, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA). MFA challenges users to provide something they own (OTP, device, security key) or something they are (face scan, fingerprint) in addition to or instead of something they know (password, PIN).&nbsp;</p> 
 Make It Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>VPN security is vastly improved by using passwordless authentication methods that completely remove shared secrets. This makes it impossible for attackers to guess or steal authentication factors and much harder to spoof identity. Specifically, passwordless authentication based on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/guide-fido-authentication">FIDO standards</a> provides robust defense against phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks</a> and hacking attempts by eliminating insecure methods like SMS or OTPs. Moreover, since it’s based on public-key cryptography, it ensures there are no server-side shared secrets vulnerable to theft in case of a breach.</p> 
 Implement Access Control and Least Privilege:  
<p>Apply granular access control policies to restrict VPN access based on user roles, groups, or individual permissions. Ensure that users have access only to the resources necessary for their job functions (principle of least privilege), reducing the impact of potential insider threats or compromised credentials.</p> 
 Regularly Monitor and Audit VPN Traffic  
<p>Enable logging and monitoring of VPN traffic to detect suspicious activities, anomalies, or potential security incidents. Regularly review VPN logs and conduct security audits to identify unauthorized access attempts, unusual patterns, or compliance deviations. This proactive approach helps maintain visibility into VPN usage and ensures prompt response to security incidents.</p> 
<p>Leverage known IOCs, shared with the community as well by other vendors. VPN-oriented IOCs usually contain source IPs and Hosting providers which you can block.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Monitor logs for employee login behavior changes such as location changes (outside of normal locations for your business), login attempts outside regular business hours, as well as attempts with invalid username and password combinations.</p> 
 Strengthen Your VPN Security With HYPR  
<p>Despite the security concerns, VPNs are not going away any time soon. Adhering to VPN security best practices mitigates the technology’s vulnerabilities to safeguard your employees, systems and data. The most essential defense step is to deploy strong authentication systems. And the most robust systems completely remove passwords and all shared secrets from their VPN authentication.</p>

  <p>We hear much about AI these days, but AI would be of little use without data to power it. Without a good data input the results form AI will disappoint. All businesses generate valuable data from day-to-day activities, much of it unstructured – that is to say it resides inside office documents, PDFs, email inboxes and social media. This type of data already outstrips traditional structured data to be found in database applications, but most organizations have little idea of what or where this data lies. That stuff tends to be already ordered and listed but even here, organizations can benefit from governance to stratify this data further. Such Data Governance platforms exist to do this and make sense of unstructured data too. The best Data Governance platforms will not just make sense of data but reveal if privacy laws are being violated or data has passed the point of being useful. But the real value is when you apply Data Governance to &nbsp;your business goals.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher is a Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole and author of the Leadership Compass report on Data Governance platforms. In this webinar he will explain the growing importance of data governance and how it will assist both business AI and Identity tools in the future. Paul will show this market is characterized by continuous technological advancements and evolving regulatory landscapes. He will take you through some of the key findings of the Leadership Compass and how you can use it to find a Data Governance solution to fit your business needs and how a Data Governance Architecture Blueprint can help maintain data integrity and create business value from any Data Governance platform.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-governance"></a>

<p>I was delighted to appear on the latest <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nabdigitalnext/talking-digital-id-and-verifiable-credentials-with-stephen-wilson">NAB Digital Next podcast</a> in conversation with Alysia Abeyratne, NAB Senior Manager for Digital Policy. We drilled into the history of verifiable credentials and the recent awareness that identification doesn’t need so much identity.<br>
Hence NAB’s terminology has switched from “digital identity” to Digital ID — something that’s much more familiar and concrete.</p>
<p>NAB realises that identification processes need better data — IDs and credentials from the real world packaged in improved digital formats that make them more reliable online than plaintext IDs, and less vulnerable to theft.</p>
<p>The Australian federal government’s Digital ID Bill embodies this paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Individuals don’t need new numbers or any new “digital identity”; they need better ways to handle their existing IDs online. And it’s exactly the same with businesses; the best digital technologies conserve the rules and relationships that are working well in the analogue world.</p>
<p>After reviewing the historical language of “digital identity” and the state of the art in verifiable credentials, I went on to discuss how better verification of all important data is an urgent need, in the broader context of AI and the wicked problems of Deep Fakes.</p>
<p>Here are some edited extracts from the podcast.</p>
 Some History 
<p>At the dawn of ecommerce, in 1995, Australia was leading in e-signatures, e-authentication and PKI (public key infrastructure) even before we were buying much online. Around then Australia passed its technology neutral electronic signature law.</p>
<p>PKI was dominated by Defence thinking thanks to national security perspectives. Led to onerous operational standards, some still with us today in TDIF.</p>
<p>Trying to help people think about new digital concepts, we had naive metaphors for identity, such as “passports”, which we hoped would let us freely go around cyberspace and prove who we are. It turned out to be really hard to have a general-purpose proof of identity.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago, the digital industry got a little more focused, by looking at specific assertions, attributes and claims. These boil down to what do you need to know about somebody, from application to application.</p>
<p>And what do you need to know about a credential?</p>
 Verifiable Credentials and What Do You Really Need to Know? 
<p>Sophisticated verifiable credentials today let you know where a credential has come from, reference its terms and conditions, and can even convey how a credential has been carried (so we can tell the difference, for example, between device-bound Passkeys and synced Passkeys).</p>
<p>Instead of identity, we can ask better design questions, about the specifics that enable us to transact with others. When it’s important and you can’t rely on trust, then you need to know where a counterparty’s credentials have come from.</p>
<p>Provenance matters for devices too and data in general. The subjects of verifiable credentials can be non-humans, or indeed intangible items such as data records.</p>
<p>In almost all cases, we need to ask: Where does a subject come from? How do you know that a subject is fit for purpose? And where will you get these quality signals?</p>
<p>The same design thinking pattern recurs throughout digital credentials, the Internet of Things, software supply chains, and artificial intelligence. We need data in everything we do, and we need to know the story behind the data.</p>
 The importance of language 
<p>We habitually talk about “identity” but what do you really need to know about somebody?</p>
<p>When put it like that, we all know intuitively that the less you know about me, the better!</p>
<p>Technically that’s called data minimisation. In privacy law, it’s sometimes called purpose specification; in security it’s the good old need-to-know principle.</p>
<p>What do you really need to know about me? It’s almost never my identity, as we saw at the first <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">NAB roundtable (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>So, if identity is not necessarily our objective, we should not call this thing “digital identity”. It’s as simple as that.</p>
 Digital identity makes uneven progress 
<p>The Digital Identity field is infamously slow moving.&nbsp; The latest Australian legislation is the third iteration in four years, and the government’s <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lockstep-TDIF-DTA-Submission-171020.pdf">“Trusted Digital Identity Framework” (TDIF) dates back to 2016 (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve made Digital Identity hard by using bad metaphors – <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/remember-that-digital-identity-is-a-metaphor">especially “identity” itself</a>. There is wider appreciation now that the typical things we need to know online about people (and many other subjects) is not “identity” but instead it’s credentials, specific properties, facts and figures.</p>
<p>But meanwhile we have made great progress on verifiable credentials standards and solutions. White label verifiable credentials are emerging; the data structures can be customised to an enterprise’s needs, issued in bulk from a cloud service, and loaded into different digital wallets and devices.</p>
<p>Enterprises will be able to <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/magnetic-stripe-cards-and-verifiable-credentials">convert their employee IDs from analogue to digital</a>; colleges and training organisations will do the same for student IDs and qualifications. The result will be better security and privacy as users become able to prove exactly what they need to know about each other in specific contexts.</p>
 Governance of Digital ID and beyond 
<p>A major potential game changer is happening at home in Australia. The Digital ID Bill and resulting Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) makes the problem simpler by making the objective smaller. Instead of any new and unfamiliar “digital identity”, AGDIS conserves the IDs we are used to, and introduces a governance regime for digitising them.</p>
<p>The IDs we are familiar with are just database indexes. And we should conserve that. The Australian Digital ID Bill recognises that ID ecosystems exist and we should be able to govern the digitising of IDs in a more secure way. So, the AGDIS is a more careful response to the notorious data breaches in recent years.</p>
 The plaintext problem 
<p>The real problem exposed by data breaches is the way we all use plaintext data.</p>
<p>Consider my driver licence number. That ID comprises six numbers and two letters, normally conveyed on a specially printed card, and codifies the fact I am licensed to drive by the state of New South Wales. My status as a driver in turn is a proxy for my good standing in official government systems, so it has become a token of my existence in the community. Along with a few other common “ID documents” the driver licence has become part of a quasi-standard <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-goal-is-identification-not-an-identity/">grammar of identification</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, IDs are presented in person; the photo on a licence card proves the credential belongs to the person presenting it. Relative to the core ID, the photo is a type of metadata; it provides an extra layer of evidence that associates the ID with the holder.</p>
<p>When we moved identification online, we maintained the grammar but we lost the supporting metadata. Online, businesses ask for a driver’s licence number but have none of the traditional signals about the quality of the ID. Simply knowing and quoting an ID doesn’t prove anything; it’s what geeks call a “shared secret”, and after a big data breach, it’s not much of a secret anymore.</p>
<p>Yet our only response to data breaches is to change the IDs and reissue everybody’s driver’s licences. The new plaintext is just as vulnerable as it was before. It’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>But let’s look carefully at the problem.</p>
<p>The driver licence as a proxy for one’s standing is still valid; the licence does provide good evidence that a certain human being physically exists. But knowing the ID number is meaningless. We need to move away from plaintext presentation of IDs — as Lockstep submitted to the government in the <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-11/lockstep_consulting.pdf">2023 consultations on Digital ID legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Crucially, some 15 years ago, banks did just that. The banks transitioned from magnetic stripe credit cards, which encode cardholder data as plaintext, to chip cards.</p>
<p>The chip card is actually a verifiable credential, albeit a special purpose one, dedicated to conveying account details. In a chip card, the credit card number is digitally signed by the issuing bank, and furthermore, every time you dip your card or tap it on a merchant terminal, the purchase details are countersigned by the chip.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you use a digital wallet, a special secure chip in your mobile phone does the same thing: it countersigns the purchase to prove that the real card cardholder was in control.</p>
 Mimicking modern credit card security for Digital IDs 
<p>That’s the pattern that we now need to pivot from plaintext IDs to verifiable IDs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)</a> has the role of Digital ID regulator. As it did with another important digital regime, the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/banking-and-finance/the-consumer-data-right">Consumer Data Right (CDR)</a>, the ACCC is expected now to convene technical working groups to develop detailed rules and adopt standards for governing Digital ID.</p>
<p>If the rules adopt hardware-based digital wallets and verifiable credentials, then the presentation of any ID can be as secure, private and simple as a modern payment card. That will be a true game changer.</p>

				  From managing deepfakes to creating reusable KYC, decentralized identity’s ability to easily implement verifiable identity and data without direct integration provides a powerful path for improved efficiency, better fraud protection, and a new level of personalized account service and data privacy.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks Indicio will look at how decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology can transform banking and finance. The unique way this technology handles authentication — such as the identity of an account holder — is a powerful solution to the challenges of identity fraud, while also being a better way to manage customer experience (no more passwords, no need for multi-factor authentication).</p>
<p>But it doesn’t stop there —&nbsp;we can authoritatively know who we are talking to online, and verify the integrity of their data, leading to seamless operational processes and providing a starting point for creating better products and services.</p>
<p>Here’s a taste of what we’ll be looking at.</p>
<p>Re-use costly KYC</p>
<p>To open a checking account at most banks, you need to provide <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/what-should-you-bring-bank-open-checking-account.asp#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20checking%20account%2C%20you%20must%20provide%20government-issued,types%20may%20require%20additional%20information">government-issued identification with your photo, your Social Security card or Taxpayer Identification Number, and proof of your address.</a> Gathering this information can be difficult, time consuming, and frustrating. KYC can take anywhere from 24 hours to <a href="https://appian.com/learn/topics/know-your-customer-process/kyc-in-banking-explained.html">three weeks</a>, and costs the average bank <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=Here%20are%20their%20key%20findings,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year">$60 million per year.</a></p>
<p>How many times should you need to do this? Once, with a verifiable credential. And once you’ve done it the information can easily be shared both internally and with partners, resulting in smoother workflows and more opportunities for customers.</p>
<p>Fraud</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/identity-theft-credit-card-fraud-statistics/">145,206 cases of bank fraud</a> were reported in the US alone. But the headline loss of money isn’t the only problem here: For every $1 lost to fraud, <a href="https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2022/11/survey-finds-fraud-costs-rising-for-banks/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20fighting%20fraud,today%20by%20LexisNexis%20Risk%20Solutions">$4.36 is lost in related expenses</a>, such as legal fees and recovery. This means that the estimated <a href="https://seon.io/resources/global-banking-fraud-index/#h-costs-of-fraud">$1.6 billion</a> lost to fraudulent payments in 2022 cost almost $7 billion.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity provides a better way to tackle this — and it doesn’t require banks to embark on a massive new IAM system.</p>
<p>Phishing</p>
<p>Phishing happens when you think the email or SMS message you just received is from your bank and you absolutely must login to the link provided or face disaster. It works. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/the-history-of-phishing/#:~:text=The%202020%20Verizon%20Data%20Breach,of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic">22% of all data breaches involve phishing</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll explain how verifiable credentials provide a way for you to always know —&nbsp;and know for certain — that you are talking to your bank and, if you are the bank, that you’re talking to a real customer.</p>
<p>Frictionless processes keep customers coming back</p>
<p><a href="https://worldretailbankingreport.com/resources/baas-platform-model-is-the-way-forward/">44% of consumers</a> face medium to high friction when engaging with their digital banking platform. This means that almost half of people trying to access online banking have a hard time, and with friction being attributed as the cause for<a href="https://fractal.ai/removing-friction-from-your-digital-banking-experience/"> 70% of abandoned digital journeys</a>, customers are very likely to give up and leave if they face frustration.</p>
<p>We’ll explain how verifiable credentials save customers (and you) from the costs of friction.</p>
<p>Passwordless Login</p>
<p>No one likes passwords. They are the universal pain point of digital experience. And that pain can be costly: <a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/top-password-strengths-and-vulnerabilities">30% of users have experienced a data breach due to weak passwords</a>. Verifiable credentials make all this go away and enable seamless, passwordless login. Imagine, never having to remember or recreate a password again or follow up with multi factor authentication.</p>
<p>We’ll also look at improving financial inclusion and crystal ball the near future —&nbsp;simplified payments, countering buyback fraud and verifiable credentials for credit cards.</p>

			 What is and what is the purpose of digital signature software 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>An electronic signature software is a tool that allows documents and contracts to be digitally signed with full legal validity, manage all signing processes, and affix time stamps to multiple files and folders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By using digital signature software, individuals, professionals and companies can manage signature processes using the latest cryptographic technologies, which guarantee the authenticity and integrity of the document and ensure that it is not subsequently altered by unauthorized modifications. Its use is now widespread due to its ability to facilitate operations and processes that would otherwise require more time and resources. In fact, digital signature applications make it possible to digitize, automate and speed up processes, avoiding the use of paper and decreasing Co2 emissions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using e-signature software it is possible to sign agreements, transactions, contracts and business documents by managing approval and signing processes more efficiently. These digital solutions also streamline and optimize workflows, eliminating costs related to document printing, mailing and paper filing.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How electronic signature software works 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>These IT solutions integrate advanced encryption and authentication technologies that ensure the security and legal validity of signatures affixed to documents. Initially, it is necessary to choose a signature certificate (simple, advanced, or qualified), which guarantees the identity of the signer and the authenticity of his or her signature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After completing the personal identity recognition required to obtain the digital certificate, and after installing the electronic signature software, the user follows an authentication procedure, often based on a combination of username, password, and sometimes additional identifying factors. From this point, e-signature software can be used on one’s device: the user loads a document into the software and signs it using the chosen digital certificate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These IT solutions allow documents to be signed in electronic formats (PDF, P7M or XML) and can vary depending on the operating system or the specific needs of the user. In addition, a time stamp can be affixed, providing proof of the exact moment the document was signed, offering an additional level of security and reliability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cutting-edge e-signature software includes features dedicated to document organization, integration with enterprise cloud storage and ERP services, and management of deadlines, urgencies and notification modes. One example is InfoCert’s <a href="https://infocert.digital/gosign/">GoSign</a> the advanced, easy-to-use electronic signature platform that enables the digitization of transactions and approval processes while ensuring the full legal value of signed documents.</p>

 In Fluctuo’s recent European Shared Mobility Annual Review, in which IDnow sponsored and contributed, three significant trends are revealed as to what is driving mobility as seen through city and operator movements based on data collected from 115 European cities. 



<p>One could say 2023 was the year of unexpected surprise within the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility industry</a> after the <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/09/01/electric-scooters-what-are-the-rules-across-europe-and-where-are-injuries-highest#:~:text=Bidding%20au%20revoir%20to%20what,the%20first%20to%20adopt%20them.">Paris e-scooter ban</a> turned many heads and required not only cities across Europe but operators as well to re-consider their services and plans. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">Paris ban kicked off a tightening of regulations</a> across Europe within the mobility sector causing cities such as Rome, Berlin and Brussels to significantly reduce the number of operators and e-scooters.</p>



<p>However, before these changes started taking effect, e-scooters were the favorite among <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">shared mobility</a> services. Between 2019-2022, Fluctuo reported that e-scooters lead the market during this time, overshadowing the use of bikes. But now, the tables, or should we say direction, has turned.</p>



<p>Seeing the need to change direction, within shared and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/micromobility-and-the-future-of-transportation/">micromobility</a> services, both users and operators headed toward the next-best, and perhaps healthier, mode of transport—bicycles.</p>

 Are bikes the new e-scooters? 



<p>With the need to enter new markets, operators spun their wheels and put more time and effort into new offers, specifically dockless bikes. And their efforts were not in vain. 2023 saw dockless bike fleets up 50% and ridership up 54% compared to previous yeas in which e-scooters dominated the market. And it wasn’t only dockless bikes which saw an increase in usage but station-based bikes as well.</p>



<p>The after-effects from Paris made scooter operators realize that city authorities prefer shared bikes rather than e-scooters. This was clearly seen as the city of Paris topped the list at 45 million for station-based bike ridership and came in second after London for dockless bikes. Though it may seem that the two services should complement one another rather than compete, it would appear that dockless bikes are the preferred choice. Despite this, <a href="https://www.here.com/learn/blog/dockless-scooters-bikes">both bike services</a> are expected to grow in 2024, with station-based bikes growing more steadily perhaps due to more affordable end-user pricing.</p>



<p>Even though bike sharing is picking up in Northern Europe, that does not mean scooters have been kicked to the curb. On the contrary, the popularity of scooters remains and grows in Eastern Europe.</p>



 I feel the need, the need for… reduction. 



<p>Okay, it may not have been what you were thinking but unfortunately speed is not the answer here. After Paris decided to go forward with banning e-scooters, many did not know how it would affect other major cities. Most probably thought that it would create a domino effect and other cities would follow suit, banning <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">e-scooters</a> left and right. But this did not come to pass.</p>



<p>Instead, other cities decided to cut scooter fleet sizes rather than banning them completely. This however, was felt on the operator side who went into survival mode. Seeing the need to make smart economic decisions in order to stay in the game, mobility operators had to reduce costs, exit markets (i.e. scooters) and in some cases merge with another operator as seen with <a href="https://ridedott.com/press-release/tier-dott-merger/">Tier and Dott</a>. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">Consolidation became the name of the game</a>.</p>



<p>Now, with the limited number of spots available in cities for scooter operators, companies must appeal in order to stay active or risk the chance of not being able to operate in that location any longer.</p>



<p>But despite what sounds like grim news, the scooter fleets that have been reduced in major cities due to these new regulations are being moved to smaller cities and other cities without a number cap, resulting in fleet sizes remaining stable. Even better is the fact that fleets have grown 33% in Eastern Europe with Poland being an exceptionally large market for scooters.</p>



 Sharing is caring. 



<p>Bikes and scooters were not the only shared services that saw changes last year. Mopeds, for example, faced challenges due to cases of vandalism and theft in Eastern Europe. Safety concerns also arose in which the <a href="https://interlinex.com/index.php/2022/12/21/safety-first-new-helmet-requirement-for-moped-and-scooter-riders-in-the-netherlands/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%20helmet%20use,from%20moped%20and%20scooter%20accidents.">Netherlands now requires users to wear a helmet on mopeds</a> capped at 25km/h. Nevertheless, the moped market remained stable.</p>



<p>One sharing service which did perform well last year and seems to continue to do so is free-floating carsharing. After a 39% increase in rentals last year, car-sharing is seeing a growing popularity in short-term rentals (2-3 hours) compared to an entire day. Cities leading the way are mostly German to include Berlin, Hamburg and Munich.</p>



<p>As cities and remaining operators start accepting regulations and gaining financial stability within the market, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> services will continue to develop providing cities and their inhabitants with greater benefits than before.</p>



 Going green. 



<p>As carsharing services gain greater popularity after continual success, this mobility option is one that breathes life into the growing e-mobility movement. With some carsharing operators already providing e-cars, these services not only decrease the volume of vehicles on the road since there is less need for personal vehicles, but also allows for reallocating space in urban areas for public benefit.</p>



<p>Benefitting further from this movement is the integration of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">carsharing services with other sustainable transport options</a> such as public transport, walking, biking, etc. By combining all options, this creates a more ecological way of living and a more <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">convenient</a> and flexible way for people to travel. But in order for this initiative to be successful, operators and cities must work together and invest in the necessary infrastructure.</p>



 IDV—the key to your transport services. 



<p>IDnow jumps on the train here as an important key in this necessary infrastructure. As regulations increase within major cities, safety requirements are implemented and theft rises, operators realize the importance of identifying their customers before allowing them to use their services. From age and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">digital signatures</a>, our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification solution</a> allow operators to verify their users within seconds.</p>



<p>We drive trust, not frustration, with our services, providing a safe and secure experience for mobility operators and their customers. With fast, 24/7 remote onboarding, transport services can offer their users a frictionless and convenient way to travel while operators can rest-assured that they are meeting regulatory needs and fighting fraud upfront with our use of biometrics.</p>



<p>Thanks to our wide range of document coverage (types of documents and origin) with up to 99% acceptance rate globally as well as a choice of automated or even <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led verification services</a>, operators can scale with confidence.</p>



<p>Tap into document and biometric verification for seamless mobility experiences.</p>

Verida Announces 200M VDA Token Long-Term Reward&nbsp;Program<p>Check the <a href="https://community.verida.io/verida-token-vda/airdrops-faq">Airdrops FAQ</a> for additional information on the Verida Airdrop&nbsp;program.</p><p>The Verida Foundation is preparing for its upcoming TGE and its related multi-tiered airdrop program. This program is intended to reward early adopters to the network and encourage newcomers to discover Verida’s features and capabilities. Both short and long-term incentives are on offer for participants. Read the previous announcements regarding these programs on <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-announces-inaugural-early-adopters-airdrop-f1e42399fe91">March 28th</a> and <a href="https://news.verida.io/embark-on-the-journey-to-vda-token-launch-campaign-on-galxe-a1ae18f9bf79">April&nbsp;18th</a>.</p><p>As part of this campaign, Verida is sharing more information on its planned long-term rewards and incentive programs, including details on dedicated funding for those programs. The central element of Verida’s longer-term growth reward programs is a dedicated pool of 200 million VDA tokens, representing 20% of the overall VDA supply, that will be distributed over a multi-year period through several dedicated programs.</p> Network Growth Rewards Explained <p>As described in the <a href="https://verida.network/whitepaper">Verida Whitepaper</a>, <a href="https://www.verida.network/vda-token">Verida’s token economics</a> specifies that 20% of the overall token supply (200M tokens) will be allocated to Network Growth&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>The Verida Network Growth token pool will be distributed to end users and application developers to incentivize long-term network growth. These token distributions will focus on the following key&nbsp;areas:</p>  Connect your data: Earn tokens by pulling your personal data from web3 applications into your Verida&nbsp;identity  Connect a node: Earn tokens by operating infrastructure on the Verida&nbsp;Network  Connect a friend: Earn tokens by referring friends to join the Verida&nbsp;Network  Connect an app: Earn tokens by building a web3 application that leverages the Verida&nbsp;Network  <p>This Network Growth Rewards pool unlocks monthly over a multi-year period and will allow the foundation to maintain several long-term reward programs backed by more than three million monthly&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The Network Growth Rewards pool will support ongoing programs including; referral rewards, incentives for members to import additional datasets into Verida, and to connect with dApps built on Verida. Additional reward programs will continue to be developed, and are anticipated to be presented to the Verida community in the months following the token&nbsp;launch.</p> VDA Launch-Related Airdrop and Incentive Programs <p>In addition to the long-term reward allocations from the Network Growth Reward pool, the Verida Foundation has developed a series of targeted near-term airdrops and reward programs coinciding with the launch of the network and the listing of the VDA Storage Credit Token on several centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p><p>This multi-stage airdrop campaign will distribute a minimum of 5 million VDA tokens across a series of targeted reward programs. Although each individual airdrop event within the larger campaign is planned to reward specific activities within the network, it is also expected that many Verida supporters and early adopters will qualify for rewards from several, and in some cases potentially all, of the planned airdrops.</p><p>The Verida Foundation’s strategy of a number of multiple, smaller, targeted airdrops (including its <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-announces-inaugural-early-adopters-airdrop-f1e42399fe91">inaugural airdrop announced on March 28th</a>) is a deliberate effort to address the shortcomings that often impact hastily conceived airdrop programs, where an excessive portion of the dedicated token reward pool too often finds its way into the hands of casual users and airdrop farmers. Another announcement, from <a href="https://news.verida.io/embark-on-the-journey-to-vda-token-launch-campaign-on-galxe-a1ae18f9bf79">April 21</a> described the second installment of Verida’s planned airdrop campaign, also with a target program focused on a specific group of ecosystem followers.</p><p>By undertaking a series of carefully targeted rewards Verida believes it can increase the percentage of rewards distributed its many enthusiastic supporters. This increases the value of airdrop rewards for actual Verida users, and multiplies the support and incentives for active&nbsp;users.</p><p>Verida looks forward to sharing further announcements related to ongoing and planned community recognition and network growth rewards programs as final details of those programs are&nbsp;settled.</p><p>Stay tuned for more news on our TGE and listing process!

<p>Editor’s note: Thanks to our Customer Success Engineer, Thilina, for authoring this week’s post on the woes (and the solution!) for access management.</p>
<p>I used to sit next to the IT SysAdmin of a small but rapidly expanding organization.&nbsp; I love to people-watch, and one of the things I would see them do–always accompanied by grumbling– (I used to people-listen, too) was handling access requests.</p>
<p>One day after a particularly loud and animated grumble, I asked:</p>
<p>“An access request again hey? What is it this time?”</p>
<p>“Oi! Can’t get enough of my work, eh mate??” (They were British, so they said “Oi” not “Oy.”)</p>
<p>“But yes..it’s another access request for [they mentioned a sensitive system], and it’s the fifth one today – I swear if they ask again…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, the profanity stopped, and I understood why it was so upsetting.</p>
 
 The company had a list of applications that required access to be granted (or revoked) in a recorded and auditable way. Auditable is key here. 
 My Admin friend was the admin of all the applications because managing them required tech skills. But the admin was not always not the “owner” or “approver,” the key decision maker who is supposed to vet requests. 
 As a result, when someone wanted access, the admin couldn’t just grant it. They had to pass the request (via email or chat message) to the approver. 
 And then wait. And sometimes, wait. And then wait some more. And nag the approver. And get nagged by the user. 
 And when you get the approval back, they needed to record it to make sure the spreadsheets were up to date for that quarterly compliance nonsense. 
 No fun! 
 
<p>It is the second decade of the 21st century, and people are still doing this. There’s got to be a better way.</p>
<p>And with YeshID – there is!</p>
 1. Enter Your Applications &amp; Their Owners 
<p>With YeshID you can add your applications and specify the application administrators – the owners or approvers I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>When someone wants access or is onboarded or offboarded, or there’s any other activity that concerns the owner’s applications, YeshID notifies them. This means less shoulder tapping on the admin and notifications going to the right place at the right time. And there’s an audit trail for compliance.</p>
<p>To get started quickly with your applications, YeshID provides two ways to add the admin (and login URL):</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have a lot of apps that you’d like to get imported into YeshID, you can use a CSV file that has your list of apps and their owners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And upload them to YeshID to quickly import your applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or you can enter them one by one or edit them this way:</p>
<p></p>
 2. Update the Access Grid for your Apps 
<p>Once your applications are added, you can check out the Access Grid to see the current record of app-to-user memberships.</p>
<p>From here, you can go in and quickly check off boxes to mark which users already have access to which apps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An even quicker way to update an app’s access, especially if you have many users, is to import a CSV of users per app.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you click into an app, you can import a CSV of email addresses and Yesh will take care of the rest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>YeshID will finish by showing you the differences so you can review the changes being made.</p>
<p></p>
 3. Let your Users and App Owners take care of their own Access Requests. 
<p>Now, since you’ve already done the hard work of:</p>
 
 Letting YeshID know of your Apps; and 
 Updating the access for your Apps 
 
<p>You and your users are now able to do the following:</p>
 My-Applications 
<p>Since YeshID is integrated into your Google Workspace, any of your users can navigate to <a href="http://app.yeshid.com/my-applications">app.yeshid.com/my-applications</a> where they will see a grid of applications they already have access to. (No more wondering: “Wait, which URL was it again?”)</p>
<p></p>
 Request Access 
<p>Now, when one of your users requires access to one of your organization’s apps, they can navigate to “All Managed Apps” and Request Access to their app of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can fill in details to provide reasons for their request.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After they submit the request, YeshID will notify the Application Owner about a pending request.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re an Application Owner, you’ll be notified with a link to a page where you can see the request and choose to either Confirm or Reject.</p>
<p>If you confirm, YeshID will generate a task will be generated for the admin, and once granted, the user will see the newly granted application the next time they click on their My-Applications grid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And just like that, a world of shoulder tapping, lost conversations, and requests falling off the side of a desk is avoided through the use of smart technology and engineering by your friends at YeshID.</p>
 4. Use Yesh to Ace your Access Audits 
<p>With YeshID ingrained into your employee lifecycle, audits and Quarterly Access Reviews (QAR’s) become a breeze.</p>
<p>Simply go to your Access Grid and click on “Download Quarterly Report,” which will produce a spreadsheet created for access audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Review the details (there’s a sheet per app!), fill in any additional comments, and just like that – your Quarterly Access Review is done.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Ready to reclaim your sanity? By automating access requests and approvals, YeshID empowers admins and users. Users gain self-service access requests, and admins are freed from the time-consuming manual process of nagging app owers and updating spreadsheets.</p>

<p></p>
<p>When blockchain technology was first introduced a decade and a half ago, it made the possibility of a decentralized web seem viable to a mass audience. Since then, blockchains have proven themselves to be a poor solution to the majority of data storage problems outside of bearer assets - i.e. Bitcoin - because blockchains grow continuously without any ability to delete data, which just doesn’t make sense for things like personal data. But ‘blockchain’ isn’t synonymous with decentralization, and just because a blockchain isn’t the best solution for personal data storage doesn’t mean your app can’t be decentralized.</p>
<p>There are two common problems when trying to port a traditional centralized application over to the blockchain: data efficiency and data custody. In this post we’ll discuss why those two problems are blockers for most applications, and how Web5 components allow developers to build performant decentralized applications in a way that wasn't possible before.</p>
 Where Blockchain Doesn’t Fit<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#where-blockchain-doesnt-fit" title="Direct link to Where Blockchain Doesn’t Fit">​</a> 
 Data Storage &amp; Efficiency<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#data-storage--efficiency" title="Direct link to Data Storage &amp; Efficiency">​</a> 
<p>It’s possible to make the argument that data such as GIS coordinates, historical data, or widely-used and immutable data are good candidates to be stored on the blockchain because there’s no need for deletion and a requirement for complete history. While blockchain isn’t the only storage method that meets the needs of these systems, those systems are the ones best suited to utilize blockchain. Despite that fact that those data are good candidates for blockchain, however, does not mean that blockchain is the best data storage solution for that data.</p>
<p>However, blockchains are continuous ledgers of data that provide the benefit of immutability at the cost of storage inefficiency, which means that they aren’t great for storing large amounts of data or data sets in which there are large subsections of trivial or ignorable data. Firstly, their read times are slower than traditional data storage because the entire blockchain needs to be traversed for a read, and write times require settlement onto the blockchain which is out of an individual’s hands. As a result, the cost per transaction will likely be significantly higher on the blockchain when compared to traditional data storage, and that cost can grow over time.</p>
<p>Imagine an on-chain photo storage app that allows for users to encrypt their data. While this framework would technically allow for the replacement of large-scale cloud-based photo services that are run by centralized corporations, the end user experience would be tarnished by much slower speeds than what users have come to expect. That’s because blockchains are designed to store an immutable ledger of transactions (in this case uploads of photos), and knowing what photos belong to who would involve traversing the entirety of the blockchain. Queries to this kind of data storage are slow and expensive, as would be the proof-of-work or other verification method needed to add new blocks to the chain. As a result, while a photo sharing app, or any app that requires storage of large files, is theoretically possible on-chain, it isn’t very scalable or performant.</p>
 Data Custody<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#data-custody" title="Direct link to Data Custody">​</a> 
<p>A key tenant to the decentralized web is the idea of custody, or data ownership. Custody, or the ability to hold an asset in which only you have full access to it, breaks down into a handful of concerns including:</p>
 
 Physical storage ownership 
 Deletion prevention 
 Censorship resistance 
 Speed of use 
 Data interoperability 
 
<p>A truly decentralized web makes it easy for each user to custody their own data, regardless of their reasoning for doing so. No matter a customer’s “why,” however, custody isn’t simply a matter of personal beliefs - it’s a feature that enables better user experience.</p>
<p>With blockchain technology, wallets don’t actually store your data - instead they address to your data on the blockchain via the public/private keys they hold and represent. This means, for example, that a crypto wallet doesn’t actually “store” your Bitcoins; it’s an address that is used as the identifier on transactions recorded on-chain, which can then be used to determine your wallet’s Bitcoin holdings.</p>
<p>In order to take custody of your on-chain data then you would need to run your own node on the blockchain network in question, which may not be a good solution for the average consumer. Additionally, in order to host a wallet that is available on all of your devices, that wallet will likely be hosted on a centralized third party’s servers.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while the issues of wallet storage and running nodes aren’t unsolvable problems, they are inherently outside of the definitions of what a typical blockchain wallet does today.</p>
 Building With Web5<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#building-with-web5" title="Direct link to Building With Web5">​</a> 
<p>Bearing in mind the limitations of custody and efficiency, it becomes clear that not a lot of data makes sense to be stored on-chain. However, just because you might not want to store important, large data like photos, or small, unimportant data like favicon history on-chain doesn’t mean that it isn’t possible to store that data in a decentralized way that offers custody and efficiency.</p>
<p>Key Web5 technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in supplement or in place of blockchain provide a framework for an internet that is both decentralized AND solves the issues we’ve discussed that blockchain alone can’t solve. It’s important to note that while the integration of these technologies with existing blockchain ecosystems isn’t unheard of, they are able to solve the issues with blockchain discussed above. Cumulatively, they offer a way to efficiently address data, store and replicate data in a decentralized manner, and maintain identity.</p>
 Custody<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#custody" title="Direct link to Custody">​</a> 
<p>A purely blockchain-focused wallet, as discussed previously, is simply a key pairing with an address that references ownership over transactions on the blockchain but doesn’t actually manage local or cloud storage. This means that any on-chain data, while decentralized, isn’t user-custodied unless they set up a node on the network in which they’re participating, which is something that in a blockchain context should happen in a separate app from the wallet.</p>
<p>In Web5, however, wallets are addressed via DIDs and are able to store data via DWeb Nodes - which can live on device and replicate storage remotely - rather than relying on storing everything on-chain or on the wallet developer’s cloud storage option. Because Web5 wallets are more robust than simply a wallet that connects to a blockchain, your Web5 wallet could theoretically manage running a blockchain node for you in addition to performing more standard “wallet” tasks like you might expect.</p>
<p>Additionally, because DWNs are able to replicate data across instances on different devices, it makes for self-custodying your data across devices much easier than with a blockchain wallet. While blockchain wallets require re-creating the private key pairings on another device and can pose a security risk, DIDs also offer ways to easily and securely port your DID between devices to replicate data and maintain a consistent user experience. You can imagine how great this is in the case of a photo storage app that is backed by a DWN that replicates data across your devices and makes sign-in on those devices easy!</p>
<p>While blockchain wallets and Web5 wallets aren’t mutually exclusive - Web5 wallets can very well interact with blockchains and blockchain wallets may use concepts like DIDs and VCs -, what matters is that when users take advantage of wallet apps using DIDs, DWNs, and VCs, they can self-custody all their off-chain data and even their on-chain data should they be able to run a node locally.</p>
 File Storage<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#file-storage" title="Direct link to File Storage">​</a> 
<p>Ledgers like the blockchain don’t make for performant databases in a lot of use cases, which is why DWNs are a breakthrough in combining decentralized web technologies with centralized web performance. While blockchains require ledger consensus and redundant storage to hold any type of data, DWNs are replicable nodes that can run any of the traditionally performant database technologies you’re used to - think SQL, MongoDB, etc. - without being tied to a centralized server.</p>
<p>As mentioned in our discussion about custody, you could run a DWN on your laptop, your phone, on your own server, or on rented server space from a cloud provider, and all of them can be synchronized to provide the kind of redundancy that we love about blockchain. As a result, DWNs are able to solve the problems of large file storage and off-chain storage.</p>
 Final Thoughts<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#final-thoughts" title="Direct link to Final Thoughts">​</a> 
<p>A performant decentralized web that offers users custody of their own data has been a tantalizing dream for almost two decades, but in that same timeframe blockchain technology has proven to not be the way to make that vision a reality. If you find yourself or your customers valuing decentralization, privacy, flexibility, and self-custodial apps, then Web5 provides the framework to achieve exactly those goals. Your Web5 app may very well leverage blockchain technology - a participating financial institution on the the tbDEX protocol we’re developing is a great example of an app that uses Web5 tech to connect to blockchains, but there are lots of ways to build dApps with Web5.</p>

<p>The recent ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a major healthcare technology company, has once again highlighted the critical importance of robust identity verification and authentication measures in safeguarding sensitive data and systems. While the details of the attack are still unfolding, the preliminary investigation has revealed that the root cause was the absence of multi-factor authentication on a remote access application used by Change Healthcare’s staff.</p>
<p>This lapse in security best practices allowed cybercriminals to compromise employee credentials and gain unauthorized access to the company’s networks. The attackers then spent nine days lurking within the systems before launching the ransomware attack, which disrupted critical healthcare services across the United States. To be fair, it is hard to say if properly implemented MFA would have even helped as bad actors are getting increasingly good at attacks like SIM Swapping, social engineering, stealing OTPs, etc. and these attacks have seen a dramatic increases in the last few years.</p>
<p>The Change Healthcare incident is a sobering reminder that even large, well-established organizations can fall victim to cyber threats when they fail to implement the necessary identity and access controls. In an era where remote work and cloud-based services have become the norm, the attack surface for malicious actors has expanded significantly, making it crucial for organizations to re-evaluate their security posture and adopt robust identity management solutions.</p>
<p>This is where the 1Kosmos platform can play a pivotal role in preventing similar breaches. Our solution offers a comprehensive approach to identity verification and authentication, addressing the key vulnerabilities that were exploited in the Change Healthcare attack.</p>
 Robust Identity Proofing 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform provides a secure and frictionless way to verify user identities, ensuring that only legitimate individuals can access sensitive systems and data. Our identity proofing capabilities, which are certified to NIST 800-63-3 and other industry standards, can detect and prevent the use of stolen or synthetic identities, a common tactic employed by cybercriminals.</p>
 Passwordless Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p>The absence of multi-factor authentication was a critical factor in the Change Healthcare breach. The 1Kosmos platform offers a range of passwordless authentication methods, including biometrics, push notifications, and hardware tokens, to provide a robust and user-friendly way to verify user identities and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
 Decentralized Identity Management 
<p>Unlike traditional identity management systems, the 1Kosmos platform leverages a private, permissioned blockchain to store and manage user identities. This decentralized approach eliminates the risk of a centralized “honeypot” of information that can be targeted by hackers, as seen in the Change Healthcare incident.</p>
 Audit Trail and Compliance 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform maintains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all identity-related events, including login attempts, access requests, and data sharing activities. This level of visibility and transparency not only helps organizations detect and respond to security incidents but also ensures compliance with industry regulations and standards.</p>
 Benefits of a Single Authentication Platform 
<p>The lessons learned from the Change Healthcare ransomware attack serve as a stark reminder that even the most well-established organizations are vulnerable to cyber threats when they fail to prioritize identity and access management. By adopting a comprehensive identity management solution like the 1Kosmos platform, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of similar breaches and ensure the security and integrity of their sensitive data and systems.</p>

<p>According to proprietary verification data from Onfido (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/entrust-completes-acquisition-of-onfido">now a part of Entrust</a>), <a href="https://onfido.com/press-release/onfido-launches-first-fraud-lab-as-deepfakes-increase/">deepfakes rose 3000%</a> from 2022 to 2023. And with the increasing availability of deepfake software and improvements in AI, the scale and sophistication of these attacks are expected to further intensify. As it becomes more difficult to discern legitimate identities from deepfakes, AI-enabled biometrics can offer consumers, citizens, and organizations some much-needed protection from bad actors, while also improving overall convenience and experience. Indeed, AI-enabled biometrics has ushered in a new era for verification and authentication. So, with such promise, why is biometrics such a flash point in AI regulatory discussions?</p>
<p>Like the proverb that warns “the road to Hell is paved with good intentions,” the unchecked development and use of AI-enabled biometrics may have unintended – even Orwellian – consequences. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has warned that the use of AI-enabled biometrics comes with significant privacy and data concerns, along with the potential for increased bias and discrimination. The unchecked use of biometric data by law enforcement and other government agencies could also infringe on civil rights. In some countries, AI and biometrics are already being used for mass surveillance and predictive policing, which should alarm any citizen.</p>
<p>The very existence of mass databases of biometric data is sure to attract the attention of all types of malicious actors, including nation-state attackers. In a critical election year with close to half the world’s population headed to the polls, biometric data is already being used to create deepfake video and audio recordings of political candidates, swaying voters and threatening the democratic process. To help defend against these and other concerns, the pending <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19015/artificial-intelligence-act-meps-adopt-landmark-law#:~:text=The%20new%20rules%20ban%20certain,to%20create%20facial%20recognition%20databases.">EU Artificial Intelligence Act</a> has banned certain AI applications, including biometric categorization and identification systems based on sensitive characteristics and the untargeted scraping of facial images from the web or CCTV footage.</p>
<p>The onus is on us … all of us</p>
<p>Legal obligations aside, biometric solution vendors and users have a duty of care to humanity to help promote the responsible development and use of AI. Crucial is the maintenance of transparency and consent in the collection and use of biometric data at all times. The use of diverse training data for AI models and regular audits to help mitigate the risk of unconscious bias are also vital safeguards. Still another is to adopt a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy for the collection, storage, use, and transmission of biometric data. After all, you can’t replace your palm print or facial ID like you could a compromised credit card.

  <p>Hello friends,  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m pleased to announce General Availability (GA) of the organizational branding role for Microsoft Entra ID company branding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new role is part of our ongoing efforts to implement Zero Trust network access by enforcing the principle of least privilege for users when customizing their authentication user experience (UX) via Entra ID company branding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, users wanting to configure Entra ID company branding required the Global Admin role. This role, though, has sweeping privileges beyond what’s necessary for configuring Entra ID company branding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new organizational branding role limits its privileges to the configuration of Entra ID company branding, significantly improving security and reducing the attack surface associated with its configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assign the role to a user, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Log on to Microsoft Entra ID and select Users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Select and open the user to assign the organizational branding role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Select Assigned roles and then Add assignments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Select the Organizational Branding Administrator role and assign it to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the settings are applied, the user will be able to configure the authentication UX via Entra ID Company Branding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Below are my personal highlights from the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> #38, which took place between April 16th and April 18th at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.</p>
 <br>
#1 – Yet another new DID Method? 
 <p>Image courtesy of James Monaghan</p> 
<p>On day one, I participated in a session hosted by Stephen Curran from the BC government, where we discussed the new DID method they’ve been working on: <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/trustdidweb">did:tdw</a>. </p>
<p>It’s essentially an extension of did:web, drawing on learnings from the Trust over IP did:webs initiative but simplifying it by removing some of the components.</p>
<p>One of the interesting aspects is their ability to incorporate historicity of DID Documents without relying on ledgers. They’ve also developed a linked verifiable presentation (i.e. when I resolve the DID I can get a proof), pre-rotation capability, and portability, which are crucial features for real business applications of DID Web.</p>
<p>They view this method as particularly suitable for public organizations and have indicated that similar implementations could be applied to other DID methods. They already have some running code for this, which is promising.</p>
<p>This session was significant for us because these business features are essential as we deploy DIDs in production with our customers. It also reinforced how our work on <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-carter-high-assurance-dids-with-dns-03.html">High Assurance DID with DNS</a> complements theirs, adding an extra layer of security and integrity. I’m excited about the potential of a proof of concept where we can see both the TDW and the High Assurance DID Web in action together.<br>
</p>
 <br>
#2 – Bootstrapping DIDComm connections through OpenID4VC flows 
<p>I attended a session by Sam Curren who represented some recent <a href="https://github.com/IDUnion/OpenIDIDComm">work done by IDUnion</a> to demonstrate how a DIDComm connection could be bootstrapped through an OpenID4VC flow, in a very light touch manner.</p>
<p>By leveraging OAuth 2.0 authentication in these flows, they’ve developed a method to pass a DIDComm connection request seamlessly. This is particularly interesting because the European Union has decided to use OpenID for verifiable credentials in issuing high assurance government digital credentials, leading to widespread adoption.</p>
<p>However, OpenID for verifiable credentials has limitations that DIDComm can address. DIDComm serves as a bilateral messaging platform between entities, enabling tasks like credential revocation notices that OpenID for verifiable credentials cannot handle. DIDComm also offers greater flexibility and modularity, allowing for secure messaging and interaction with various protocols.</p>
<p>IDUnion in Germany aims to leverage the OpenID for VC specification to establish DIDComm connections between issuers and holders, enabling a broader range of functionalities. They have running code and a demo for this, which we plan to implement at Northern Block in the near future.</p>
<p>The work is under discussion for transfer to the DIF for further work.</p>
<p>I also found out about where to get <a href="https://didcomm.myspreadshop.com/">DIDComm swag</a>!</p>
 <br>
#3 – Apple and Google’s Cross Platform Demo of Digital Credential API 
<p></p>
<p>In the first session of day two, representatives from both Apple and Google held a demo to showcase interoperability between Apple Wallet and Google Wallet with a browser, drawing a large crowd. Demonstrations by major platform players like these always mark significant progress in where we are in the adoption cycle of a new industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main takeaway is that their demonstration questions the value of third-party wallets. The trend is that government-issued high-assurance citizen credentials are increasingly issued into government-based wallets, both in North America and Europe. While government-provided wallets may be the norm for high-assurance government-issued credentials, for other types of identity credentials, direct exchange from the device via a third-party application seems to offer the best user experience. This raises questions about the future role of vendor wallets, particularly for personal use or specific utility-focused applications.</p>
 <br>
#4 – Content Authenticity 201: Identity Assertion Technical Working&nbsp; 
<p>Content authenticity is a pressing real-world issue, especially with the rise of generative AI, which blurs the lines between human-generated and machine-generated content. This challenge has been exacerbated by the difficulty in tracing the origin of content, leading to concerns about integrity, manipulation, and misinformation. The Content Authenticity Initiative aims to address this problem by bringing together industry partners, including hardware and software providers, as well as media outlets, to establish standards for tagging media. Led by Eric Scouten, founder of the initiative from Adobe, they have successfully developed a standard for tagging media. However, questions remain regarding how to manage identity behind content, which varies depending on the type of content creator involved. Whether it’s media outlets or individual creators, maintaining integrity in the provenance of media assets requires trust in the identity process. Discussions around creator assertions and identity management are ongoing, with active participation encouraged through the initiative’s working group discussions. For those interested, here’s a link to a <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/content-authenticity-combating-deepfakes-misinformation-and-fraud/">podcast</a> where Eric Scouten and I discuss these topics, as well as a link to the Creator Assertions Working Group homepage (<a href="https://creator-assertions.github.io/">here</a>) for further engagement.</p>
 <br>
#5 – Trust Registry FACE OFF!!&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>I co-hosted a session with Sam Curren, Andor Kesselman, and Alex Tweeddale on trust registries. The aim was to explore various projects in this space and identify opportunities for convergence or accelerated development. The conversation began with an overview of how X.509 certificates are currently used on the web to establish trust in secure connections. I then introduced Northern Block’s trust registry solution, which offers features to enhance integrity in the trust registry process (<a href="https://trustregistry.nborbit.ca/">https://trustregistry.nborbit.ca/</a>).</p>
<p>We then delved into different standards:</p>
 
 <a href="https://hub.ebsi.eu/get-started/design/trust-chain">EBSI Trust Chains</a>: This standard tracks “Verifiable Accreditations” and is used by cheqd. It involves a governing authority for the ecosystem with a DID on a blockchain, tracking DIDs authorized for specific actions. 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/">Trust over IP Trust Registry Protocol v2</a>: Version 2 is under implementor’s review as of April 2024. It offers a RESTful API with a query API standardizing how to query which entities are authorized to do what in which context. 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>: This standard, particularly OpenID Federation 1.0, is already used in systems worldwide, including university networks and Brazil’s open banking. It allows each entity to provide trust lists, including common trust anchors with other lists. 
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-trust-establishment/">Credential Trust Establishment 1.0</a>: This standard, part of the DIF Trust Establishment specification, is a data model rather than a protocol or interaction model. It involves creating a document and hosting it behind a URI, with no centralization. It allows roles for each participant and is complementary to VC-based decentralized trust. 
 
<p>The session was dynamic, with significant interest, especially regarding roots of trusts, a topic gaining traction at the Internet Identity Workshop. We’re excited about our ongoing work in this field.</p>
 <br>
#6 – High-Assurance did:web Using DNS 
<p>I hosted a session to showcase our work with the High Assurance did:web using DNS. Jesse Carter from CIRA and Tim Bouma from the Digital Governance Council of Canada joined me in the presentation.</p>
<p>We demonstrated to the group that, without new standards or specifications, but simply by leveraging existing internet infrastructure, we could significantly enhance the assurance behind a decentralized identifier.</p>
<p>The feedback we received was positive, and all of our presentations so far have been well-received. We believe that organizations with robust operational practices around DNS infrastructure can integrate the security and integrity of DNS into decentralized identifiers effectively. This approach should align well with the planned proof-of-concept using the HA DID Spec in conjunction with did:tdw’s verifiable presentation feature, offering both technical and human trust in one process.</p>

<p>#7 – AnonCreds in W3C VCDM Format</p> 
<p>I attended an engaging session led by Stephen Curran from the British Columbia government, discussing their project to align AnonCreds credentials with the W3C verifiable credential data model standard. It was insightful to learn about British Columbia’s commitment to preserving privacy by leveraging AnonCreds, particularly highlighting the unlinkability feature that prevents the generation of super cookies. While acknowledging concerns about potential correlation of unique identifiers in other digital identity programs globally, Stephen addressed market friction from those seeking W3C-aligned verifiable credentials. He outlined the innovative steps taken to ensure compatibility, including leveraging their procurement program to fund multiple companies for various aspects of the project, including implementations. Once again, the British Columbia Government showcased remarkable innovation in the Digital Trust space.</p>

<p>#8 – A Bridge to the Future: Connecting X.509 and DIDs/VIDs</p> 
 <p>Diagram with X.509 and DID/VC comparison</p> 
<p>I participated in a great discussion about the potential connection between X.509 certificates and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Drummond Reed provided an exceptional overview of what DIDs entail, offering the clearest explanation I’ve encountered. The genesis of this discussion stemmed from the Content Authenticity Initiative’s endeavour to establish a trust infrastructure for content providers, with a notable push for X.509 certificates due to existing investments by large enterprises. We delved into how X.509 certificates are utilized by organizations like the CA/Browser Forum and browsers, as well as their role in trust registries. However, a fundamental distinction emerged between the two: X.509 certificates are intricately woven into a governance process with a one-to-one correspondence, while DIDs can be self-asserted and are not necessarily tied to specific governance structures. This contrast prompted exploration into leveraging current X.509 processes to facilitate linkage with DIDs, enabling broader utility within the same context. Overall, the discussion shed light on the interconnectedness of roots of trust, trust registries, and the evolving landscape of digital trust.</p>

<p>#9 – State of eIDAS&nbsp; + German eIDAS Wallet Challenge</p> 
 <p>Screenshot taken from deck linked below</p> 
<p>In my final session of note before heading to the airport on day three, we engaged in a discussion regarding the state of eIDAS, alongside updates on Germany’s eIDAS wallet consultation project and challenge. While the discussion didn’t introduce anything particularly groundbreaking, the notable turnout underscored the widespread interest in developments within the European digital identity landscape. Throughout IIW, numerous sessions delved into the technical specifications mandated by the European Union’s architectural reference framework to align with eIDAS 2.0. For those interested, I’ve participated in several podcasts covering this topic (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">1</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet-part-2/">2</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas-2-0-predicting-its-impact-on-various-ecosystems-with-dominik-beron/">3</a>). The ongoing momentum surrounding eIDAS 2.0 promises to be a focal point in future IIWs.</p>

The previous two, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/finema-official_vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-activity-7149006651126075392-mRZ_">vLEI Demystified Part 1: Comprehensive Overview</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-2-identity-verification-519102614b8e">vLEI Demystified Part 2: Identity Verification</a>, have explained the foundation of the pioneering verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) ecosystem as well as its robust Identity Verification procedures. In this part, we will share with you our journey through the Qualification of vLEI Issuers, called Qualified vLEI Issuers (QVIs), including the requirements and obligations that QVIs have to fulfill once they are authorized by GLEIF to perform their roles in the ecosystem.</p><p>The Qualification of vLEI Issuers is the evaluation process conducted by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) to assess the suitability of organizations aspiring to serve as Qualified vLEI Issuers within the vLEI ecosystem. GLEIF has established the Qualification Program for all interested organizations, which can either be the current LEI Issuers (Local Operating Units: LOUs) or new business partners who wish to explore the emerging vLEI ecosystem. The organizations that complete the Qualification Program under the GLEIF vLEI Ecosystem Framework (EGF) are authorized to perform verification, issuance, and revocation of vLEI credentials to legal entities seeking the credentials and also their representatives.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nguyendhn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Nguyen Dang Hoang Nhu</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Step 1: Start the Qualification Program <p>To kick start the qualification process, the organizations interested in becoming QVIs must first review <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">Appendix 2: vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Manual</a>, which provides an overview of the required Qualification Program, and the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (vLEI EGF) to make sure that they understand how to incorporate the requirements outlined in the framework to their operations. Once they have decided to proceed, the interested organizations may initiate the Qualification Program by sending an email to <a href="mailto:qualificationrequest@gleif.org">qualificationrequest@gleif.org</a> along with a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) signed by an authorized signatory of the interested organization.</p><p>Unless GLEIF has a mean to verify the signatory’s authority by themselves, the interested organization may be required to submit proof of the signatory’s authority. In the case where the NDA signer’s authority is delegated, the power of attorney may also be required.</p><p>After GLEIF reviews the qualification request, they will countersign the NDA and organize an introductory meeting with the interested organization, now called a candidate vLEI issuer, to discuss the next step of the Qualification Program.</p> Step 2: Implement the Qualification Program Requirements <p>To evaluate if a candidate vLEI issuer has both the financial and technical capabilities to perform the QVI role, the candidate vLEI issuer is required to implement the Qualification Program Requirements, which consist of business and technical qualifications. Throughout this process, the candidate vLEI issuer may schedule up to two meetings with GLEIF to clarify program issues and requirements.</p> Complete the Qualification Program Checklist <p>A candidate vLEI issuer is required to complete <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">Appendix 3: vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Checklist</a> to demonstrate that they are capable of actively participating in the vLEI ecosystem as well as being in good financial standing. The checklist and supporting documents can be submitted via online portals provided by&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>The Qualification Program Checklist is divided into 12 sections from Section A to Section L. The first five sections (Section A to Section E) focus mainly on the business aspects while the last seven sections (Section F to Section L) cover the technical specifications and relevant policies for operating the vLEI issuer Services.</p><blockquote>Note: vLEI Issuer Services are all of the services related to the issuance, management, and revocation of vLEI credentials provided by the&nbsp;QVI.</blockquote><p>Section A: Contact&nbsp;Details:</p><p>This section requires submission of the candidate vLEI issuer’s general information as well as contact details of the key persons involved in the vLEI operation project, namely: (1) Internal Project Manager, (2) Designated Authorized Representative (DAR), (3) Key Contact Operations, and (4) Key Contact&nbsp;Finance</p><p>Section B: Entity Structure</p><p>This section requires submission of the candidate vLEI issuer’s organization structure, regulatory internal and external audit reports, operational frameworks, and any third-party consultants that the candidate vLEI issuer has engaged with regarding their business and technological evaluation.</p><p>Section C: Organization Structure</p><p>This section requires submission of the current organization chart for all vLEI operations and a complete list of all relevant third-party service providers that support the vLEI operations.</p><p>Section D: Financial Data, Audits &amp; General Governance</p><p>This section requires submission of financial and operational conditions of the candidate vLEI issuer’s business, including:</p>  Audited financial statements for the prior&nbsp;year  Financial auditor&nbsp;reports  Formal vLEI Issuer Operation Budget  <p>Section E: Pricing&nbsp;Model</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer outlines their strategy to generate revenue from the vLEI operations and ensure that they are committed to managing the funding and monetization of the services they plan to offer. This includes the pricing model and business plan regarding the vLEI issuer&nbsp;services</p><p>Section F: vLEI Issuer&nbsp;Services</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer shall outline their detailed plans and processes related to the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials, including:</p>  Processes for receiving payments from legal entity (LE)&nbsp;clients.  Processes for identity verification in accordance with the vLEI&nbsp;EGF.  Processes for validating the legal identity of official organization role (OOR) persons as well as using GLEIF API to choose the correct OOR&nbsp;code.  Processes for calling the vLEI Reporting API for each issuance of LE and OOR vLEI credentials  Processes for verifying the statuses of legal entity clients’ LEI. The clients must be notified 30 days before their LEI&nbsp;expires.  Processes for revoking all vLEIs issued to the legal entity client whose LEI has&nbsp;lapsed  Processes for monitoring compliance with the Service Level Agreement (Appendix 5)  Processes for monitoring witnesses for erroneous or malicious activities  <p>Section G: Records Management</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer provides their internal Records Management Policy that defines the responsibilities of the personnel related to records retention to ensure that the records management processes are documented, communicated, and supervised.</p><p>Section H: Website Requirements</p><p>In this section, the candidate QVI’s websites are required to display the following items:</p>  QVI Trustmark  Applications, contracts, and required documents for legal entities to apply for vLEI credentials.  <p>Section I:&nbsp;Software</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer provides their internal policy for the Service Management Process including:</p>  Processes for installing, testing, and approving new&nbsp;software  Processes for identifying, tracking, and correcting software errors/bugs  Processes for managing cryptographic keys  Processes for recovering from compromise  <p>The candidate vLEI issuer must also specify their policies and operations related to management for private keys and KERI witnesses as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Processes and policies for managing thresholded multi-signature scheme, where at least 2 out of 3 qualified vLEI issuer authorized representatives (QARs) are required to approve issuance or revocation of vLEI credentials  Processes for operating KERI witnesses, where at least 5 witnesses are required for the vLEI issuer&nbsp;services  <p>Section J: Networks and Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer describes their network architecture including KERI witnesses and the details of third-party cloud-based services as well as a process monitoring of the vLEI Issuer-related IT infrastructure. The candidate vLEI issuer must also provide the following internal policies:</p>  Disaster Recovery and/or Business Continuity Plan  Backup Policies and Practices  The vetting process for evaluating the reliability of third-party service providers  <p>Section K: Information Security</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer provides their internal Information Security Policy that includes, for example, formal governance, revision management, personnel training, physical access policies, incident reports, and remediation from security breaches.</p><p>Section L: Compliance</p><p>QVI candidates must declare that they will abide by the general and legal requirements as a vLEI Issuer&nbsp;by:</p>  Execute a vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement with&nbsp;GLEIF  Execute a formal contract, of which the template follows the Agreement requirements, with a Legal Entity before the issuance of a vLEI credential  Comply with the requirements for Qualification, vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework, and any other applicable legal requirements   Respond to Remediation (if&nbsp;any) <p>After the candidate vLEI issuer has submitted the qualification program checklist and supporting documents through online portals, GLEIF will review the submission and provide the review results and remediation requirements, if any. Subsequently, the candidate vLEI issuer must respond to the remediation requirements along with corresponding updates to their qualification program checklist and supporting documents.</p> Undergo Technical Qualification <p>After the qualification program checklist has been submitted, reviewed, and remediated, the candidate vLEI issuer then proceeds to the technical part of the qualification program. GLEIF and the candidate vLEI issuer then organize a dry run to test that the candidate vLEI issuer is capable&nbsp;of:</p>  Performing OOBI sessions and authentication  Generating and managing a multi-signature group&nbsp;AID  Issuing, verifying and revoking vLEI credentials  <p>The purpose of the dry run is to make sure that the candidate vLEI issuer has the technical capability to operate as a QVI as well as identify and fix any technical issue that may arise. A dry run may take multiple meeting sessions if required.</p><p>After the candidate vLEI issuer completes the dry run, they may proceed to the official technical qualification, which repeats the process during the dry run. vLEI credentials issued during the official session are official and may be used in the vLEI ecosystem.</p> Step 3: Sign the Qualification Agreement <p>Once the vLEI candidates have completed all of the business and technical qualification processes, GLEIF will notify the organization regarding the result of the Qualification Program. The approval of the qualification application will result in the candidate vLEI Issuer signing the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement</a> with GLEIF. The candidate vLEI Issuer will then officially become a&nbsp;QVI.</p> Beyond the Qualification Program <p>Once officially qualified, the QVI must ensure strict compliance with the vLEI EGF and the requirements that they completed in the Qualification Program Checklist. For example, their day-to-day operations must comply with <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">Appendix 5: Qualified vLEI Issuer Service Level Agreement (SLA)</a> as well as comply with their internal policies such as the Records Management Policy and Information Security Policy. They must also continuously monitor their services and IT infrastructure including the witnesses.</p> Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification <p>The QVI is also subject to the Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification by GLEIF to ensure that they continue to meet the requirements of the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework. If the QVI has made significant changes to their vLEI issuer services, IT infrastructure, or internal policies, the QVI must document the details of the changes and update corresponding supporting documentation. GLEIF will then review the changes and request for remediation actions, if&nbsp;any.</p> Conclusion <p>The processes of the QVI Qualification Program are designed to be extensively rigorous to ensure the trustworthiness of the vLEI ecosystems as QVIs play a vital role in maintaining trust and integrity among the downstream vLEI stakeholders. We at Finema are committed to promoting the vLEI ecosystem, and would be delighted to assist should you be interested in embarking on your journey to participate in the ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-3-qvi-qualification-program-59b4eba308f0">vLEI Demystified Part 3: QVI Qualification Program</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest installment in our ongoing series on Aergo’s strategic advancements and initiatives. In this edition, we’ll explore how Aergo is leveraging its unique features to address the evolving needs of enterprise clients, focusing specifically on its compatibility with the EVM and its structural design.</p><p>In a nutshell:</p><p>Aergo’s integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), alongside its hybrid architecture and tailored focus on enterprise requirements, establishes a strong foothold. Particularly attractive to enterprises in the financial sector, Aergo provides inventive ways to simplify blockchain implementation and operation, particularly for RWAs and&nbsp;STOs.</p> Rising Demand and&nbsp;EVM <p>Since 2018, Aergo and Blocko have implemented and sophisticated the idea of a decentralized physical infrastructure network for the customers based on the enterprise-focused blockchain platform, Aergo Enterprise. Various applications have emerged, ranging from shipment asset management to energy-related asset trading systems. These developments formed the foundation of what can be termed as today’s DePin(Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) model — a decentralized network driven by blockchain technology and incentives. Early implementations had limitations due to restricted participation and minimized token incentives as they were primarily tailored for consortia or affiliates.</p><p>However, Aergo stands out in its ability to engage in diverse projects with major domestic and international companies and public institutions. This is attributed to the need for a player in the market capable of delivering the level of service demanded by enterprise customers. As Ethereum leads the way in blockchain technological standards, demand arises for more adaptable enterprise blockchain solutions. Aergo’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides enterprises with a robust foundation for constructing decentralized solutions capable of revolutionizing multiple facets of their operations.</p><p>From asset management to financial transactions and data management, Aergo’s integration with the EVM opens doors to transformative possibilities. Furthermore, Aergo accommodates various sizes and industries with its hybrid architecture, gaining traction through EVM integration. Such hybrid structures are crucial in the enterprise market, where participant identity verification and safeguarding sensitive information are paramount. EVM integration holds significance for enterprise clients seeking to transition to web3, especially as private blockchains lose traction, and integration with public ecosystems gains prominence.</p> EVM and&nbsp;STOs <p>When integrating blockchain solutions into various financial projects, including Security Token Offerings (STOs) and Real World Assets (RWAs), project managers and decision-makers inevitably reference the performance and achievements of <a href="https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-defi-composability-an-introduction-to-money-legos">Ethereum-based DeFi models</a> along with other models built on the EVM. Utilizing open-sourced EVMs from various implementations becomes crucial for effectively meeting clients' needs. We have successfully built and operated multiple projects with Blocko, striving for implementations that recognize the demands and prioritize EVM features essential for enterprises. Simultaneously, our collaboration underscores our dedication to identifying these requirements and pursuing efficient implementations that prioritize the necessary EVM features for enterprise applications. The essential features offered by Aergo Enterprise include tokenization and asset backing, regulatory compliance, and secondary market trading capabilities.</p><p>Despite the recent hype surrounding them, DePin, RWAs, and STOs operate within the same business framework. The key takeaway is the necessity for a platform capable of representing a diverse range of assets through fractional ownership, tailored to various sectors and scales. Aergo’s commitment to enterprise market growth, driven by its hybrid structure and technical adaptability via EVM, positions it favorably. Collaborations with Blocko, including entry into the RWA and STO markets, underscore the ongoing development efforts, while initiatives like Booost expand its business and consumer reach based on geolocation services.</p><p>With STO-related regulations in Korea nearing finalization, we anticipate forthcoming news soon. Also, a detailed article on fee structure will be uploaded if they were any&nbsp;updates.</p>  For further information on Aergo’s emphasis on the enterprise blockchain market and its structure, please refer&nbsp;to:  <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2-0-a-decentralized-infrastructure-for-web3-4c1e63b597d">Aergo 2.0: A Decentralized Infrastructure for Web3</a></p>  For information on current fee structures and voting rewards, please refer to the articles listed&nbsp;below:    <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergos-fee-2-0-889861b7b247">Aergo’s Fee 2.0</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-network-voting-reward-28212d568fc9">Aergo Network Voting Reward</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-set-to-penetrate-enterprise-blockchain-market-with-its-hybrid-structure-and-evm-integration-c3dd51f660f5">Aergo Set to Penetrate Enterprise Blockchain Market with its Hybrid Structure and EVM Integration</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our Chief Architect, Steve McCown, recently compared two of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/08/17-industries-with-viable-use-cases-for-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity’s</a> leading governance models—trust registries (from <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> or ToIP) and trust establishment (from the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> or DIF)—and published his findings in our latest white paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skip straight to the white paper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2024/04/comparing-two-of-decentralized-identitys-leading-governance-models/">“Comparing Two of Decentralized Identity’s Leading Governance Models.”&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>We know that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a> (DI) as a new approach to <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">identity management</a> on the internet offers many <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-4-benefits-to-enterprises-from-proactively-adopting-decentralized-identity/">benefits</a> over traditional <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">centralized</a> systems, such as greater privacy, increased security, and better fault tolerance. It also offers a novel approach to system governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Steve describes in his comparison of the two leading government models, trust registries and trust establishment, is that while the two approaches appear to compete with each other, their features and capabilities actually make them rather serendipitous, and users may find them mutually beneficial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trust registry model from ToIP’s <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">Governance Stack Working Group</a> creates a governance framework that guides organizations in creating their own governance model more than specifying exactly what rules and descriptions a governance model must contain. In other words, it is a process for creating a governance model rather than a pre-existing governance model to be applied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Quite often, teams creating DI systems don’t know where to start when defining governance for their systems and the ToIP model is an excellent roadmap,” Steve says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While ToIP’s governance framework processes appear best suited for enterprise-level ecosystem efforts, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">trust establishment</a> (TE) processes that DIF is creating are intended to be much simpler. According to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">Trust Establishment 1.0 document</a>, “This specification describes only the data model of trust documents and is not opinionated on document integrity, format, publication, or discovery.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve says that rather than presenting a series of processes by which a governance framework can produce a governance model, the DIF specification provides a single “lightweight trust document” that produces a governance data model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the TE does not require a particular data format, it can be embodied in many formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In one instance, it can be used through an internet-accessible API as is specified for the ToIP trust registry/governance model solution. However, it is most commonly described as a cryptographically signed and JSON-formatted document that can be downloaded from a website, immutable data source, or a provider’s own service,” Steve says.&nbsp;</p>

 Generative AI (GenAI) represents a significant technological frontier, impacting cybersecurity landscapes in two primary ways. Its advanced capabilities enable malicious actors to craft sophisticated and convincing fraudulent schemes, from phishing attacks to synthetic audio and video content designed to deceive and exploit. Conversely, GenAI also powers robust fraud detection systems, generating synthetic data that mimics complex fraud scenarios and enhances organizational capabilities to identify and neutralize threats proactively. As businesses navigate the duality of GenAI, advancing cybersecurity measures and regulatory frameworks to harness its potential for good while mitigating risks is crucial. 







<p>The widespread availability and affordability of GenAI tools, combined with global macroeconomic instability, are key drivers behind the significant increase in the volume and velocity of fraud attacks targeting consumers and businesses. The rapid adoption of tools like ChatGPT and FraudGPT, accessible relatively cheaply, has facilitated their use in malicious activities such as creating malware and phishing attacks. This surge in fraudulent activities is further exacerbated by economic downturns, which increase financial pressures and lead to cuts in fraud detection resources within organizations. Recent statistics show a drastic increase in phishing incidents and overall fraud complaints, highlighting the growing challenge of GenAI-enabled fraud in an economically unstable environment.</p>



 Insights into the Impact of Generative AI and Related Fraud Attacks 



 
 <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note/articleshow/97542869.cms?from=mdr">ChatGPT adoption</a> surpassed 1 million users within 5 days of its launch, now boasting approximately 100 million weekly active users. 



 One-third of cybersecurity experts identified the increase in attack volume and velocity as a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/11/16/rethinking-the-framework-around-identity-security/?sh=1cb8ac0c2017">top GenAI-related threat.</a> 



 Malicious emails and credential phishing <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">volumes have increased</a> more than 12-fold and nearly tenfold in the past 18 months. 



 Fraud complaints rose from 847,000 in 2021 to 1.1 million in 2022, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3Report.pdf">escalating total losses</a> from $4.2 billion to $10.5 billion. 



 FraudGPT, a GenAI tool capable of generating malicious code and designing phishing pages, is available for as low as $90 monthly. 



 93% of financial institutions plan to <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/news-and-insights/blog/industry-perspectives-on-ai-and-transaction-fraud-detection/">invest in AI for fraud prevention</a> in the next 2-5 years 
 



 GenAI Market Trends and Challenges&nbsp; 



<p>GenAI’s dual nature significantly influences cybersecurity, with fraudsters using it to enhance their fraudulent schemes, including phishing and social engineering, by creating more convincing and sophisticated attacks. Tools like FraudGPT can write malicious code, generate malware, and create phishing pages, dramatically increasing phishing activities.</p>



<p>Solution providers are also adopting GenAI to strengthen defenses against such threats. Its ability to generate synthetic datasets allows for better training and improvement of risk and decision models, as evidenced by the growing demand among financial institutions planning substantial investments in AI for fraud prevention.</p>



<p>Despite its growing adoption, GenAI faces challenges like the unpredictable nature of new disruptive technologies, accessibility issues, a lack of regulatory oversight, and insufficient education and awareness about its capabilities and risks. These factors complicate the management of GenAI’s impact on fraud detection and prevention.</p>



 Strategies for Strengthening Defenses Against GenAI-driven Fraud 



<p>To effectively combat GenAI-driven fraud, businesses can adopt advanced AI and ML technologies for anomaly detection, implement device-bound authentication for added security, utilize multi-factor authentication to verify user identities, and apply behavioral analytics to monitor unusual activity. Continuous monitoring and regular updates of security measures are also essential to keep pace with evolving fraud tactics, ensuring robust protection even as regulations develop.

 What is GenAI? 



<p>Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can autonomously create new content such as audio, images, text, and videos. Unlike traditional AI, which follows strict rules or patterns for specific tasks, GenAI uses neural networks and deep learning to produce original content based on patterns in data it has learned. This capability is increasingly integrated into everyday applications. Still, it poses risks, such as enhancing the effectiveness of phishing and social engineering attacks by scammers exploiting GenAI to create convincingly fake communications.GenAI also offers tools for enhancing fraud prevention. It enables the creation of synthetic data samples that mimic real-life fraud scenarios, helping to train and improve fraud detection systems, thus preparing solution providers to better recognize and react to emerging fraudulent techniques.</p>

<p>The KILT team has completed all milestones of the Polkadot Treasury Grant for developing the Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP), and DIP is now ready for use. Using DIP, any chain can become an identity provider, and any parachain (and, in the future, external chains) can integrate KILT and / or other identity providers for their identity&nbsp;needs.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables a ground-breaking cross-chain decentralized identity system inspired by the functionality of OpenID. This means that parachains requiring an identity solution don’t need to build their own infrastructure. Instead, they can leverage the infrastructure DIP provides. DIP is open-source, and you can integrate it with existing Polkadot-compatible runtimes with minimal changes and without affecting the fee model of the relying&nbsp;party.</p> DIP Actors <p>DIP has three key roles: the identity provider, the relying party or consumer, and the&nbsp;user.</p><p>The identity provider is any blockchain with an identity system that makes it available for other chains, e.g., KILT Protocol, Litentry, etc.</p><p>The relying party or “consumer” is any blockchain that has chosen to delegate identity management to the provider, thus relieving it of needing to maintain its identity infrastructure.</p><p>The user is an entity with an identity on the provider chain and wants to use it on other chains without setting up a new identity on&nbsp;each.</p><p>The process begins with a user setting up their identity on an identity provider chain, for instance, KILT, by making a transaction. Once an identity completes that transaction, they can share that identity with any relying party chain that uses that provider, eliminating the need for further interaction with the identity provider unless changes are made to the user’s identity information.</p><p>Relying parties (e.g., parachains) can choose one or more identity providers. As in the case of accepting multiple social logins such as Google and Facebook, this allows them to access the information graph that each identity provider has previously built.</p> The Tech <p>DIP provides a suite of components available for integration:</p>  A set of pallets for deployment on any chain that wants to act as an identity provider. These allow accounts on the consumer chain to commit identity information, storing such representation in the provider chain’s&nbsp;state.  A set of pallets to deploy on any chain that wants to act as an identity-relaying or consumer party. These take care of validating cross-chain identity proofs provided by the subject and dispatch the actual call once the proof is verified.  A set of support crates, suitable for use within a chain runtime, for types and traits the provider and relying partys can&nbsp;use.  <p>These components enable the use of state proofs for information sharing between&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Identity on KILT is built around W3C-standard decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. Using KILT as an example, the following is a streamlined version of the process for using&nbsp;DIP:</p><p>Step 1. A user sets up their identity on KILT by generating their unique DID and anchoring it on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>Step 2. Credentials issued to that user contain their DID. The user keeps their credentials on their device, and the KILT blockchain stores a hash of each credential.</p><p>Step 3. To use the services of the relying party (in this example, any chain using KILT as their identity provider), the user prepares their identity via a transaction that results in their identity information committed to the chain state of KILT. After this point, the user doesn’t need to interact with KILT for each operation.</p><p>Step 4. The relying or “consumer” party can verify the identity proofs provided by the User. Once verified, the relaying party can dispatch a call and grant the user access to their services.</p> Advantages of&nbsp;DIP <p>DIP offers several significant advantages, including:</p>  Portability of Identities<br>Traditionally, users would need to create a separate identity for each application. However, with DIP, identities become portable. This means someone can use a single identity across multiple applications or platforms. This simplifies the user experience and maintains consistency of user identity across different platforms.  Focus on core competencies<br>Blockchain networks can focus on their core functionalities and strengths instead of investing resources into developing and maintaining an identity system. Instead, they can delegate identity management to other chains that specialize in it, effectively increasing efficiency.  Simplified Management of Identity for Users<br>Users can manage and update their identity in a single place, i.e., via their identity provider, even though the system is decentralized. This simplifies identity management for users, as they do not have to update their information on each platform separately.  Decoupling of Identities and Accounts<br>With many systems, a user’s identity is closely tied to their account, potentially enabling the tracking or profiling of users based on their account activity. Because DIP is linked to the user’s DID — the core of their identity — rather than their account address, DIP allows for identities to be separate from accounts, increasing privacy and flexibility. The user can then choose which accounts to link their identity to (if any) across several parachains and ecosystems, retaining control over their information disclosure.   KILT as an Identity&nbsp;Provider <p>KILT Protocol is consistently aligned with the latest <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">standards</a> in the decentralized identity&nbsp;space.</p><p>On top of these, additional KILT features such as <a href="https://www.kilt.io/services/web3name">web3names</a> (unique, user-friendly names to represent a DID) and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/services/account-linking">linked accounts</a> make it easier for users to establish a cross-chain identity.</p><p>Users may also build their identity by adding <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> from trusted&nbsp;parties.</p><p>By integrating KILT as an identity provider, the relying party gains access to all the identity information shared by the user while giving the user control over their data. This ensures a robust and comprehensive identity management solution.</p> Start Integrating <p>Relying party:</p>  Decide on the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your identity&nbsp;provider  Add the DIP consumer pallet as a dependency in your chain&nbsp;runtime  Configure the required Config trait according to your needs and the information agreed on with the&nbsp;provider  Deploy it on your chain, along with any additional pallets the identity provider requires.  <p><a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/dip/what-is-dip">(read KILT pallet documentation</a>)</p><p>Identity provider:</p>  Check out the pallet and&nbsp;traits  Agree on the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your relying&nbsp;party  Customize the DIP provider pallet with your identity primitives and deploy it on your&nbsp;chain  For ease of integration, you may also customize the DIP consumer pallet for your consumers.   What’s next? <p>Now that DIP is up and running, in the next stages, the team will continue to refine privacy-preserving ways to make KILT credentials available to blockchain runtimes. These will include improvements in proof size and proof verification efficiency and support for on-chain credential verification (or representation thereof). With DIP in the hands of the community, DIP’s users and community will guide future development.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p>KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, enabling secure, practical identity solutions for enterprises and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/unchaining-identity-decentralized-identity-provider-dip-enables-cross-chain-solutions-ba0baa1e68d0">Unchaining Identity: Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) Enables Cross-Chain Solutions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>Oracle Access Governance is a cloud-native IGA solution which runs in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle Access Governance can also run alongside Oracle Identity Governance in a hybrid deployment model to provide identity analytics from the cloud for Oracle Identity Governance customers. It serves as a one-stop shop for identity orchestration, user provisioning, access review, access control, compliance, and multi cloud governance. It offers a mobile-friendly, cloud-native governance solution. It can detect and remediate high-risk privileges by enforcing internal access audit policies to identify orphaned accounts, unauthorized access, and privileges. This helps improve compliance with regulatory requirements. With the capacity to manage millions of identities, Oracle suggests it is suitable for enterprise level organizational needs.</p>
 User Provisioning 
<p>Setting up this governance solution has two options. It can be done through connectors for systems easily accessible and for disconnected applications that cannot directly connect with Oracle Access Governance or are behind firewall systems, Oracle provides a one-time connector which can be downloaded by the administrator. The connector establishes the integration with the target system to securely sends and receives encrypted data to Oracle Access Governance. The connector continuously polls for access remediation decisions from Oracle Access Governance. The user interface provides detailed status updates for each connected system, including data load status and duration. In the latest update, Oracle Access Governance introduces new capabilities that focus on provisioning, identity orchestration, identity reconciliation and prescriptive analytics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Identity provisioning and reconciliation</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance’s identity orchestration makes use of identity provisioning and reconciliation capabilities along with schema handling, correlation, and transformations. The update provides comprehensive features for account provisioning by allowing users to create accounts by leveraging outbound transformation rules and assigning them appropriate permissions to access downstream applications and systems. The Access Governance platform can also perform reconciliation by synchronizing user accounts and their permissions from integrated applications and systems. Oracle suggests this will also support handling ownership to reduce orphan and rogue accounts effectively. Oracle suggests business owners can either manually address these orphaned accounts or allocate orphaned accounts to specific identities, followed by regular review cycles for these assigned accounts. Additionally, event-based reviews can be set up to automatically assess rogue and orphaned accounts as soon as they are detected within an integrated application or system.</p>
<p>Oracle’s Access Governance platform can also support authoritative source reconciliation from systems such as HRMS, AD, LDAP for onboarding, updating, and deleting identities through identity reconciliation. This solution combines identity provisioning and reconciliation capabilities, supported by robust integration. Whether it's for on-premises or cloud-based workloads, Oracle Access Governance offers a reliable framework for managing identity and access effectively.</p>
 Access reviews 
<p>Oracle Access Governance offers intelligent access review campaigns using AI and ML driven prescriptive analytics for periodic and micro certifications. These analytics provide insights and recommendations to proactively manage access governance and ensure compliance effectively.</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance offers a robust suite of features for access review for management of user permissions. The solution has manual access review campaigns that provides admins with a wizard-based interface for campaign creation. Oracle has also leveraged machine learning for managing reviews by providing deep analytics and recommendations. Oracle suggests that this will simplify the approval and denial of access. The platform also offers flexibility of scheduling periodic access review campaigns for compliance purposes. Oracle mentions this will streamline the process of auditing user permissions at regular intervals. Event-based micro certifications are also supported for limiting the certification of affected identities. Oracle has incorporated pre-built and customizable codeless workflows which are based on a simple wizard.</p>
<p>Moreover, administrators can set up ad hoc or periodic access review campaigns. The platform provides a granular approach for selecting criteria for access reviews. The identities can configure workflows according to their requirements or leverage AI and machine learning algorithms to suggest workflows based on certification history of related identities. The user interface for admins is modern and has features to review, download, and create reports on access review campaigns.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Oracle Access Governance continues to reinforce its identity and access management capabilities. With the ability to conduct micro-certifications instead of traditional certifications every six months, Oracle suggests their platform is well placed for streamlining governance procedures.</p>
<p>By leveraging cloud infrastructure, Oracle Access Governance is on track to support operations as well as facilitating integration with applications such as Cerner for auditing and compliance purposes. They plan monthly release cycle to their access governance platform &nbsp;with the latest features and enhancements. Oracle wants to provide visibility into access permissions across the enterprise using their dashboards which can be tailored based on requirements of business users. Furthermore, Oracle suggests this platform can be useful for CISOs by offering top-down or bottom-up consolidated views of access permissions across the enterprise.</p>

<p>The emergence of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are a linchpin for providing privacy preserving decentralized infrastructure to power the next generation of large language&nbsp;models.</p>How Web3 and DePIN Solves AI’s Data Privacy&nbsp;Problems<p>Written by <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a> (Verida CEO &amp; Co-Founder) and originally published on <a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/how-web3-and-depin-solves-ais-data">tahpot: Web3 on the edge</a>, this post is Part 2 of a Privacy / AI series and continues from <a href="https://news.verida.io/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing-ai-today-1503e50b65bd">Part 1: Top Three Data Privacy Issues Facing AI&nbsp;Today</a>.</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an undeniable force in shaping our world. From personalized recommendations to medical diagnosis, AI’s impact is undeniable. However, alongside its potential lies a looming concern: data privacy. Traditional AI models typically rely on centralized data storage and centralized computation, raising concerns about ownership, control, and potential misuse.</p><p>See part 1 of this series <a href="https://news.verida.io/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing-ai-today-1503e50b65bd">Top Three Data Privacy Issues Facing AI Today</a>, for a breakdown of key privacy issues which we will explain how web3 can help alleviate these problems.</p><p>The emergence of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are a linchpin for providing privacy preserving decentralized infrastructure to power the next generation of large language models&nbsp;(LLMs).</p><p>At a high level, DePINs can provide access to decentralized computation and storage resources that are beyond the control of any single organization. If this computation and storage can be built in such a way that it is privacy preserving; ie: those operating the infrastructure have no access to underlying data or computation occurring, this is an incredibly robust foundation for privacy preserving AI.</p><p>Let’s dive deeper into how that would look, when addressing the top three data privacy&nbsp;issues.</p> Privacy of user&nbsp;prompts <p>Safeguarding privacy of user prompts has become an increasingly critical concern in the world of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>An end user can initiate a connection with a LLM hosted within a decentralized privacy-prserving compute engine called a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which provides a public encryption key. The end user encrypts their AI prompts using that public key and sends the encrypted prompts to the secure&nbsp;LLM.</p><p>Within this privacy-preserving environment, the encrypted prompts undergo decryption using a key only known by the TEE. This specialized infrastructure is designed to uphold the confidentiality and integrity of user data throughout the computation process.</p><p>Subsequently, the decrypted prompts are fed into the LLM for processing. The LLM generates responses based on the decrypted prompts without ever revealing the original, unencrypted input to any party beyond the authorized entities. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and inaccessible to any unauthorized parties, including the infrastructure owner.</p><p>By employing such privacy-preserving measures, users can engage with AI systems confidently, knowing that their data remains protected and their privacy upheld throughout the interaction. This approach not only enhances trust between users and AI systems but also aligns with evolving regulatory frameworks aimed at safeguarding personal&nbsp;data.</p> Privacy of custom trained AI&nbsp;models <p>In a similar fashion, decentralized technology can be used to protect the privacy of custom-trained AI models that are leveraging proprietary data and sensitive information.</p><p>This starts with preparing and curating the training dataset in a manner that mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive information. Techniques such as data anonymization, differential privacy, and federated learning can be employed to anonymize or decentralize the data, thereby minimizing the potential for privacy breaches.</p><p>Next, an end user with a custom-trained Language Model (LLM) safeguards its privacy by encrypting the model before uploading it to a decentralized Trusted Execution Environment.</p><p>Once the encrypted custom-trained LLM is uploaded to the privacy-preserving compute engine, the infrastructure decrypts it using keys known only to TEE. This decryption process occurs within the secure confines of the compute engine, ensuring that the confidentiality of the model remains&nbsp;intact.</p><p>Throughout the training process, the privacy-preserving compute engine facilitates secure communication between the end user’s infrastructure and any external parties involved in the training process, ensuring that sensitive data remains encrypted and confidential at all times. In a decentralized world, this data sharing infrastructure and communication will likely exist on a highly secure and fast protocol such as the <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/830eba0d-a598-4471-bb5e-9591163cf98f?j=eyJ1IjoiMWVtbGwwIn0.hH-ixEtng8leUm5PEghR3rkdvO0GQ5tCHF_2mjj2ff4">Verida&nbsp;Network</a>.</p><p>By adopting a privacy-preserving approach to model training, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access while fostering trust among users and stakeholders. This commitment to privacy not only aligns with regulatory requirements but also reflects a dedication to ethical AI practices in an increasingly data-centric landscape.</p> Private data to train&nbsp;AI <p>AI models are only as good as the data they have access to. The vast majority of data is generated on behalf of, or by, individuals. This data is immensely valuable for training AI models, but must be protected at all costs due to its sensitivity.</p><p>End users can safeguard their private information by encrypting it into private training datasets before submission to a LLM training program. This process ensures that the underlying data remains confidential throughout the training&nbsp;phase.</p><p>Operating within a privacy-preserving compute engine, the LLM training program decrypts the encrypted training data for model training purposes while upholding the integrity and confidentiality of the original data. This approach mirrors the principles applied in safeguarding user prompts, wherein the privacy-preserving computation facilitates secure decryption and utilization of the data without exposing its contents to unauthorized parties.</p><p>By leveraging encrypted training data, organizations and individuals can harness the power of AI model training while mitigating the risks associated with data exposure. This approach enables the development of AI models tailored to specific use cases, such as utilizing personal health data to train LLMs for healthcare research applications or crafting hyper-personalized LLMs for individual use cases, such as digital AI assistants.</p><p>Following the completion of training, the resulting LLM holds valuable insights and capabilities derived from the encrypted training data, yet the original data remains confidential and undisclosed. This ensures that sensitive information remains protected, even as the AI model becomes operational and begins to deliver&nbsp;value.</p><p>To further bolster privacy and control over the trained LLM, organizations and individuals can leverage platforms like the <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/830eba0d-a598-4471-bb5e-9591163cf98f?j=eyJ1IjoiMWVtbGwwIn0.hH-ixEtng8leUm5PEghR3rkdvO0GQ5tCHF_2mjj2ff4">Verida Network</a>. Here, the trained model can be securely stored, initially under the private control of the end user who created it. Utilizing Verida’s permission tools, users retain the ability to manage access to the LLM, granting permissions to other users as desired. Additionally, users may choose to monetize access to their trained models by charging others with crypto tokens for accessing and utilizing the model’s capabilities.</p> About Chris <p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network that empowers individuals to control their digital identity and personal data.

<p>For the past month, we have been working closely with ten customers who have been helping us build something that solves their Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) problems. We call them our Lighthouse customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are smart folks at companies who are either “Unexpected Google Admin”, Solo-IT team, and/or HR. We have been working with them to figure out how they can move away from manual checklists and spreadsheets that manage their: onboarding, offboarding (or provisioning, de-provisioning), and access requests.</p>
<p>(If this sounds like you, you might qualify to climb into the next Lighthouse group.)</p>
<p>We’re working with them to replace their checklists and spreadsheets with something smarter – YeshLists.</p>
<p>A YeshList template is a pattern for a smart checklist. It’s kind of like a task template–the kind that you might create in Asana, Notion, or Google Sheets, but smarter. It does some of the automation and orchestration of getting the task list done for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You make a Yesh template by listing the steps for an activity–say onboarding or offboarding, YeshID can automate tasks within Google Workspaces like ”Create a new Google Account” or “Lock Workspace.” Or they can be automated outside Google Workspaces, like “Send welcome email.” Or they can be delegated, like “Have the Slack Admin set this person up for the Slack channels needed for a new hire in marketing.” Or manual like “Order a Yubikey” or “Send them a welcome swag box.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an Onboarding template. Notice that the YeshID template is smart enough to make the dates relative to the start date.</p>
<p>Here’s what a YeshList template looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you’ve got a template customized to your organization–or even to a particular department–and someone is ready to start you put in the person’s name, start date, and some other information, and YeshID will create a YeshList from a template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, it will&nbsp; RUN the template for you. If a task is automated (like some of the Google tasks we mentioned above), YeshID will make it happen when it’s supposed to happen. So think “I don’t need to sit in front of the computer at exactly 5 pm and suspend Joe from Google Workspace.” You can trust that YeshID will do it for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we cannot automate a task–like reclaiming a license or de-provisioning–we route the request to the person responsible for the task and ask them to respond when it is completed. And when they respond, we mark it as done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! In addition to helping you ensure someone is offboarded or onboarded properly, we will automatically update our access grid so that you can use it for compliance purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we have an end-user view that lets your employees see what applications they have access to and request access to apps they don’t have. This will help you track access for compliance purposes and make sure they are properly offboarded from the apps they have access to upon departure from the company.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking for anyone who:</p>
 
 Uses Google Workspace 
 Works at a company between 10-400 employees 
 Holds the responsibility of IT, Security, HR, compliance (or some combination thereof) in their job description 
 (not requirement, but bonus) Have SOC2 or other compliance requirements 
 
<p>..to work with us to setup YeshID in your environment. We’d love to show you how you can be more efficient, secure, and compliant with us!<br>
</p>
<p>If you are interested, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@yeshid.com">support@yeshid.com</a>. Of course, you are always welcome to sign up in your own time <a href="http://www.yeshid.com/onboard">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As interdisciplinary designers Che and Ross explain, prevailing technology too often serves narrow corporate interests rather than the empowerment of communities. Yet lessons from diverse, decentralized ecosystems demonstrate that more holistic models for catalyzing economics are aligned with collective thriving.</p><p>Just as living systems are circular, we must redesign digital infrastructure to nurture regeneration rather than extracting from the system.&nbsp;</p><p>In our interview with Che and Ross, we learned that by applying principles of interdependence and circularity, technology can shift from concentrating power to cultivating mutually beneficial prosperity.&nbsp;</p> Ingredients for Regenerative Value Flows <p>To build technology capable of empowering communities, we must look to the wisdom found in living systems that have sustained life on this planet for billions of years. As Ross explains:</p><blockquote>“Regenerative systems are living systems. And living systems tend to be characterized by things like circular value flows. It's like recycling, nutrients and resources, and energy. They tend to be diverse, and there’s a diversity of forms that allows it to adapt to complex, changing environments. And evolution in that, I think, is learning about information and feedback loops.”</blockquote><p>These properties allow ecosystems to be “both intensely resilient and creatively generative at the same time — maintaining integrity through shifts while allowing novelty to emerge.</p><p>Taken together, these key ingredients include:</p>  Diversity: A variety of components and perspectives allows greater adaptability. Monocultures quickly become fragile.  Interdependence: Rather than isolated parts, living systems work through symbiotic relationships where waste from one process becomes food for the next in closed nutrient loops.  Circularity: Resources cycle continuously through systems in balanced rhythms, more akin to the water cycle than a production line. Renewable inputs and outputs avoid depletion.  Feedback loops: Mechanisms for self-correction through learning. Information flows enable adaptation to dynamic conditions.  <p>Technology typically pursues narrow aims without acknowledging the repercussions outside corporate interests. However, by studying ecological patterns and the deeper properties that sustain them, we can envision digital infrastructure aligned with collective prosperity across interconnected systems.&nbsp;</p> Starting the Shift to Regenerative Models <p>The extractive practices prevalent in mainstream economics have fundamentally different outcomes compared to the circular, regenerative flows seen in natural systems. Commons-based peer production is one way to more closely align with natural systems, yet shifting the entrenched infrastructure rooted in exploitation presents an immense challenge.</p><p>As Che recognizes, the tension of, “incubating Commons-oriented projects” lies in “interfacing with a capital-driven system without the projects being subsumed by that system, in a way that suffocates the intuitions of the commons.”</p><p>Technology builders, of course, face a choice: will new solutions concentrate power further into existing hierarchies of control or distribute agency towards collective empowerment? Each application encodes certain assumptions and values into its architecture.</p><p>Creating regenerative systems therefore requires what some refer to as “transvestment” — deliberately rechanneling resources out of extractive systems into regenerative alternatives aligned with the common good.</p><p>As Ross points out:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“Capital actually needs to be tamed, utilized, because that's where all sorts of value is stored. And that's how we get these projects started and going. But if you're not able to sort of turn them under new Commons-oriented logics, then it escapes.”</blockquote><p>Grassroots projects cultivating local resilience while connecting to global knowledge flows demonstrate this paradigm shift. For example, <a href="https://farmhack.org/tools?ref=blog.holochain.org">Farm Hack</a> uses open source collaboration to freely share sustainable agriculture innovations.</p><p>So as solutions centered on human needs gain traction, the tide may turn towards nurturing collective prosperity.</p> Nurturing Collective Knowledge <p>As Che and Ross explained, extractive technology dumps value into corporate coffers while frequently compromising user privacy and autonomy. In contrast, thriving systems empower broad participation at individual and collective levels simultaneously.</p><p>For instance, public data funneled through proprietary algorithms often fuels asymmetric AI rather than equitably enriching shared understanding. "Data is being locked up,” Che explains. </p><blockquote>“And that puts a lot of power in the hands of a very small group."</blockquote><p>Yet human instincts lean towards cooperation and collective learning. Wikipedia stands out as a remarkable example of voluntary collaboration in service of the commons.</p><p>“It demonstrates how willing and how fundamental it is for humans to share, to share knowledge and information and contribute towards the commons,” Ross notes. Rather than reduce users to passive consumers, it connects personal growth to universal betterment.</p><p>At their best, technologies can thus amplify innate human capacities for cumulative innovation and participatory sensemaking.</p><p>By structuring information as nourishing circulations, technology can shift toward cultivating empathy; from addicting users to advertised products to aligning connectivity with meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain was built to enable this kind of circular value flow, connecting users, resisting centralizing tendencies, and enabling the Commons.</p><p>We hope our data and digital traces might then grow communal wisdom rather than being captured and used to control.</p>

<p>Traditional identity verification methods show their age, often proving susceptible to data breaches and inefficiencies. Blockchain emerges as a beacon of hope in this scenario, heralding a new era of enhanced data security, transparency, and user-centric control to manage digital identities. This article delves deep into blockchain’s transformative potential in identity verification, highlighting its advantages and the challenges it adeptly addresses.</p>
 
What is Blockchain? 
<p>Blockchain technology represents the decentralized storage of a digital ledger of transactions. Distributed across a network of computers, decentralized storage of this ledger ensures that every transaction gets recorded in multiple places. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that no single entity controls the entire blockchain, and all transactions are transparent to every user.</p>
 
Types of Blockchains: Public vs. Private 
<p>Blockchain technology can be categorized into two primary types: public and private. Public blockchains are open networks where anyone can participate and view transactions. This transparency ensures security and trust but can raise privacy concerns. In contrast, private blockchains are controlled by specific organizations or consortia and restrict access to approved members only. This restricted access offers enhanced privacy and control, making private blockchains suitable for businesses that require confidentiality and secure data management.</p>
 
Brief history and definition 
<p>The concept of a distributed ledger technology, a blockchain, was first introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Initially, it was the underlying technology for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The primary goal was to create a decentralized currency, independent of retaining control of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable, and immutable way. Over time, the potential applications of blockchain have expanded far beyond cryptocurrency. Today, it is the backbone for various applications, from supply chain and blockchain identity management solutions to voting systems.</p>
 
Core principles 
<p>Blockchain operates on a few core principles. Firstly, it’s decentralized, meaning no single entity or organization controls the entire chain. Instead, multiple participants (nodes) hold copies of the whole blockchain. Secondly, transactions are transparent. Every transaction is visible to anyone who has access to the system. Lastly, once data is recorded on a blockchain, it becomes immutable. This means that it cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of most of the blockchain network.</p>
 
The Need for Improved Identity Verification 
<p>Identity verification is a cornerstone for many online processes, from banking to online shopping. However, traditional methods of identity verification could be more challenging. They often rely on centralized databases of sensitive information, making them vulnerable to data breaches. Moreover, these methods prove identity and often require users to share personal details repeatedly, increasing the risk of data theft or misuse.</p>
 
Current challenges in digital identity 
<p>Digital credentials and identity systems today face multiple challenges. Centralized systems are prime targets for hackers. A single breach can expose the personal data of millions of users. Additionally, users often need to manage multiple usernames and passwords across various platforms, leading to password fatigue and increased vulnerability. There’s also the issue of privacy. Centralized digital identities and credentials systems often share user data with third parties, sometimes without the user’s explicit consent.</p>
 
Cost of identity theft and fraud 
<p>The implications of identity theft and fraud are vast. It can lead to financial loss, credit damage, and a long recovery process for individuals. For businesses, a breach of sensitive information can result in significant financial losses, damage to business risks, reputation, and loss of customer trust. According to reports, the annual cost of identity theft and fraud runs into billions of dollars globally, affecting individuals and corporations.</p>
 
How Blockchain Addresses Identity Verification 
<p>Blockchain offers a fresh approach to identity verification. By using digital signatures and leveraging its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature, blockchain technology can provide a more secure and efficient way to verify identity without traditional methods’ pitfalls.</p>
 
Decentralized Identity 
<p>Decentralized identity systems on the blockchain give users complete control over their identity data. Users can provide proof of their identity directly from a blockchain instead of relying on a central authority to keep medical records and verify identity. This reduces the risk of a centralized data breach and gives users autonomy over their identities and personal data.</p>
 Transparency and Trust 
<p>Blockchain technology fosters trust through transparency, but the scope of this transparency varies significantly between public and private blockchains. Public blockchains allow an unparalleled level of openness, where every transaction is visible to all, promoting trust through verifiable openness. On the other hand, private blockchains offer a selective transparency that is accessible only to its participants. This feature maintains trust among authorized users and ensures that sensitive information remains protected from the public eye, aligning with privacy and corporate security requirements.</p>
 Immutability 
<p>Once identity data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered without consensus. This immutability of sensitive, personally identifiable information ensures that identity data remains consistent and trustworthy. It also prevents malicious actors from changing identity data for fraudulent purposes.</p>
 
Smart Contracts 
<p>Smart contracts automate processes on the blockchain. In identity verification, smart contracts can automatically verify a user’s bank account’s identity when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for manual verification of bank accounts and reducing the often time-consuming process and potential for human error.</p>
 
Benefits of Blockchain Identity Verification 
<p>Blockchain’s unique attributes offer a transformative approach to identity verification, addressing many of the challenges faced by the traditional identity systems’ instant verification methods.</p>
 
Enhanced Security 
<p>Traditional identity verification systems, being centralized, are vulnerable to single points of failure. If a hacker gains access, the entire system can be compromised. Blockchain, with its decentralized nature, eliminates this single point of failure. Each transaction is encrypted and linked to the previous one. This cryptographic linkage ensures that even if one block is tampered with, it would be immediately evident, making unauthorized alterations nearly impossible.</p>
 
User Control 
<p>Centralized identity systems often store user data in silos, giving organizations control over individual data. Blockchain shifts this control back to users. With decentralized identity solutions, individuals can choose when, how, and with whom they share their personal information. This not only enhances data security and privacy but also reduces the risk of data being mishandled or misused by third parties.</p>
 
Reduced Costs 
<p>Identity verification, especially in sectors like finance, can be costly. Manual verification processes, paperwork, and the infrastructure needed to support centralized databases contribute to these costs. Blockchain can automate many of these processes using smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries and manual interventions and leading to significant cost savings.</p>
 
Interoperability 
<p>In today’s digital landscape, individuals often have their digital identities and personal data scattered across various platforms, each with its verification process. Blockchain can create a unified, interoperable system where one’s digital identity documents can be used across multiple platforms once verified on one platform. This not only enhances user convenience but also streamlines processes for businesses.</p>
 
The Mechanics Behind Blockchain Identity Verification 
<p>Understanding its underlying mechanics is crucial to appreciating the benefits of the entire blockchain network’s ability for identity verification.</p>
 
How cryptographic hashing works 
<p>Cryptographic hashing is at the heart of the blockchain network’s various security measures. When a transaction occurs, it’s converted into a fixed-size string of numbers and letters using a hash function. This unique hash is nearly impossible to reverse-engineer. When a new block is created, it contains the previous block’s hash, creating a blockchain. Any alteration in a block changes its hash, breaking the chain and alerting the system to potential tampering.</p>
 
Public and private keys in identity verification 
<p>Blockchain uses a combination of public and private keys to ensure secure transactions. A public key is a user’s address on the blockchain, while a private key is secret information that allows them to initiate trades. Only individuals with the correct private key can access and share their data for identity verification, ensuring their data integrity and security.</p>
 
The role of consensus algorithms 
<p>Consensus algorithms are protocols that consider a transaction valid based on the agreement of the majority of participants in the network. They play a crucial role in maintaining the trustworthiness of the blockchain. In identity verification, consensus algorithms ensure that once a user’s identity data is added to the blockchain, it’s accepted and recognized by the majority, ensuring data accuracy and trustworthiness.</p>
 
Challenges and Concerns 
<p>While blockchain offers transformative potential for identity verification, it’s essential to understand the challenges, key benefits, and concerns associated with its adoption.</p>
 
Scalability 
<p>One of the primary challenges facing blockchain technology is scalability. As the number of transactions on a blockchain increases, so does the time required to process and validate them. This could mean delays in identity verification, especially if the system is adopted on a large scale. Solutions like off-chain transactions and layer two protocols are being developed to address this, but it remains a concern.</p>
 
Privacy Concerns 
<p>While blockchain offers enhanced security, the level of privacy depends on whether the blockchain is public or private. In public blockchains, the transparency of transactions means that every action is visible to anyone on the network, which can compromise user privacy. Conversely, private blockchains control access and visibility of transactions to authorized participants only, significantly mitigating privacy risks. This controlled transparency is important in environments where confidentiality is paramount, leveraging blockchain’s security benefits without exposing sensitive data to the public.</p>
 
Regulatory and Legal Issues 
<p>The decentralized nature of blockchain challenges traditional regulatory frameworks. Different countries have varying stances on blockchain and its applications, leading only to a fragmented regulatory landscape; for businesses looking to adopt blockchain for identity verification and online services, navigating this complex regulatory environment can take time and effort.</p>
 
Adoption Barriers 
<p>Despite its benefits and technological advancements, blockchain faces skepticism. Many businesses need help to adopt a relatively new technology, especially when it challenges established processes. Additionally, the need for a standardized framework for blockchain identity management and verification and a complete ecosystem overhaul can deter many from its adoption.</p>
 
Blockchain Identity Verification Standards and Protocols 
<p>For blockchain-based identity verification to gain widespread acceptance, there’s a need for standardized protocols and frameworks.</p>
 
Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) 
<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) is an alliance of companies, financial institutions, educational institutions, and organizations working together to develop a unified, interoperable ecosystem for decentralized blockchain enables and identity solutions. Their work includes creating specifications, protocols, and tools to ensure that blockchain-based identity solutions are consistent, reliable, and trustworthy.</p>
 
Self-sovereign identity principles 
<p>Self-sovereign identity is a concept where individuals have ownership and control over their data without relying on a centralized database or authorities to verify identities. The principles of self-sovereign identity emphasize user control, transparency, interoperability, and consent. Blockchain’s inherent attributes align well with these principles, making it an ideal technology for realizing self-sovereign digital identity.</p>
 
Popular blockchain identity protocols 
<p>Several protocols aim to standardize blockchain identity verification. Some notable ones include DID (Decentralized Identifiers), which provides a new type of decentralized identifier created, owned, and controlled by the subject of the digital identity, and Verifiable Credentials, which allow individuals to share proofs of personal data without revealing the actual data.</p>
<p>Through its unique attributes, blockchain presents a compelling and transformative alternative to the pitfalls of conventional identity management and verification systems. By championing security, decentralization, and user empowerment, it sets a new standard for the future of digital and blockchain identity and access management solutions. To understand how this can redefine your identity management and verification processes, book a call with us today and embark on a journey toward a more secure security posture.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce the general availability of Microsoft Graph activity logs! Microsoft Graph activity logs give you visibility into HTTP requests made to the Microsoft Graph service in your tenant. With rapidly growing security threats and an increasing number of attacks, this log data source allows you to perform security analysis, threat hunting, and monitor application activity in your tenant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common use cases include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identifying the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant.&nbsp; 
 Building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs, such as an application enumerating all users, or making probing requests with many 403 errors.&nbsp; 
 Investigating unexpected or unnecessarily privileged assignments of application permissions.&nbsp; 
 Identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications, such as extreme call volumes that cause throttling for the tenant.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re currently able to collect sign-in logs to analyze authentication activity and audit logs to see changes to important resources. With Microsoft Graph activity logs, you can now investigate the complete picture of activity in your tenant – from token request in sign-in logs, to API request activity (reads, writes, and deletes) in Microsoft Graph activity logs, to ultimate resource changes in audit logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 New VideoIdent Flex elevates trust with a human touch in the face of rising fraud and the closing of physical bank branches 



<p>London, April 16, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification provider in Europe, has unveiled VideoIdent Flex, a new version of its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led video verification service</a> that blends advanced AI technology with human interaction. The human-based video call solution, supported by AI, has been designed and built to boost customer conversion rates, reduce rising fraud attempts, increase inclusivity, and tackle an array of complex online verification scenarios, while offering a high-end service experience to end customers.</p>



<p>The company’s original expert-led product, VideoIdent, has been a cornerstone in identity verification for over a decade, serving the strictest requirements in highly regulated industries across Europe. VideoIdent Flex, re-engineered specifically for the UK market, represents a significant evolution, addressing the growing challenges of identity fraud, compliance related to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes and ensuring fair access and inclusivity in today’s digital world outside of fully automated processes.</p>



<p>Empowering businesses with flexible human-based identity verification</p>



<p>As remote identity verification becomes more crucial yet more challenging, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a> combines high-quality live video identity verification with hundreds of trained verification experts, thus ensuring that genuine customers gain equal access to digital services while effectively deterring <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">fraudsters and money mules</a>. Unlike fully automated solutions based on document liveness and biometric liveness features, this human-machine collaboration not only boosts onboarding rates and prevents fraud but also strengthens trust and confidence in both end users and organizations. VideoIdent Flex can also serve as a fallback service in case a fully automated solution fails.</p>



<p>Bertrand Bouteloup, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, commented: “VideoIdent Flex marks a groundbreaking advancement in identity verification, merging AI-based technology with human intuition. In a landscape of evolving fraud tactics and steady UK bank branch closures, our solution draws on our decade’s worth of video verification experience and fraud insights, empowering UK businesses to maintain a competitive edge by offering a white glove service for VIP onboarding. With its unique combination of KYC-compliant identity verification, real-time fraud prevention solutions, and expert support, VideoIdent Flex is a powerful tool for the UK market.”</p>



<p>Whereas previously firms may have found video identification solutions to be excessive for their compliance requirement or out of reach due to costs, VideoIdent Flex opens up this option by customizing checks as required by the respective regulatory bodies in financial services, mobility, telecommunications or gaming, to offer a streamlined solution fit for every industry and geography.</p>



<p>Customizable real-time fraud prevention for high levels of assurance</p>



<p>VideoIdent Flex has a number of key features and benefits:</p>



  Customizable: Pre-defined configurations to meet specific industry requirements and regional regulations.  Expert-led: High-quality live video verification conducted by trained identity verification experts, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and compliance for high levels of assurance.  Extensive document coverage: Support for a wide range of documents, facilitating global expansion and inclusivity.  Real-time fraud prevention: Advanced fraud detection capabilities, including AI-driven analysis and manual checks, combat evolving fraud tactics and help protect against social engineering fraud, document tampering, projection and deepfakes, especially for high-risk use cases and goods.  Verification of high-risk individuals: Reviewing applications from high-risk persons, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), high-risk countries; or assessing where fraud might be expected with real-time decisions, without alerting suspicion.  



<p>Bouteloup concluded: “Identity verification is incredibly nuanced; it’s as intricate as we are as human beings. This really compounds the importance of adopting a hybrid approach to identity – capitalizing on the dual benefits of advanced technology when combined with human knowledge and awareness of social cues. <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/closure-of-high-street-banks-impact-on-local-communities/">With bank branches in the UK closing down</a>, especially in the countryside, and interactions becoming more and more digital, our solution offers a means to maintain a human relationship between businesses and their end customers, no matter their age, disability or neurodiversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“VideoIdent Flex is designed from the ground up for organizations that cannot depend on a one-size-fits-all approach to ensuring their customers are who they say they are. In a world where fraud is consistently increasing, our video capability paired with our experts adds a powerful layer of security, especially for those businesses and customers that require a face-to-face interaction.”</p>

 We sit down with our Principal Product Manager, Nitesh Nahta and Senior Product Marketing Manager, Suzy Thomas to find out why VideoIdent Flex is all set to become a game changer. 



 



<p>In April 2024, we launched <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a>, a customizable video identity verification solution aimed specifically at the UK market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our original expert-led product, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, has been a cornerstone in identity verification for over a decade, serving the strictest requirements in highly regulated industries across Europe. VideoIdent Flex, re-engineered specifically for the UK market addresses the nation’s growing challenges of identity fraud and compliance related <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know-Your-Customer (KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> requirements. It also ensures <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-verification-services-inclusivity/">fair access and inclusivity</a> in today’s digital world.</p>



 Can you tell us a little more about VideoIdent Flex? 



<p>Nitesh: VideoIdent Flex, from our expert-led video verification toolkit, will revolutionize the onboarding process by focusing on the human touch in KYC onboarding. Our proprietary technology will boost conversion rates while thwarting escalating fraud attempts. What sets it apart? Unlike its predecessors, VideoIdent Flex transcends its origins as a German-centric product. Leveraging years of refinement, insights and unmatched security, we’re extending its capabilities beyond German borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzy: VideoIdent Flex caters to a diverse range of global use cases, including boosting customer conversion rates, reducing fraud attempts, verifying high-risk individuals and onboarding VIPs. It offers a face-to-face service or provides an accessible and personalized alternative to automated identification processes. </p>



<p>Further differentiating IDnow in the market, VideoIdent Flex can also be combined with our digital signature solutions, allowing us to expand into loan and investment use cases from financial services, as well as recruitment, legal and insurance. With its advanced technology and expert-led verification, VideoIdent Flex offers three pre-configured packages tailored to suit different risk levels within organizations.</p>



 



 

 



 How important do you think VideoIdent Flex will be to the UK market? 



<p>Nitesh: Video verification is already a trusted AML-compliant onboarding solution across many European countries. Enter VideoIdent Flex: a versatile product catering to both AML and non-AML needs, boasting a seamless process, high conversion rates, and budget-friendly pricing. This marks a significant shift for IDnow, offering a distinctive value proposition that sets us apart. It’s a game-changer, enticing customers outside of the DACH region who hadn’t previously explored expert-led video verification. </p>



<p>Already embraced by numerous EU clients, this launch signifies our expansion beyond the DACH market, solidifying our foothold across the continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzy: I’m excited about the potential impact of VideoIdent Flex! It not only expands our market reach beyond the DACH and France+ regions, but also allows IDnow to break into new territories, including regulated and unregulated sectors in the UK, and non-regulated markets in DACH, France and beyond. With the UK’s highly competitive document and biometric verification market, VideoIdent Flex serves as a powerful differentiator, offering a face-to-face, fraud busting solution that will drive organizations to better recognize, trust and engage with IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe there are three main drivers that make this an excellent time to launch our new solution:&nbsp;</p>



  The economic pressures to close expensive physical branches.  



  Increasing consumer demand for remote digital experiences that can be accessed anytime, anywhere.  



  Societal pressure driving environmental and corporate governance concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>We’re excited to launch and see the market reaction. We believe it significantly enhances our value proposition and solidifies our position as industry leaders in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technology – it gives with one hand and takes with the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology, and the internet in particular, has afforded consumers incredible convenience, providing 24/7 access to services, across every industry imaginable. Unfortunately, technology has also <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/work-chatgpt/">empowered criminals to commit fraud</a> with an effortless ease and at an unprecedented level.<br>&nbsp;<br>Discover more about the scourge of fraud in the UK, in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">blog, ‘UK fraud strategy declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, multinational banks are subjected to <a href="https://www.cosive.com/fraud-detection-in-banking-guide">tens of thousands of fraud attacks</a> every single month, ranging from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">account takeover fraud</a> all the way to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/red-flags-money-laundering/">money laundering</a>. It is this reason, among many others, that it’s paramount to verify the identity of customers as a preventative measure against fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As businesses scale and the need to onboard customers quickly increases, many banks have implemented AI-assisted <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification solutions</a>. In certain high-risk circumstances, however, the importance of human oversight cannot be overstated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As bank branches continue to close (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">almost three-fifths of the UK’s bank network closing since 2015</a>), many UK banks are beginning to look for alternatives to data checks and automatic checks and are turning to expert-led video verification solutions.</p>

<p>Our recently launched <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a>, specially designed for the UK market, works in two ways: full service or self-service, meaning banks can choose to either use our extensive team of multilingual identity experts, or have their bank staff trained to the highest standard of fraud prevention experts. Here’s how VideoIdent Flex can help.</p>



 Tackling fraud, in all 4 forms. 



<p>At IDnow, we categorize fraud into four different buckets. Here’s how VideoIdent Flex can help tackle fraud, in all its forms.</p>



 1. Fake ID fraud. 



<p>We classify fake ID fraud as the use of forged documents or fraudulent manipulations of documents. Common types of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/document-fraud/">document fraud</a> – the act of creating, altering or using false or genuine documents, with the intent to deceive or pass specific controls – include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Counterfeit documents: reproduction of an official document without the proper authorization from the relevant authority.<br>  Forged documents: deliberate alteration of a genuine document in order to add, delete or modify information, while passing it off as genuine. Forged documents can include photo substitution, page substitution, data alteration, attack on the visas or entry/exit stamp.<br>  &nbsp;Pseudo documents: replicates codes from official documents, such as passports, driver’s licenses or national identity cards.  



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops fake ID fraud.</p>



<p>As a first step, IDnow’s powerful automated checks can detect damaged documents, invalid/cut corners, photocopies and much more. As a second step and additional layer of assurance, identity experts, specially trained in fraud prevention request document owners to cover or bend certain parts of documents as a way of detecting fake IDs and document deepfakes.</p>



 2. Identity theft fraud. 



<p>Identity theft fraud is when individuals, without permission, use stolen, found or given identity documents, or when another person pretends to be another person. Although popular among teenagers to buy age-restricted goods like alcohol and tobacco, fake IDs are also used for more serious crime like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/">human trafficking</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>. There are numerous forms of identity theft, with perhaps the darkest being ‘ghosting fraud’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the fraudulent use of a deceased person’s personal information in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ghosting-fraud-dead/">‘Ghosting fraud: Are you doing business with the dead?’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops identity theft fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s identity verification always begins with powerful automated identity checks of document data. Our identity specialists will then perform interactive motion detection tests like a hand movement challenge to detect deepfakes. To prevent cases of account takeover, VideoIdent Flex can be used to help customers reverify their identity when any changes to accounts (address, email etc) are made.</p>



 3. Social engineering fraud. 



<p>Worryingly, according to our recently published UK Fraud Awareness Report, more than <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/attitudes-awareness-uk-fraud/">half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is</a>. Social engineering fraud refers to the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging personal information, money or property and is an incredibly prevalent problem. Common examples of social engineering fraud include <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">social media fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">romance scams</a>.</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops identity theft fraud.</p>



<p>To help prevent social engineering, in all its forms, our identity experts ask a series of questions specifically designed to identify whether someone has fallen victim to a social engineering scam. There are three different levels of questions: Basic; Advanced; and Premium, with questions ranging from “Has anyone promised you anything in return (money, loan etc) in return for this identification?” to “Has anyone prepared you for this identification?”</p>



 4. Money mules.&nbsp; 



<p>Although many may initially envisage somebody being stopped at the airport with a suitcase full of cash, money mules, like every fraudulent activity, has gone digital, and has now been extended to persons who receive money from a third party in order to transfer it to someone else. It is important to distinguish between “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">money mules</a>” and “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>“. Money mules are involved in fraud scenarios (i.e. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bank-drop/">bank drops</a>) and cooperate as part of the criminal scheme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a social engineering scenario, a person is seen as a victim of fraud and are usually unaware that they are breaking the law with their behaviour. They are tricked into opening accounts, e.g. through job advertisements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops money mule fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our fraud prevention tools like IP address collection and red flag alerts of suspicious combinations of data, such as email domains, phone numbers and submitted documents, can go some way to help prevent money mule fraud. However, as an additional safeguard, when combined with VideoIdent Flex, agents can be trained to pick up on suspicious social cues and pose certain questions.</p>

 Lisbon Land Ownership Mapping: Unpacking Regulatory Mechanisms Behind Lisbon’s Spatial (In)justice <p>This blog post is the 4th article in the <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping">series</a>. The collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) has previously resulted in <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping/urban-land-ownership-mapping-in-copenhagen-eb13bfbbded1">mapping of Copenhagen</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/prague-land-ownership-mapping-unearthing-the-foundations-of-affordability-crisis-8b9f931eba2d">Prague, </a>and aims to continue its investigation further in&nbsp;Athens.</p><p>Through findings in this blog, we aim to flag the role of the state and city councils as active agents — alongside many others — shaping neoliberal development as opposed to the prevailing belief that solely the market forces may jeopardize spatial justice. The example of Lisbon shows that whereas transparent and accessible land ownership information is an important enabler for public oversight and policy, it is not the only key factor shaping a city’s ability to safeguard local livelihoods and affordability. This blog post expands on the thesis that land ownership patterns are foundational to spatial (in)justice, broadening the definition by encompassing the state- and city council-led regulatory mechanisms that govern property&nbsp;markets.</p> Introduction <p>Lisbon is currently the 3rd <a href="https://www.idealista.pt/en/news/property-for-rent-in-portugal/2023/05/08/5468-long-term-rentals-in-portugal-lisbon-is-the-3rd-most-expensive-european#:~:text=Rent%20for%20a%201%2Dbedroom,city%20after%20Amsterdam%20and%20Reykjavik.&amp;text=Property%20for%20rent%20in%20Portugal%20is%20getting%20more%20and%20more%20expensive.">most expensive city in Europe for rental accommodation.</a> Given Portugal’s lower salary levels compared to other European member states, the recent penetration of vast amounts of foreign capital into the housing market has <a href="https://jacobin.com.br/2023/02/a-especulacao-imobiliaria-fez-de-lisboa-uma-das-cidades-mais-inabitaveis-do-mundo/">made everyday life increasingly unmanageable for its citizens.</a></p><p>Lisbon can be considered as a flagship example of the dynamics where the public debt of the European “semi-periphery” to the financial European and global market “core” (see: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2023.2245302">Lima, 2023</a>) creditors turns the city into space for capital accumulation and its repayment. The public assets, municipal land, cultural heritage, housing, service sector and public space all become tools for economic growth often measured solely by abstract metrics such as real estate value appreciation.</p><p>Financialization means that even greater amounts of capital decoupled from the real economy and local realities (livelihoods, salaries etc.) flow into the city’s square meters turning them into financial assets that demand continuous returns on investments. In a context where finance is linked to space, new waves of capital need to continue finding physical room to act, with major impacts on people’s lives. The true debtors of this logic are not only the state or the municipality balance sheets, but the <a href="https://radicalhousingjournal.org/2022/informal-modes-of-governance/">displaced</a> citizens whose apartments needed to be freed for urban rehabilitation, struggling middle-class families facing soaring housing costs, the <a href="https://radicalhousingjournal.org/2022/informal-modes-of-governance/">22,812 families on the waiting list for social housing</a>, and the young; future generations who might never afford a home, forced to live with their&nbsp;parents.</p><p>In Lisbon, state-aided deregulation of the rental market, commodification of the existing housing stock, land and new housing developments speculation are the forces that have shaped this condition. Based on existing research, this blog aims to explain these&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Due to a lack of data transparency, it is difficult to precisely assess and depict who owns land and properties in the city, as well as what are the historical transactions which could bring actors in power into the public eye. What is known, however, through qualitative interviews with leading housing justice researchers, is that the main factors that have been shaping the catastrophic housing affordability crisis in Lisbon are those known to many other cities in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Structure of the&nbsp;blog <p>The structure of the blog aims to guide the reader through the dynamics which led Lisbon to its current condition.</p><p>1.

In this context,, <blockquote>o Liberalisation of the rental market through, among&nbsp;others,</blockquote>  § 2012 — New Urban Lease Law leading to displacement of former tenants in the central districts of Lisbon (and&nbsp;beyond).  <p>The set of events shows that multiple incentives and deregulation rather than demand and supply issues led to the current unaffordability (see: <a href="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/themes/investigations/untaxed">Untaxed, Investigate Europe&nbsp;2022</a>).</p> Force 2: Further financialisation of the housing stock — role of large-scale institutional investors <p>The measures that led to the commodification of the historical core proved to be successful in terms of real estate investment returns. Following this first wave of investments, the perceived oversupply of luxury housing and scarcity of land for new large-scale investments in the central areas led institutional investors to bet on the peripheral plots of Lisbon’s metropolitan area.</p><p><a href="https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_destaques&amp;DESTAQUESdest_boui=348829804&amp;DESTAQUESmodo=2&amp;xlang=en">A significant surge of almost 90% in building permits between 2017 and 2018</a> indicates this surge in large-scale investments, where substantial capital could be deployed. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2023.2245302">The adoption of a build-to-sell strategy ensured a secure exit option for institutional investors</a>, who then facilitated the acquisition of ostensibly “affordable” housing from non-premium segments by smaller investors keen on subletting.</p><p>As highlighted by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2023.2245302">Lima, 2013</a>, the narratives of the large investors shifted towards “long-term” investments targeting “the middle class”. Further narrative tools which the author points towards&nbsp;are:</p>  § Complaining about bureaucracy and “context-risk” — as means to justify lack of possibility of affordable housing provision, and needing to sell housing at more premium&nbsp;prices.  Positioning as the only ones able to build in the city due to lack of capital and institutional capacity from the state to&nbsp;deliver.  Lamenting the historical lack of public investment to make the case for private investment.  Differentiating themselves from the previous “short-term”, speculative investors through the “long-term” rhetoric — emphasising the role of institutional investors as actors responding to city’s&nbsp;needs.  <p>Against the backdrop of liberalised rental laws, institutional investors drove the creation of a “new supply” of speculative rental apartment units extending beyond the historical core. This perpetuates the financialisation of housing, allowing the trend to proliferate and persist beyond the city&nbsp;centre.</p><p>The following illustration aims to capture the dynamics that led to Lisbon’s persisting unaffordability:</p>Fig. The role of the state — Regulatory and policy changes influencing the spatial injustice in Lisbon, enabled by <a href="http://Agustín%20Cocola-Gant">A.

The permanent certificate of land registry provides, online, all the data regarding a property, even the pending requests. It is always updated and available for consultation. The <a href="https://www.predialonline.pt/PredialOnline/">WEBSITE</a> (<a href="https://www.predialonline.pt/PredialOnline/docs/Pedido_Certidao_Online.pdf">INSTRUCTION (in Portuguese)</a> of the Registo Predial Online offers the possibility of creating a ticket based on Town, parish (however, outdated taxonomy) and building number. The building number however can only be known if the interested party knows it (e.g. from a legal document such as a property sales contract) or applies for it in a physical office in&nbsp;Lisbon.</p><p>Application based on the property number (not land plot) is possible but costs 1 euro per entry (each apartment is one entry). For for purposes of this project, obtaining the scale of data would be simply beyond budget, and it may not even give much information on land. No data has therefore been purchased from this&nbsp;source.</p><p>As a test, a random search for buildings in the area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina,_Lisbon">Santa Catarina</a> (which is now part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miseric%C3%B3rdia_(Lisbon)">Misericórdia</a> parish) revealed 650 possible buildings, several of which may contain multiple housing units. One could reduce the cost of the purchase by filtering out some buildings (for example, those known to be owned by the municipality), but this is not an option, as the cadaster building number is decoupled from its&nbsp;address.</p><p>Interviews with researchers conducting similar investigations (<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=m4fCcQ4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Cocola-Gant, A</a>; Gago A.; Lima, R, and Silva R.) confirmed that large-scale land ownership investigations are an impossible or very costly task. Applications for buildings by their address costs 14 euro, need to be submitted via a physical office in Lisbon and are limited to 10 inquiries per day. According to some researchers, even the municipality’s own planning department may not have a clear overview on the municipal assets.</p> Conclusion &amp; Recent developments <p>Lisbon serves as a prime illustration of how gentrification processes, initially disconnected from land ownership, originate in the city core and radiate outwards. Initially, urban rehabilitation efforts and incentives for transnational individuals and corporate investors attract foreign capital, which primarily targets properties such as apartments and housing units, and are not necessarily land focused. In the second instance, however, as the market matures, land plays an important role as the large-scale investors attracted by promising returns seek space for large-scale developments. Thus, as the property market in the central areas gets saturated, the new wave of large-scale investments provides a new supply of housing units, inflating the market&nbsp;further.</p><p>Amid rising cost of living, Lisbon city council has recently introduced measures to mitigate the effects of increased financialisation of the housing&nbsp;sector.</p><p>This February (2024) the municipality approved the new <a href="https://www.idealista.pt/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2024/02/15/61478-lisboa-cede-terrenos-a-cooperativas-para-criar-habitacao-acessivel">“Cooperativas 1ª Habitação Lisboa”</a> programme which involves making municipal assets available to housing cooperatives for 90 years. This includes small plots of land for construction of affordable housing by the cooperatives. Furthermore, Lisbon’s Municipal Housing Charter just went through a <a href="https://www.idealista.pt/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2023/11/08/60185-carta-municipal-de-habitacao-de-lisboa-ja-esta-em-consulta-publica">3-month long public consultation process</a> (see also <a href="https://www.am-lisboa.pt/101000/1/022072,112023/index.htm">Civic Assembly’s website</a>, <a href="https://www.am-lisboa.pt/documentos/1699880411C3iFM1sm7Ge45OM3.pdf">the Report</a>, and <a href="https://www.am-lisboa.pt/documentos/1699880475F6cYA8wx1Lq65AP0.pdf">Maps</a>).

   Controlling access to resources and data is a critical priority for organizations. When developers are tasked with introducing a new application, one of the first considerations is the authorization model. How will we control access to features? Will there be limitations on who can perform actions? For too long, the answer has been to custom develop a homegrown solution for each application.

<p>Controlling access to resources and data is a critical priority for organizations. When developers are tasked with introducing a new application, one of the first considerations is the authorization model. How will we control access to features? Will there be limitations on who can perform actions? For too long, the answer has been to custom develop a homegrown solution for each application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this approach often means that developers are repeatedly developing an authorization solution time and time again. This is a hidden cost of application development, where developer time is spent building an authorization framework rather than features and functionality that help drive business outcomes. Furthermore, homegrown authorization frameworks are often limited in the use cases they can solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the pattern of authentication, developers are now turning to IAM platforms to manage authorization controls. For simple needs, authorization may be easily managed with an application permissions model. As more sophisticated use cases and requirements emerge, this simple model is best extended with fine-grained policies to handle user segmentation and dynamic decisioning.</p>

   In a digital age where the management of identity wallets and credentials is becoming increasingly complex, the W3C's Web Incubator Community Group (WICG) has initiated a pivotal work item called Digital Identities. As co-chair of the newly formed Federated Identity Working Group alongside Wendy Seltzer, I delve into why this project may (or may not!) soon find a permanent home within our group.

<p>About a year ago, a new work item was formed under the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Incubator Community Group</a> (the WICG). This work item looks at how a browser should behave when it comes to identity wallets and the credentials they hold. While the project has gone through a few name changes, it is currently called Digital Identities; the scope is available in <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why am I writing about it now? Because the W3C is thinking about whether the new working group I’m co-chairing in the W3C with Wendy Seltzer, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Federated Identity Working Group</a>, should be the standardization home for this project.&nbsp;This is definitely a niche post, but IYKYK! </p>



 Background 



<p>Initially, conversations about browsers, wallets, and how individuals are expected to select their credential of choice started in a FIDO Alliance board task force. Given the number of overlapping participants, members of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community Group</a> (FedID CG) took up the question as to whether that work should be in scope for the CG. The FedID CG, however, came to the conclusion that they were focused on determining how a different identity architecture, one that covers more traditional federation models via OpenID Connect and SAML, should handle the deprecation of third-party cookies. So, while there was alignment on the problem of “how is an individual supposed to actively select their identity,” the fact that the deprecation of third-party cookies mattered to the federation architecture but not to the wallet architecture suggested a separate incubation effort was necessary. If you don’t have alignment on what problem you’re trying to solve, you’re probably not going to solve the problem.</p>



 A Different Set of Stakeholders 



<p>That wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, that rejection from the FedID CG. The work item there is relatively simple when compared to what needs to come into play for an entirely new identity architecture. There are fewer stakeholders involved in a ‘traditional’ federation architecture. When considering wallet interactions, the number of interested parties goes well beyond a SAML or OIDC federation’s Identity Providers and Relying Parties and the browser. </p>



<p>With a digital identity wallet, we see requirements coming in from operating system developers, browser developers, and privacy advocates, as well as wallet and credential issuers and verifiers. This diversity of needs results in some confusion as to what problem the group is trying to solve. There are several layers to making a digital wallet function in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion; the group is not, however, specifying for all layers.</p>



<p>The WICG’s Digital Identities work may be a good fit for a more structured working group format than it was for a community group focused on incubation; that’s part of what has inspired this post.</p>



 Protocol Layers 



<p>The WICG Digital Identities work item did not start with a single problem statement the way the FedID CG did. Instead, their mission is described in their charter&nbsp;“to specify an API for user agents that would mediate access to, and representation of, verifiably-issued digital identities.”</p>



<p>To understand the totality of the effort to bring digital wallets and credentials to the web, which is a broader scope than that of the Digital Identities work item, you need to understand the many <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/blob/main/resources/DigitalCredentialsAPI-Layering-v20240301.pdf">layers</a> involved in enabling an identity transaction on the web and/or across apps.&nbsp;</p>



 Our Layers 



 
 Standardized API (W3C) = Digital Credentials Web Platform API (this is us) 



 Standardized API (Other) = currently FIDO CTAP 2.2 (hybrid transport; a phishing-resistant, cross-device link is already in place for passkeys/WebAuthn) 



 Platform-specific web translation API = platform abstraction of web platform APIs for verifiers* 



 Platform-specific function API = independent platform native API* 



 Protocol-specific = Protocol or deployment-specific request/response 
 



 Digital Credentials Web Platform API 



<p>The output of the WICG Digital Identities work item is the Digital Credentials Web Platform API from that first layer in the stack. In incubating that API, the specification editors are relying on the existence and behavior of other APIs either already in place or being developed by their respective platforms. Having the developers of those other APIs involved to make sure that the end-to-end flow of wallet and credential selection works as anticipated by the Digital Credentials Web Platform API is critical. Requiring change to those other APIs is out of scope for the Digital Identities work item (though we can ask nicely).&nbsp;</p>



 An FAQ 



 
 Should the browser see the details of the request for what’s in a wallet?
 
 That’s not in scope for the W3C (though the question still comes up when people join the group). 
 
 



 Should the OS see the details of what’s in a wallet?
 
 That’s not in scope for the W3C, either, so while of interest to many, it’s not something this group can or should resolve.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Should the API be protocol agnostic when it comes to verifiable credentials?
 
 Some say yes, some say no. The more protocols you have to support, the more expensive maintenance gets. So, while on the one hand, being protocol-agnostic supports the largest number of use cases, it’s also the most expensive thing to do.&nbsp; 
 
 



 What does protocol-agnostic look like in practice when different credentials format similar information differently?
 
 That’s one of the things we talk about.&nbsp; 
 
 



 At what point(s) does the individual consent to the information being requested from a wallet? being requested to be added to a wallet?
 
 We’re still talking about that, too. 
 
 



 Is the use case under consideration primarily remote presentation or in-person presentation?
 
 The scope is online presentation, so the work is focused on the remote use case.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Is the payload of requests in scope for this group, or is the group only concerned with communication channels (leaving payload handling up to the platforms)?
 
 Here’s another area of contention. Of course, the browser wants to prevent bad traffic. But this stuff is encrypted for a reason, and making everything (most things? some things?) viewable to the browser isn’t necessarily the right answer either from a privacy and security perspective.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Is the question of what signal must exist (and who provides that signal) for a wallet to be trusted by the browser in scope for the group? If not, where can those discussions be directed?
 
 This is not in scope as the web platform does not directly communicate with the wallet in this architecture. 
 
 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>So what happens now? Conversations are happening at the OAuth Security Workshop, within the W3C Advisory Committee, and soon at the Internet Identity Workshop. By the time those wrap up, the Federated Identity Working Group will start meeting and will have its own say as to whether this work belongs in scope or not. If you’re interested in participating in the conversation, there is a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/450">GitHub issue</a> open where we are collecting input on the topic. You are welcome to chime in there, or just grab some popcorn and watch the story unfold!</p>

<p>For many years, Aergo has been at the forefront of providing blockchain-based solutions catering to enterprises, businesses, governments, and non-profits. With Booost, Aergo is now venturing into new territories within the consumer segment, signaling a significant expansion of its brand and services.</p><p>In the latter half of 2023, Booost embarked on a strategic shift, deliberately slowing down its feature rollout to focus on a comprehensive overhaul of its infrastructure. This move to Booost v2.0 was not merely an upgrade but a foundational step towards achieving seamless integration across its offerings, ensuring that Booost remained competitive in the fast-evolving blockchain landscape.</p><p>The results of this strategic pivot have begun to manifest. The upgraded infrastructure has enabled Booost to introduce new features such as Chat, Check-in, and Memories more efficiently. These features, aimed at enriching the socialfi experience, indicate Booost’s commitment to surpassing consumer expectations and enhancing user engagement.</p><p>Booost’s Q1 2024&nbsp;Overview</p><p>Booost set ambitious objectives for the start of 2024. Significant progress has been made as the first quarter comes to a close, despite some minor delays. Below is an update on Booost’s Q1 progress, marked by several significant milestones:</p>  New Social Features: Booost has successfully launched Chat, Check-in, and Memories, fully activating these crucial components within its socialfi strategy.  Socialfi MVP: The Mission Center, a cornerstone of Booost’s platform, is nearing its launch, expected by late-April.  Ambassador Pilot Phase 1: The initial group of ambassadors is gearing up to debut by the end of April. This was an initiative that was launch-ready in January but got held back to ensure it ties closer towards other product launches and roadmap&nbsp;plans.  Website and Whitepaper Refresh: Updates to both the website and whitepaper are imminent, with a reveal anticipated by late&nbsp;April.  <p>Partnership Highlights</p><p>The quarter also saw Booost enhance its ecosystem through strategic partnerships, including collaborations with Beoble and HK Web3 Festival. These alliances, along with others in the pipeline, are crucial for strengthening Booost’s network and market presence.</p><p>Looking Forward</p><p>Excitement is building for the introduction of Booost v3.0. The delays experienced in recent initiatives are seen as laying the groundwork for significant advancements Booost is preparing to roll&nbsp;out.</p><p>As Booost continues to bridge the gap between Aergo’s enterprise-grade solutions and the consumer market, it solidifies Aergo’s position at the forefront of the blockchain revolution. The community is encouraged to stay tuned for further updates as Booost propels Aergo’s journey into the consumer space, reshaping the digital landscape with each innovative step.</p><p>For further information on Aergo’s emphasis on dynamic NFT and consumer NFT markets, please refer&nbsp;to:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/booosting-the-dynamic-nft-and-consumer-nft-markets-bee8ca91635e">‘BOOOST’ing the Dynamic NFT and Consumer NFT Markets</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergos-developments-into-the-consumer-segment-q1-update-472a97f7da21">Aergo’s Developments into the Consumer Segment: Q1 Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Whether such exploitation is initiated by external parties or internal bad actors, these events can put customers’ private information at risk and be extremely costly for organizations to resolve.

<p>Pete Corke's love for nature, nurtured through his walks in the coastal rainforests of British Columbia, Canada, inspired him to find ways to invest in the preservation of these precious ecosystems. </p><p>As the Director of Vision &amp; Leadership at <a href="http://www.kwaxala.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kwaxala</a>, an Indigenous-led and majority owned organization focused on protecting at-risk forests, Pete brings a unique perspective to the challenges and opportunities of creating a regenerative economic system.</p><p>With a background spanning technology, brand marketing, and supply chain management, Pete recognized that traditional conservation methods often left local economies poorer, relying heavily on philanthropy and government programs. He saw the need for a new approach that could generate sustainable economic value while protecting the environment.</p><p>Regenerative economics offers a solution by providing a for-profit orientation to conservation, benefiting communities and promoting biodiversity. However, accounting for the value of ecosystem services and ensuring the reliability of carbon credit markets can be complex. This is where Web3 technologies play a crucial role, providing tools to create transparency, trust, and custom solutions for documenting nature's value and connecting it to global markets.</p> Problems With the Current Extractive Economic System&nbsp; <p></p><p>The current economic system primarily focuses on removing resources from the earth — creating a world that often overlooks the value of living nature.</p><p>As Pete Corke explains, "Living nature isn't represented in [our economy]. It's all dead and extracted from nature. And in fact, the only way of creating value-flows from the current system into protected nature is by literally burning the transactional medium, burning money through philanthropy."</p><p>In other words, the current economic system only recognizes the value of nature when it is extracted and sold, and the only way to direct money towards conservation is through philanthropic donations, which do not generate any economic returns or retain asset value.</p><p>This approach has led to a lack of ways to recognize the value of ecosystems and the services they provide. Remote communities, like those in British Columbia, Canada, face a tough choice between participating in the resource extraction that makes up most of the local economy or supporting conservation efforts that often lack economic incentives.</p><p>Additionally, the established laws and structures around land use are deeply rooted in this resource-focused economic system, making it difficult to create change. So how can one aim to operate within the current structure and transform the economics?</p><p>Pete emphasizes that "Traditional conservation makes British Columbia poorer. It's giving up tax revenues, it's giving up export revenues. And that's at a provincial level. At a local level, they're giving up jobs in remote communities."</p><p>The extractive industry's control over these structures poses a significant challenge to those seeking to create a regenerative economic system. As Pete points out, "It's not about replacing extractive economics. It's about creating an economic counterbalance to it."</p><p>Achieving this balance requires not only developing new economic models but also navigating complex laws and governance frameworks that have long prioritized resource extraction over regeneration.</p> Opportunities for Regenerative Economics <p></p><p>Despite the challenges posed by the current extractive economic system, there are significant opportunities for regenerative economics to create a counterbalance. Specifically, regenerative economics would be creating incentive-based conservation efforts that spur economic growth while protecting nature.</p><p>As Pete Corke explains, "The whole point of the regenerative economics space is, hey, we need a two polled [economic] world here to create a counterbalance."</p><p>One key opportunity lies in generating value flows to conserve natural areas and the local communities that support these ecosystems. Pete emphasizes the importance of creating "an economic activity that's based on regeneration [which] counteracts extractive economic value."&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.kwaxala.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kwaxala</a> is building a global network of protected forest areas that, at scale, generate economic markets for natural systems. Their projects demonstrate on-going returns for both forest communities and mindful investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Most resource extraction happens on public lands, with companies buying the rights (to log, mine, or drill for oil) that give them use of that land. By buying these rights and safeguarding them, managing the land appropriately, and documenting the revitalization of these ecosystems, it’s possible to demonstrate the value of conservation in a global market.&nbsp;</p><p>These thriving ecosystems provide numerous benefits to the people, industries, and municipalities who interact with them. They clean the air and water, offer mental health benefits to individuals, provide educational opportunities and recreational spaces for children, and attract tourism to communities.&nbsp;</p><p>This only scratches the surface of the economic and social benefits of rich, site specific ecosystems, on both local and global levels, but we don’t have great ways to account for these benefits within our economy. One market tool is high quality carbon credits, which can be produced through the act of conservation to start accounting for these benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>By developing mechanisms that allow individuals and businesses to invest in and hold value in living natural assets, regenerative economics can provide a viable alternative to extractive industries. Whilst carbon offsets and biodiversity credits represent an economic mechanism for recognising the services provided by nature, there are very few mechanisms that enable you to hold equity/investment value in the supply side of that value flow. But that is changing and Kwaxala is leading in that space.</p> The Next Economic Mechanism <p></p><p>Web3 tools, such as blockchain and smart contracts, offer promising solutions for creating transparency, provenance, and liquidity in regenerative economic systems.&nbsp;</p><p>As Pete points out, "Web3 is so powerful because we're not trying to just build regenerative products, we're trying to build an entire regenerative stack and entire economic ecosystem that counterbalances the extractive ecosystem."</p><p>These tools enable the creation of new financial products and value flows that can be quickly prototyped and scaled, providing a more efficient means of realizing the potential of regenerative economics.&nbsp;</p><p>Web3 technologies can help ensure the authenticity and on-the-ground truth of regenerative assets, such as carbon offsets, by embedding due diligence and provenance information directly into the digital tokens representing these assets.&nbsp;</p><p>These technologies also allow transparent value redistribution back into the communities on the ground, ensuring that the regenerative economy is built from the foundations up in a far more equitable way than the extractive/colonial economy ever was.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the success of regenerative economics hinges on shifting mindsets and creating a new paradigm that recognizes the inherent value of nature. As Pete states, "Nature doesn't just need a seat at the economic table, we need to acknowledge that it is the table and it's also the air in the room! The human economic system is a subsidiary of the natural economic system."</p><p>As the world faces mounting environmental challenges, the need for a regenerative economic system has never been more pressing. Pete Corke and Kwaxala's work in partnering with Indigenous communities, protecting at-risk forests, and generating regenerative returns through innovative financial mechanisms that allow anybody to hold equity value in a living forest serves as a powerful example of how we can begin to create a true counterbalance to the extractive economy.</p><p>By leveraging Web3 tools such as Holochain, regenerative projects can create a trustworthy data layer that ensures transparency and trust in regenerative economic systems. Holochain's architecture allows for the distributed storage and processing of vast amounts of data, essential for documenting ecosystem interactions and ensuring the integrity of regenerative assets.</p><p>Centralized solutions have often proved untrustworthy, with instances of carbon credit markets failing to deliver on their promises due to lack of oversight and accountability. These examples highlight the need for trustable solutions that provide transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof records of regenerative assets and their associated impacts. Holochain's distributed data layer creates a system resistant to manipulation and greenwashing, ensuring the value generated by regenerative economics is genuine and long-lasting.</p><p>Recognizing the intrinsic worth of healthy ecosystems can create a new economic paradigm that prioritizes the well-being of both human communities and the natural world. The path forward requires collaboration, innovation, and a willingness to challenge entrenched structures. </p>

			 Fedor Bolotnov is QA&nbsp;Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>Hi, my name is Fedor, and I’m a QA Engineer at Tokeny. I prefer the QA Engineer position over Tester because QA involves more than just testing. While testing is a significant aspect, QA also encompasses communication, processes, and creating an error-prone environment.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I held various QA roles, ranging from QA to Team Lead, in several companies in Russia. However, in 2022, I unexpectedly relocated to Spain and had to restart my QA career.</p>
<p>The concept of revolutionizing the traditional finance sector intrigued me, prompting my decision to join Tokeny. As a QA professional, part of my role involves “ruining” someone else’s code, but only to enhance its quality and resilience. Essentially, we strive to challenge the current system to pave the way for a newer and superior one.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Fun, educational, and collaborative. With a diverse team, each member brings their unique life and career experiences and expertise, fostering continuous learning and knowledge sharing every day.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Sleep, haha! I cherish a good 10-11 hours at least once a week. But on a serious note, learning something new is what really motivates me to get out of bed every morning. Of course, I also adore spending time with my wife and our cat (fortunately, she can’t read, so she won’t find out she’s second on the list!). Additionally, I’m a bit obsessed with sports, both playing and watching American football.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To borrow from Archimedes: “Give me a point that is firm and immovable, and I will fall asleep.” So, I don’t have a single ultimate dream, but rather an endless list of tasks to accomplish to ensure my family’s happiness.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and never give up.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>The borderlessness of it all. It opens up endless possibilities beyond any limits we can currently dream or imagine.</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my <a href="https://youtu.be/1eX7_3sqLxM">YouTube explainer video</a> on why privacy and personalization are so hard to balance. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheDigitalCowNetwork">Digital Cow Network</a>! I’m your host, Heather Flanagan. In today’s explainer, we’re going to look at some of the challenges of balancing privacy with the desire for personalization on the web. This is important because the standards and regulations under development today are trying to do this, too.&nbsp; Sneak preview: asking for user consent is not particularly helpful here. Think of it as necessary but not sufficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we surf the web, we want to see more of what’s of interest to us, and we also want to know that our privacy is being protected. Let’s look at this dichotomy—the desire for privacy versus the desire for personalization—that’s at the heart of our digital lives. How much are we willing to share for a tailored online experience?</p>



 The Personalization Phenomenon 



<p>Personalization is everywhere – from your social media feed to shopping recommendations. Millennials and Gen Z in particular expect a level of personalization that older generations aren’t quite used to. But ever wondered how it works? Websites and apps collect data about our preferences, activities, and more to create a custom experience. Sometimes that is as simple as optimizing for whatever web browser you use (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or something else). Other times it’s a lot more invasive.</p>



 The Data Behind Personalization 



<p>Let’s break down the data journey. It starts with what you click, what you search, and even how long you linger on a page. This data forms a digital profile, which then guides the content you see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s where the magic of Real-Time Bidding comes in! Real-time bidding only works because the Internet is blindingly fast for most, especially compared to the days of old-school dial-up connections. It works like this:&nbsp;</p>



 
 You visit a website.&nbsp; 



 The website has a space on it for an ad.&nbsp; 



 That space includes a piece of code that says “go to this ad exchange network, and take information about this website AND information about the user (either via cookies, or their browser fingerprint) AND the physical location of the user because their device probably knows that and send it all to the ad exchange.”&nbsp; 



 The ad exchange has a list of advertisers who have preloaded information on what they’re willing to pay to promote their ad based on specific criteria about the website, the user, and even who the user is physically close to.&nbsp; 



 The ad exchanger immediately figures out who wins the auction and returns the winning ad to be embedded in the website.&nbsp; 
 



<p>All this takes milliseconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Real-time bidding: the Internet is fast enough to stream movies… and to collect information about you, where you are, what you’re looking at, and even where you focus your attention on the screen in real-time.</p>



 Privacy in the Personalized World&nbsp; 



<p>And there’s the catch: this level of personalization requires access to a lot of personal data. That’s where privacy concerns come in. How do companies ensure our data is safe? How much control do we have over what’s collected?</p>



<p>Thanks to laws and regulations like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), individuals do have some ability to control this flow of information. For example, there are cookie banners on many websites that are supposed to let you decide what type of information you’re willing to share. There are also authenticated ids for when an individual has logged in and provided consent to be tracked. Google’s Privacy Sandbox has several mechanisms they’re testing out, like the Protected Audience API and the Topics API to help with ethical advertising.</p>



 Navigating the Trade-offs 



<p>But ultimately, accommodating privacy, personalization, and legal requirements around both is a trade-off, both for advertisers and for individuals. Personalization can make people’s online life more convenient and enjoyable. The increase in regulatory pressure, though, means that every entity involved in serving up a website and its associated ads to an individual needs to be a part of the consent process. It’s a barrage of “are you ok with us collecting data? How about now? Is now ok? What about over here? And here? And here, too?” This is a terrible user experience.</p>



 Best Practices for Users and Developers&nbsp; 



<p>So, what can we do? For individuals, it’s about making informed choices, understanding privacy settings, and being patient with the barrage of consent requests. For developers, the challenge is to respect user privacy while providing value. This is all still a very new space, which is why there is so much activity within the W3C and the browser vendors to find a path forward that satisfies the business requirements while still keeping on the right side of privacy law. The best thing organizations that are in the business of benefiting from tracking need to get involved in the standards process to test out those APIs under development and offer feedback the API developers can use.&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up: The Future of Privacy and Personalization&nbsp; 



<p>Looking ahead, the landscape is ever-evolving. New technologies, stricter privacy laws, and changing user attitudes are reshaping this balance. If you’re looking at the One True Way for your business to thread this needle, I’m afraid you’ve still got some waiting around to do. The browser vendors are trying different things at the same time lawyers are trying to find different ways to interpret the legal requirements into technical requirements. If it were easy, it would have been solved already.</p>

Top cybersecurity companies BeyondTrust, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne continue to make substantial investments in ITDR. Microsoft has leaned into ITDR by blending technologies from its Entra and Defender XDR products. Other vendors, such as Gurucul, Securonix, and Sharelock are attempting to broaden the definition of ITDR in various ways. 
Given these developments, the market remains difficult to quantify. Arguably, there isn’t even a real “ITDR market,” because it’s ultimately more like an activity or an identity protection platform. Many of these vendors don’t even use the term ITDR in their products’ names. But what is clear is that ITDR is a banner under which enterprise identity and access management (IAM) and security operations center (SOC) teams must unite. 
So, what’s your organization’s best route to protecting identities and IAM infrastructure? This Leadership Compass evaluates the market dynamics for ITDR in 2024 and provides guidance on how your organization can take advantage of these critical technologies.

The right tree in the right place can support our urban infrastructure for example a mature tree is equivalent to 10 air conditioning units running for 20 hours in a&nbsp;day<p>Trees-as-Infrastructure (TreesAI) was evolved as an initiative by Dark Matter Labs with contributions by Lucidminds and is now being held by Dark Matter Labs. TreesAI is exploring the required organisational infrastructures to revalue nature as a critical part of urban infrastructure alongside bridges, roads and rail. TreesAI is part of a wider Nature-based solution mission at Dark Matter Labs, focused on supporting nature-inspired approaches that sustain and regenerate the health of underlying ecosystems.</p><p>In this blog we summarise how one of our tools, the TreesAI Location-based Scoring, has been applied in Stuttgart to assess climate risks spatially and support the design and prioritisation of different urban nature-based solutions. None of this would have been possible without the valuable collaboration of various partners in Stuttgart: Bernd Junge, Clemens Hartmann, Ekkehard Schäfer, Elisabeth Bender, Fridtjof Harwardt, Hauke Diederich, Holger Wemmer, Jan Kohlmeyer, Johannes Wolff, Juliane Rausch, Katja Siegmann, Niels Barth, Sophie Mok, Sven Baumstark.</p><p>TreesAI Stuttgart is cofunded by Stuttgarter Klima-Innovationsfonds and The Nature Conservancy</p> (1) Introduction <p>Since 2023, TreesAI has been working in Stuttgart, Germany, after successfully applying to the nature-based solutions funding line by the Stuttgarter Klima-Innovationsfonds and The Nature Conservancy.</p><p>TreesAI is being implemented in partnership with several city departments and municipal facilities: the Stuttgart climate protection unit, the urban planning department, the civic engineering office, the health department, the tree management teams for city trees, and trees on state premises.</p><p>The project kicked off in September 2023 with an in-person, cross-divisional workshop with all involved city departments in Stuttgart to align on project&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Two key goals came out of the workshop. The first one was around the quantification of benefits trees provide — for which Stuttgart is using <a href="https://gus.earth/">GUS</a> which is essentially a comprehensive, AI-powered platform created to support stakeholders in forestation projects. It accommodates various forest types, scales, and geographic locations, maintaining scientific rigour with its peer-reviewed framework. GUS is now being developed and maintained by Lucidminds.</p><p>The second goal, which is this blog's focus, was to synthesise existing data to support decision-making around the location and prioritisation of projects. In this blog, we share our experience to date of working with the city departments through a co-created process of scoring projects through their location — what we call “Location-Based Scoring”</p><blockquote>TreesAI Location-based Scoring (LBS) provides an overlay and weighting process of location-based vulnerabilities to climate risks in the city — like heavy rainfall hazards, air pollution and heat islands — and helps decision-makers assess the most effective locations for maintaining and increasing green infrastructure to mitigate climate risk across the&nbsp;city.</blockquote>Part of our TreesAI team in Stuttgart, where we went on excursions with Clemens Hartmann (center) and Fridtjof Harwardt (not in the picture) to the Stuttgart Schloßgarten, Rosensteinpark and Europaviertel on the topic of tree&nbsp;care. How can Location-Based Scoring (LBS) be used to make the case for urban&nbsp;nature? <p>The LBS methodology applied in Stuttgart is a tool designed by TreesAI to perform a risk-based vulnerability assessment. This helps to evaluate how patterns of risks and potential benefits on natural and human systems are shifting due to climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>Climate risks result from an interplay between hazards, stress factors, exposure and vulnerability. Vulnerability is special in that it is not only determined by the sensitivity to damage yet also by the coping capacity to deal with&nbsp;it.</p><p>The overall aim of this analysis was to facilitate an understanding of:</p>  Hazard-Exposure relationships of climate change in the local&nbsp;context.  Identify geographical hotspots that lack green in relation to their level of risk and potential.  Consolidate compound site factors — including population density, surface water flooding risk, heat island effect, air pollution concentration, site accessibility — into a single overall location-based score.  <p>For this purpose, the LBS methodology involves developing a risk score for geographical areas based on the different focus areas in Stuttgart, and it is a methodology adapted from the “Impact and Vulnerability Analysis of Vital Infrastructures and built-up Areas Guideline” (<a href="https://resin-cities.eu/resources/ivavia/">IVAVIA</a>) (Resin, 2018) that is based on the concepts of risks defined by the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report.</p><blockquote>LBS reveals which areas would highly benefit from specific Nature-based Solution typologies to increase their coping capacity to climate risks in the&nbsp;city.</blockquote>Nature’s gifts aren’t always in plain sight: while maintenance, and increasing tree survival is essential, this image of a dead tree actually hides an important biodiversity habitat (2) The story so&nbsp;far  Scoping assessment in Stuttgart: defining focus climate&nbsp;themes <p>The first step of the onboarding process for Stuttgart was the definition of the most pressing risks in the city’s local context that NbS could help mitigate and adapt, which could also damage green infrastructure. In other words, this step was about defining the hazards and exposed assets or systems for assessing risks in the city of Stuttgart. Therefore, the TreesAI team, in partnership with the involved city departments and municipal facilities, jointly crystalised the following five hazard-exposure relationships:</p>  Heat Risk on Population Health  Drought Risk on Green Infrastructure  Air Pollution Risk on Population Health  Surface Water Flooding Risk on Built-up&nbsp;Areas  Surface Water Flooding Risk on Transport Network  <p>For each hazard-exposure combination, an impact chain was crafted. These impact chains describe the cause-and-effect dynamics between hazard and exposure components. Subsequently, indicators were established to delineate the three primary facets for assessing climate risk: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, which includes coping mechanisms and sensitivity. Each of the five impact chains and the selection of these indicators were guided by the data available in Stuttgart and, crucially, by co-creation workshops and interviews with experts, policymakers and through scientific research.</p><p>Given that LBS focuses on spatial analysis to rank NbS according to their necessity gathering spatial data on pertinent urban indicators was an essential stage of this partnership with the city. The team secured a variety of inventory data from the city alongisde open-source satellite data, encompassing aspects like population density, surface water flooding risk, urban heat island effect, the extent of impermeable surfaces in built-up areas, and a tree register. These data sets were then synthesized using the TreesAI LBS methodical approach.</p><p>An impact chain diagram shows the relationship between these components. Below is an example of the impact chain diagram developed for Stuttgart to visualise the factors needed to evaluate the impact of heat (hazard) on population health (exposure)</p>Schematic diagram of indicators used in LBS, at the example of a heat-to-population impact&nbsp;chain. Scoring the city according to NbS potential to mitigate&nbsp;risks <p>After gathering all the necessary data and establishing the analysis resolution, initially set as a 500x500m grid, we processed all data to fit this spatial framework using GIS software. This processing allowed us to compute a location score for each spatial unit by calculating the various indicators of risk components in the LBS Modeling. This calculation involved weighting, normalizing, and aggregating the different indicators.</p><p>The weighting of indicators enabled us to prioritize among risk components, such as hazards, vulnerabilities, and exposures. In the case of Stuttgart, the assignment of weights to these indicators was achieved through collaborative workshops with the city’s municipal departments. Each workshop focused on a specific impact chain, gathering representatives from departments relevant to the climate theme under discussion. For example, in the workshop addressing the risk of drought to green infrastructure, the attendees included experts and stakeholders directly involved in this area, including the Stuttgart tree management teams for city trees as well as trees on state premises, the Stuttgart climate protection unit and the Stuttgart urban planning department.</p><p>During these sessions, we presented all the indicators, and participants allocated points based on their perception of the indicators’ importance and relevance to reflect the level of&nbsp;risk.</p> User Interface <p>To present the results of the LBS in spatial data, maps are produced using a Geographical Information System (GIS) and a web-based interface is developed to provide an interactive dashboard geared to the needs of the city of Stuttgart.</p><p>Maps can effectively present geographical comparisons of climate damage in the city for either spatial unit. Charts can also illustrate the combined risks of one hazard or show the risks of one impact chain in the&nbsp;city.</p><p>The platform features two approaches for the spatial analysis (a) “Explore the risk of a location” and (b) “Find locations (with characteristic X)”.</p><p>The dashboard function “Explore the risk of a location” analyses each (project) location in the Stuttgart city area preferred by users, supported by an address field input and zoom function.</p>Screenshots of the platform: “Explore specific risk &amp; NbS adaptation potential of a location” on the left, “Find locations with characteristic X” on the&nbsp;right (3) What comes&nbsp;next <p>Now that we have the platform for Stuttgart, there are various opportunities for the municipality to choose to use the results to support decision-making and enable more effective development, maintenance, and monitoring of&nbsp;NbS.</p>  Guide the location of NbS by identifying areas susceptible to climate risks. LBS can potentially connect different urban structures with specific Nature-Based Solution (NBS) types, optimizing resilience strategies tailored to distinct risk profiles.  Guide the design of NbS by pointing out the location's risk profile, for example, choosing SuDS-enabled trees in areas of flood&nbsp;risk.  Guide the development of maintenance schedules, as LBS can highlight areas where existing trees are at higher risk of drought or pests due to factors like soil conditions, urban heat islands, or insufficient care.  Guide policy by providing data to policymakers for creating and implementing environmental regulations based on spatial&nbsp;risks.  <p>Beyond this, we are exploring how LBS could be linked to ecosystem valuation tools to support a more radical and collaborative approach to delivering and financing urban forestry, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Raising private capital as outcome payments for the benefits provided by&nbsp;trees.  Supporting private land-owners to contribute to risk mitigation through nature-based adaptation.  Assist utility companies and infrastructure developers in choosing optimal locations for integrating green infrastructure in their locations.  Integrate LBS into real estate databases or insurance risk assessment models  Repurposing budgets from preventive health initiatives to fund&nbsp;NBS  <p>If you are based in Stuttgart and want to get involved, or if you are from another city and want to find out more, don’t hesitate to get in touch at: <a href="mailto:treesai@darkmatterlabs.org">treesai@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p>TreesAI LBS in Stuttgart: Sebastian Klemm, Chloe Treger, Sofia Valentini, Gurden&nbsp;Batra</p><p>GUS in Stuttgart: Oguzhan Yayla, Bulent Ozel, Cynthia Mergel and Jake Doran<br><br>Platform Design &amp; Code: Arianna Smaron, Alessandra Puricelli, Gurden&nbsp;Batra</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/treesai-is-implementing-location-based-scoring-in-stuttgart-c54c752bdaaf">TreesAI is implementing location-based scoring in Stuttgart</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Este guia do usuário foi traduzido da versão em inglês <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/5-19-2023-user-faq">aqui</a>. Por favor, desculpe quaisquer imprecisões na tradução!</p>
<p>Bem-vindo ao aplicativo Bluesky! Este é um guia do usuário que responde a algumas perguntas comuns.</p>
<p>Para perguntas gerais sobre a empresa Bluesky, por favor, visite nosso FAQ <a>aqui</a>.</p>
 Entrando no Bluesky 
<p>Como faço para me juntar ao Bluesky?</p>
<p>Você pode criar uma conta em <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>. (Não é necessário código de convite!)</p>
<p>Você pode baixar o aplicativo Bluesky para <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">iOS</a> ou <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play</a>, ou usar o Bluesky via <a href="https://bsky.app/">desktop</a>.</p>
 Moderação 
<p>Qual é a abordagem do Bluesky para a moderação?</p>
<p>A moderação é uma parte fundamental das redes sociais. No Bluesky, estamos investindo em segurança de duas formas. Primeiro, construímos nossa própria equipe de moderação dedicada a fornecer cobertura contínua para manter nossas diretrizes comunitárias. Além disso, reconhecemos que não existe uma abordagem única para a moderação — nenhuma empresa pode garantir a segurança online corretamente para todos os países, culturas e comunidades do mundo. Portanto, também estamos construindo algo maior — um ecossistema de moderação e ferramentas de segurança de código aberto que dá às comunidades o poder de criar seus próprios espaços, com suas próprias normas e preferências. Ainda assim, usar o Bluesky é familiar e intuitivo. É um aplicativo simples à primeira vista, mas por baixo do capô, habilitamos uma verdadeira inovação e competição nas mídias sociais ao construir um novo tipo de rede aberta.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre nossa abordagem para moderação <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">aqui</a>.</p>
<p>O que a função de silenciar faz?</p>
<p>Silenciar impede que você veja quaisquer notificações ou postagens principais de uma conta. Se eles responderem a um tópico, você verá uma seção que diz "Postagem de uma conta que você silenciou" com uma opção para mostrar a postagem. A conta não saberá que foi silenciada.</p>
<p>O que o bloqueio faz?</p>
<p>O bloqueio impede a interação. Quando você bloqueia uma conta, tanto você quanto a outra conta não poderão mais ver ou interagir com as postagens uma da outra.</p>
<p>Como eu denuncio abuso?</p>
<p>Você pode denunciar postagens clicando no menu de três pontos. Você também pode denunciar uma conta inteira visitando o perfil dela e clicando no menu de três pontos lá.</p>
<p>Onde posso ler mais sobre seus planos para moderação?</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre nossa abordagem para moderação <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">aqui</a>.</p>
 Feeds Personalizados 
<p>O que são feeds personalizados?</p>
<p>Feeds personalizados é um recurso no Bluesky que permite escolher o algoritmo que define sua experiência nas mídias sociais. Imagine querer que sua linha do tempo exiba apenas postagens dos seus contatos mútuos, ou apenas postagens com fotos de gatos, ou somente postagens relacionadas a esportes — você pode simplesmente selecionar seu feed preferido de um mercado aberto.</p>
<p>Para os usuários, a capacidade de personalizar seu feed devolve o controle de sua atenção para si mesmos. Para os desenvolvedores, um mercado aberto de feeds proporciona a liberdade de experimentar e publicar algoritmos que qualquer um pode usar.</p>
<p>Por exemplo, experimente <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/feed/hot-classic">este feed</a>.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre feeds personalizados e escolha algorítmica em nosso <a>post no blog aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Como eu uso feeds personalizados?</p>
<p>No Bluesky, clique no ícone de hashtag na parte inferior do aplicativo. A partir daí, você pode adicionar e descobrir novos feeds. Você também pode explorar diretamente os feeds através <a href="https://bsky.app/feeds">deste link</a>.</p>
<p>Como posso criar um feed personalizado?</p>
<p>Desenvolvedores podem usar nosso <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">kit inicial de gerador de feeds</a> para criar um feed personalizado. Eventualmente, forneceremos ferramentas melhores para que qualquer pessoa, incluindo não desenvolvedores, possa construir feeds personalizados.</p>
<p>Além disso, <a href="https://skyfeed.app/">SkyFeed</a> é uma ferramenta criada por um desenvolvedor independente que possui um recurso de Construtor de Feeds que você pode usar.</p>
 Domínios Personalizados 
<p>Como posso configurar meu domínio como meu identificador?</p>
<p>Por favor, consulte nosso tutorial <a>aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Posso comprar um domínio diretamente pelo Bluesky?</p>
<p>Sim, você pode comprar um domínio e definí-lo como seu nome de usuário pelo Bluesky <a href="https://account.bsky.app/">aqui</a>.</p>
 Privacidade de Dados 
<p>O que é público e o que é privado no Bluesky?</p>
<p>O Bluesky é uma rede social pública. Pense nas suas postagens como postagens de blog – qualquer pessoa na web pode vê-las, mesmo aquelas sem um código de convite. Um código de convite simplesmente concede acesso ao serviço que estamos executando e que permite publicar uma postagem você mesmo. (Desenvolvedores familiarizados com a API podem ver todas as postagens, independentemente de terem ou não uma conta própria.)</p>
<p>Especificamente:</p>
 
 Postagens e curtidas são públicas. 
 Bloqueios são públicos. 
 Silenciamentos são privados, mas as listas de silenciamento são listas públicas. Suas assinaturas de lista de silenciamento são privadas. 
 
<p>Por que minhas postagens, curtidas e bloqueios são públicos?</p>
<p>O Protocolo AT, no qual o Bluesky é construído, foi projetado para suportar conversas públicas. Para tornar as conversas públicas portáteis em todos os tipos de plataformas, seus dados são armazenados em repositórios de dados que qualquer pessoa pode visualizar. Isso significa que, independentemente de qual servidor você escolher para se juntar, você ainda poderá ver postagens em toda a rede, e se escolher mudar de servidor, poderá facilmente levar todos os seus dados com você. É isso que faz com que a experiência do usuário do Bluesky, um protocolo federado, seja semelhante a todos os outros aplicativos de mídia social que você usou antes.</p>
<p>Posso definir meu perfil para ser privado?</p>
<p>Atualmente, não existem perfis privados no Bluesky.</p>
<p>O que acontece quando eu excluo uma postagem?</p>
<p>Depois de excluir uma postagem, ela será imediatamente removida do aplicativo voltado para o usuário. Qualquer imagem anexada à sua postagem também será imediatamente excluída em nosso armazenamento de dados.</p>
<p>No entanto, leva um pouco mais de tempo para o conteúdo de texto de uma postagem ser completamente excluído no armazenamento. O conteúdo do texto é armazenado de forma não legível, mas é possível consultar os dados via API. Realizaremos periodicamente exclusões no back-end para apagar completamente esses dados.</p>
<p>Posso obter uma cópia de todos os meus dados?</p>
<p>Sim — o Protocolo AT mantém os dados do usuário em um <a href="https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car">arquivo endereçado por conteúdo</a>. Este arquivo pode ser usado para migrar dados de conta entre servidores. Para desenvolvedores, você pode usar <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/com/atproto/sync/getRepo.json">este método</a> para exportar uma cópia do seu repositório. Para não desenvolvedores, as ferramentas ainda estão sendo construídas para facilitar.</p>

 Segurança 
<p>Como posso redefinir minha senha?</p>
<p>Clique em "Esqueci" na tela de login. Você receberá um e-mail com um código para redefinir a senha.</p>
<p>E se eu não receber o e-mail para redefinição de senha?</p>
<p>Confirme o e-mail da sua conta nas suas configurações e adicione <a href="mailto:noreply@bsky.social">noreply@bsky.social</a> à sua lista de remetentes permitidos.</p>
<p>Como posso alterar o e-mail da minha conta?</p>
<p>Você pode atualizar e verificar o e-mail da sua conta nas Configurações.</p>
<p>Vocês implementarão autenticação de dois fatores (2FA)?</p>
<p>Sim, a implementação da 2FA está em nosso plano de desenvolvimento a curto prazo.</p>
 Bluesky, o Protocolo AT e Federação 
<p>Qual a diferença entre Bluesky e o Protocolo AT?</p>
<p>Bluesky, a empresa de benefício público, está desenvolvendo dois produtos: o <a href="https://atproto.com/">Protocolo AT</a>, e o aplicativo de microblogging Bluesky. O aplicativo Bluesky tem como objetivo demonstrar as funcionalidades do protocolo subjacente. O Protocolo AT é construído para suportar um ecossistema inteiro de aplicativos sociais que vai além do microblogging.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre as diferenças entre Bluesky e o Protocolo AT em nosso FAQ geral <a>aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Como a federação me afeta, como usuário do aplicativo Bluesky?</p>
<p>Estamos priorizando a experiência do usuário e queremos tornar o Bluesky o mais amigável possível. Independentemente de qual servidor você se juntar, você pode ver postagens de pessoas em outros servidores e levar seus dados com você se escolher mudar de servidor.</p>
<p>O Bluesky é construído em uma blockchain? Ele usa criptomoeda?</p>
<p>Não e não.</p>
<p>O Bluesky suporta domínios Handshake (HNS)?</p>
<p>Não, e não há planos para isso.</p>
 Diversos 
<p>Como posso enviar feedback?</p>
<p>No aplicativo móvel, abra o menu lateral esquerdo e clique em "Feedback". No aplicativo web, há um link para "Enviar feedback" no lado direito da tela.</p>
<p>Você também pode enviar e-mails para <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a> com solicitações de suporte.</p>
<p>Como uma postagem no Bluesky é chamada?</p>
<p>O termo oficial é "postagem".</p>
<p>Como posso incorporar uma postagem?</p>
<p>Existem duas maneiras de incorporar uma postagem do Bluesky. Você pode clicar no menu de três pontos diretamente na postagem que deseja incorporar para usar o snippet de código.</p>
