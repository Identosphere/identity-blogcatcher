<p><a href="https://rankone.io/">Rank One</a> is once again <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-warns-about-cyberthreats-us-supply-chain-100704/">raising the alarm</a> about the security of United States infrastructure, and is urging the White House to amend ‘Buy American’ rules to further ensure that potentially adversarial technologies aren’t being imported into American infrastructure.</p>



<p>In a statement, the facial recognition leader pointed specifically to an Executive Order issued back in President Biden’s first week in office. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-proposed-buy-american-rule-advancing-the-presidents-commitment-to-ensuring-the-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas/">Executive Order 14005</a>, “Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America’s Workers”, was broadly aimed at reassessing some of the waivers and exemptions present in ‘Made-in-America’ laws, and offered proposed reforms that would help to ensure that the federal government is procuring products from American companies.</p>



<p>Now, Rank One wants the White House to take action, particularly with respect to a longstanding exemption to commercial IT products. The company noted that this exemption was implemented 15 years ago, and that it is no longer appropriate in the current cybersecurity landscape.</p>



<p>“The exemption should be removed at minimum with respect to software such as facial recognition that powers critical government applications, and federal procurement should emphasize a strong bias in favor of using trusted, U.S.-made software solutions,” the company said.</p>



<p>Rank One knows what it’s talking about. The company is a U.S.-based leader in facial recognition technology, offering a solution that has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-shows-significant-accuracy-gains-latest-frvt-test-091706/">delivered impressive results</a> in the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Ongoing Face Recognition Vendor Test.</p>



<p>Rank One is also emerging as <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-pushes-industry-led-code-conduct-ethical-use-facial-recognition-090901/">a leading industry voice</a> in the call for ethical guidelines for AI and facial recognition. And for those who shares the company’s concerns, the importance of a Buy American approach to these technologies is readily apparent in consideration of the abuses that facial recognition is enabling <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/deepglint-is-latest-chinese-facial-recognition-firm-added-to-us-blacklist-707122/">in countries like China</a>.</p>



<p>Ethical considerations aside, though, Rank One believes there is a strong self-interest-driven case for a Buy American approach to facial recognition.</p>



<p>“Due to the gravity of potential harm that could arise from Artificial Intelligence-based attacks by foreign adversaries, trusted U.S. technology providers should be strongly preferred by federal government customers and domestic companies who take IT security risks serious,” said Rank One COO and General Counsel David Ray.</p>

<p><a href="https://oosto.com/">Oosto</a> is celebrating the Australian Information Commissioner’s recent <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/australian-information-commissioner-finds-clearview-violated-privacy-act-110901/">ruling against Clearview AI</a>, framing it as a validation of the company’s ethical guidelines concerning facial recognition technology.</p>



<p>The recent ruling concerned Clearview’s controversial use of facial recognition technology. The company is now notorious for scanning the internet, including social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, to build a face database for its facial recognition platform, which has been sold to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/despite-denials-leaked-log-shows-dutch-police-used-clearview-biometric-tech-083103/">law enforcement agencies</a>, retailers, and other clients.</p>



<p>Clearview has been accused of privacy violations and unethical behavior by a number of parties, and revelations of its work have prompted multiple investigations from <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/commissioner-rules-rcmps-clearview-contract-violated-canadian-privacy-law-061104/">regulators and other government agencies</a> around the world. One of those was the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which determined that the company’s practices were in violation of the Australian Privacy Act of 1988, largely for collecting citizens’ biometric data without their consent and using “unfair means” to do so.</p>



<p>For Oosto – itself a facial recognition specialist – it’s a textbook case of what not to do. Almost literally: the company recently <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-ebook-makes-case-for-ethical-facial-recognition-711012/">published an eBook</a> in which it made the case for implementing ethical guidelines to govern the development and use of this biometric technology. Among the guidelines is the recommendation that facial recognition vendors only sell the technology itself to clients, and not pre-built databases.</p>



<p>“Scraping images of people from the web without their consent is, in our view, a serious violation of the right to privacy,” said Oosto CEO Avi Golan. “As a vendor of AI based facial recognition products for private companies and government agencies it is important for me to emphasize – facial recognition apps should be provided with an empty database.”</p>



<p>In recent weeks Golan has been overseeing a major strategic pivot on the part of his company, which has rebranded from its previous moniker, AnyVision, and sought to expand its focus beyond biometric security and into new application areas for its computer vision technology. To that end, the company recently announced a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Biometric Research Center, whose founder and director, Marios Savvides, is now Oosto’s Chief AI Scientist.</p>

<p>Germany-based identity verification specialist <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a> is celebrating continuing success in the United Kingdom market. In a newly issued statement, the company boasted that it “has grown eightfold year-over-year” in the UK.</p>



<p>The company <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idnow-discusses-immunity-credentials-uk-government-061706/">opened offices in London and Manchester</a> in 2019, and engaged in discussions with the British government about the possibility of developing a COVID-19 immunity credential. The company went on to report new hires and a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-celebrates-uk-growth-amid-rising-demand-biometric-identity-verification-101303/">1,400 percent increase in order intakes</a> the following year.</p>



<p>A private company, IDnow is not burdened with the obligation of providing comprehensive financial data, and the timeframe for its newly reported eightfold growth in the UK is unclear, nor is it clear whether its growth refers to revenues, bookings, or some other metric. But the company clearly has some momentum, having acquired <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-to-acquire-fellow-biometric-onboarding-specialist-ariadnext-706301/">selfie-based identity verification specialist ARIADNEXT</a> earlier this year; and the company’s management are adamant about a very positive growth trend in the UK.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing a significant rise in demand for our services from the UK market this year,” asserted IDnow CEO Andreas Bodczek, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic pushed many organizations into accelerating digital transformation, which in turn entailed rising demand for strong authentication security.</p>



<p>Indeed, these trends have resulted in considerable success for the entire selfie biometrics segment, with multiple vendors having <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/selfie-onboarding-boom-delivers-record-growth-socure-081003/">reported large increases</a> in revenues and bookings in recent months.</p>



<p>“Since we launched into the UK in 2019, we’ve seen consistent growth, as businesses look to deploy the most secure digital onboarding processes possible,” explained IDnow UK&amp;I Director Roger Tyrzyk, “As digitisation continues at pace, we are expecting this demand to continue to grow and as a result, will be looking to further invest in our UK presence, with plans to create more jobs over the next 12 months.”</p>

<p>Biometric authentication and security solutions provider BIO-key International, Inc. has announced that cyber threat intelligence services expert Cyberlitica is the latest member of its Channel Alliance Partner Program (CAP).</p>



  



<p>The partnership aims to help customers address the core functions of a successful cybersecurity program as outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.</p>



<p>“Because of the many high-profile companies and government agencies that we work with, Cyberlitica chooses&nbsp;its partners very carefully with a vetting process that’s one of the strictest in the industry,” said Bob Schiff, Founder and CEO of Cyberlitica. “That’s why we chose BIO-key as our ‘Best of Breed’ partner for authentication. We know they have the products and services that our clients want and will service them with the support that each client needs to be successful&nbsp;in a very unpredictable world.”</p>



<p>Cyberlitica’s suite of products offers its customers — whether they are individuals or companies — a range of products and services aimed at helping them prevent and fight cyber-warfare, account takeover, and fraud. This is of particular importance at present as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has forced record numbers of people online throughout the world, resulting in instances of fraud and other cybercrime to grow in step with this increase in online traffic.</p>



<p>“Customers need multiple, interoperable solutions to solve their cybersecurity challenges,” said Fred Corsentino, CRO, BIO-key. “We look forward to working together with Cyberlitica to help customers improve their security posture, prevent cyberattacks, and solve their identity and access management challenges.”</p>



<p>Cyberlitica joins <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-adds-intelisys-channel-partner-program-091305/">a growing list</a> of partners that have joined the CAP program, including ScanSource subsidiary Intelisys in Sept 2021, and UVS Infotech earlier this year.</p>



<p>Adding to what has already been a busy and successful year for the company, with Bio-Key having reported a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-reports-223-yoy-revenue-increase-in-q2-update-708172/">223 percent year-over-year increase in its revenues</a> in its Q2 update this past summer, owing in large part to its July 2020 acquisition of PistolStar and its flagship <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-completes-acquisition-of-pistolstar-107022/">PortalGuard IAM solution.</a></p>

 “Safety and security is in our DNA at CLEAR, and we’ve spent the past decade building a brand that stands for trust.” – Caryn Seidman-Becker, CEO, CLEAR 



  



<p><a href="https://www.clearme.com/">CLEAR</a> appears to be cooking up a big new identity verification offering, and has achieved an important certification on its path to commercialization. The company has revealed that a new “High Assurance Mobile Enrollment” solution has been approved by the Kantara Initiative as a Component Service.</p>



<p>The Kantara Initiative is <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-joins-kantara-board-of-directors-031108/">an industry alliance</a> whose goal is to establish and promote standards and best practices for digital identity and privacy. Its board members include major names such as Microsoft and IDEMIA.</p>



<p>Kantara’s certification confirms compliance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-63 rev.3 Class of Approval at Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2). For CLEAR, this will help the company to assure its partners and customers of its new solution’s privacy protections.</p>



<p>“Safety and security is in our DNA at CLEAR, and we’ve spent the past decade building a brand that stands for trust,” explained CLEAR CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker. “When a user trusts us with their information, they know it is protected by CLEAR’s comprehensive security program which now includes Kantara’s IAL2 certification – giving our partners and members greater peace of mind.”</p>



<p>As for the “High Assurance Mobile Enrollment” solution that received the certification, CLEAR has so far offered only a few intriguing details. </p>



<p>In its announcement, the company framed the new solution as part of its expansion beyond passenger screening at airports – an effort that is most clearly illustrated in CLEAR’s deployments for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-provides-access-control-university-texas-football-stadium-101805/">large-scale venue access</a>, though it’s also evident in CLEAR’s development of a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gsma-to-use-clear-health-pass-to-screen-mwcla-attendees-810111/">Health Pass mobile app</a> designed to let users confirm their COVID-19 test results and vaccination records.</p>



<p>The “new enrollment process”, meanwhile, will offer a range of use cases, including “age validation for restricted products, biometric payments, and third party account creation and access,” the company explained. These details, together with the name of the solution, suggest that CLEAR’s new solution may ride the momentum of the selfie-based onboarding and mobile ID trends; in any case, further details are surely in the pipeline.</p>

 “Once a given student establishes their digital ID, the companies explained, they will be able to use it in a number of other areas, including opening a bank account, renting a car, or buying age-restricted goods such as alcohol.” 



  



<p>Brazil-based identity verification specialist <a href="https://idwall.co/">idwall</a> has teamed up with an edutech-focused compatriot and a global payments giant to develop a digital identity solution that could end up having a big impact in the Latin American market.</p>



<p>The effort will start with a narrow focus: idwall and <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__amigoedu.com.br&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=uc5ZRXl8dGLM1RMQwf7xTCjRqXF0jmCF6SP0bDlmMmY&amp;r=eziqf-qB-QImPW7plcZjQ-DFzdJtnmt3lnc6zmPzzLE&amp;m=rcBACuJp6AiQHb2uJdSck6iRLYWRXgdlRRYA2sQzPzA&amp;s=uX_639KY-OUf8vLLluhANQ8aAvwuCLXK1Fs4LtXos4c&amp;e=">Amigo Edu</a> will develop a mobile ID app, dubbed “Meu ID”, to let students prove their identity before taking their University Admission Exams and other such academic examinations. The aim is to help students prove that they are actually who they claim to be at a time when remote examination is on the rise.</p>



<p>“COVID-19 altered the education landscape, creating greater opportunities for hybrid learning, while also presenting challenges – like proving your identity,” explained Amigo Edu CEO José Roberto Dantas. “In 2020 alone, we’ve had half a million students participate in a variety of exams and we’re thrilled to be adding a digital identity component to further ensure security for all parties.”</p>



<p>To that end, idwall’s solution leverages a ‘background check’ capability that searches public and private databases, as well as a <a href="https://idwall.co/face-match/">selfie-based biometric verification</a> system in which facial recognition is used to match an end user to their physical ID. The third partner in this effort, Mastercard, is providing “a simple and flexible API-based integration for both organizations to connect to the ID network and enable the secure sharing of the verified identity credentials,” the companies explained in a statement.</p>



<p>In the context of confirming the identities of students taking exams, Mastercard’s involvement may strike some as unusual. But the companies’ long-term aims are much more ambitious. Once a given student establishes their digital ID, the companies explained, they will be able to use it in a number of other areas, including opening a bank account, renting a car, or buying age-restricted goods such as alcohol.</p>



<p>“With this partnership, we accelerate our ambition to create a global digital identity for Latin America,” explained idwall CEO Lincoln Ando.</p>



<p>“With digital identity, consumers can unlock new and enhanced experiences as they interact with businesses, service providers and their communities – making it safer and more efficient to shop online, open a bank account, file taxes or book travel,” added Mastercard Cyber &amp; Intelligence President Ajay Bhalla.</p>



<p>The companies have not yet offered a timeline for how their digital ID solution will roll out across its various use cases, nor have they set an initial launch date for the Meu ID itself.</p>

<p>We’ve already told many folks what we are advising <a href="https://www.cheqd.io">cheqd</a>&nbsp;and participating in the cheqd network as a node operator – but we wanted to provide more information for the community (clear disclosure – that means we will, or do – depending on when you are reading this article – hold cheqd tokens).</p>
<p>This article aims to explain areas where we are aligned with cheqd as well as a few areas we will be pushing them towards.</p>
 1. OUR CLIENTS 
<p>We serve a range of client types (government, military, financial institutions, NGOs, not-for-profits, startups). I’ll deal with them in two distinct groups here as the first group is unique while the others fall into the same broad bucket.</p>
 1.1 GOVERNMENT 
<p>We advise several government agencies and they, right now, aren’t overly interested in token-enabled networks for operational use. However, they do need to understand what things will mean when permissionless ledgers and tokens are “normal” and citizens insist on their use.</p>
 1.2 OTHER CLIENTS (Corporations, Financial Institutions, Startups, Investors, Crypto Projects, and Not for Profits/NGOs) 
<p>We are advising multiple organizations about the state of decentralization/crypto/web3 space and about the key developments in the space. Many of these organizations are either actively interested in understanding what impact permissionless ledgers and tokens will have on them immediately or over the longer term. Their interest ranges from rabid to tepid to allergic. Some may be partial competitors to cheqd but they are also potential collaborators. It’s an interesting mix.</p>
<p>The reason we advise them is that it is our job at Continuum Loop to keep them apprised about where things are headed (here comes an obligatory Canadian hockey quote from a non-sports fan):</p>
<blockquote><p>“I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”</p>
<p>– Wayne Gretzky</p></blockquote>
 2. COMPLIANCE 
<p>For many of our clients, compliance is a big issue. While many of the #decentralizeTheWorld types would like to think that there is no need for this, the world we live in needs it. So part of our efforts with cheqd is in understanding and advising on how the cheqd network fits with various compliance and audit needs.</p>
<p>Payments aren’t simple. Sure, in crypto it is easy to send funds from one address to another on the same chain. Once you start exchanging between different coins/tokens you add quite a bit of complexity. Adding the KYC/AML needs that you will, as a citizen of a country, require and things get hairy quickly.</p>
 3. INTEROP/STANDARDS 
<p>We have been talking more and more about what we call “premature interoperability” and “premature standardization”. The gist of these discussions is that there are only a few areas right now where interoperability and standardization make any sense – and neither have definitive good answers. We’ll be supporting cheqd to align with the key initiatives that we see are making a difference, particularly with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, Hyperledger with the <a href="https://aries-interop.info/aries-interop-intro.html">Aries Interoperability project</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;with its interoperability profile efforts. These leading groups are bringing the industry together and I’ll be helping cheqd play a role there.</p>
 4. GOVERNANCE 
<p>As a founder (and funder) of the Trust Over IP Foundation, the consideration of governance of any ecosystem is critical. We’ve looked at how cheqd could fit into various different ecosystems that we are helping with and are pleased that it fits nicely. It is focused on the creation of a permissionless network. They are working to ensure that no single party holds too much control. In this case, control could easily kill an ecosystem so that is critical. One of my most important operating principles is pinned on my Twitter profile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control only what you must. Influence the rest.</p>
<p>— Darrell O'Donnell 🇨🇦🆔 (@darrello) <a href="https://twitter.com/darrello/status/792496888444575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>A governance-related area that I will be pushing cheqd and others in the SSI/decentralized identity realm relates to where developers fit into the governance structure. To date, the ecosystems we are working with don’t incentivize developers well, or at all. That’s a deep flaw in my view. We have created back-of-napkin incentive concepts that show our team internally what is feasible with cheqd in the longer term, and from the Continuum Loop side, we’re satisfied that we’re off to a good start.</p>
 5. COMMERCIAL MODEL 
<p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is part of what we help our clients understand. One big problem is that to date they really only get uptake where they are radically reducing costs, which is a bottom-line impact for companies.</p>
<p>The more interesting use cases from a business perspective are top-line revenue related – how does a business drive massive value for its customers using verifiable credentials? Any business that drives value deserves a portion of that value (while rent-seekers take oversized percentages of value while adding little or nothing, and should rightly be removed from the system).</p>
<p>The problem has been answering the following range of questions:</p>
 
 How does a Verifier pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Holder pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Verifier pay a Holder; 
 or any variant of those pairings (or more than 2 parties)? 
 
<p>This is indeed a hard problem, especially when you consider how privacy, security, and compliance are impacted when you introduce payment.</p>
<p>Many of our clients feel there is a way to add value and drive revenue with decentralized identity, but we haven’t had any good answers to date. We believe we are getting much closer to that with cheqd and other projects we are working on.</p>
 6. FIAT versus TOKEN 
<p>One of the first questions I asked the cheqd team when we started getting into discussions was how they would make life easy for users that want to use, or just stick with, fiat currency for transactions. They will need to provide details for you but I am satisfied that they are taking a good approach to make fiat payments work – especially when it comes to network fee stability.</p>
<p>On the tokenomics side, we aren’t going to get into the science (magic/mythology/voodoo – pick your term) of tokenomics as that is not our area of deep expertise. However, it is worth mentioning a few things that are important to our clients and our team. Governance is an obvious one. Another is ensuring that the non-token world can be abstracted away from the token when required. Another is how cheqd’s approach may enable commercial models that, to date, have been holding back the use of decentralized identity. The team at cheqd has a coherent explanation of how <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-f13f680cf00d">cheqd is handling the tokenomics here</a>.</p>
 7. SOVRIN 
<p>I have fielded a lot of “but what about Sovrin?” questions. These ones baffle me somewhat, but I get it. I want to be clear, we (Continuum Loop and I) fully support the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> and its mission. I am an ex officio member of the Sovrin Board of Trustees, by virtue of co-chairing the <a href="https://sovrin.org/i4a/">Identity For All Council</a>, which is hosted at the Sovrin Foundation. I volunteer a lot of time with Sovrin and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Similar to Continuum Loop’s work with governments that are working on deploying, or have deployed, Hyperledger Indy networks of their own, Sovrin plays a critical role. We don’t believe that there will be one single SSI network but Sovrin is important both as a network, as well as its facilitator/leader role in a network-of-networks. The cheqd network adds to the diversity in the network-of-networks and I imagine that the two groups will work together nicely.</p>
<p>Sovrin is also the progenitor of much of the leading thinking that is in the space – Trust Over IP Foundation; Sovrin Governance; Hyperledger Indy; and more.</p>
 8. CONCLUSION 
<p>We’re looking forward to learning how our relationship with cheqd shakes out. We’re going to be learning alongside them and our clients. I am sure we will make progress and I am sure we will stumble at times. That’s what we do at Continuum Loop.</p>
<p>Our clients are the ones that face an uncut jungle and do one of two things – grab a machete to cut trail (Innovators*) or look for the narrow trails that other adventurous souls have already started to cut (Early Adopters*). Our clients are not looking for paved roads through well-known paths (majority and laggards). By the time those roads are in place the rest of the world is already using them.</p>
<p>* If the Innovator/Early Adopter terms are unfamiliar check the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle">Technology Adoption Life Cycle</a>. Keep in mind that most folks that talk about the adoption life cycle usually start with “we need the Early Adopters”, when they likely mean they need the Innovators.</p>

<p>Identity platform grew eightfold in the UK compared to previous year, continues to see increasing demand for its solutions.</p>
<p>London and Manchester, November 11th, 2021: IDnow, a leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification from Germany, with offices in Manchester and London, has grown eightfold year-over-year in the UK market.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow, comments: “We’re seeing a significant rise in demand for our services from the UK market this year. The pandemic pushed many industries into accelerating their digitisation, and as part of that, consumers now expect a much quicker and fully digital onboarding process. The knock-on effect of that has been an increase in cybercrime making security more important than ever and meaning businesses have a heightened focus on delivering a safe and secure process for customers.”</p>
<p>IDnow’s UK growth is aligned with the global demand for its solutions. The firm sees substantial interest across the world, with more and more companies deciding to switch to fully digital application processes.</p>
<p>To meet the rising demand, IDnow acquired two companies in 2021: French identity technology provider, ARIADNEXT and German IdentityTM. The merged companies able to offer one of the broadest sets of identity verification solutions to the European market.</p>
<p>IDnow’s Director UK&amp;I, Roger Tyrzyk, adds: “Since we launched into the UK in 2019, we’ve seen consistent growth, as businesses look to deploy most secure digital onboarding processes possible. As digitisation continues at pace, we are expecting this demand to continue to grow and as a result, will be looking to further invest in our UK presence, with plans to create more jobs over the next 12 months. As digital identity experts, our expansion will come at a critical time, as the UK Government moves forward with its Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, a national approach for digital identity solutions which will enable people to prove who they are quickly and safely.”</p>
<p>As part of its high-growth strategy, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become recognised as an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 900 customers worldwide, including Canopy, MyCDD, Entain and ICICI.</p>

<p>Travel and tourism was one of the worst affected industries due to the COVID pandemic.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.unwto.org/unwto-world-tourism-barometer-data">UNWTO World Tourism Barometer</a>, international travel fell by 72% in January-October 2020 when compared to the previous year, resulting in a loss of about USD 935&nbsp;billion.</p><p>In 2021, things began to look up for this industry as it saw a reasonable recovery, thanks in part to the widespread availability of vaccinations. Another important aspect that bolstered the travel industry is the adoption of digital vaccination certificates and travel passes that boosted the confidence of people to travel&nbsp;again.</p><p>At a time when airline companies and airport authorities were scrambling to check the vaccination status of their passengers, these digital credentials streamlined the verification process and created a safe travel experience for everyone involved.</p><p>The European Union digital COVID certificate and Affinidi’s safe travel passes played a big role in different geographies to get people to travel&nbsp;again.</p> Affinidi’s Safe&nbsp;Travel <p>Affinidi’s Safe travel, in particular, made a big difference in boosting travel in Southeast and Central Asia by providing end-to-end validated digital health credential solutions based on <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">self-sovereign identity</a>.</p><p>Essentially, any traveler who tested negative in the RT-PCR test was given a vaccination credential mentioning the same, and this could be shared securely with the airline, airport authorities, or any other verifier as needed. This interoperable solution used QR codes for easy verification and followed the principles of self-sovereign identity such as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security</a>, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">selective disclosure</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This created a sense of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust</a> for the verifying entities because these <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> are tamper-proof and machine-verifiable, and hence required no physical contact. As for passengers, it was a safe and secure way to share their vaccination status <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">without revealing</a> additional personal information.</p><p>In all, it worked well for every stakeholder in the travel industry.</p><p>While this has been helpful to create a sense of confidence during the pandemic, what happens in a post-pandemic world?

More importantly, are there more ways to generate revenue from these credentials?</p><p>To explore these answers and to discuss new revenue streams within the travel industry using digital credentials, join us for Affinidi’s webinar on November 25th at 4 pm&nbsp;SGT.</p><p>Toby Berger, the Director of Travel Affinidi, and Shankar Pillai, the Director of Engineering. Health/Travel, Affinidi will be talking about the impact of digital credentials in 2022 and&nbsp;beyond.</p> What to Expect from the&nbsp;Webinar? <p>In this webinar, Toby will be talking about the main adopters (issuers, holders, and verifiers) of the COVID verification solutions and relevant use-cases.

<p>“Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machines are able to interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer-to-peer networks without the need for third parties. The result:&nbsp;a composable human-centric and privacy preserving computing fabric for the next wave of the web.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This quote from venture capitalists Max Mersch and Richard Muirhead writing in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>&nbsp;is a pretty good answer to the question, as is this from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=745d290558df">Forbes Technology Council</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The rise of technologies such as distributed ledgers and storage on blockchain will allow for data decentralization and create a transparent and secure environment, overtaking Web 2.0’s centralization, surveillance and exploitative advertising. Decentralized infrastructure and application platforms will displace centralized tech giants, and individuals will be able to rightfully own their data.”</p>



<p>Clearly Web 3.0 will shake up data privacy and change the data economy as we know it. Indeed, as the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) suggested in 2018, Web 3.0 might just be the answer to our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy woes</a>.</p>



 What is Web 3.0? 



<p></p>



<p>Web 3.0 is the latest iteration of the internet that’s arriving even as Web 2.0 still consumes us. Web 3.0 goes by several different monikers: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">decentralized internet</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">spatial web</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">semantic web</a>. A brief history of the internet’s evolution puts Web 3.0 in context:</p>



  Web 1.0 was&nbsp;static desktop web pages.  Web 2.0 is interactive content on desktop, mobile and social media, and constant connection via devices.  Web 3.0 will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">marked</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;open source software&nbsp;and trustless&nbsp;(users interact publicly or privately without a trusted third party)&nbsp;and&nbsp;permissionless&nbsp;(no governing body)&nbsp;networks. It will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">built</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;edge computing,&nbsp;decentralised data networks&nbsp;and&nbsp;artificial intelligence.  



<p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte</a>&nbsp;says Web 3.0 or the spatial web will combine machine learning from the semantic web with distributed ledger technologies like blockchain to authenticate and decentralize information resulting in “interaction with information away from screens and into physical space.”</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>



<p>And this shows how Deloitte sees the spatial web continuing to emerge from now:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a><br>



<p>Clearly, the hallmarks of Web 3.0 will be decentralization and greater user interaction and control over data. Data will be dispersed across an array of computing resources, including phones, appliances, sensors and vehicles,&nbsp;rather than held exclusively in central data stores&nbsp;and, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>&nbsp;says, it&nbsp;“will eventually eliminate the boundary between digital content and physical objects that we know today” and “improve efficiency, communication and entertainment in ways we are only beginning to imagine today.”</p>



<p>The enabling technologies of Web 3.0 are the innovations we’re already seeing, such as&nbsp;augmented and virtual reality, advanced networking (e.g. 5G), geolocation, Internet of Things devices and sensors, distributed ledger technology (e.g. blockchain), and artificial intelligence and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are one example of Web 3.0 innovation, but as Mersch and Murihead say in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>, Web 3.0 goes way beyond cryptocurrencies to crypto-connections of people, corporates and machines … “leading to a “return to the global village” — daily immersion in the human-centric and highly personalised interactions from which we used to benefit, yet now delivered at the global scale of the internet and supporting an ever-increasing myriad of human and machine skills specialisations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;sees Web 3.0 as promoting “true sovereignty” where users own and control&nbsp;who profits from an individual’s time and information … “and eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it.”</p>



 What does Web 3.0 mean for privacy? 



<p></p>



<p>For privacy, this brave new world will mean humans, enterprises and machines can share more data with far greater privacy and security. We will no longer rely on (or will at least interact on our own terms with) Big Tech platforms with all their inherent risks, and users will own their own data and digital footprint via&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">IAPP</a>&nbsp;laid out exactly what Web 3.0 could mean for privacy and was highly optimistic:&nbsp;</p>



  We’ll use cryptographically secured digital identities to trustlessly complete transactions that currently require us to give up our highly sensitive and highly valuable&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. We will no longer be the product and return to being the customer.  The Googles of the world will no longer control our data and bad actors will be less able to attack it. What’s more, governments won’t control our data either. Instead, all apps, users and connected devices will interact directly and data will be stored in secure decentralized ways. This will mean we’ll see fewer data breaches that affect large numbers of users, and rightfully return control of data to individual users.  The “middleman” of centralized identity management on the web will be obsolete and users will instead interact directly using&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">self-sovereign identities</a>.&nbsp;  



 Obviously, this is all sounds like a data privacy nirvana, but the IAPP has two warnings:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



  Privacy regulations might be stumbling blocks and regulators will need to unravel issues including:  Who is the controller/processor for decentralized personal data  Where would the decentralized data be stored – location and jurisdiction&nbsp;  How to respond to subject access requests, and which entities are required to respond to such requests  How to delete or change personal information on and off the blockchain.<br>  Easy to use and convenient decentralized applications will be paramount for the average user.&nbsp;  



<p>And that’s where Anonyome Labs is helping to realize the vision of Web 3.0. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">applications and platforms</a> are already allowing users and enterprise partners to create and manage multiple digital identities via our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, with each Sudo providing a range of privacy protecting capabilities.

<p>The time has finally arrived! As of November 11 at 4:14 pm CET, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a fully decentralized blockchain network. This means that BOTLabs GmbH, the company behind the development of KILT Protocol, has handed over decision-making to the community. From now on, KILT will be run via a sophisticated system of governance in which any KILT Coin holder can propose changes to the network that can be voted on by the community. This level of decentralization is what makes Web3, the next generation of the internet, truly fair and exciting.</p> Decentralization Day <p>Until now, a Sudo Key module allowed the development team to make any necessary changes to the blockchain on behalf of the network without the vote of the KILT community. Now that the network has been audited and these functionalities are running as planned, the time has come for the community to take&nbsp;control.</p><p>Today KILT reached the final step of decentralization. The Sudo Key was removed and governance of the KILT blockchain transitioned into the hands of its community.</p> Governance at&nbsp;work <p>The first proposal in front of KILT community governance is to allow tokens to be transferred (TTE) and to distribute the “thank you” KILT Coins to supporters of the crowdloan. With sufficient backing, this proposal will go to referendum at the end of this week (by 12 November) for KILT Coin holders to vote on over the following 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Following a successful referendum, proposals are automatically carried out on KILT on-chain by the system, after an enactment period of one day. So it can be expected that the KILT Coins will be distributed to crowdloan supporters in around two weeks’ time. Follow the process on-chain <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.kilt.io%2F#/democracy">here</a> to see blockchain democracy in&nbsp;action!</p> The Path to Decentralization <p>Over three years of planning and development have gone into bringing KILT Protocol to this point. First conceived in 2018, KILT was developed by <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/about-us/">BOTLabs under the direction of Ingo Rübe</a>. From the beginning, KILT was designed to evolve into a decentralized blockchain network that aims to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy and dignity to the individual as well as enabling innovative, industry-agnostic business models around identity.</p><p>Thanks to support from its community, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-wins-kusama-parachain-auction-slot-6-launches-mainnet-a48aed4ed5e0">KILT</a> secured a parachain slot on the <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> network and launched as a live blockchain on September 8th of this year. KILT was designed as a limited delegated proof of stake (<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">LDPoS</a>) system, with delegators who support a network of collators that hold and secure the data of the KILT blockchain and create blocks. Following this design, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-first-cohort-of-kilts-initial-collators-programme-4e4b65159246">an initial cohort</a> of 16 active collators were onboarded at launch. This number is expected to increase to 75 in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>Since launch, the development team of KILT Protocol added functions such as staking, governance, and a Treasury, which will fund projects that support the KILT ecosystem, approved by community vote. <a href="https://www.kilt.io/how-it-works/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials</a> were also added to provide developers with tools to create businesses around identity and credentials.</p> In the Hands of the Community <p>As part of handing over the network to the ecosystem, BOTLabs GmbH, the company that developed KILT, will publish a series of how-to guides and blogs over the next few weeks to help the community to take control of their network. These will include guidance on how to become an active participant in the ecosystem including how to vote and how to stake on&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>Keep an eye on KILT’s <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> to follow these exciting developments and to learn how to become an active member of the KILT community!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralized identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-transitions-to-a-fully-decentralized-network-8edc5f66ed9f">KILT Transitions to a Fully Decentralized Network</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 10.11.2021 Die Zukunft gehört digitalen Identitäten  <p>Der Fachartikel “Elektronische Gesundheitskarte auf dem Prüfstand: Die Zukunft gehörte digitalen Identitäten” ist als Titelstory in der aktuellen Ausgabe der E-HEALTH-COM, dem unabhängigen Fachmagazin für Gesundheitstelematik, vernetzte Medizintechnik, Telemedizin und Health-IT für Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz erschienen. In dem Beitrag von Christian Hälker, Michael Hartmann und Dominik Deimel geht es um die Lösung des sicheren Zugriffs auf die Gesundheitsdatenautobahn ohne elektronische Gesundheitskarte.</p><p>„Ohne eGK in die TI“: Mit dieser Herausforderung startete Ende 2020 der Verband der Privaten Krankenversicherung (PKV Verband) ein Innovationsprojekt zu digitalen Identitäten. Es findet mittlerweile große Aufmerksamkeit und könnte die Zukunft der deutschen Telematikinfrastruktur entscheidend mitprägen.</p><p>In einer Marktrecherche im zweiten Halbjahr 2020 hat sich der PKV-Verband mit unterschiedlichen Ansätzen bei der Realisierung digitaler Identitäten in der Branche beschäftigt und sich für eine Innovationspartnerschaft mit den Firmen msg systems ag und comuny entschieden.</p><p>Seit Februar 2021 arbeiten diese beiden Unternehmen zusammen mit den privaten Krankenversicherungen Allianz, Debeka, Signal Iduna und mit Beteiligung der gematik unter der Koordination des PKV-Verbands an der technischen Realisierung der Lösung zum Zugang zur TI ohne eGK. Im August hat sich diesem Projekt auch die BARMER als erste gesetzliche Krankenversicherung angeschlossen und im September dann die ERGO/DKV als weitere PKV, um den Einsatz des Lösungsansatzes für ihre Versicherten zu eruieren.</p><p>Ziel ist, Identitäten auf dem Mobilgerät komfortabel zu erzeugen und zu nutzen. Der Anspruch der PKV an digitale Identitäten ist hoch, sie müssen sicher sein und dem Konzept der gematik zum föderierten Identitätsmanagement entsprechen. Danach sollen mit einem Zugang viele digitale Lösungen in der TI erreichbar sein.</p><p>Die Ende September abgeschlossene Konzeptions- und technische Umsetzungsphase konnte allen Beteiligten die Machbarkeit und die Vorteile eines IDP-Lösungsansatzes mit Datenhaltung und Prozesssteuerung auf dem Mobilgerät aufzeigen. Das Innovationsprojekt konnte aufzeigen, dass die Einführung von physischen eGK-Diensten wie E-Rezept und ePA für private Krankenversicherer nicht zwangsläufig notwendig sein wird. Jeder Versicherer stellt zukünftig einen Identitätsprovider bereit, lässt diesen hierfür bei der gematik zu und betreibt ihn anschließend entkoppelt von eigenen Fachanwendungen wie zum Beispiel der ePA […].</p><p><a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/EHC_Sonderdruck_Digitale-Identitaeten_PKV-Verband_Online.pdf">Weiterlesen?

<p><br>Another day, another data breach! &nbsp;It's the reason why Bloom was founded and why we feel so passionately about what we build. &nbsp;These breaches will just continue to happen until we shift the paradigm from centrally stored personal data to models built around decentralized identity. &nbsp;Let’s take a look at the facts of this latest breach.<br></p><p>Robinhood Data Breach Compromises Names and Email Addresses of Millions of Customers<br></p><p>On November 3, <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a> released a statement that an unauthorized intruder gained access to the personal information of millions of its customers. &nbsp;The data breach compromised the email addresses of approximately five million people, and separately, the full names of around two million people. &nbsp;Further evidence shows that a smaller number of customers may have had additional personal information exposed.<br></p><p>Based on the on-going investigation, it appears social security numbers and bank account data were not breached, and that there has been no financial loss to any customers. &nbsp;The incident is still under investigation and Robinhood has enlisted the help of law enforcement, as well as Mandiant, a cybersecurity company. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Unfortunately, Robinhood’s data breach is just the latest attack in a year that has seen a record number of breaches. &nbsp;Despite the knowledge that a cybersecurity-related incident was likely, an intruder was able to easily bypass Robinhood’s security system, compromising the information of millions of customers who had put their trust in the company.<br></p><p>Why does this keep happening? &nbsp;When are users going to start to demand that every company they deal with not store their personal information centrally? &nbsp;Decentralization is the future - not just for transactions, but for personal data storage and interactions. &nbsp;Download the Bloom App if you haven't already done so and see why over a million other users believe that their personal information should be theirs. &nbsp;And if you're a business, sign up for an <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp Demo</a> and see what it could mean for your business. &nbsp;It’s time to be proactive about our digital identity.<br></p><p>Data Breaches Reach an All-time High in 2021<br></p><p>As we approach the holiday season, the days are getting shorter, shopping receipts are getting longer, and cybersecurity threats are at an all time high. &nbsp;In fact, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), the number of data breaches so far this year has already <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/identity-theft-resource-center-to-share-latest-data-breach-analysis-with-u-s-senate-commerce-committee-number-of-data-breaches-in-2021-surpasses-all-of-2020/">surpassed the total for 2020</a>. &nbsp;This is extremely alarming news and worrisome as we approach the time of the year when online shopping is at its peak, and more of our personal information is available on the web.<br></p><p>As of now, there have been over 1,290 data breaches - up by 17% since last year. &nbsp;With the exponential growth in the connectivity of cyber devices, and the vulnerability of a centralized intermediary, cybersecurity is more important than ever. &nbsp;Phishing and ransomware attacks continue to be the most prevalent weapons for hackers, and the firm Cybersecurity Ventures estimate that a new ransomware attack will occur every 2 seconds. &nbsp;Ransomware is a criminal extortion tool in which key files are encrypted by hackers, rendering them inaccessible to the victim until a ransom has been paid. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Although ransomware is not a new tactic, the expanded attack surfaces and interconnectivity of digital commerce have made the cybersecurity threat as dangerous as ever. &nbsp;Hackers, constantly seeking new avenues to exploit, are now demanding payments in the form of cryptocurrency. &nbsp;The US Treasury Department has tied approximately $5.2 billion in BitCoin transactions to ransomware payments. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Awareness and Transparency<br></p><p>Cybersecurity is all about risk management. &nbsp;As the number of threats increases, more and more Americans are expressing concern that their personal information, or that of the centralized financial institutions to which they are associated, is at risk. &nbsp;The problem, though, is this: awareness does not necessarily lead to action. &nbsp;Too often, people assume that cybercrime is someone else’s responsibility, and believe that a hack will never affect them personally. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Furthermore, some organizations and governments have purposefully been withholding important data breach notices. &nbsp;In 2017, a ransomware attack called WannaCry, disrupted hospitals, schools, and government organizations in over 100 countries, demonstrating the vulnerability of globally-connected networks and devices. &nbsp;Although the WannaCry attack (and others, including CryptoLocker, WhiteRose, and Petya) was seen by some as a wake-up call, organizations and governments did not fortify against future attacks. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Significant Attacks in 2021<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the more significant attacks that have occurred just this year.<br></p>  Bonobos: In January, Bonobos, a men’s clothing retailer, was victim of a massive breach, in which personally identifiable information (PII) of over 7 million shoppers was leaked in a forum for hackers. &nbsp;The PII included address, phone numbers, account information, and partial credit card numbers.  Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn: Due to an unsecured database, the PII of 214 million social media users was leaked, exposing full names, subscriber data, location, and other contact information.  CNA Insurance: Hackers in March attacked CNA, one of the largest insurance firms in the US, compromising the data of around 75,000 employees, and leading to the halt of trading for a short period of time. &nbsp;CNA Insurance agreed to pay the hackers $40 million to regain access to their ransomed network.  National Basketball Association: This year, the NBA was targeted by a ransomware attack, with the group responsible claiming that they had stolen 500gb of confidential data.  Buffalo Public Schools: Unfortunately, cyberattacks within the education sector are also becoming more prevalent, and in March the Buffalo Public Schools suffered a ransomware attack that targeted highly sensitive information for the 34,000 students within the school district.<br>  <p>As if the pandemic wasn’t hard enough for people, hospitals and healthcare facilities have also become increasingly prone to cyber attacks. &nbsp;Often these critical facilities are forced to comply for fear of shutting down their medical operations. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Securing our digital identities is a universal problem. &nbsp;The interconnectivity of the world we live in means that cyberthreats will continue to impact our lives, and although awareness is increasing, so too is the complexity of the targeted attacks. &nbsp;Information shared with a centralized entity is vulnerable to a breach, as the user loses control of precisely who has their personal data. So, what can be done to mitigate the risk?<br></p><p>The Bloom Solution<br></p><p>Taking proactive measures is a good place to start. &nbsp;Staying hyper-vigilant to cyber trends and utilizing new and emerging tools to help with compliance and risk will certainly help to avoid an attack. &nbsp;Bloom offers a solution for digital identity, user privacy, and risk assessment. &nbsp;In fact, Bloom was founded in response to the 2017 Equifax scandal, in which hackers gained access to the private information of 147 million US citizens. &nbsp;By developing the BloomID, Bloom gave its users the ability to create and control their own digital identities. &nbsp;More recently, with the release of OnRamp, our latest DeFi-focused product, we are securely connecting enterprises to users by offering reusable, verifiable credentials to help enable compliance and risk assessment. &nbsp;This means that your personal information and financial data, used in determining creditworthiness, are available to use on a decentralized platform without sacrificing your privacy. &nbsp;<br></p> Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all with one simple app. No more centralized data storage. No more selling off your data to the highest bidder. Bloom enables you to <a href="https://bloom.co/identity?utm_source=twidb&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=bloomid">own, control, and protect your data</a> using the latest advancements in blockchain technology.It’s time to take back control of your data and unlock the power of a secure identity today. <a href="https://bloom.co/download?utm_source=twidb&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=download">Download the Bloom mobile app</a> to build a digital identity, monitor your credit, and get free data breach alerts with Radar!</p>

<p>,,Auf meinem Bildschirm sehen Sie sechs Menschen‘‘, sagte Frank Puscher. ,,Einige mögen Ihnen sympathischer sein, andere weniger. Was beachtenswert ist: keiner dieser Menschen existiert in echt.‘‘ Unter diesem Eindruck begann die Vortragsreihe zum Thema: ,,Vertrauen im Zeitalter KI-gestützter Bots und Fakes: Herausforderungen und mögliche Lösungen‘‘. Am 4. November 2021 luden das BMWi, BMJ und VDE ein, um über exakt dieses Thema virtuell zu diskutieren, Lösungen zu präsentieren, und auf die Fragen der 103 Teilnehmenden einzugehen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der erste Teil der Fachkonferenz begann mit einer Einführung in die Problemstellung: Es ging zum einen um Fake Reviews im Internet, zum anderen um eine Einführung in das Thema Deep Fakes – eine Mischung von Deep Learning und Fakes. Anschließend gab es Impulsvorträge zu der Kernfrage: Wie schützen wir den politischen Diskurs in Zeiten der Aufmerksamkeitsökonomie? Hier wurden die Herausforderungen bei der Regulierung von Deep Fakes herausgestellt und Beispiele aus der Gegenwart. Im zweiten Teil der Konferenz ging es konkret um die Frage: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Impulsvorträge griffen diese Frage von verschiedenen Ansätzen auf und zeigten Ideen für den möglichen Umgang und Regulierungen von Deep Fakes. &nbsp;</p>



 Teil 1: Wie sieht die Problemstellung aus? KI als globaler Trend.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>Ab wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?</p></blockquote>



<p>Künstliche Intelligenz nimmt mehr Raum in Diskursen ein. Ob in der Altenbetreuung, beim Auftritt in Lernvideos oder Beantworten von Kundenfragen, KI Klone werden uns wohl immer häufiger in der nahen Zukunft begegnen. Dabei handelt es sich durchaus nicht um etwas Exotisches: Eingebettet in unsere Gesellschaft handelt es sich um eine Software, die bereits jeder nutzen kann. Ein anschauliches Beispiel verdeutlicht, dass virtuelle KI Klone sogar CO2 sparen könnten. Wenn Prominente ein Double von sich erstellen, könnten sie zur selben Zeit an verschiedenen Orten sein und müssten nicht selbst reisen. Das führt zwangsläufig zu der Kernfrage: Ist das schlimm? Wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Betrachtet man die Rolle von KI in Deutschland fällt zunächst auf: so weit verbreitet wie in anderen Ländern ist es hier nicht. Bereits 2018 benannte eine Studie des Roland-Koch Instituts die USA als führende Nation im Bereich KI. Vom Amazon Go Supermarket, in welchem man ohne Angestellte, Kasse, und Barcode-Scanner einkaufen kann, bis hin zu KI Klonen, die Termine beim Friseur ausmachen: die USA zeigen Ausschnitte einer Welt, die hier noch nicht Realität, aber definitiv Zukunft sein kann (<a href="https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718">https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doch noch ist es hierzulande weniger verbreitet. Auswirkungen von KI gestützter Fakes auf den politischen Diskurs sind überschaubar, dafür im Handel jedoch mehr ausgeprägt. So lässt sich ein Problemfeld von Fake Reviews im Internet deutlich erkennen: Die negativen Folgen von durch Bots kreierter Fake Reviews kreieren die Gefahr, seriöse Anbieter:innen nicht mehr zu erkennen, ein allgemeines Zurückgehen von Vielfalt, und das Abhängen neuerer Plattformen. Wie eine Studie herausstellte, haben 85% aller befragten Händler:innen bereits negative Auswirkungen auf ihre Verkaufszahlen erlebt – durch Fake Reviews. Problematisch hierbei sind vor allem das Fehlen eines Unrechtsbewusstseins und eine effektivere Rechtsdurchsetzung.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Man sieht: die Grenzen zwischen Realität und Künstlicher Intelligenz vermischen. Ebenfalls ist zu erkennen, dass es sich um ein zukünftiges Problem handelt, welches definitiv Auswirkungen annehmen wird. Freilich bringt das Vorteile mit sich, aber jede Münze hat zwei Seiten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fokussierte man sich in der Fachkonferenz auf das mögliche Ausmaß von KI, wenn keine Regulierungen vorliegen. Auch wenn es sich noch um Zukunftsszenarien handelt, sind negative Folgen bereits absehbar. Diese ziehen sich von der individuellen Ebene (Verletzung von Menschenrechten, Psychologischen Folgen), über die Wirtschaftliche Ebene (Versicherungs- oder Steuerbetrug) bis hin zur ganzen Gesellschaft (Verletzung demokratischer Werte). Kompliziert wird es weiterhin, wenn man die Anonymität der Täter:innen bedenkt oder die rechtlichen Herausforderungen. Das Paradox liegt hierbei zwischen Rechten wie Kunstfreiheit und staatlichen Pflichten, nämlich dem Schutz von Persönlichkeitsrechten. Selbstverständlich ist auch das Erkennen von KI Klonen oder automatisierter Bots nicht immer einfach. Als Bot gilt ein Account, der mehr als 50 Tweets pro Tag twittert. In einer vorgestellten Studie wurde ein Twitter Account eines kanadischen Ingenieurs untersucht, der im Durchschnitt über 300 Tweets pro Tag twitterte. Wie allerdings festgestellt wurde, handelte es sich hierbei allerdings nicht um einen automatisierten Account, sondern um einen echten Menschen. Alles sind Herausforderungen, denen die Regierung sich definitiv wird stellen müssen. KI ist ein globaler Trend, der sich weiterentwickelt.&nbsp;</p>



 Teil 2: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Die Rolle von SSI.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>,,Wir stehen hier – wie in vielen anderen Bereichen – Infrastrukturfragen gegenüber. Individuelle Pflichten sind da ein winziger Anteil; der Löwenanteil liegt bei systemischen Veränderungen.‘‘ </p>Irene Adamski</blockquote>



<p>Wie herausgestellt, stellt KI aktuell keine Gefahr da. Diese besteht vorwiegend im Bereich von Fake Reviews im Internet und der Verbreitung gefälschter Inhalte durch KI-Klone. Wie ist hiermit umzugehen?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In der Mitte von Schwierigkeiten liegen die Lösungen. Derlei gibt es einige, und auch Jolocom hat am Donnerstag den von uns verfolgten Ansatz vorstellen dürfen: Selbst-Souveräne Identitäten (SSI) im digitalen Raum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der Grundgedanke: die eigenen Daten kontrollieren. Aufgeschlüsselt: selektiv auswählen, wer Zugang zu seinen und ihren Daten hat, und ablehnen, wer keinen Zugang bekommen soll. Beim Nutzen einer digitalen Wallet kommt dies gut zum Ausdruck: Ich kann ausweisen, dass ich über 18 Jahre alt bin, ohne mein persönliches Geburtsdatum teilen zu müssen. Diese selektive Weitergabe von Daten bringt auch wieder mehr Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum mit sich. So liefert eine sichere Wallet die Möglichkeit, im beginnenden Zeitalter von KI und automatisierter Bots die Autonomie über die eigenen Daten zu behalten und zu schützen. Globale Entwicklungen zeigen den Vorwärts-Trend von KI-Anwendungen. Auch auf EU-Ebene gibt es Ambitionen, digitale Identifikationsnachweise auszugeben. Die eIDAS Verordnung strebt eine digitale Identität an, die von jedem Mitgliedsstaat herausgegeben und von den anderen Mitgliedsstaaten anerkannt werden müssen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es ist wichtig, an der Wurzel des Problems anzusetzen und Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum auszubauen. Dieses Vertrauen kann vor allem durch SSI hergestellt werden.  &nbsp;</p>

Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, shared her opinion in the article “<a href="https://beincrypto.com/women-and-web-3-0-experts-weigh-in-on-community-and-financial-freedom/">Women and Web 3.0 — Experts Weigh-In On Community and Financial Freedom</a>”, published in BeInCrypto. She said decentralized finance offers more opportunities for authentic creativity and boundary-breaking, and women’s role in the redefinition of what finance is, is&nbsp;key.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>CoinDesk — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/22/why-us-policymakers-should-embrace-web-3/">Why US Policymakers Should Embrace Web&nbsp;3</a></p><blockquote>Big tech has been embroiled in an unending series of controversies over the past decade, ranging from poor stewardship of consumer data and privacy breaches to disinformation and algorithmic bias. But these platforms are now being disrupted and disintermediated by Web3. For instance, decentralization has opened up the possibility of a world in which people can own their data and grant applications permission to use it on a limited basis, rather than having that data littered across hundreds of centralized databases.</blockquote><p>When people talk about Web3, it is often difficult to circumvent a puzzle: how to protect their own identity and privacy data while also being connected with the real world? In order to solve this confusion and to prepare people for the Web3 explosion, Ontology proposed the decentralized digital identity (DID) solution, ONT ID. ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C commendations for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, using blockchain and cryptographic technology, that can quickly identify and connect people, data, and services. It is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 So long, View Engine! 

<p>With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.</p>

<p>The way you can now create components dynamically is an example of how this release simplifies existing capabilities. Dynamic components are components loaded at runtime. You might use this when you need to tailor visible components based on responses from a server call. Previously, to dynamically create components, you had to use the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code>. Now the API takes the Component type directly. Let’s look at how this works.</p>

 Set up the Authorization Server 

<p>In my example, I am authenticating using OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect through Okta. In my Okta Authorization Server, I added a custom claim named <code>pet_preference</code> to my identity token. Does this sound only vaguely familiar? Refresh your understanding of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect by reading “<a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/10/29/things-to-keep-in-mind-about-auth">The Things to Keep in Mind about Auth</a>”.</p>

<p>With this custom claim, I want to display dynamic components specific to the value. The app uses the claim value to rotate through images of pets that match their preference.</p>

 Prepare the components 

<p>To write something like this, you’ll first create components for the customized views of different pets that all implement the same interface, such as one named <code>PreferenceComponentInterface</code>. The interface has a property named <code>data</code> so you can pass in customized information. You’ll also need to get the <code>pet_preference</code> custom claim value and retrieve content specifically for it. Once you have the data for the preferred pet, you can add the code to create dynamic components.</p>

 Implement the dynamic component creation 

<p>Create a <code>Directive</code> to house the view.</p>

   <code>import { Directive, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appPreference]'
})

export class PreferenceDirective {
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }
}
</code>   

<p>And a container component that handles the dynamic creation of the component. I simplified the code snipped to focus on the v13 change. In an upcoming post, I’ll do a complete walkthrough of creating this application.</p>

   <code>class PreferenceItem {
  component: Type&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;;
  info: any;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-secret-preference',
  template: `&lt;ng-template appPreference&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;`
 })

export class SecretPreferenceComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild(PreferenceDirective, {static: true}) private host!: PreferenceDirective;
  
  private preferences: PreferenceItem[] = [{
    component: MyCustomComponent,
    info: 'example'
  }, {
    component: MyOtherCustomComponent,
    info: {
      isTrue: true
    }
  }];
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {
    const preferredItem = this.preferences[0];
    const compRef = this.host.viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;(preferredItem);
    compRef.instance.data = preferredItem.info;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Notice you didn’t have to inject the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code> to do this. The API is more straightforward to use. A more realistic use case might be a custom claim for the department and displaying customized content based on the authenticated user’s department.</p>

 Clean-up after each test 

<p>Testing Angular apps is much improved in v13, and better cleanup of the DOM between tests is the new default. Now, Angular does a better job of cleaning up the DOM, and tests run faster and more performantly with better isolation between tests.</p>

<p>The clean-up behavior is configurable when configuring or resetting the <code>TestBed</code>. Let’s look at an example test where we greet the user after they’ve logged in.</p>

<p>Component code</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  template: `
    &lt;ng-container *ngIf="name$ | async as name "&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;Welcome {{name}}!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/ng-container&gt;
  `
})

export class ProfileComponent {
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),
    map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.idToken?.claims.name ?? 'stranger')
  );

  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Test code</p>

   <code>describe('ProfileComponent', () =&gt; {
  let component: ProfileComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture&lt;ProfileComponent&gt;;

  let authStateSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj&lt;OktaAuthStateService&gt;([], { authState$: of(authState) });

  beforeEach(() =&gt; {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ ProfileComponent ],
      providers: [
        { provide: OktaAuthStateService, useValue: authStateSpy }
      ],
      teardown: { destroyAfterEach: false } // flakey tests!
    });
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes the user by name', () =&gt; {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
      
    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome Test Name!');
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes a user with no name', () =&gt; {
    (Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(authStateSpy, 'authState$')?.get as jasmine.Spy).and.returnValue(of({
      isAuthenticated: true,
      idToken: {...idToken, claims: {sub: 'sub'}}
    }));
      
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();

    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome stranger!');
  });
});
</code>   

<p>We can configure the teardown cleanup in this test suite by changing the value of <code>destroyAfterEach</code>. With this change enabled by default, you have the option of writing new tests with better performance. Plus, you can disable the default for tests that aren’t ready to consume the changes. Angular has our backs on non-breaking updates!</p>

 Enhanced developer tooling 

<p>Creating Angular apps is now easier with developer tooling enhancements and compilation time improvements.</p>

<p>The first thing you might notice is how much faster the build time is. A lot of work went into improving the build time. By adding <a href="https://angular.io/cli/cache">a build cache</a>, the Angular team found build time improvements of up to 65+%!</p>

<p>The Angular Language Service’s tooling improvement to auto-apply optional chaining feels like a small thing but is such an appreciated feature. I can focus on the object property I want to use, and the tooling handles the optional chaining for me!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: The example demo shown above is for demonstration purposes, and exaggerates capabilities to showcase the new feature. Please remember to apply sound software development practices to your real-world applications.</p>

 So long, Internet Explorer! 

<p>In this release, we also say goodbye to Internet Explorer. <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41840">Dropping Internet Explorer support</a> means lots of doors open up for new features, refactoring the code base, and keeping up with security best practices. With extra polyfills, you can use Okta’s Auth JS library in Internet Explorer, but the recommendation is to migrate away from it.</p>

 All the Angular v13 details 

<p>These are the features that I found most interesting, but there are lots more in Angular v13! You can read more about them in the <a href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-v13-is-now-available-cce66f7bc296">Angular team’s blog post</a>. You can read about the changes in the new version of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://rxjs.dev/6-to-7-change-summary">RxJS</a>.</p>

 Upcoming changes 

<p>Angular keeps improving and growing. The <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap">subsequent releases</a> should prove exciting, with features such as strict typing for forms and standalone components in the works.</p>

<p>Due to the ID-Wallet project in Germany, some articles and comments have equated Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) with blockchain technology in the last few weeks. The impression is given that SSI only works in conjunction with a blockchain. Spoiler, that’s not the case.<br>In the following, I will try to explain why this is not the case in a simplified way.</p>



<p><br>The term blockchain is used in this article to represent all Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). Including all public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, permissioned / public and permissioned / private Blockchains.</p>



<p>What does decentralized mean in Decentralized Digital Identities (aka SSI)?</p>



<p>The “decentralized” doesn’t refer to Blockchains. Decentralized means that a person’s data is stored with the person and is under their control. Most of the time, the information is stored on the smartphone, on a so-called wallet. An SSI wallet also has nothing to do with storing cryptocurrencies. Conventional Digital Identity systems store the data and information centrally on the server of the provider.</p>



<p>Private and public key, what is it?</p>



<p>SSI is only possible due to cryptography. One of the cornerstones is asymmetric encryption. A key pair is generated using a cryptographic method. The key pair consists of a public and a private key. As the names suggest, the private key must remain private, and the public key can be shared with the broader public You can do two things with the key pair:</p>



  You can encrypt a message. <br>Encryption is done with the public key and decryption with the private one.  You can sign a file. <br>The signature is made with the private key, and the signature is verified with the public key.  



<p>The signature function is essential for further explanation.</p>



<p>SSI and digital signatures.</p>



<p>In an SSI system, an issuer generates the data (e.g. a driver’s licence), digitally signs it and transfers it to the holder. The holder can send the signed data or only parts of it to a verifier. The verifier can use the issuer’s public key to check the authenticity of the data.</p>



<p>How does the verifier get the public key?</p>



<p>For the verifier to be able to check the data, he needs the issuer’s public key. But how does he get it? In conventional systems, such as SSL certificates, a central point is contacted. Our browser asks a registration authority whether the website’s certificate is registered. In this way, our browser ensures that we are not on a fake page. The disadvantage is that the process depends on a central service and collects information about the activities.</p>



<p>Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain.</p>



<p>A Blockchain can be used to store and query the public key. It should be emphasized that the Blockchain alone does not provide any security whether the stored key comes from the specified issuer. It must be guaranteed that the issuer is who he claims to be. This cannot be achieved by technology alone. In addition, organizational and process specifications must be defined. This is called governance or a trust framework. But this is a different topic and would go beyond the scope of this article.<br>The theoretical advantage of a Blockchain is that it is decentralized, and theoretically, every verifier can keep a copy of a Blockchain node, ensuring that he does not have to contact a central service. In reality, however, the query is usually made by a central service that itself operates a node and provides the information.</p>



<p>Can other storage locations than Blockchains be used for the public keys?</p>



<p>Yes, you can. It would even be possible to use existing PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures). It only has to be ensured that privacy of the holder is ensured and that no third party receives information about the use of the data. Another aspect is the dependence on a central service. If this stops the service or deletes individual keys, the key cannot be verified anymore. These aspects must be taken into account in the design of a trust framework. Here again, decentralized technologies could be helpful …</p>



<p>The following graphic shows an example in which 2 documents from 2 different exhibitors are checked by one auditor. The first issuer, in this case, a bank, uses a Blockchain network to store the public key. The second issuer, an authority, uses an existing PKI.</p>



For a bigger picture, <a href="http://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/process_EN.png">click here</a>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>In the past two years, the SSI community has emancipated itself from Blockchain technology. It has been recognized that a Blockchain is not necessarily a prerequisite for realizing Self Sovereign Identity. And there is not “the one” Blockchain network on which an SSI system has to be built. It doesn’t matter which one, as long as it meets security and operational standards.<br>It is also difficult for authorities, for example, to abandon their current PKI implementations. Furthermore, it can therefore make sense to use existing PKIs.</p>



<p>Jolocom considers these requirements and develops its next generation of SSI technology independent of the underlying storage, PKI or Blockchain networks. Any storage location can be linked.<br>More important than the technology used is the definition of the organization and the processes so that a secure PKI and the highest level of privacy is guaranteed for the citizens.</p>

The Constitution outlines responsibilities, voting guidelines, and ground rules that enable improvement protocols and a framework for new nodes to enter the Network. The Federation Constitution is also a resource for the Shyft Network community to stay informed on the rules that guide the Network and federation members’ expected duties and responsibilities for the months&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>The Federation Constitution details the current rights, duties, penalties, and authorities for members. Members can seal transactions as a Validator on the Chain upon signing of the Constitution, with each validator entitled to one vote per matter, including the option to propose additions or amendments to the Constitution. Additionally, members have the right to verify current network configurations and performance. As incentivization for their duties, members will receive SHFT for their performance at a rate of 7 SHFT per block&nbsp;sealed.</p><p>The Constitution also outlines Federation duties regarding commitment to ensuring the security of the Chain and individual Node Operations. Federation members agree to sealing blocks, remaining online, and deploying critical security-related software updates upon signing. Federation members also must generate applications, onboard new users, and support ongoing use cases that leverage the Chain. Members are also required to uphold the common good of the Federation through their public messaging activity, with specific guidelines around the release of financial advice in public forums. Additional duties outline governance participation for members pertaining to the potential risk of removal, notification of validator transfer, and confidentiality agreements. If Federation members fail to uphold their duties, the Constitution specifies penalties, including Member review and potential loss of&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The Federation must adhere to a common set of principles to execute on the mechanics agreed upon by the supermajority of its members. Principles include managing DAO mechanics in existing smart contract and on-chain voting systems, addition and/or removal of Validator keys (with specific voting parameters), and specifications on proposed changes, if applicable, to protocol code on Github. In closing, the Constitution outlines potential Amendments to the Constitution, including guidance on proposal endorsements, review/committal timelines for amendments, and voting necessities for the passing or failure of suggested amendments.</p><p>By making these rules, guidelines, penalties, and opportunities public, Shyft Network is implementing a more transparent and trustworthy environment for Federation members to navigate and capitalize on their obligations and opportunities. As an innovative public constitution focused on building Proof-of-authority (PoA) in blockchain, Shyft Network is creating opportunities for Federation members to become successful validators by incentivizing good participation through the attachment of reputation to identity a sector. As a more secure and robust alternative than PoS (proof-of-stake) when considering the distribution of trust across private and public networks, the guidelines in the Constitution create the best possible framework for Federation Members to uphold their duties for the betterment of the Network and their own position.</p><p>The entire Shyft Network team would like to recognize and express gratitude to the entire Node Federation member network, who, upon signing this Constitution, demonstrate their commitment to the highest level of trust in blockchain, our Network, and community.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out the Federation Website (<a href="https://shyftfederation.com/federation">The Federation | Shyft Federation</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/fMMeQ9ck">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

Stuff happens   1. The future of identity will be portable and decentralized <p>This week, we’ve got a great long read via <a href="http://global.id/toddjcollins">/toddjcollins </a>— <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">an in-depth piece by Kei Kreutler analyzing the state of digital identity and where it might go in the context of&nbsp;web3</a>:</p><blockquote>Whether it’s the enforcement of legal identities, platform lock-in, or more implicit social norms, the logic of individualized identity was baked into web 2.0. With the advent of web 3.0, we have a chance to do things differently. Ultimately, web 3.0 identity will revolve around questions of privacy, portability, and ownership. Beyond such clearly contentious issues, we still have the ability to imagine more, with a reinvigorated array of tools in our hands for thinking through identity. One of these tools is multi-signature accounts, which are accounts that can provide identity collections for individuals, groups, or organizations. Embracing more than the normative individual as a fundamental unit of account, such a paradigm could better serve the creation of resilient, accountable, and mutualistic institutions leading into the twenty-first century.</blockquote><p>Kreutler covers everything from SSI to DIDs to NFTs to DAOs.

Why we should care about our&nbsp;data <p>First up, Facebook is ditching its facial recognition program, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-shut-down-facial-recognition-in-photos-videos-11635874174?mod=djem10point">the WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook said it is shutting down its facial-recognition system in the coming weeks, scrapping a feature that has developed into a key tool for sharing photos on social media but has raised concerns among privacy advocates and regulators.</blockquote><blockquote>The move continues a dramatic reshaping of the tech giant in recent weeks, which includes pausing the development of an Instagram for children product and a rebranding of the entire company to Meta Platforms Inc. to focus on a future beyond social&nbsp;media.</blockquote><blockquote>People who have opted into facial-recognition service will no longer be automatically recognized in video and photo content, according to Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at Meta, formerly Facebook Inc. He said the social-media platform would also delete data related to the faces of more than one billion&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>In related news, Australia is pretty much done with Clearview AI, ordering them to delete all data belonging to Australians, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete">the Verge&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to destroy all images and facial templates belonging to individuals living in Australia by the country’s national privacy regulator.</blockquote><blockquote>Clearview, which claims to have scraped 10 billion images of people from social media sites in order to identify them in other photos, sells its technology to law enforcement agencies. It was trialled by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) between October 2019 and March&nbsp;2020.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, following an investigation, Australia privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), has found that the company breached citizens’ privacy. “The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair,” said OAIC privacy commissioner Angelene Falk in a press statement. “It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.”</blockquote><p>This one is a bit stickier and goes to the heart of the debate around what constitutes public data — and if that data is public, shouldn’t it be accessible by&nbsp;anyone?</p><p>If you accept that to be true, it speaks toward individual responsibility around privacy and oversharing. Our personal data is incredibly important and we should probably think twice before offering it to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-shut-down-facial-recognition-in-photos-videos-11635874174?mod=djem10point">Facebook to Shut Down Facial Recognition in Photos,&nbsp;Videos</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete">Clearview AI ordered to delete all facial recognition data belonging to Australians</a>   3.

They’re the latest in a line of such projects that dates back to CryptoPunks and Crypto Kitties, both of which launched in&nbsp;2017.</blockquote>  What they’re saying: “The project’s name, Bored Ape Yacht Club, represents a club for people who got rich quick by ‘aping in’ — crypto slang for investing big in something unsure — and, thusly, are too bored to do anything but create memes,” writes Rolling Stone’s Samantha&nbsp;Hissong.  <blockquote>By the numbers: Bored apes have gone from nothing to a billion-dollar ecosystem in less than a year, with one ape selling for $3.4 million at Sotheby’s.</blockquote>  The 277-year-old auction house called its image “an NFT with historical significance,” on the grounds that only 100 apes have gold&nbsp;fur.  <p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bayc-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-interview-1250461/">How Four NFT Novices Created a Billion-Dollar Ecosystem of Cartoon&nbsp;Apes</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/04/fc-barcelona-joins-nft-rush-with-moments-from-122-years-of-history/">FC Barcelona Joins NFT Rush With Moments From 122 Years of&nbsp;History</a>   5.

Description: This week we welcome Kevin Sellers, our Chief Marketing Officer here at Ping Identity. When he’s not traveling the world, Kevin is leading the charge of our marketing efforts to be sure Ping is connecting with its users and championing truth, trust, and identity. Kevin talks about his transition from Intel into the identity space and what he’s learned, why partnering with Terry Crews was great for the brand, and his tips for brands looking to stand out and convey their uniqueness. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [3:00] Kevin talks about what he learned at Intel Inside about creating an emotional response and teaching consumers to think not only about what it is they are buying, but what goes inside, how it’s made, and how this makes a difference. [5:14] The identity world now can look like what Kevin calls the “sea of sameness.”Everyone talks about being the trusted solution. How does Ping Identity stand out and convey its specialties and uniqueness? [5:45] In this digital-first world, we must understand who it is that we are engaging with, and that means truly knowing your identity and how it matters. [8:25] Identity is the foundation of all commerce. Kevin shares how brands can position themselves in a way that shows their unique value. [9:11] What is the differentiator for Ping? Kevin first talks about knowing the soul of the company, which is a combination of mission, culture, leadership, and values, and also strategy. [11:19] Ping Identity helps its users become champions, which is more of an emotional place where the team can position capability through more of an outcome orientation than a feature or rational product-based orientation. [12:50] How did Terry Crews come to be involved with Ping Identity, how did it help the brand, and what makes Terry so cool to work with as the Chief Identity Champion? How can brands decide if working with a spokesperson is right for them? [21:42] Our identity is like a fingerprint; it is unique to us and cannot be copied. Our credentials can, but our identity is unlike anyone else’s, and that is why it is  the foundation of any digital transformation.  [23:08]The evolution that was eye-opening to Kevin was how important and central identity and access management really is.   &nbsp; Quotes:    “There’s what you want to be for the market, and then what you are. Part of the journey is to really do a discovery of the soul of the company.”—Kevin   “Most people will listen to and engage with a message from a trusted person talking about a brand, far more than they do a brand talking about a brand.”—Kevin   “Be true to your soul, be true to who you are, tell the story well, and you’ll find that that marketing is actually a pretty cool thing. And it actually can make a difference in the trajectory of your company’s success.”—Kevin    Mentioned in This Episode: PingIdentity KevinSellers TerryCrews

Part of this final stage is to ensure that the KILT blockchain is resilient to hacker attacks and to get an overview of potential weaknesses in order to fix them before the network is decentralised. To achieve this, BOTLabs GmbH, the entity behind KILT Protocol, engaged Security Research Labs (SRLabs) to perform a security&nbsp;audit.</p> The Auditor <p><a href="https://www.srlabs.de/">SRLabs</a> is a cybersecurity consultancy and hacking research collective striving to make the world more secure. BOTLabs selected them for their <a href="https://www.srlabs.de/bites/blockchain-security-best-practices-for-your-next-review">methodological approach</a> and <a href="https://www.srlabs.de/bites/blockchain-security-six-common-mistakes-found-in-substate-chains">extensive experience</a> in auditing Kusama, Polkadot, Substrate-based chains, and many networks in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> Audit Scope <p>The aim of the security audit was to assess the KILT Protocol with regards to its resilience to hacking attempts and to get an overview of the most relevant weaknesses in order to fix them before the launch of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We engaged SRLabs to perform audits&nbsp;of:</p>  The KILT Blockchain  The KILT Software Development Kit (SDK), which enables an easy way for developers and third parties to build applications on the top of KILT&nbsp;Protocol  The Sporran Wallet, a browser extension which in its current version can receive, hold and send KILT Coins; soon it will also be used to manage KILT credentials.  <p>In order to effectively review the KILT codebase, SRLabs employed a threat model-driven code review strategy. For each identified threat, hypothetical attacks that can be used to realise the threat were developed. Prioritising by risk, the codebase or relevant pallets was assessed for existing protections against respective threats and attacks, as well as the vulnerabilities that make these attacks possible.</p><p>Karsten Nohl, SRLabs’ founder, adds: “Every blockchain system comes with new security challenges due to the unique business logic and implementation. Starting from threat modeling enables our testers to focus attention on the most promising hacking avenues. The collaboration with BOTLabs on securing KILT Protocol worked really&nbsp;well.”</p> Audit Results <p>During the audit, SRLabs identified eight issues including two with a high severity. These two issues were found in the areas of staking and were resolved by the KILT development team with the first runtime upgrade. The remaining six issues affecting the area of KILT functionality with a severity of moderate to low were fixed by the KILT development team in a subsequent runtime upgrade, in advance of full decentralisation and the availability of the KILT functionality.</p><p>“We selected SRLabs for their experience with top projects in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. We appreciated their methodological and collaborative approach, and plan additional audits with SRLabs as we continuously evaluate KILT Protocol security,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-protocol-completes-security-audit-with-srlabs-4d7130212cbd">KILT Protocol Completes Security Audit with SRLabs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 11th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealAbyss">Andrey Sher</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyRussian">Russian community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I learned about Ontology shortly after its founding in 2017. Ontology had a fresh take on Web3 and brought its own, new and unique product suite. Namely, the management and protection of user online identities and&nbsp;data.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I like the idea of ​​Ontology and its future prospects; renting cars, devices, real estate, and the ability to provide these services without an intermediary. I like their range of services very&nbsp;much.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I see an opportunity to help show people how their data is managed and controlled online! Once people realize how little control they currently have over their data, Ontology’s decentralized identity and data solutions become very attractive.</p><p>I like to be the first to receive information. And the opportunity to do what I like, which is helping people! Although, I began doing this long before I became Harbinger.</p> 4. Why is it important to you to be a part of the Ontology community? <p>I am very close to the ideas and goals of Ontology. I want to be at the forefront of decentralized identity adoption.</p> 5. How is the Ontology community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Our community is similar to other crypto communities in certain respects. However, one thing that stands out to me is that people who come to Ontology become loyal supporters forever.</p> 6. What do you use as your main channels for interacting with the Ontology community and why? Do you want to see&nbsp;more? <p>Most often I use Telegram, but I also actively communicate through other social networks on cryptocurrency channels. There are a lot of people in these groups and you can get new ideas and information, as well as help people learn more about Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share an unforgettable experience or something you learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a journalist? <p>There is access to the admin chat. There, the admins turn to each other for help and if you closely follow everything, then later, you won’t even need to ask, you will know a lot of subtleties. I would like to highlight DuMonT, he is a real pro and responds very&nbsp;quickly!</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Innovative, thoughtful, impactful.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology can expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less? What kinds of things do you see community members doing that you think have helped our community grow? <p>Of course, the first is advertising and cooperation with companies and the integration of ONT ID. The creation of new applications, especially related to GameFi, is also important. The community should share and recommend Ontology on social media and messenger apps.</p> 10. What do you see as key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help achieve&nbsp;them? <p>Ontology has a great future. I believe the project will continue to grow and improve. The sky’s the&nbsp;limit!</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Why secure the API server? 

<p>The API server has multiple layers of security. By default, all communication with the API server uses TLS. Authentication is done using service account tokens, bearer tokens, basic authentication, a proxy, or client certificates, depending on the platform. In the case of PaaS like Amazon EKS, AKS, and GKE, it can also be done using custom authentication mechanisms. Once a request is authenticated, the API server can use one of several authorization mechanisms, like Attribute-based access control (ABAC) or Role-based access control (RBAC), to control access to resources. And finally, there are also admission control modules that can be configured to control resource modifications.</p>

<p>Since the API server is the only part of the Kubernetes cluster that a client can access, it is essential to secure the API server. Unauthorized access to the API server can lead to hijacking of the entire cluster, which also lets an attacker access all secrets and data accessible to the services running on it. Hence, configuring users and roles properly is a must to secure the cluster, especially in organizations where more than one user can access the cluster.</p>

 Why OpenID Connect? 

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/">OpenID Connect</a> is an authentication standard built on top of OAuth 2.0. It adds an additional token called an ID token. OpenID Connect also standardizes areas that OAuth 2.0 leaves open to choice, such as scopes, endpoint discovery, and dynamic registration of clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the default authentication mechanism of the Kubernetes API server might be enough for simple use cases, where only a handful of people manage the cluster, it does not scale for bigger organizations. Also, the default is definitely not the most secure way, because Kubernetes does not handle user management and expects it to be done outside. This is where OpenID Connect (OIDC) comes in. OIDC can manage users and groups, which works very well with the Kubernetes RBAC to provide very granular control of who can access what inside a cluster.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With an OIDC integration, you can use the same OIDC provider used for SSO in your existing infrastructure to access your Kubernetes cluster, like Okta or Keycloak.</p>

 Use Okta as an OIDC provider to secure the API server 

<blockquote>
  <p>Okta provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into applications and enables developers to build identity controls into applications, websites, web services, and devices. Okta is a certified OpenID Connect provider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us see how we can secure the Kubernetes API server using Okta as an OIDC provider and use RBAC to control access from the Okta Admin Console. If you are using Amazon EKS, check out this <a>tutorial for using Okta OIDC with EKS</a>.</p>

 What you’ll need to get started 

<p>Before you try this out, make sure you have access to the following.</p>

 
   An Okta account. You can sign up for a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">free Okta account</a>. Or, you can use another OIDC provider or <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex">Dex</a>, and the steps should be similar. 
   A Kubernetes cluster. I’m using <a href="https://k3d.io/">k3d</a> to run a local <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> cluster. You can use any Kubernetes distribution, including managed PaaS like Amazon EKS, AKS, and GKE, and so on. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a> installed on your machine. 
   <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli">Terraform</a> installed on your machine. This is not required if you do the Okta configuration via the <a href="https://login.okta.com/">Okta Admin Console</a> GUI. 
 

 Set up an Okta OIDC application and authorization server 

<p>You can achieve OIDC login for the cluster by creating a simple OIDC application with Okta either using the Okta CLI or the Admin Console. But with an OIDC application alone, you would have to use the client secret to authenticate from kubectl or any other client library. Authenticating with the client secret does not scale and is not better than default k8s authentication mechanisms, as you won’t have granular controls over users and roles. For a more helpful setup, we need an OIDC application and an authorization server with customized claims and policies for Kubernetes. This way, we can use Okta to manage users and permissions as well.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to set up an OIDC application and authorization server in Okta. If you prefer to do this via a GUI, then follow the steps in the <a>**Configure Your Okta Org ** section</a> of the article mentioned earlier, to do it via the Okta Admin Console.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use Terraform to configure the Okta part so that you can reuse the code for any automation required. Let’s dive into each step needed.</p>

 Set up Terraform 

<p>You can find the complete Terraform source code for this article in this <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-k8s-oidc-terraform-example">GitHub repo</a></p>

<p>First, we need to configure the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Okta Terraform provider</a>. Create a new Terraform file, let’s say <code>okta.main.tf</code>, and add the following:</p>

   <code>variable "base_url" {
  description = "The Okta base URL. Example: okta.com, oktapreview.com, etc. This is the domain part of your Okta org URL"
}
variable "org_name" {
  description = "The Okta org name. This is the part before the domain in your Okta org URL"
}
variable "api_token" {
  type        = string
  description = "The Okta API token, this will be read from environment variable (TF_VAR_api_token) for security"
  sensitive   = true
}

# Enable and configure the Okta provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    okta = {
      source  = "okta/okta"
      version = "~&gt; 3.15"
    }
  }
}

provider "okta" {
  org_name  = var.org_name
  base_url  = var.base_url
  api_token = var.api_token
}
</code>   

<p>You need to provide the input variables <code>org_name</code>, <code>base_url</code>, and <code>api_token</code>. Update these values in a file named <code>okta.config.auto.tfvars</code>. The <code>.auto</code> in the name is important; otherwise, Terraform will not pick it up automatically. For example, if the address of your Okta instance is <code>dev-1234.okta.com</code>, then your <code>org_name</code> would be <code>dev-1234</code>, and <code>base_url</code> would be everything that comes after the org name (e.g., okta.com).</p>

<p>Next, you will need to generate the <code>api_token</code> value. Log in to your Okta administrator console as a superuser and select Security &gt; API &gt; Tokens (Tab) from the navigation menu. Next, click the Create Token button, give your token a name, click Create Token, and copy the newly generated token. Save this in a separate <code>secret.auto.tfvars</code> file excluded from Git or in an environment variable named <code>TF_VAR_api_token</code>.</p>

<p>The Okta provider is now configured and ready to go.</p>

 Create groups 

<p>Now we need some groups to differentiate and map different kinds of users who want to access our clusters. Let’s say we have a group of administrators with full access to the cluster and another group of users who have limited access. You can have any number of groups as per your needs. The configuration below will create two groups. The group’s privileges will be defined using Kubernetes RBAC policies on the cluster, which we will do later.</p>

   <code># Set up OKTA groups
resource "okta_group" "k8s_admin" {
  name        = "k8s-admins"
  description = "Users who can access k8s cluster as admins"
}

resource "okta_group" "k8s_restricted_users" {
  name        = "k8s-restricted-users"
  description = "Users who can only view pods and services in default namespace"
}
</code>   

 Assign users to the groups 

<p>The below snippet looks up existing users and adds them to the groups. You can add any number of users at this stage, or you can skip adding users and do it via the Okta Admin Console later. For this exercise, I’m fetching existing users. You could also create new users using the <code>okta_user</code> resource.</p>

   <code># Assign users to the groups
data "okta_user" "admin" {
  search {
    name  = "profile.email"
    value = "&lt;your_admin_user_email&gt;"
  }
}

resource "okta_group_memberships" "admin_user" {
  group_id = okta_group.k8s_admin.id
  users = [
    data.okta_user.admin.id
  ]
}

data "okta_user" "restricted_user" {
  search {
    name  = "profile.email"
    value = "&lt;another_user_email&gt;"
  }
}

resource "okta_group_memberships" "restricted_user" {
  group_id = okta_group.k8s_restricted_users.id
  users = [
    data.okta_user.restricted_user.id
  ]
}
</code>   

 Create an OIDC application 

<p>Now that our groups are in place, let’s create an OIDC application. We will set the application type to <code>native</code> and use PKCE as client authentication, which is much more secure than using a client secret. We will also set the redirect URIs to <code>localhost:8000</code> so that we can work with kubectl locally. We should also assign the groups we created earlier to this application here. Finally, we can capture the client ID of the created app using an output variable.</p>

   <code># Create an OIDC application

resource "okta_app_oauth" "k8s_oidc" {
  label                      = "k8s OIDC"
  type                       = "native" # this is important
  token_endpoint_auth_method = "none"   # this sets the client authentication to PKCE
  grant_types = [
    "authorization_code"
  ]
  response_types = ["code"]
  redirect_uris = [
    "http://localhost:8000",
  ]
  post_logout_redirect_uris = [
    "http://localhost:8000",
  ]
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [groups]
  }
}

# Assign groups to the OIDC application
resource "okta_app_group_assignments" "k8s_oidc_group" {
  app_id = okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.id
  group {
    id = okta_group.k8s_admin.id
  }
  group {
    id = okta_group.k8s_restricted_users.id
  }
}

output "k8s_oidc_client_id" {
  value = okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.client_id
}
</code>   

 Create an authorization server 

<p>Next, we need an authorization server so that we can define policies and claims. We will also capture the issuer URL in an output variable.</p>

   <code># Create an authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server" "oidc_auth_server" {
  name      = "k8s-auth"
  audiences = ["http:://localhost:8000"]
}

output "k8s_oidc_issuer_url" {
  value = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.issuer
}
</code>   

 Add claims to the authorization server 

<p>Let’s add a claim to the authorization server to add the user’s groups in the <code>id_token</code> when they authenticate. We will need this to do RBAC at the Kubernetes side. Also, note that we are only adding groups with the prefix <code>k8s-</code> to the claim. This is to avoid adding groups that are not related to Kubernetes.</p>

   <code># Add claims to the authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server_claim" "auth_claim" {
  name                    = "groups"
  auth_server_id          = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  always_include_in_token = true
  claim_type              = "IDENTITY"
  group_filter_type       = "STARTS_WITH"
  value                   = "k8s-"
  value_type              = "GROUPS"
}
</code>   

 Add policy and rule to the authorization server 

<p>Now we need to create policies and rules for the authorization server. The below policy defines which OIDC applications it will be assigned to. Then we create a rule for the policy that will define the PKCE tokens lifetime and refresh interval. For this, we are leaving the values at default, which is 1 hour lifetime and unlimited refresh interval, but you can change them as per your needs.</p>

   <code># Add policy and rules to the authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server_policy" "auth_policy" {
  name             = "k8s_policy"
  auth_server_id   = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  description      = "Policy for allowed clients"
  priority         = 1
  client_whitelist = [okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.id]
}

resource "okta_auth_server_policy_rule" "auth_policy_rule" {
  name           = "AuthCode + PKCE"
  auth_server_id = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  policy_id      = okta_auth_server_policy.auth_policy.id
  priority       = 1
  grant_type_whitelist = [
    "authorization_code"
  ]
  scope_whitelist = ["*"]
  group_whitelist = ["EVERYONE"]
}
</code>   

 Create the Okta configurations using Terraform 

<p>Now that the Terraform code is ready, let’s apply it. First, run <code>terraform plan</code> to see the changes that will be made. Verify that the changes proposed by the <code>plan</code> make the changes you wanted, on the resources that you intended to modify. Then run <code>terraform apply</code> and type <code>yes</code> to apply the changes. You should see an output similar to this. You can also log in to the Okta Admin Console to verify the changes.</p>

<p>Copy the output values as we will need them for the next steps.</p>

   <code>okta_group.k8s_admin: Creating...

</code>   

<p>You can run <code>terraform destroy</code> to revert the changes if required.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TIP: You can use the <code>terraform import &lt;resource_name.id&gt;</code> command to import data and configuration from your Okta instance. Refer to <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">these Okta Terraform provider docs</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

 Preparing the cluster for OIDC 

<p>Now we need to prepare the cluster to work with OIDC. For this, we need to update the API server flags below:</p>

 
   <code>oidc-issuer-url</code>: This will be your issuer URL from the Okta authorization server 
   <code>oidc-client-id</code>: This is the client ID from the Okta OIDC application 
   <code>oidc-username-claim</code>: This is the claim that will be used to identify the user. In this case, it is <code>email</code>. 
   <code>oidc-groups-claim</code>: This is the claim that will be used to identify the groups. In this case, it is <code>groups</code>. 
   <code>oidc-ca-file</code>: This is the CA file that is used to validate the OIDC server. If you are using Okta as an OIDC provider, then you don’t need to set this. 
 

<p>NOTE: If you encounter an issue where OIDC groups/users collide with Kubernetes groups/users, you can set <code>oidc-groups-prefix</code> and <code>oidc-username-prefix</code> flags as well.</p>

<p>Flags can be set when creating the cluster or by patching the API server via SSH, as described below.</p>

 Create a cluster with OIDC enabled 

<p>Here is how you can create a new k8s cluster with OIDC enabled using different tools. Execute the command for the tool you’re using. Make sure to replace <code>&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;</code> with values from the output of the Terraform step. For any other tools, refer to their documentation on how to update API server flags.</p>

 kubeadmn 

<p>If you are using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadmn</a>, add the following flags to the cluster configuration and pass them to <code>kubeadm init</code> command.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    oidc-issuer-url: &lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;
    oidc-client-id: &lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
    oidc-username-claim: email
    oidc-groups-claim: groups
</code>   

 kOps 

<p>For <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kOps</a>, create a cluster with the required config. For example, the code below will create a cluster in AWS.</p>

   <code>kops create cluster \
 --authorization RBAC \
 --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
 --cloud aws \
 --state $S3_STATE_STORE
</code>   

<p>Now edit the cluster config and add OIDC data.</p>

   <code>kops edit cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --state $S3_STATE_STORE
</code>   

<p>Add this YAML to the <code>kubeAPIServer</code> spec.</p>

   <code>kubeAPIServer:
  authorizationRbacSuperUser: admin
  oidcIssuerURL: &lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;
  oidcClientID: &lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
  oidcUsernameClaim: email
  oidcGroupsClaim: groups
</code>   

 k3d 

<p>To create a <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> cluster using <a href="https://k3d.io/">k3d</a>, run the following command.</p>

   <code># k3d v5.0.0+
k3d cluster create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-username-claim=email@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-groups-claim=groups@server:0"
</code>   

 Updating an existing cluster to enable OIDC 

<p>If you already have an existing cluster, you can SSH into it using the root user and patch the API server with the following command.</p>

   <code>ssh root@master-node-ip

sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

...
    command:
    - /hyperkube
    - apiserver
    - --advertise-address=x.x.x.x
...

    - --oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt; # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-username-claim=email # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-groups-claim=groups # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
...
</code>   

<p>If you are using a managed service like <a>EKS</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/oidc#enabling_on_an_existing_cluster">GKE</a>, then follow their instructions to update the API server.</p>

 Configure RBAC 

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">Role-based access control</a> lets you control who can access what is inside a cluster. This is a very powerful feature and can be used to control access to specific resources. The great thing about using OIDC is that we can use it with RBAC to enable very granular control over resources.</p>

<p>Most Kubernetes distributions have RBAC enabled by default. If not, make sure to enable it before proceeding. It can be set using the <code>--authorization-mode</code> flag for the API server when creating or patching the cluster. For example, <code>--authorization-mode=RBAC,anotherMethod</code>.</p>

<p>For this exercise, we will use both groups we created in Okta. At the cluster level, we restrict admin access to a specific group that will be controlled via the OIDC provider, in this case, Okta.</p>

<p>Let’s create a cluster role binding by applying the below YAML via kubectl. This binds to the built-in cluster role called <code>cluster-admin</code> and restricts access to users in the <code>k8s-admins</code> group in Okta. Now any user added to the group will have access to the cluster, and removing someone from the group will be enough to remove their access.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: oidc-cluster-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: k8s-admins
EOF
</code>   

<p>In real use cases, you may want to restrict further a group’s access to specific resource types or namespaces, add multiple groups with different permissions, and so on. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">this</a> for different possibilities.</p>

<p>Now, let’s create a k8s role that can only view pods and services in the default namespace.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: restricted-user
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
EOF
</code>   

<p>Now we can bind the role to the second group we created in Okta.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: oidc-cluster-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: restricted-user
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: k8s-restricted-users
EOF
</code>   

<p>That’s it! The cluster is now ready for some OIDC action.</p>

 Connecting to the cluster using kubectl 

<p>Before we can go ahead and test this out, we need to do some setup for kubectl so that it knows how to do OIDC authentication. We need to install <a href="https://github.com/int128/kubelogin">kubelogin</a> plugin for this. Go ahead and install it using any of the following commands.</p>

   <code># Homebrew (macOS and Linux)
brew install int128/kubelogin/kubelogin

# Krew (macOS, Linux, Windows and ARM)
kubectl krew install oidc-login
</code>   

<p>The plugin enables OIDC login capability for kubectl. Let’s test it out first. Run the following command, make sure to replace <code>k8s_oidc_issuer_url</code> and <code>k8s_oidc_client_id</code> with what you saved earlier during Okta set up.</p>

   <code>kubectl oidc-login setup --oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; --oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
</code>   

<p>This should produce an output that looks like this:</p>

   <code>authentication in progress...
Opening in existing browser session.

## 2. Verify authentication

</code>   

<p>Now let us update kubectl configuration to add an OIDC user:</p>

   <code>kubectl config set-credentials oidc-user \
--exec-api-version=client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1 \
--exec-command=kubectl \
--exec-arg=oidc-login \
--exec-arg=get-token \
--exec-arg=--oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; \
--exec-arg=--oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt; \
--exec-arg=--oidc-extra-scope="email offline_access profile openid"
</code>   

<p>Now we can use this user to authenticate to the cluster via kubectl.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --user=oidc-user -n default
</code>   

<p>This should open a browser window to authenticate you. You can use your Okta account credentials to log in.</p>

<p>Test out this RBAC configuration by playing around with different users in different groups. Users who are not in the <code>k8s-admins</code> group in Okta should not be able to access any resource. Users who are only in the <code>restricted-users</code> group should only be able to see pods and services.</p>

<p>You can use the below command to set this user as default for your current kubectl context.</p>

   <code>kubectl config set-context --current --user=oidc-user
</code>   

 Learn more about using OIDC with Kubernetes 

<p>Using OIDC is a great way to secure your Kubernetes clusters, especially in bigger teams. It is more secure than any of the default Kubernetes authentication mechanisms. On top of that, it will let you manage users and their roles and permissions in your cluster, and even add multi-factor authentication for your cluster.</p>

<p>While this exercise shows you an Okta implementation, the process would be very similar for other OIDC providers. Check out the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Okta Terraform provider docs</a> to see what else can be automated via Terraform. You can also automate the Kubernetes parts via terraform using the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Kubernetes Terraform provider</a>.</p>

			 Tokeny has successfully helped Enegra migrate its EGX security tokens from Ethereum to Polygon. End-users now benefit from faster, cheaper and compliant transactions which ultimately improves liquidity and accessibility of the assets. 
<p>Luxembourg — 5th November 2021 — <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, an asset tokenization and compliance infrastructure provider, has successfully helped Enegra Group Ltd (“Enegra”), a commodities trading firm with approximately $28 billion in net asset value (NAV), migrate its equity-tied EGX security tokens from Ethereum to Polygon.</p>
<p>The migration enables faster end-to-end transfers of EGX security tokens with near-zero transaction fees on Polygon and puts EGX tokens on a pathway to attract global top 20 token market cap status.</p>
<p>In September 2019, Enegra tokenized 100% of its equity and issued EGX equity-backed digital security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform. Enegra decided to switch to Polygon to address Ethereum’s mounting gas fees and slow transaction speed and improve liquidity for EGX token holders.</p>
<p>The EGX tokens were issued through the T-REX security token standard, now recognized as the ERC3643 by the Ethereum community. Thanks to the cross-chain compatibility of the standard, the migration to Polygon from Ethereum was seamlessly managed over a few days, and investors were able to retain the same wallet address for holding their EGX tokens. After the migration, investors were able to interact immediately with their tokens on Polygon via the same platform but without prohibitive gas fees.</p>

		 
	 
    We tokenized our equity to improve liquidity. And, now that the technology is available for faster, cheaper, and compliant transactions on the blockchain, we wanted our investors to take advantage of it. Polygon and Tokeny provided the complete infrastructure we needed to do so, and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Matthew AverayManaging Director &amp; CEO at Enegra    
	 
		 
			<p>Energa’s decision comes at a time of intense interest in tokenization — a means of digitizing any asset and placing it on an immutable blockchain. Equity, funds, debt, and even real estate can all benefit from the added liquidity, efficiency, and transparency tokenization brings. Mid-cap companies, investment banks, asset managers, funds, and stock exchanges from all around the world are already starting to shift towards blockchain-based financial assets.</p>
<p>Enegra Group Ltd, incorporated in Malaysia, enables mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally against larger competitors by providing world-class commodity trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance. It currently has mining offtake agreements with 16 mid-tier mines in Southeast Asia with a combined Net Asset Value (NAV) of $US 28 billion, audited by Crowe LLP, a global top 10 accounting and audit firm.</p>

		 
	 
    Our goal is to provide our customers with a flexible and scalable solution for permissioned tokens. Issuers of tokens don’t need to worry anymore about being blocked on a blockchain forever. Without losing any history, we now have the tools and processes for smooth migrations from one network to another. Enegra’s migration has showcased how quickly and easily migration can be done using our technology stack. And, the benefits are realized instantly, which is exactly what investors need and expect.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Polygon was designed to work in parallel with the Ethereum network to improve functionality and promote infrastructure development. The leading Ethereum scaling platform achieves this via its array of scaling solutions, including Polygon PoS, Polygon SDK, Polygon Avail, Polygon Nightfall, and Polygon Hermez.</p>

		 
	 
    The tokenization of real-world assets and financial securities is probably the next big wave in DeFi, and we are excited to see our partner, Tokeny, bring qualitative and compliant assets to the Polygon network. By leveraging our infrastructure with the right software provider, such as Tokeny, businesses can quickly deploy or convert their assets to Polygon.  Sandeep NailwalCo-Founder at Polygon    
	 
		 
			<p>The EGX Security Token found at address 0x8db0a6d1b06950b4e81c4f67d1289fc7b9359c7f on Polygon. The EGX token complies with the ERC3643 standard.</p>

			 About Enegra&nbsp; 
<p>Enegra is an international mineral commodities trading business based in Malaysia. Enegra is proud to be one of the world’s first regulated companies to issue equity backed digital security tokens, under security token code EGX on the Polygon network. Enegra has secured lucrative mining offtake agreements among 16 mid-tier mines in Southeast Asia. This provides Enegra with exclusive access to 1.8 billion tonnes of thermal coal and up to 500,000 tonnes per month of nickel sands. The valuation of these mining offtake assets provides Enegra with an audited Net Asset Value (NAV) of $US 28 billion, audited by Crowe LLP<a href="https://www.crowe.com/"> https://www.crowe.com/</a>&nbsp; a global top 10 accounting and audit firm. Based on total issued supply, each EGX token has a NAV of $US 329, underwritten by an audited balance sheet.

 About Tokeny&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

 See how Ontology’s ONT TAG protects ROCKI’s user&nbsp;base <p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483">announced</a> a partnership with <a href="http://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain. Today, we are excited to share more details about how ROCKI is leveraging <a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>’s decentralized identity framework on its own platform.</p><p>Ontology’s decentralized framework encompasses <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/enter-web-3-0-with-ont-id-375930e78242">several products</a> including <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-id-2-0-take-charge-of-your-identity-with-customized-data-control-and-disclosure-features-c54bd9305e2d">ONT ID</a>, <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, and <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>. Ontology’s Decentralized Identity (DID) Registration Management SDK enables ROCKI to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs.</p><p>Ontology’s DID technology relies on global trust anchors to verify user credentials that can then be used to establish a digital identity across multiple blockchains (e.g. Ontology, BSC, Ethereum, Polkadot).</p><p>We are proud to see ROCKI users now log into the services in a decentralized way thanks to Ontology’s decentralized identity-based batch verification solution, <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT&nbsp;TAG</a>.</p><p>ONT TAG enables ROCKI (along with other apps) to quickly obtain a user’s verifiable credentials with the user’s authorization. The authorization process is performed whilst protecting user privacy. To authorize credentials, ONT TAG must first be granted permission by the user&nbsp;only.</p><p>This set of solutions fully takes into account the verification requirements of users and applications for specific information sources.</p><p>Being fully integrated into the ROCKI application, when users log into ROCKI, ONT TAG is working in the background to verify their credentials. This means that users unfamiliar with Ontology may not even know that ROCKI is actually relying on Ontology’s DID framework. Nonetheless, the user benefits from ONT TAG’s unique authorization process. The entire process only takes a few minutes, is cheap, and prevents the application from collecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>ROCKI is a fast-growing start-up with a growing user base of over 9,000 musicians and 30,000 songs. Thus far, over 1,200 music NFTs have been minted and traded on the platform. We are excited to be providing DID services to ROCKI’s users. ONT TAG ensures ROCKI users’ data remains secure and artists are rewarded for the work they&nbsp;produce.</p><p>Stay tuned for future Ontology news and&nbsp;updates.</p> About ROCKI <p><a href="http://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a> is a user-centric music streaming ecosystem that incentives both the artists and the listeners by rewarding them with its in-house ROCKI token. Specifically, ROCKI’s marketplace provides artists with near-real-time royalty payments, paid in ROCKI — thereby solving one of the major challenges in the modern, COVID-stricken digital music industry, where most artists have to fight for streaming pay.

<p>With almost 7.5 million people working in the construction industry and 673,000 people employed by the mining industry, contributing about 5% to overall employment in the US economy, it’s becoming more important to simplify the verification of qualifications and ensure each worker is fully certified for the job at hand. </p><p>The current process when verifying the certifications and qualifications of each worker consists of:</p>  Each worker holding a paper-based certificate for each qualification they have.  Handing these paper-based certificates over to the site managers.  Site managers having to verify each of these qualifications by calling the issuing body.  Noting each worker's accreditations to ensure they do not carry out tasks on site they are not qualified for.  <p>This process must be done on each new site a worker attends. The worker cannot begin their day until their accreditations have been verified, this can take hours to do and causes delays in the scheduled work. </p><p>There are many issues with paper-based certifications from reduced productivity to heightened compliance risks. In the UK, it’s a legal requirement under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HSWA) that businesses are responsible for developing and following a health and safety policy to keep employees out of danger. Many countries have passed similar worker safety laws, however, some businesses fail to comply with this legislation. A worker can change the expiration date of a qualification and reprint, or produce fraudulent qualifications they claim to have earned - this causes huge compliance risks for the site if the verification process fails. </p><p>“​​Being found guilty of breaching the regulation can cost far more than it would to comply, as you could face staggering fines, legal costs, compensation, sick pay, and more. Health and safety fines alone can cost £62,770 more than the cost of compliance for an SME.”* Verifiable Credentials removes the risk of accidentally approving and verifying a fraudulent qualification.</p><p>How Verifiable Credentials transforms this process</p><p>With verifiable credentials, each worker stores their accreditations on a digital wallet on their mobile device. They have full control over these accreditations and who sees them. They are also not prone to loss or damage as is the case with paper-based credentials. </p><p>Digital credentials remove any risk of fraudulent activity; credentials are issued by an educational or training body, and these can be optionally anchored to the Dock blockchain which serves as a timestamp for the credential, providing an expiration date for each qualification. The verifier (being the work site) can instantly verify the credentials; through the use of cryptography, can know they are legitimate. This removes any compliance risks associated with the credentials as a worker cannot falsely claim qualifications. <br><br>Hours down to minutes</p><p>By integrating with Dock and utilizing verifiable credentials, the process of verifying a workers qualifications goes from analysing paper-based certificates and calling each educational body to certify the legitimacy of it, to having the accreditations sitting in a tamper-proof digital wallet, with a digital signature signature from the issuing body certifying the legitimacy. </p><p>This process goes from hours of verifying workers to minutes, reducing delays in the scheduled work while ensuring no fraudulent certifications are presented. </p><p>As mentioned above, certificates are held in a digital wallet; should an educational or training body cease to exist, the credentials stay in the digital wallet, and as the decentralized identity that issued the credential is immutable and stored on the blockchain forever, it’s legitimacy can be verified indefinitely. </p><p>Contact Us</p><p>Dock’s API is easy to use and integrate with, sign up and trial the API in test mode. You have 50 free transactions to use on production, access to the sandbox test net at all times, and no card required on sign up. </p><p>If you’d like to find out more about API and how it will benefit you and your company, book a consultation with our experts here. <br></p><p>*<a href="https://www.arinite.co.uk/the-cost-of-health-and-safety-compliance-versus-a-fine">Arinite Health and Safety</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4925/1">Cloud Security 2025 – Perspective &amp; Roadmap</a> on Thursday, November 11 from 11:00 am to 11:20 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Martin some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Are today's identity and access solutions such as IGA and PAM able to serve the needs of today's complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments? 
<p>I think that's a good question. When we look at this and we look at a little bit of where do IGA and PAM solutions stem from, then these solutions were created to work with environments where you have a traditional server set up, where you focus on your workforce identities, but they were not built for agile IT environments, they were not built for environments that you have in a cloud environment or on your private cloud, on your kubernetes environment, we have workloads going up and down where you have way more types of identities, where you have service identities and things and devices and other things. So, both IGA and PAM, as we know them, are focused on a very traditional problem. So how to give access to your workforce, to applications. To extend it a little to partners and other things, there's consumer identity management. But in fact, no they weren't built for multi-cloud and multi-hybrid, which means there are use cases, there are challenges, there are requirements that can't be served well with these types of solutions.</p>
 So, you are saying that there's a need for additional solutions if we look at today’s agile IT workload. Would Cloud Infrastructure and Entitlements Management (CIEM) be a solution for that? 
<p>So, CIEM is an interesting thing and it popped up and emerged because there's a challenge, which is: How do you manage the access of resources to services and of resources to other resources in your dynamic environments, which you find in public cloud environments which you find in your private cloud, which you find in other modern work environments and so CIEM is something which solves a problem, which is., when you go to the core of CIEM, it's cloud and it's infrastructure. At the end, what we need is to look at, how can we work with all the environments we have in a multi-cloud - which CIEM does - and the multi-hybrid. If you count private clouds, if you count your own so to speak de facto private cloud or your own data center as a hybrid part, then CIEM doesn't fully serve that.</p>
<p>It is part of the problem, it's super important to address that, but I believe we should do it better for everything, not just for cloud, or multi-cloud, but for the entire types of modern workloads. And also looking at how can we, from a management perspective, from a policy perspective, from a governance perspective, do that for every type of workload in a consistent manner, because having one solution for the cloud, the public cloud, one solution for your private cloud and for your UVM environments and for the traditional workloads and having other solutions, or workforces or resources and services, makes it, over time, rather complex. So, yes, it is a solution, we need to figure out solutions in that space, CIEM is a step in the right direction. But I don't believe that it's the final step in that evolution.</p>
 You say that CIEM will not be the last step to a full strategic approach. Could you maybe recommend to CISOs how they could approach this topic strategically? 
<p>Yeah, and I think there are two levels, there's tactical and there's strategic. For the strategic part, at our recent European Identity and Cloud Conference, we unveiled three concepts, three models we call BASIS, SODAS and DREAM. And DREAM is that perspective, the tension of CIEM towards dynamically managing all types of resources: Dynamic Resource and Entitlement and Access Management, and it covers all types of resources. So this, I think, gives a good target state from a strategic perspective for a unified management, for a unified delivery of applications in Europe. Today's IT to serve the needs of the digital business. Tactically, I think it's worth to look at CIEM and how these tools are evolving. Some of them are really making some interesting progress and we see other vendors coming in more from policy management perspective.</p>
<p>So OPA, the open policy agent, for instance, is a very interesting theme here, which all of them help you to get a better grip with the dynamic workloads by managing them through policies. Strategically seen, in any case, you need to put policies at the forefront. You can't manage dynamic workloads with static concepts such as roles or so, but you need dynamic concepts. That means you control via policies. This is in some way the common denominator of everything you're doing in the future. And this is, I think, a very central aspect in everything you do strategically. Tactically, look at the solutions out there today because. You must address the challenge of. Managing entitlements in your cloud environments and beyond.</p>

  <p>When defining classes for a simple aggregation of values, Java developers have traditionally relied on constructors, accessors, <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>toString()</code>, an error-prone practice that has low value and shifts the focus away  from modeling immutable data. Java records were introduced as a first preview in JDK 14 in order to simplify how we write  data carrier classes. The second preview came in JDK 15 and the finalized feature arrived  in JDK 16. A summary of this history is available in the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395">JDK Enhancement Proposal JEP 395</a>.</p>

<p>While code generators can be used to reduce boilerplate code, the goals of the <code>record</code> proposals focus on its semantics. In this post, let’s explore Java records’ features and advantages, and apply them for building a REST API and querying a database.</p>

 The <code>record</code> keyword 

<p>The <code>record</code> is a new type of declaration, a restricted form of class that acts as a transparent carrier for immutable data. Let’s start the exploration by defining a simple data type <code>EndOfGame</code> as a <code>record</code>:</p>

   <code>import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;

public record EndOfGame(String id, LocalDate date, LocalTime timeOfDay,
                        String mentalState, Integer damageTaken,
                        Integer damageToPlayers, Integer damageToStructures) {
}
</code>   
<p>As you can see in the example above, the <code>record</code> has a name, <code>EndOfGame</code> in this case. What looks like a constructor signature is the state description or header, declaring the components of the <code>record</code>.</p>

<p>The following members are acquired automatically with the declaration:</p>

 
   A private final field and a public read accessor for each component of the state description 
   A public canonical constructor with the same signature as the state description, which initializes each field from the corresponding argument 
   Implementation of <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>toString()</code> 
 

<p>The tests in the <code>EndOfGameTest</code> class below verify that the automatic members are indeed available:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.domain;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

public class EndOfGameTest {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EndOfGameTest.class);

    private EndOfGame createEndOfGame() {

        return new EndOfGame("1", LocalDate.of(2018, 12, 12),
                LocalTime.of(15, 15), "sober",
                10, 10, 10);
    }

    @Test
    public void equalsTest() {
        EndOfGame eog1 = createEndOfGame();
        EndOfGame eog2 = createEndOfGame();

        assertTrue(eog1.equals(eog2));
        assertEquals(eog1, eog2);
        assertEquals(eog1.hashCode(), eog2.hashCode());
    }

    @Test
    public void toStringTest() {
        EndOfGame eog = createEndOfGame();
        logger.info(eog.toString());

        assertEquals("EndOfGame[id=1, date=2018-12-12, timeOfDay=15:15, mentalState=sober, " +
                        "damageTaken=10, damageToPlayers=10, damageToStructures=10]",
                eog.toString());
    }

    @Test
    public void accessorTest() {
        EndOfGame eog = createEndOfGame();
        assertEquals("sober", eog.mentalState());
    }

}
</code>   
<p>The automatic canonical constructor is used for creating a sample <code>EndOfGame</code> in the method <code>createEndOfGame()</code>.
In the <code>equalsTest()</code> above, <code>eog1</code> has the same state as <code>eog2</code>, so <code>eog1.equals(eog2)</code> is <code>true</code>. This also implies both instances have the same <code>hashCode</code>.
Automatic read accessors have the same name and return type as the component. Note there is no <code>get*</code> prefix in the read accessor name, which is the same name as the component, as illustrated in the <code>accessorTest()</code>.</p>

 Java record restrictions and rules 

<p>While <code>record</code> provides a more concise syntax and semantics designed to help to model data aggregates, as stated before, a <code>record</code> is a restricted form of a class. Let’s have a brief look at those restrictions.</p>

 Inheritance, extensibility, and immutability 

<p>A <code>record</code> is implicitly final, and cannot be abstract. You cannot enhance it later by extension, as the compiler will output the following error:</p>

   <code>Cannot inherit from final 'com.okta.developer.records.EndOfGame'
</code>   

<p>A <code>record</code> cannot extend any class, not even its implicit superclass <code>Record</code>. But it can implement interfaces. Using the <code>extends</code> with records clause will cause the following error:</p>

   <code>No extends clause allowed for record
</code>   

<p>A <code>record</code> does not have write accessors and the implicitly declared fields are final, and not modifiable via reflection. Moreover, a <code>record</code> cannot declare instance fields outside the <code>record</code> header. Records embody an immutable by default policy, usually applied to data carrier classes.</p>

   <code>Instance field is not allowed in record
Cannot assign a value to final variable 'id'
</code>   

<p>Read accessors can be declared explicitly, but should never silently alter the record state. Review record semantics before making explicit declarations of automatic members.</p>

<p>A record without any constructor declaration will be given a canonical constructor with the same signature as the header, which will assign all the private fields from the arguments. The canonical constructor can be declared explicitly in the standard syntax, or in a compact form:</p>

   <code>public EndOfGame {
    Objects.requireNonNull(date);
    Objects.requireNonNull(timeOfDay);
    Objects.requireNonNull(mentalState);
    Objects.requireNonNull(damageTaken);
    Objects.requireNonNull(damageToPlayers);
    Objects.requireNonNull(damageToStructures);
}
</code>   

<p>In the compact form, the parameters are implicit, the private fields cannot be assigned inside the body, and are automatically assigned at the end. This enables a  focus on validation, making defensive copies of mutable values, or some other value processing.</p>

 Serialization, encoding, and mapping 

<p>Record instances can extend <code>Serializable</code>, but the serialization and deserialization processes cannot be customized. Serialization and deserialization methods like <code>writeObject</code>,  <code>readObject</code> can be implemented, but will be ignored.</p>

<p>As <code>spring-web</code> module provides Jackson with JSON encoders and decoders, and Java record support was added to Jackson in release 2.12, records can be used for REST API request and response mapping.</p>

<p>Records cannot be used as entities with JPA/Hibernate. JPA entities must have a no-args constructor, and must not be final, two requirements that <code>record</code> will not support. There are additional issues with JPA and records too.</p>

<p>Spring Data modules that do not use the object mapping of the underlying data store (like JPA) support records, as persistence construction detection works as with other classes. For Spring Data MongoDB, the general recommendation is to stick to immutable objects, because they are straightforward to materialize by calling the constructor. An all-args constructor, allows materialization to skip property population for optimal performance. This too is recommended, and Java record semantics align with these guidelines.</p>

 Use Java records with Spring WebFlux and Spring Data 

<p>While searching for a dataset for this tutorial, I came across a collection of 87 end game statistics from a single player, for a popular game. As the author included his mental state in the game play data, I decided to use Java records for building a basic average query and finding out if the player’s performance was significantly altered when sober vs when intoxicated.</p>

<p>Let’s jump ahead and build a secured REST Api using the <code>EndOfGame</code> record, Spring Boot, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community">MongoDB</a> and Okta authentication. With the help of <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a> create a WebFlux application, from the web UI or with <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a>:</p>

   <code>https -d start.spring.io/starter.zip bootVersion==2.5.6 \
  baseDir==java-records \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.records \
  artifactId==records-demo \
  name==java-records \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.records \
  javaVersion==17 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta,data-mongodb-reactive
</code>   

<p>Note: Although Java records have been available since release 14, the Spring Initializr Web UI only lets you select Java Long Term Support (LTS) releases.</p>

<p>Extract the Maven project, and edit <code>pom.xml</code> to add two more required dependencies for this tutorial, <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/mongodb/">MongoDB Testcontainers Module</a> for testing database access, and <code>spring-security-test</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.testcontainers&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mongodb&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.15.3&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;5.5.1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Rename <code>application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, and add the following content:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}

spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      port: 27017
      database: fortnite

logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.data.mongodb: TRACE
</code>   

<p>Add an <code>EndOfGame</code> record under the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.domain</code>. Annotate the <code>record</code> with <code>@Document(collection = "stats")</code> to let MongoDB map <code>EndOfGame</code> to the <code>stats</code> collection. As you can see, a record class can be annotated. The class should look like this:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.domain;

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.Document;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.util.Objects;

@Document(collection = "stats")
public record EndOfGame(String id, LocalDate date,  LocalTime timeOfDay,
                        String mentalState, Integer damageTaken,
                        Integer damageToPlayers, Integer damageToStructures) {

    public EndOfGame {
        Objects.requireNonNull(date);
        Objects.requireNonNull(timeOfDay);
        Objects.requireNonNull(mentalState);
        Objects.requireNonNull(damageTaken);
        Objects.requireNonNull(damageToPlayers);
        Objects.requireNonNull(damageToStructures);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Add a new record for the mental state query <code>MentalStateDamage</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.domain;

public record MentalStateDamage(String mentalState,
                                Double damageToPlayers,
                                Double damageToStructures,
                                Double damageTaken) {
}
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.repository</code> and add a <code>MentalStateStatsRepository</code> interface:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public interface MentalStateStatsRepository {

    Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage();

}
</code>   

<p>Add the implementation <code>MentalStateStatsRepositoryImpl</code> to retrieve the average damage in each category, for each mental state:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.ReactiveMongoTemplate;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.aggregation.Aggregation;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

import static org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.aggregation.Aggregation.*;

public class MentalStateStatsRepositoryImpl implements MentalStateStatsRepository {

    private final ReactiveMongoTemplate mongoTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MentalStateStatsRepositoryImpl(ReactiveMongoTemplate mongoTemplate) {
        this.mongoTemplate = mongoTemplate;
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage() {
        Aggregation aggregation = newAggregation(
                group("mentalState")
                        .first("mentalState").as("mentalState")
                        .avg("damageToPlayers").as("damageToPlayers")
                        .avg("damageTaken").as("damageTaken")
                        .avg("damageToStructures").as("damageToStructures"),
                project("mentalState", "damageToPlayers", "damageTaken", "damageToStructures")
                );
        return mongoTemplate.aggregate(aggregation, EndOfGame.class, MentalStateDamage.class);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Note: The <code>Impl</code> suffix is required for customizing individual repositories with <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.single-repository-behavior">Spring Data</a></p>

<p>Create the <code>StatsRepository</code> interface, extending the <code>MentalStateStatsRepository</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import org.springframework.data.repository.reactive.ReactiveSortingRepository;

public interface StatsRepository extends ReactiveSortingRepository&lt;EndOfGame, String&gt;, MentalStateStatsRepository {

}
</code>   

<p>After the import,the sample dataset, will create strings for the date and time values, in a custom format. Create the following converters to map <code>String</code> to <code>LocalDate</code> and <code>LocalTime</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter;

import java.time.LocalDate;

public class LocalDateConverter implements Converter&lt;String, LocalDate&gt; {

    @Override
    public LocalDate convert(String s) {
        return LocalDate.parse(s);
    }
}
</code>   
   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter;

import java.time.LocalTime;

public class LocalTimeConverter implements Converter&lt;String, LocalTime&gt; {

    @Override
    public LocalTime convert(String s) {
        return LocalTime.parse(s);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>MongoConfiguration</code> class in the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.configuration</code>, to register the converters:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.configuration;

import com.okta.developer.records.repository.LocalDateConverter;
import com.okta.developer.records.repository.LocalTimeConverter;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.convert.MongoCustomConversions;

import java.util.Arrays;

@Configuration
public class MongoConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public MongoCustomConversions mongoCustomConversions() {

        return new MongoCustomConversions(
            Arrays.asList(
                    new LocalDateConverter(),
                    new LocalTimeConverter()));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>StatsService</code> interface in the <code>com.okta.developer.records.service</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.service;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public interface StatsService {

    Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage();

    Flux&lt;EndOfGame&gt; getAll();
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>DefaultStatsService</code> class for the implementation in the <code>com.okta.developer.records.service</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.service;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import com.okta.developer.records.repository.StatsRepository;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@Service
public class DefaultStatsService implements StatsService {

    @Autowired
    private StatsRepository statsRepository;

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage() {
        return statsRepository.queryMentalStateAverageDamage();
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;EndOfGame&gt; getAll() {
        return statsRepository.findAll();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>StatsController</code> class in the <code>com.okta.developer.records.controller</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.controller;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import com.okta.developer.records.service.StatsService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@RestController
public class StatsController {

    @Autowired
    private StatsService statsService;

    @GetMapping("/endOfGame")
    public Flux&lt;EndOfGame&gt; getAllEndOfGame(){
        return statsService.getAll();
    }

    @GetMapping("/mentalStateAverageDamage")
    public Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; getMentalStateAverageDamage(){
        return statsService.queryMentalStateAverageDamage();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>The controller enables the <code>/endOfGame</code> endpoint to get all entries, and the <code>/mentalStateAverageDamage</code> endpoint, that returns the damage in each category, as in average by mental state.</p>

 Test Java records in the web layer 

<p>Create a <code>StatsControllerTest</code> class in the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.controller</code> under the <code>src/test</code> folder, to verify the endpoints’ basic functionality with a web test. In this test, only the web slice is verified:</p>

    }

}
</code>   

<p>Run the tests with the following Maven command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test -Dtest=StatsControllerTest
</code>   

<p>The <code>/mentalStateAverageDamage</code> test above also verifies that the <code>MentalStateDamage</code> record type is correctly handled when used as a response body. For the <code>/endOfGame</code> you should see response logs similar to this:</p>

   <code>[

      "id":"1",
      "date":"2021-10-21",
      "timeOfDay":"12:02:34.233944363",
      "mentalState":"happy",
      "damageTaken":1,
      "damageToPlayers":1,
      "damageToStructures":1
   }
]
</code>   

 Test Java records in the database layer 

<p>Download the test dataset from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-java-records-example/blob/main/src/test/resources/stats.json">GitHub</a> with HTTPie, and copy it to <code>src/test/resources/stats.json</code>:</p>

<p><code>@DataMongoTest</code> configures the data layer for testing. For this test, I evaluated using <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/#core.repository-populators">repository populator</a>, but decided to go for a Testcontainers MongoDB instance instead, to reuse the import process and <code>data.json</code> file later with Docker Compose. Using a container MongoDB instance requires disabling the <code>EmbeddedMongoAutoConfiguration</code>.</p>

<p>In the <code>setUp()</code> above, the <code>mongoimport</code> tool is executed in the test container, initializing the <code>stats</code> collection with the sample dataset.</p>

<p>Run the tests with the following Maven command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test -Dtest=StatsRepositoryTest
</code>   

<p>If the import runs successfully, the following line should appear in the test logs:</p>

   <code>87 document(s) imported successfully. 0 document(s) failed to import.
</code>   
<p>Also, you can inspect the response in the logs for the average damage test:</p>

   <code>MentalStateDamage[mentalState=sober, damageToPlayers=604.3777777777777, damageToStructures=3373.511111111111, damageTaken=246.46666666666667]
MentalStateDamage[mentalState=high, damageToPlayers=557.547619047619, damageToStructures=2953.8571428571427, damageTaken=241.71428571428572]
</code>   
<p>For this single-player dataset, the damage taken or inflicted was not orders of magnitude different when sober than when high.</p>

 Run the application 

<p>Create a <code>docker</code> folder in the root of the project, and add the following <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file there:</p>

   <code>version: "3.1"

services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:bionic
    environment:
      - MONGO_INIT_DATABASE=fortnite
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - ../src/test/resources/stats.json:/seed/stats.json
      - ./initdb.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initdb.sh
  demo:
    image: records-demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=mongodb
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
</code>   

<p>Add also the <code>initdb.sh</code> script in the <code>docker</code> folder, to import the test data into MongoDB, with the following content:</p>

   <code>mongoimport --verbose --db=fortnite --collection=stats --file=/seed/stats.json --jsonArray
</code>   

<p>In the project root, generate the application container image with the following Maven command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
</code>   
<p>Run the application with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Once the services are up, go to <code>http://localhost:8080/mentalStateAverageDamage</code>, and you should see the Okta login page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sign in with your Okta credentials, and if successful, it will redirect to the <code>/mentalStateAverageDamage</code> endpoint, and you should see a response body like the following:</p>

   <code>[
   {
      "mentalState":"sober",
      "damageToPlayers":604.3777777777777,

 Java records advantages and limitations 

<p>While Java record is more concise for declaring data carrier classes, the “war on boilerplate” is not a goal of this construct, Records are not meant to  add features like properties or annotation-driven code generation, as <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Project Lombok</a> does. Record semantics provide benefits for modeling an immutable state data type. No hidden state is allowed, as no instance fields can be defined outside the header, hence the transparent claim. Compiler generated <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> avoid error-prone coding. Serialization and deserialization into JSON are straightforward thanks to its canonical constructor. Summarizing some of the Java Record features discussed in this post:</p>

<p>Advantages</p>
 
   Concise syntax 
   Immutable state 
   Compiler generated <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> 
   Straightforward JSON serialization and deserialization 
 

<p>Limitations</p>
 
   Immutable state 
   Cannot be used as JPA/Hibernate entities 
   Cannot be extended or inherit a class

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and learned about Java record semantics, its benefits, and limitations. Before choosing this feature, make sure to find out if your favorite frameworks support it. Fortunately, Spring Boot support for Java Records was recently added in 2.5.x releases through Jackson 2.12.x. I was not able to find comments about records in Spring Data documentation.</p>

 &nbsp; 
 The Lead Up&nbsp; 
<p>The topic has been discussed in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group">informal bi-weekly meetings</a>&nbsp;for the last two months&nbsp;(we call it the SCIM Interest Group), with strong participation and lots of healthy opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started by reviewing the many different draft extensions that are out there for SCIM, and a lot of those reviews are available on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe2lm3WNUfehPOxEvZ92ygA">SCIM IG&nbsp;Youtube&nbsp;channel</a>&nbsp;if you are interested.&nbsp; We applied for the&nbsp;BoF&nbsp;meeting to get feedback from a larger audience and to judge whether we have momentum, and now we are going to find out.&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Microsoft View&nbsp; 
<p>When it comes to SCIM,&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;interested in participating for several simple reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operational Clarity&nbsp;</p>
 
 At the time SCIM was born,&nbsp;the&nbsp;cloud was&nbsp;still&nbsp;new&nbsp;and the possibilities were not known.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;very&nbsp;common assumed implementation pattern was&nbsp;a push model from on-premises to cloud, and this led to assumptions about who would be pushing what data where.&nbsp;&nbsp;These days however, the combinations of push and pull, client and server, are much more varied.&nbsp;We think that some simple updates in language and better profiling of common implementation roles could make the specification much more intuitive to adopt – thus&nbsp;helping overall interoperability&nbsp;across the identity community&nbsp;and&nbsp;getting us closer to making SCIM a must-have&nbsp;cross-domain interface.&nbsp; 
 
<p>End to End Automation as a First Order Goal&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Identity world is now&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;powered by automation and&nbsp;AI.&nbsp; Connectivity is no longer just about web single-sign on;&nbsp;the new and growing requirement today is for&nbsp;automated&nbsp;corporate oversight,&nbsp;including&nbsp;governance, provisioning, risk detection and threat intelligence.&nbsp;And we don’t only want to automate the connections, we want to automate the establishment of the connection.&nbsp; We are hoping to research&nbsp;whether there is additional&nbsp;metadata or even schema that could facilitate a more seamless bootstrapping of&nbsp;various protocols in the multi-cloud world, including&nbsp;protocols like&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared&nbsp;Signals and&nbsp;Events(SSE)/CAEP</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/wg/fastfed">Fastfed</a>, with a plan to&nbsp;lay the groundwork for the explosion in multi-cloud automation that&nbsp;growing industry verticals like&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudknox.io/cloud-infrastructure-entitlement-management/">CIEM</a>&nbsp;exemplify.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Security Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Multi-cloud&nbsp;Updates&nbsp;</p>
 
 In the API Security world, a lot has happened since the first SCIM work began.&nbsp; OAuth 2.0&nbsp;has become&nbsp;the preferred mechanism for protecting APIs and a number of extensions have evolved that increase security during access token presentation.&nbsp; We want the negotiation of industry-best security to be well specified for identity data&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Get Involved&nbsp; 
<p>The most important thing to do is to sign up for the IETF Birds of a Feather meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration is here:&nbsp;<a href="https://registration.ietf.org/111/">https://registration.ietf.org/111/.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no membership requirement, but there is a fee – a day pass costs $125 but there are fee waivers available if that cost is too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also join our merry band in the SCIM Interest Group – connection data is on our wiki:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group/wiki">Explanation of our goals, how to get involved, and pages on our dedicated work efforts (github.com)</a>&nbsp;. We meet every 2 weeks, in two different times of day to encourage global participation. For updates,&nbsp;the easiest way to stay informed is to subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ietf.org%2Fmailman%2Flistinfo%2Fscim&amp;data=04%7C01%7CPamela.Dingle%40microsoft.com%7C50789b8468294876f9df08d9507d030f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637629320743730646%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sGI8BsjgtS2v7idTkSnr4O0QI9BlYBs9M2DGaePjr8U%3D&amp;reserved=0">SCIM Mailing list at IETF</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your excitement about this standards work is as great as&nbsp;ours&nbsp;and we cannot strongly enough encourage your participation – the best specifications are made from diverse input, and the more breadth we have in implementation experience and point of view, the better we will do.&nbsp; Join us!&nbsp;</p>

				  The W3C’s DID Specification is critical to building a better digital world.  
			  
				
				
				  Sam Curran and Ken Ebert  
			  
				
				
				 <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 to develop standards for the World Wide Web. Over the years, this collaboration between membership organizations and the W3C’s staff has been responsible for developing CSS, HTMl, JSON, SVG <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">and more</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> (CCG), was created by the W3C in 2014 to discuss, research, document, prototype, and test credential storage and exchange systems for the Web. As&nbsp; part of this work, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a> (DID Working Group) was formed to standardize the DID URI scheme and the data model and syntax of DID Documents.</p>
<p>The DID Working Group eventually published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Specification</a> as a W3C Proposed Recommendation, and interested parties were invited to review it. The result, after years of work, is one of the most innovative standards to date. The specification addresses an important gap in internet infrastructure — that of proving identifier ownership using methods that are distributed and decentralized. Filling this gap is a critical step towards realizing&nbsp; decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Several organizations have formally objected to the specification. We will not discuss their objections or the responses here — they have been well addressed by other community members and we refer you to a few of them, listed below.</p>
<p>The position of Indicio is that the DID Specification is of signal importance to creating a better digital world. We recognize that, as with any specification, improvements can and will be made in the future; but we back its recommendations and its approval.</p>
<p>We do this because Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized digital ecosystems that provide the ability to trust the authenticity of information and relationships using verifiable credentials. As the gap between our real and digital lives blurs, we must be able to define public goods that orient and protect people as they live and work and do business at the intersection of the real and digital. Decentralized identity is a public good — and we can’t collectively achieve it without a DID Specification.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity enables privacy and consent, authenticity and verification, and all within a new mechanism for peer-to-peer interaction that transforms security. All of these elements are either missing from or badly broken in our current digital world. The move from centralized ways of organizing digital information and relationships to decentralized is the paradigm shift we need, one that will benefit almost everyone, whether consumer or business, citizen or government. It will even benefit&nbsp; things — devices both digital and non-digital.</p>
<p>The DID Specification is critical to realizing decentralized identity as a public good. This is why we support the W3C, its groups, and its standards work — and encourage everyone to get involved to build a better digital future.</p>

			 Enegra’s tokenized equity improves the liquidity of its $28Bn balance sheet via T-REX Platform<br>
 
<p>Enegra sought to provide liquidity and great UX for its investors while remaining compliant on the public blockchain. Enegra turned to Tokeny’s innovative digital asset compliance infrastructure to issue, manage and transfer its equity on the blockchain. Tokeny’s solution allows Enegra to achieve a seamless outcome without the worry of technical barriers. The highlighted results are:</p>

		 
	 
      <p>Improved liquidity</p>      <p>Global and automated compliance</p>      <p>Zero transaction fees</p>                              We tokenized our equity to improve liquidity. And, now that the technology is available for faster, cheaper, and compliant transactions on the blockchain, we wanted our investors to take advantage of it. Polygon and Tokeny provided the complete infrastructure we needed to do so, and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Matthew AverayManaging Director &amp; CEO at Enegra        
	 
		 
			 Introduction 
<p><a href="https://www.enegragroup.com/">Enegra</a> was established in Malaysia in 2011, with a mission to enable mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally, Enegra achieves this through its world-class trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance – thereby delivering economic security among mid-tier mining communities whose lack of trading expertise often leaves them exploited on price.</p>
 Why Enegra tokenized its equity 
<p>Earlier 2019, Enegra’s management team explored asset tokenization, and team was fascinated by the concept and the advantages it brings to the company as an issuer, along the liquidity benefits to its investors. The following benefits meet exactly what Enegra sought to achieve for its new equity offering:</p>
 
 Improved liquidity 
 Automated compliance 
 Real-time cap table 
 Low administration and asset transfer costs 
 Control securities 
 Directly connect with investors 
 
 Compliantly tokenizing assets since 2019 
<p>Later in 2019, Enegra embarked on a search for a suitable tokenization platform to issue and manage its equity-backed security tokens on a public blockchain in a compliant manner, along with the necessary controls in place. Tokeny’s <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> caught Enegra’s attention for two main reasons:</p>
 
 First: it leverages the public blockchain while bringing compliance and control. It achieves this through a unique <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchain-finance-leveraging-decentralized-technology-for-capital-markets-infrastructure/">onchain compliance approach</a> by whitelisting of digital identity not the wallet for maximum security, e.g: when investors lose their wallets, issuers can recover the tokens for them. 
 Second: it provides the most advanced platform (120+ functions) with the best user experience in the market. 
 
<p>In September 2019, Enegra issued its equity-backed EGX security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform on Ethereum. From then on, Enegra has been managing its security tokens and investors through the same platform.</p>
 Improving the UX further: say goodbye to gas fees 
<p>Earlier this year, Tokeny enhanced its blockchain layer to start supporting Polygon, a scalable layer 2 solution, to provide a faster, cheaper and compliant infrastructure for its customers. In addition, <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-has-solved-the-problem-of-gas-fees/">the Gas Tank solution</a> was introduced to make the transaction fees free for platform users, eliminating infrastructure costs and troublesome processes.</p>
<p>To enhance the user experience of its security token holders, Enegra upgraded its services with Tokeny last month:</p>
 
 Migrated security tokens to Polygon&nbsp; 
 Implemented the Gas Tank solution 
 
<p>Enegra and its security token holders can now take advantage of fast, free and compliant transactions which ultimately improves liquidity and accessibility of the assets.&nbsp;</p>

 Introduction <p>In collaboration with<a href="http://twitter.com/deltadao"> deltaDAO</a>, we implemented new adjustable privacy features into Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>If data owners want to spin up their data market based on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>, it will now include adjustable privacy features by design, including a privacy preference center, multi-language privacy policies, and more editable metadata.</p><p>Section 1 of this blog post discusses the need for decentralized data sharing solutions and explains how Ocean Protocol solves the current trade-off between using and monetizing private data and the risk of exposing&nbsp;it.</p><p>Section 2 explains how privacy-preserving data sharing with Oceans <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2020-05-26-ocean-protocol-launches-compute-to-data-efb89990ce1">Compute-to-Data </a>enables individuals and businesses to monetize private data while keeping full ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Then we describe how Ocean follows privacy and security by design principles and explain the new privacy features that Ocean Market now offers by default. Following that, we include a brief How-to on how to use these features in practice when setting up a data&nbsp;market.</p> Background <p>AI loves data. The more data is available, the more accurate AI models become which leads to better business and research outcomes. It can help research, leading to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/motivation-for-the-global-initiative-on-ai-and-data-commons-151628c15d6">life-altering innovations</a> in science and technology.</p><p>However, while large amounts of valuable data are generated each year, data exchange, AI application and analysis are often aggravated by restrictions or concerns over security, privacy and associated regulatory risks. For example, the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines high potential fines for privacy breaches, which can be as high as 4% of a company’s annual turnover.</p><p>Thus, data often remains locked in silos and its value is underutilized. Data is hoovered up and used by a handful of big players. In the status quo, there is just not enough incentive to share&nbsp;data.</p><p>But: The confluence of blockchain, AI and data can very well be a lightning charge to spark an immense and far-reaching decentralized Data Economy. That is where Ocean Protocol comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>Ocean is built on a radical possibility: the potential for data to be shared openly without barriers. The idea was to build a decentralized data exchange protocol that enables anyone to publish and trade datasets that they have the right to. At its core Ocean aims to give people and organizations the power to take control of their data, share their data the way they want to, and monetize their data under their own terms. It aims to unlock an Open Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/deltadao">deltaDAO AG</a> acts as an integrator of the Ocean Protocol tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Adding more privacy-preserving features to the Ocean tech stack is one focus of the ongoing collaboration between deltaDAO and Ocean Protocol Foundation. In the last few months deltaDAO focused&nbsp;on</p>  improving the privacy features in Ocean&nbsp;Market  building market and Compute-to-Data demonstrators, such as the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/building-towards-a-decentralized-european-data-economy-a-minimal-viable-gaia-x-mvg-powered-by-43a853101d">Minimal Viable&nbsp;Gaia-X</a>  educating enterprises and consortia about the Web3 data economy and Ocean Protocol core&nbsp;design   Compute-to-Data (CtD) <p>Compute-to-Data allows for privacy-preserving data sharing, remote computation and data monetization and is a core feature and strong advantage of Ocean Protocol. CtD keeps the data on-premises and allows data consumers to run remote compute jobs on the data. Data owners keep full control as the data never leaves their premises and is only ever accessed by algorithms.</p><p>Compute-to-Data resolves the tradeoff between using private data and the risks of exposing it. Newly monetized data creates new revenue streams for data publishers. Price discovery using Automated Market Makers (AMMs) allows newly published data to be priced to market&nbsp;value.</p><p>CtD is directly integrated into Ocean Market, where data providers can opt to restrict the access type to “compute only”. Once data is made accessible, the compute job is brought to the data and executed on-premise. This is especially suitable to train AI models, calculate statistics or build business analytics use cases on private data without revealing them.</p><p>“The technology must default towards the ideals of data protection, towards democratizing data while retaining privacy rights. Compute-to-Data is Ocean’s response to solving the current trade-off between benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it.” — Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>There is a multitude of applications in business, technology and science, benefitting from sufficient aggregation or anonymization of data. Moreover, data owners can approve only vetted and trusted algorithms, which further lowers privacy&nbsp;risk.</p><p>“Using Ocean Protocol, data consumers can train their AI models on remote private data sets and extract insights while ensuring compliance with privacy regulation. The data remains secure, it never leaves the owner’s premises.” — Frederic Schwill, Tech Lead at&nbsp;deltaDAO</p> Applications and business cases of Ocean’s&nbsp;CtD <p>Ocean’s CtD is a versatile technology that can be applied to problems and business cases of varying complexity.</p><p>In Ocean, a Compute-to-Data infrastructure is set up as a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. The cluster runs in the background on, for example, cloud services like AWS or Azure or private infrastructure. This Kubernetes cluster is responsible for running the actual compute jobs, out of sight for marketplace clients and end-users. In its simplest form, it could compute an average. For example, getting an average of wages across offices of a multinational company can be difficult due to privacy regulations in different jurisdictions.</p><p>More advanced applications could feature statistics or business analytics use cases, for example doing remote analytics across the supply chain of certain automakers.</p><p>CtD is especially useful when applied to verticals like the health sector, where Ocean Protocol enables the possibility to train machine learning models across patient data residing at different hospitals. CtD applied in the health sector can accelerate advancements in science and research, ultimately contributing to saving more lives&nbsp;faster.</p> Privacy-preserving data monetization <p>CtD, combined with Ocean Protocol’s built-in data monetization layer is a powerful tool to enable sustainable business models around private data lakes. Users can benefit from this technology in a number of ways. Developers can quickly launch their own data marketplace, using Ocean software components while connected to the Ocean decentralized data-sharing network.</p><p>Data owners can sell the private data in a marketplace while maintaining control:</p>  Privacy: sell private data, while preserving privacy. It stays private because only AI algorithms see the data directly.  Control: data assets remain secure. Control stays with data owners because data never leaves the premises.  <p>Data consumers can access private data without the liability of directly seeing private&nbsp;data.</p><p>AI practitioners &amp; data scientists can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models to improve research and business outcomes.”</p> Following privacy and security by design principles <p>Being based on blockchain, Ocean Protocol has some key advantages compared to traditional Web2 data sharing solutions:</p><p>It is radically different from the traditional manner we exchanged data in the past, which usually involves giving up control and using a middleman mediating between data market participants. The middleman is a single point of failure and could use the data for their own benefit or have their data stolen, as regularly reported in the&nbsp;media.</p><p>Following security and privacy by design principles and giving control back to the user, are key elements of the GDPR. Ocean gives full control and sovereignty to data owners. Moreover, compared to Web2 solutions, Ocean Market requires minimal personal&nbsp;data.</p> NEW: Adjustable privacy&nbsp;features <p>The Ocean Market is an out-of-the-box data marketplace for monetizing data — both with an Ocean reference marketplace and the promise to allow developers to build their own marketplaces to monetize data. Here data can be bought or sold in a privacy-preserving fashion using&nbsp;CtD.</p><p>If data owners want to spin up their data market based on Ocean Market, it will now include adjustable privacy features by design. Here’s&nbsp;how:</p>  Multi-language privacy policies. Ocean Market delivers a privacy policy in English, German, Spanish, and French to inform the market users adequately and transparently about the processing operations. These policies are free to use and can be quickly adjusted to your needs so that you can get started right away and worry less about regulations.  Facilitated introduction of new policies: Moreover, Ocean Market provides easy to edit markdown files to enable you to easily add and remove privacy policies. You can add a policy by providing your own markdown file in the content/pages/privacy directory.  Privacy preference center. There is also a configurable privacy preference center. We offer a simple configuration for showing a cookie banner, as well as a more advanced setup. If your use case requires it, you can now configure a fine-grained preference center for marketing or analytics cookies, which require user&nbsp;consent.  History Table: The history table is a transparency feature you can use to quickly overview the transactions you made on Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Disclaimers. To increase transparency even further, Ocean Market provides several disclaimers to inform users about privacy implications.  Editable metadata: After publishing a data asset you can rectify your metadata (e.g. the author field) at any&nbsp;time.  Data Lifecycle Management: You can restrict the processing of your personal data on Ocean Market by using <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/list-assets.json">Purgatory</a>, a mechanism to hide any data asset from Ocean&nbsp;Market.   How to use the new privacy&nbsp;features <p>If you are new to Ocean Market, head over to our dedicated beginners guide on how to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/launch-a-blockchain-based-data-marketplace-in-under-1-hour-9baa85a65ece#3a60">Launch a blockchain-based data marketplace in under 1&nbsp;hour</a>.</p><p>After finishing the initial setup of your data market, depending on your use case, you may want to enable the features mentioned above.</p><p>To get started and display a simple pre-configured cookie banner, head to your&nbsp;.env file in the root of your repository. If you do not yet have a&nbsp;.env file you can just create&nbsp;one.</p><p>Make sure you have the file saved at the same location as shown&nbsp;below:</p><p>Now copy and paste the following into the&nbsp;file:</p><p>GATSBY_PRIVACY_PREFERENCE_CENTER=”true”</p><p>You will notice a few changes when you now run your market with the following command: npm&nbsp;start.</p><p>First, you will notice a cookie banner that is now appearing in the bottom left corner (1). Additionally, a link to open this banner again is now displayed in the footer&nbsp;(2).</p><p>Now, to configure everything that is displayed within the privacy preference center, you can open the “content” folder and navigate to a file called “gdpr.json”. Open it up and you will see the configurations for our privacy preference center.</p><p>You can change the title, body and even the text on the buttons in this file. Additionally, you will notice a variable called “optionalCookies”. Here you can configure which optional cookies your market implementation uses and give the user the option to opt-in or out of each category individually.</p><p>If you click on the “Customize” button in the cookie banner of your running market, you will see the additional preferences a user can&nbsp;set.</p><p>To make use of those preferences, head over to the CookieConsent provider located in the “provider” folder in the “src” directory. Open the “CookieConsent.tsx” file and you will find two functions that are of special interest. “handleAccept” and “handleReject”. Each time the user changes their settings on any given cookie category, these functions will be called respectively. The “cookieName” passed over to the functions is the same you set in the “gdpr.json” file.</p><p>To make interaction with cookies a little easier for you we also provide a helper file named “cookie.ts” located in the “utils” folder within the “src” directory. You can import the “setCookie” and “deleteCookie” functions, as well as the “getCookieValue” function anywhere in your code to easily handle your&nbsp;cookies.</p><p>But there’s more! Let’s say your market will only use strictly necessary cookies and you want to display a cookie banner only to inform users. In that case, you can go ahead and delete the “optionalCookies” variable in the “gdpr.json” config file altogether. Now change the text of the cookie banner and give the close button a more fitting label and you are all&nbsp;set.</p><p>Your users will now be presented with a simple cookie banner informing them of your use of cookies, which they can acknowledge.</p> Conclusion <p>For Ocean, secure data sharing is a means to an end: it enables staking, pricing, curating, and incentivization to share. Until now, anyone looking to provide data for sale would need to set up companies, figure out the back-office, build sales and distribution channels and then provide the actual value of the data. With Ocean, those barriers are much, much&nbsp;lower.</p><p>Ocean Protocol resolves the current trade-off between the benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it. Ocean follows security and privacy by design principles, giving control and sovereignty back to data&nbsp;owners.</p><p>If you want to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/launch-a-blockchain-based-data-marketplace-in-under-1-hour-9baa85a65ece#3a60">spin up a data market based on Ocean Market</a>, it will already support all privacy features out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>“The increasing loss of control over one’s own data and the non-transparent way in which companies exploit users requires change. Ocean Protocol enables this change.” — Meike Molitor, Compliance Lead at deltaDAO&nbsp;AG.</p> About deltaDAO <p><a href="http://twitter.com/deltadao">deltaDAO AG</a> is the first “Ocean Protocol” engineering, integration, and consulting company — entirely founded, built, led, operated, and owned by Ocean Protocol community members and supporters. deltaDAO’s mission is to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/building-towards-a-decentralized-european-data-economy-a-minimal-viable-gaia-x-mvg-powered-by-43a853101d">build towards a European data economy powered by “Ocean Protocol”</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>There is no successful digital business without utilizing digital identities. Digital identities of consumers, customers, business partners, employees, but also devices, things, or services are at the core of the digital business. Unfortunately, most digital identities reside in siloes. Building a modern Identity Fabric that delivers seamless yet secure and controlled access from everyone and everything to every service requires breaking down the legacy identity siloes. Only then, new digital services can unveil and leverage the potential of the identities you have and that are newly created. Radiant Logic delivers the technology for creating a unified view and use across all types of identities, thus delivering the data foundation for modern Identity Fabrics.

<p>In den letzten Wochen gab es, aufgrund des ID-Wallet Projektes, einige Artikel und Kommentare, die Dezentrale Digitale Identitäten, auch Self Sovereign Identities (SSI) genannt, mit Blockchain Technologie gleich setzten. Es wird der Eindruck vermittelt, dass SSI nur gemeinsam mit einer Blockchain&nbsp;funktioniert. Spoiler, das ist nicht so.<br>Wieso dies nicht so ist, versuche ich im Folgenden vereinfacht zu erklären.</p>



<p>Der Begriff Blockchain wird in diesem Artikel stellvertretend für alle Distributed Ledger Technologien (DLT) verwendet. Darunter fallen sämtliche public Blockchains wie Bitcoin oder Ethereum, permissioned/public -, und permissioned/private Blockchains.</p>



<p>Was bedeutet dezentral bei Dezentralen Digitalen Identitäten?</p>



<p>Das “dezentral” bezieht sich nicht auf Blockchains. Dezentral bedeutet, dass die Daten einer Person, bei der Person selbst gespeichert und unter deren Kontrolle sind. Meist sind die Daten auf dem Smartphone, auf einer sogenannten Wallet, gespeichert. Eine SSI Wallet hat auch nichts mit dem Verwahren von Kryptowährungen zu tun. Herkömmliche digitale Identitätssysteme speichern die Daten auf dem Server des Anbieters, also zentral.</p>



<p>Privater- und öffentlicher Schlüssel, was ist das?</p>



<p>Dezentrale Digitale Identitäten sind nur aufgrund von Kryptographie möglich. Einer der Grundpfeiler ist die asymmetrische Verschlüsselung. Mittels eines kryptographischen Verfahren wird ein Schlüsselpaar erzeugt. Das Paar besteht aus einem öffentlichen- und einem privaten Schlüssel. Wie die Namen schon verraten, muss der private Schlüssel privat bleiben und der öffentliche Schlüssel kann geteilt werden. Mit diesem Schlüsselpaar kann man zwei Dinge tun:</p>



  Man kann eine Nachricht verschlüsseln.<br>Die Verschlüsselung erfolgt mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel und Entschlüsselung mit dem privaten.  Man kann eine Datei signieren.<br>Die Signatur erfolgt mit dem privaten Schlüssel und die Prüfung der Signatur erfolgt mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel.  



<p>Für die weitere Erklärung ist die Signaturfunktion wichtig.</p>



<p>Dezentrale Digitale Identität und digitale Signaturen.</p>



<p>In einem SSI System, erzeugt ein Aussteller die Daten (z.B. einen Führerschein), signiert diese digital und übergibt sie dem Empfänger. Der Empfänger kann den signierten Datensatz oder Teile davon an einen Prüfer schicken. Der Prüfer kann mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel des Ausstellers die Echtheit der Daten prüfen. </p>



<p>Wie kommt der Prüfer zum öffentlichen Schlüssel?</p>



<p>Damit der Prüfer die Daten prüfen kann, benötigt er den öffentlichen Schlüssel des Ausstellers. Aber wie kommt er zu diesem? In herkömmlichen Systemen, wie zum Beispiel bei SSL Zertifikaten, wird eine zentrale Stelle kontaktiert. Unser Browser fragt bei einer Registrierungsstelle nach, ob das Zertifikat der Website registriert ist. Damit stellt unser Browser sicher, dass wir uns nicht auf einer gefälschten Seite befinden. Die Nachteile dieser Methode sind, die Abhängigkeit von einem zentralen Dienst und das Sammeln von Informationen über unsere Aktivitäten.</p>



<p>Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain.</p>



<p>Für die Speicherung und Abfrage des öffentlichen Schlüssels kann man auch eine Blockchain verwenden. Hier ist zu betonen, dass die Blockchain keinerlei Sicherheit gibt, ob der hinterlegte Schlüssel wirklich vom vorgegebenen Aussteller stammt. Es muss gewährleistet sein, dass der Aussteller auch der ist, für den er sich ausgibt. Dies kann nicht durch Technologie alleine erreicht werden. Es müssen auch organisatorische- und Prozessvorgaben erstellt werden. Oft wird von Governance oder einem Trust-Framework gesprochen. Dies ist aber ein anderes Thema und würde den Rahmen sprengen. Der theoretische Vorteil einer Blockchain ist, dass sie dezentral ist und theoretisch jeder Prüfer eine Kopie eines Blockchainknoten vorhalten kann und so sichergestellt ist, dass man keinen zentralen Dienst kontaktieren muss. In der Realität erfolgt die Abfrage aber auch meist bei einem zentralen Dienst, der selbst einen Knoten betreibt und die Information zur Verfügung stellt.</p>



<p>Kann man auch andere Speicherorte als Blockchains für die öffentlichen Schlüssel verwenden?</p>



<p>Ja man kann. Es wäre sogar möglich bestehende PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures) zu verwenden. Es muss nur sichergestellt werden, dass der Datenschutz eingehalten wird und kein Dritter Informationen über die Benutzung der Daten erhält. Ein weiterer Aspekt ist natürlich die Abhängigkeit von einem zentralen Dienst. Stellt dieser den Dienst ein, oder löscht einzelne Schlüssel, kann der Schlüssel nicht mehr geprüft werden. Auf diese Aspekte muss im Design eines Trust-Frameworks Rücksicht genommen werden. Hier könnten wieder dezentrale Technologien hilfreich sein…</p>



<p>Die folgende Grafik stellt ein Beispiel dar, indem 2 Dokumente von 2 unterschiedlichen Ausstellern von einem Prüfer geprüft werden. Der erste Aussteller, in diesem Fall eine Bank, verwendet ein Blockchain Netzwerk, um seinen Schlüssel abzulegen, der zweite Aussteller, eine Behörde, verwendet ein bereits existierende PKI.</p>

<p>Fazit</p>



<p>In den letzten beiden Jahren hat sich die SSI Community von der Blockchain Technology emanzipiert. Man hat erkannt, dass eine Blockchain nicht unbedingt eine Voraussetzung ist, um eine Digitale Dezentrale Identität zu realisieren. Und es gibt auch nicht das eine Blockchain-Netzwerk, auf der ein SSI System aufbauen muss. Es ist egal welches, solange sie Sicherheits- und Betriebsstandards erfüllt.<br>Es ist auch schwierig, dass zum Beispiel Behörden, ihre derzeitigen bestehenden PKI Implementierungen aufgeben werden. Daher kann es Sinn ergeben auf bestehende PKIs aufzusetzen.</p>



<p>Diesen Rahmenbedingungen trägt auch Jolocom Rechnung und entwickelt seine nächste Generation von SSI Technologie unabhängig vom darunterliegenden Speicher, PKI oder Blockchainnetzwerken. Jeder beliebige Speicherort kann angebunden werden.</p>



<p>Wichtiger als die Frage, der eingesetzte Technologie, ist die Definition der Organisation und der Prozesse, damit eine sichere PKI und das höchste Maß an Datensicherheit für die Bürger gewährleistet ist.</p>

 More Americans than ever are pushing for federal data privacy protections, according to the Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MeriTalk&nbsp;<a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/trust-in-government-is-low-but-americans-are-united-around-investments-in-technology/">survey</a>&nbsp;released last month. 



<p></p>



<p>The clear majority of adults surveyed want national standards around how companies collect, process and share&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;to help protect users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and security online. Seven in 10 people agree with the federal government treating personal data security as a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">national security</a>&nbsp;issue and investing in cybersecurity.</p>



 The survey also revealed&nbsp;<a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/trust-in-government-is-low-but-americans-are-united-around-investments-in-technology/">60 percent</a>&nbsp;of Americans believe their social media and physical location data are not secure online. 



<p></p>



<p>The AP-NORC surveyed 1,004 adults in late June using NORC’s Ameri-Speak panel, which is designed to be representative of the whole population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall the results show Americans are optimistic that government investments in technology will improve their lives, particularly their online data security, in the next 10 years. But 56 per cent say they trust the private sector to do more than government in this area—which we see as&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">a&nbsp;massive opportunity</a>&nbsp;for enterprise to step up the privacy and cybersecurity solutions they offer customers.</p>



<p>Americans have been waiting a long time for a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">national data privacy law</a>, as opposed to the patchwork of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state laws</a>&nbsp;we currently have, and the United States remains one of the few countries in the world without one.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">China</a> recently passed its Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), recognizing that the amount of personal data collected by non-government online services and mobile apps is at the point where it can be a rich data source for a national security adversary. The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">United States</a>&nbsp;certainly recognizes this same&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/digital-advertising-may-present-national-security-risks-us-senators/">risk to national security</a> from&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>



<p>The people are speaking so let’s hope the federal government hears and acts soon.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology has come a long way over the last decade, from Bitcoin enabling a secure, decentralized, and trustless way to transfer value, to Ethereum enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications, opening up a wider range of logic with new use cases. We are already seeing a fast rate of adoption in blockchain applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Many blockchains outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum are also gaining adoption, widening the funnel for the mainstream to enter this space. The time is ripe for multichain.</p> Layers in the blockchain <p>Before diving into multichain, let’s first go over the three layers in the blockchain ecosystem: layer 0, layer 1, and layer&nbsp;2.</p><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-0">Layer 0</a> (L0) is the base layer among blockchain protocols. Think of it as a blockchain of blockchains. It supports different types of blockchains and allows them to interoperate with one another (e.g. Polkadot and&nbsp;Cosmos).</p><p>Today, if you ask anyone outside of the vibrant crypto community to describe blockchain, most would mention: Bitcoin (or maybe Dogecoin). Bitcoin and Dogecoin are both layer 1. <a href="https://thedefiant.io/whats-layer-1-vs-layer-2/">Layer 1</a> (L1) is a blockchain itself and acts as the base layer for applications.</p><p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/whats-layer-1-vs-layer-2/">Layer 2</a> (L2) is a network built on top of the underlying layer 1 blockchain. They are designed to help scale the underlying blockchain, for instance, by handling the computation of many transactions off-chain and submitting a single proof so that users can enjoy fast transaction speed and low gas cost for using the&nbsp;network.</p> Enter multichain <p>A multichain world represents the world of multiple blockchains spanning layer 0 to layer 1 to layer&nbsp;2.</p><blockquote>We believe multichain is already&nbsp;here.</blockquote><p>Check <a href="https://cryptofees.info/">cryptofees.info</a>, a site that offers usage metrics on blockchains and protocols, today versus a year before&nbsp;today.</p>Crypto Fees chart, 1 year&nbsp;ago<p>A year ago, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and protocols built on Ethereum represented nearly the entire list. Today, new players — L1s outside of Ethereum, protocols built on separate L1s, and various L2s — have gained popularity.</p>Crypto Fees chart,&nbsp;today<p>This is not to say Ethereum combined with its ecosystem of protocols is losing its dominance, but rather the total addressable market is being realized faster. This trend is just getting started. Time will tell, but we do not see this as a winner-takes-all-market.</p><p>Currently, adoption of multichain seems to be mainly driven by problems stemming from network congestion in blockchains with high demand. This means that since there is so much demand to use the blockchain, unless you pay really high gas fees, your transaction will take a long time to be completed. As a result, other blockchains that focused on scalability (fast transaction times) with low cost of entry (cheaper gas fees) have benefited&nbsp;. Of course, this provokes the question: is it acceptable to compromise security and decentralization for scalability? Is it making the right tradeoffs in the blockchain <a href="https://medium.com/certik/the-blockchain-trilemma-decentralized-scalable-and-secure-e9d8c41a87b3">trilemma</a> model? We will dive more into that in the next&nbsp;section.</p><p>At Magic, we would like to share our thoughts on pragmatically taking Web3 to the mainstream, and this starts with focusing our lens from a purely UI/UX perspective.</p><blockquote>Scalability and cheaper gas fees as the two main factors that need to be addressed to onboard the next billion Web3&nbsp;users.</blockquote><p>Scalability enables fast transactions. Fast transaction time is already a massive UI/UX improvement. Just look at Amazon losing revenue for <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales">every hundred milliseconds of latency</a>. Unless everyone goes down the rabbit hole of how blockchains actually work, people will simply not wait and drop off. Time is precious.</p><p>Cheaper gas fees lower the cost of entry for the mainstream. Currently, the “mass” are priced out of using Ethereum (hopefully ETH2 + L2s will address this) for a few&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Not understanding or appreciating the cost of using a highly secured and decentralized blockchain which does not justify the high cost they need to pay to use the blockchain  Not having enough capital to use chains with high&nbsp;demand  <p>Thankfully, there is great progress in L0s, L1s, and L2s working in tandem to address those issues and level the playing field for everyone.</p> Multichain is a&nbsp;choice <p>What should the right mental model be for deciding which blockchain to pick over another? Is the blockchain <a href="https://medium.com/certik/the-blockchain-trilemma-decentralized-scalable-and-secure-e9d8c41a87b3">trilemma</a> model the only one to look at? There are different implications that you may run into when you compromise one aspect over another. At the same time, this is not completely binary. It is more like playing around with the levers based on your preference or requirements. How much speed does your application need? How much decentralization is enough? How much security is required?</p><p>Let’s go over some hypothetical scenarios with respect to the trilemma&nbsp;model:</p>  Your application does not benefit from the network effect of users that already exist in the blockchain. You are also concerned that you may experience network congestion issues during busy times even in scalable blockchains that could affect your app’s experience. It would make sense to launch your own blockchain on L0. This likely means you would first be prioritizing speed and security over decentralization.  You are launching a DeFi application and your #1 priority is tapping into the blockchain with the most liquidity and the network effect of DeFi users. Fast transaction speed and low gas cost are nice-to-haves. It would make sense to launch your application on a blockchain with the most liquidity and many DeFi users. People would be most comfortable providing liquidity to the blockchain that is secure and decentralized.  You would like to tap into a diverse set of user bases. It would make sense to launch your application on multiple chains with different sets of user bases. If the user base is the top priority, perhaps the trilemma model does not matter as&nbsp;much.  You are launching a NFT game application and you care about fast transaction speed and low gas cost. It would make sense to launch your application on a highly scalable chain that offers low gas cost. This likely means you would be prioritizing speed over security and decentralization.  <p>It does not always have to be systemic related. There could be one blockchain community that really aligns with your ethos and you are also aligned with their vision that they are chasing towards and you would like to be part of their journey. Or you may strongly care about developer experience, and the blockchain project that offers the best developer experience according to your criteria may be attractive to&nbsp;you.</p><p>In the end, multichain is a&nbsp;choice.</p> Magic and multichain brings us closer to mainstream adoption <p>At <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a>, we serve developers.</p><blockquote>Magic is empowering developers with the tools needed to put them in the best position to succeed.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the tenth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/MunajHossan4">Munaj Hossan</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyBangladesh">Bengali community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first learned about Ontology from CoinMarketCap in 2019. At first, I didn’t do much research on it but later when I saw that its team members were developing the project very well, I began following Ontology more seriously.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I noticed that Ontology had many local communities. I wanted to support Ontology and help grow the ecosystem so I created the Ontology <a href="https://t.me/OntologyBangladesh">Bengali Community</a>.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>In my opinion, a Harbinger’s main role is sharing news, helping community members, removing language barriers, and maintaining the community’s growth and activity.</p><p>My favorite thing is having direct and special access to the Ontology&nbsp;team.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Ontology is one of the best blockchain platforms I’ve seen and has been on the market for over three years. Being part of the Ontology community is the best way for me to improve my&nbsp;skills.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Ontology has a total of 30+ local communities and 700K community members. Ontology has a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">Harbinger program</a>, which is not available in other projects. Ontology imparts ideas to people before launching anything new, which we have seen in its <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/web3-101-how-ontology-is-helping-catalyze-web-3-0-adoption-and-why-it-matters-cae3d304fb22?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">Web3</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/what-are-ethereum-virtual-machines-and-why-should-you-care-930a739171a9?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">EVM</a>&nbsp;series.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>I am most active on Telegram so I will choose Telegram as the key channel. I also use Twitter to interact with Ontology-related posts.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>Since I am a new Harbinger, I have no memorable experiences. However, I understand that the Ontology team evaluates advice from Harbinger’s and helps implement new ideas. If you want to be a Harbinger, you can <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">apply</a>. Remember that if you work hard, you will&nbsp;succeed.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Active, helpful,&nbsp;awesome.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>I think new events and campaigns can be held to help grow the community and impress existing community members. I would like to see more Harbingers and influencers in Ontology who can help grow the community.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>ONT ID recently surpassed 1.5 million users and on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Ontology</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet">ONTO Wallet</a> passed 160k and 100k followers, respectively. I think community is the key to achieving these milestones. Hopefully, the community will continue supporting Ontology in the future as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Joe some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your presentation: “Securing the Cloud - From the Inside Out” 
<p>Sure. Hi, I'm really excited to do this presentation. The way I think about it is, you know, there's that old saying "the cloud is just someone else's computer", and in this case, a big part of the cloud is actually the computers that we run for our customers. My number one job at Cloudflare is to make sure that those servers are secure. And so what I'm looking forward to doing is talking about how we approach security of those servers, how we interact with customers on that and how you should be thinking about, when you evaluate companies like Cloudflare.</p>
 What does the term "cloud" represent for you and Cloudflare? 
<p>Yeah, it's funny. To me, the term cloud represents the concept of making your job easier for you. It's taking one of the burdens of traditional information security and information technology and moving it off of your responsibility and not ours. It used to be that every company, as they grew up, they had to buy more and more servers of their own and dedicate more and more of their own resources to taking care of them. Now, with the cloud, our customers can focus on their core product, and we take care of that infrastructure for them.</p>
 What lessons have you learned over the years managing Cloudflare? 
<p>Well, people always ask me why I joined Cloudflare, and one of the reasons I joined was because I like going where the internet security issues are. And the internet security issues happen from the kernel on the server all the way up to the network, traffic all the way out to the end-user, and, I have learned that something can go wrong anywhere along the process. It can be a security issue. It could be a performance issue. And you need to have dedicated teams working on all those areas all the time to support our customers well.</p>
 How does Cloudflare ensure that privacy and security are delivered despite the immense scale? 
<p>Yeah, I think it's, you know, it starts with our mission as a company. At Cloudflare, our mission is to help build a better internet. And we think about, everyday performance, reliability, security, and privacy. Our business model doesn't involve collecting people's data and making information from it or making money from it. It involves providing security, privacy, and performance at scale. And then a business model comes from that. It's a really neat thing where you get to come to work every day and help make the internet better for everybody else and build a business around it.</p>

<p>NFTs, the Metaverse, and Digital Identity</p>



<p>This post started over as a mid-coffee ramble at <a href="https://community.decentralised.co/c/nft/power-law-of-nfts-in-the-metaverse">Decentralised.co</a> (kudos go to <a href="https://community.decentralised.co/u/5126b933">Joel John</a> for creating that community).</p>



 
I thought I would share a thought that is still forming in my mind. It came from a question that I was asked:
 



<p>“Will NFTs matter in the gaming and VR/AR worlds?” </p>



<p>My answer was yes. But then I started wondering what that could mean. Imagine a 3D immersive environment along the lines of Second Life. You “decorate” your “home” with “art”. You pop up an obligatory Persistence of Memory Dali print. But is it “real” and what does real even mean? In the physical realm, we know that this is only one original, which is at the MOMA in NYC. But what about the various quality prints that I can buy – at the MOMA, on Amazon, on the street.</p>



<p>How do we know that something is “authorized” or “authentic”?</p>



<p>And now, let’s go digital, where copying of data is free.</p>



<p>How do people know what’s real when we’re in the digital realm? Naval Ravikant did a good job of describing this idea on a <a href="https://tim.blog/2021/10/28/chris-dixon-naval-ravikant/">recent podcast</a> with Tim Ferriss and Chris Dixon. Basically, your game or xR rig will tell you what’s “real” and what is a reproduction, copy or outright fake. (Note: that podcast landed after most of this article was written – pretty awesome timing).</p>



<p>My guess here is that there will be a power law of NFT platforms and issuers that are considered “the real deal”. That is, a small number of NFT platforms/issuers that, when you query the detail behind that Dali on the wall, you say “OMG – this isn’t a crappy print from the street, this one is from .” The rest will be the equivalent of the poster you can buy on the street for your dorm room. As Naval says in that podcast – it’s the “copy-and-paste jpeg” or the original.</p>



<p>(Note: that world avocado image up above – it’s a copy-and-paste of an NFT. I haven’t figured out how to embed an image-based NFT into Ulysses/WordPress yet.)</p>



<p>This power-law concept presents signalling opportunities galore. But how will this shake out? Will there be preferred NFT Issuers on various platforms? As an example, TerraVirtua could be the recognized leader in the Unity gaming realm, but may mean nothing – or not even function – in a Facebook/Meta world. In fact, if you listen to that podcast I mentioned (Tim Ferriss, Naval Ravikant and Chris Dixon) they’ll point out that corporates (e.g. Meta/Facebook) are likely to resist any decentralized NFT use unless they get a “cut”. Remember – when you own the house, the house always wins.</p>



<p>Now think about artists and the way that they sell one original, numerous “limited” prints, perhaps some “artist” prints, and then there are the mass merchandise posters, postcards, coffee coasters, toilet paper (is that a thing? I hope not), etc. Will there be NFT platforms that cater to each of those? Will the artist receive similar portions of the proceeds?</p>



<p>Add in the identities (yes, the digital identities) of the key players – the artist/creator; the seller; the buyer; the platform. Each of those will get a cut of the proceeds likely. As an example, GaryVee (the creator) has some NFTs that clear a 10% fee on re-sale. The platform (Opensea.io in GaryVee’s case) adds 2.5%. So the seller is paying a selling fee of 12.5%. Further, of the 10% take that GaryVee brings in 1% (10% of his fees) goes to charity – which I imagine is handled via a smart contract.</p>



<p>Things are changing.</p>



<p>Quickly.</p>



<p>Just some mid-morning coffee thoughts. Let me know what you think.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>It was February 2014, already hundreds of millions of people worldwide had a smartphone in their pockets, with dozens of apps installed, apps like: Snapchat, Spotify, Vine, Skype, and games like Angry Birds and Minecraft. Mobile apps had been booming for a few years, and users were eager to install every app that resonated with them out of a seemingly unlimited stream of new apps. Indeed, the Apple’s App Store had recently reached the 1 million mobile apps milestone.</p>
<p>Not only mobile, but also in web services, for every new app I wanted to use, I needed to create a new user account, which was OK when I could count them with my own fingers. But what if I had 20, 30, 40 apps on my phone. This was becoming a headache for people, but especially it was clear to become a security concern.</p>
<p>Identity professionals had seen this challenge even in their own lives. And there were combined efforts from big tech, mobile operators, identity software vendors, to architect a solution. An early effort was the OpenID standard, which gained promising interaction at the start of the 2010s. With my OpenID user account, I could log into Yahoo, Google MySpace, and dozens of thousands of web services. However, the lack of a uniform user experience didn’t help people and not a massive audience got hooked with the standard.</p>
<p>So, what happened after the setback? A new solution had been cooked by identity professionals, and finally solved this long living problem. OpenID Connect not only solved that problem for the big tech and social networks, but created a modern way of user authentication, especially for mobile.</p>
<p>Today, if you are listening to this podcast, you have definitely used OpenID Connect before, with or without knowing it. To hear a story from the brilliant minds that designed this standard, let’s hear from Nat Sakimura, one of the creators of the OpenID Connect 1.0 Standard, and today, Chairman of the OpenID Foundation. How was the world just before OpenID connect appeared?</p>
<p>—</p>
 <p>Nat Sakimura</p> 
<p>Nat Sakimura: So you know, the creation of OpenID Connect actually started in 2009. And contemplation on that was actually done from 2007. Even before OpenID 2.0 was published, right? There were things like XRI, XDI, SAML. And SAML was becoming pretty strong in the market, but at the same time, because of the XMLD Signature problems, people are starting to complain about that.</p>
<p>And the OpenID Connect just started off with three people: Me, John Bradley, and Breno De Medeiros at the corner of the Internet Identity Workshop. And we were just sketching out a protocol, which is really dead simple to implement in the simple cases but at the same time, something that could be extended to a very high security, integrity protected federation protocol. And the years between 2010 and 2013 was spent on drafting it and implementing it.</p>
<p>Actually, a lot of people started implementing OpenID Connect back in 2011 or something like that. And we had multiple rounds of interop tests as well as you know, they were actually deployed in the wild and was tested. So OpenID Connect was actually quite well-implemented by service providers like Google before it was published in 2014.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, so that was my understanding that before the standard was published, like Google and other service providers already had some version, but not fully compatible. That was my understanding, it’s what I read. So, it then comes…</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, because it’s… early drafts, right?</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, early drafts. So what happened when all these people in these companies decided to join forces to create a unified standard that didn’t exist at that time? Was it easy to reach consensus for creating this new standard?</p>
<p>Nat: So it wasn’t that difficult. So, the process was kind of long, because we had to start from creating the digital signature standard to start with, right, which became JWS. And also, we had to create a token standard, which later became JWT, and encryption as well.</p>
<p>And so we had to start building very basic blocks. In parallel, we were also developing OAuth right, as the base protocol. So it was almost done from the ground up, because we didn’t have enough building blocks. So that kind of took long, but the discussion there wasn’t that contentious, really. People are cooperating and trying to achieve the maximal interoperability and the consensus in good spirit. So that was good.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that was great. Great to hear that there was consensus already because there was a need for having such a global standard for authentication for these new times especially when mobile was getting big.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, I guess the appearance of the iPhone and subsequent mobile-first world actually helped people to converge, because then people realise that they need a new protocol, which could deal with the new environment effectively.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And what would have happened if, for some reasons, even though you just told us that it was good consensus, but if some reason the standard had been published but still failed, what would have happened?</p>
<p>Nat: So by the time we have published the final version, it was pretty well deployed. So we didn’t think that it’s going to be a miserable failure. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo – well, at least Yahoo Japan – and a bunch of mobile carriers has already deployed them. So we were quite confident that it is going to achieve some degree of success.</p>
<p>But we actually had a long way to go as well. The specification is written in English – it’s just English, right? And there can be many ways to interpret it. And that became actually blatantly clear. And it was clear that we needed something which makes it tighter. That’s why we created certification suite. And I think over 600 deployments have already tested with the OpenID Connect certification in some form or fashion. And I think that has actually helped the interoperability of OpenID Connect substantially.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when the certification started?</p>
<p>Nat: So that was April 2015, just about a year after we had published OpenID Connect final.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. OK. Excellent. So it didn’t take too long until…</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, right. So Google, Microsoft, Ping Identity, ForgeRock, Nomura Research Institute, PayPal, went through the certification.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Oscar: That was Nat Sakimura from the OpenID Foundation. The standard was published and announced in February 2014 during the conferences, RSA 2014 and the Mobile World Congress, and the promise on the press release was “Providing Increased Security, Usability, and Privacy on the Internet”.</p>
<p>I was also curious to get another viewpoint from the early days when OpenID Connect was coming to life. Let’s hear from Petteri Stenius, Principal Scientist at Ubisecure. Since when, you, the team at Ubisecure years ago, start hearing about OpenID Connect? Since when OpenID Connect came to your radar?</p>
<p>—</p>
 <p>Petteri Stenius</p> 
<p>Petteri Stenius: All right. Thanks, Oscar. A nice question. Of course, in the very early days Ubisecure was definitely a SAML company. So back in the year of 2008, we had completed a full-matrix interoperability testing with a couple of very large companies like CA, NTT, RSA and Ping. So we had made a huge effort into testing interoperability with our SAML implementation. The testing was quite an effort. It was almost two weeks, a team of four people, when the size of our company was about 20 people at the time.</p>
<p>It was also at that time that we did hear for the first time mentioned the OAuth 1.0 and OpenID 1.0. The names of these protocols started to pop up. Initially, we did look at those, but we didn’t really become interested in the first versions of these protocols. But a couple of years later, the next iterations of this specification started to appear with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0. We did pay some more attention to this. But we were still quite happy with SAML so we did not rush into any implementations. And I think it was only in 2014, that we started to work on adding support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect into the products.</p>
<p>Oscar: And that happened, I guess, because some of Ubisecure customers or prospective customers already had new different requirements. So could you tell a bit about that?</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah. The fact is that SAML is quite complex and it basically requires that you integrate with ready tested implementation. So either your application server has a built-in support for SAML or you add support for SAML with an integration module. So, if you can find an application server that has support for SAML, or you can find an integration module with SAML, then you are quite happy. But the challenge at that time, in the beginning of 2010, 2012, and so, was that people started building web applications with completely new languages, tools and frameworks and application servers. So it was increasingly hard to find integration modules.</p>
<p>Also, there was this boom of mobile apps. So, SAML and mobile apps don’t really work well together. OpenID Connect is better suited for integration with mobile apps. So there was increased demand from our customers that they wanted something that was simpler than SAML and also they had completely new use cases with the mobile apps. So there was good reason to start working on OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.</p>
<p>[For more information, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/education/differences-between-saml-oauth-openid-connect/" title="check out this blog on the differences between OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0 &amp; SAML">check out this blog on the differences between OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0 &amp; SAML</a>]</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Mobile… well, the explosion of the mobile apps was definitely a driver.</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah, yeah. It was in the beginning of this decade. Yeah. Last decade, sorry.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Now, it’s last decade. That’s correct.</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: And if you can tell us a bit of what happened in the Ubisecure team, development team, when you made the decision already we are going to implement OpenID Connect into the platform. So tell us a bit of how things went in that moment.</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah. The product from the beginning has been designed so that it’s possible to add support for new federation protocols. There is a plug-in architecture of sorts. So when we started with the product, we only had support for our own in-house ticket protocol – that was in probably 2002 or 2003. Then we soon added SAML and WS-Federation. Initially, adding support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect was not a huge effort. It was quite straightforward.</p>
<p>But in the end, given all the extensions that have been designed into the specifications, I mean, it has been a significant effort to follow all of the developments in both of these specifications. But I’m fairly happy with the way that it has turned out. We have good support for most of the most important features in both of these specifications. And also we recently were able to complete interoperability testing with OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. And I also know that you at some point joined forces in OpenID Foundation. You’re a member and very active member there, right?</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah, yeah. I’ve been mostly active in the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/mobile/">MODRNA Working Group</a> where we are designing APIs for mobile authenticators, because mobile authenticators were… I mean Finland was quite early adopting mobile authenticators with the mobile PKI effort. I think it was already 15 years ago or something like that, that we had the mobile PKI system running in Finland and we had quite a lot of experience from that. And it was good to be sharing those experiences with the MODRNA Working Group and we were designing the new APIs for mobile authenticators.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, it’s great that now we are actively participating also in OpenID Foundation, helping building further this protocol, OpenID Connect and also OAuth 2.0 that evolves in parallel.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>That was Petteri Stenius, from Ubisecure.</p>
<p>When the OpenID Connect 1.0 was published, there was a strong need for a standard like that. Big players in tech and in the identity space put in all their efforts, and soon mobile operators, banks, governmental institutions and all kinds of organisations followed the adoption of the standard.</p>
<p>We can certainly say that OpenID Connect took over the world. It’s so prevalent in the online services we use every day that today it’s nearly impossible to measure how many services use the standard.</p>
<p>To give you just one example of the magnitude of this success, at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2018 in Munich, Alex Simons from Microsoft Identity Division, shared that in the last week of April 2018, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/sites/futurium/files/7_nat_sakimura_openid.pdf">92% of all Azure Active Directory authentication happened with OpenID Connect</a>. That was a massive slice of the pie chart that he showed. And that number is a lot and it’s growing every single day.</p>
<p>Today, nearly every single mobile application in which you authenticate uses the standard. As you can imagine, new security challenges have appeared throughout the years, so the standard had to keep evolving. So I asked Nat Sakimura his thoughts on the future of OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>Let’s now jump to the future, so, if you can tell me a bit of the new things that are happening in OpenID Connect for the protocol and how do you see the future of OpenID Connect if we start thinking five or 10 years, what do you envision?</p>
<p>Nat: Right. So, after we had published OpenID Connect 1.0, we were not standing still. For example, we have done quite a lot of work in the mobile space, as well as mobile operator space, as well as in the Financial Grade API security profile space. So generally speaking, Open Banking. So the UK has adopted FAPI, Australia adopted FAPI, and Brazil is now deploying FAPI into 800 banks and other relying parties there. And the US is also expected to do so pretty soon. And Russia is also in the process of doing so.</p>
<p>So, I continue to see… and so, if you don’t know FAPI is security protocol for higher risk use cases, right? So OpenID Connect can address very simple cases, to high security use cases, and it offers a lot of options. But FAPI actually pins it down to the highest security only options, right? And we do expect more deployments and more adoption of FAPI in the coming years. And in the OpenID Connect working group, we are busily working on something called Self-Issued OpenID Provider or SIOP, which is defined in chapter seven of OpenID Connect Core.</p>
<p>But there are handwavy stuff there. And also, we wanted to make it useful in terms of verified credentials and distributed identifier. So we are making an extension with regard to that. So we expect the specs to be coming out in a year or so, hopefully. So they can be deployed in the self-sovereign and distributed identifier and verified credential space as well. So that’s one thing.</p>
<p>We are also working on something called OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance. And this is to convey metadata about how identity proofing was performed on that particular entity. It’s closely related to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN, Global Assured Identity Network">GAIN, Global Assured Identity Network</a>, which I announced at EIC last week. And this has been deployed already. And it’s not the final specification, it’s just Implementer’s Draft, but it’s been deployed by multiple parties. And it’s actually actively in use in Europe for creating the qualified certificate and qualified signature. So I’m expecting some take up, at least in this regard, as well. So these are the things coming up.</p>
<p>Oh, there’s another thing. We’re working on something called CAEP, Continuous Access, Evaluation Protocol, and RISC, which is Risk Information Sharing and Coordination protocol. So, we are moving towards the world where just depending on the one authentication event isn’t good enough. We need to evaluate the access continually. And if there are some peculiarities about access, then we might want to notify the stakeholders so that they can be prepared for anomaly and something like that. Or, if it was deemed too low from the point of view of authentication level, then the user can be re-authenticated or something like that.</p>
<p>So, it’s an application of something called security event token. But it’s actually deployed among big techs right now. And I think that’s going to be a very, very useful addition to the world of, I kind of put it, internet security, or cyber world security and safety, let’s say. So these are the things which I do expect to come within five years or so.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Excellent. As I can see, there are several improvements and projects also connected to OpenID Connect protocol that come – you’re expecting in five years means – means that in 5, 10 years from now, and even more, we will still be using OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>Nat: In some form or fashion, I think.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so we’ll see OpenID Connect for many years.</p>
<p>Nat: For example, SAML was published – SAML 2.0 was published in 2005, if my memory serves well, and we are still using it, right? It’s been there for 16 years. So, new technology seldomly completely replaces the older technologies. They will form additional layers, and slowly start replacing it but it doesn’t happen, like at one stroke or something like that.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Oscar: And that was the story of how OpenID Connect took over the world and became an irreplaceable building block for digital identity today. Today, more than 6 billion people use a smartphone, and the most popular apps people use have changed. As Nat Sakimura said, for many years to come, OpenID Connect will be in use, and combined with other standards, will be protecting your identity every time you book a taxi ride, order food delivery, or as this story is coming to an end, go to Netflix and find the next story for your day.</p>
<p>This was a special story episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Thank you to our guests, Nat Sakimura and Petteri Stenius. The story of this episode was produced by me, Oscar Santolalla, with help of Francesca Hobson and Elena Sanz.</p>

<p>Finicity, a Mastercard company, makes the ACH transfer process more secure and more consumer-centric with our open banking platform. Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments are one of the most-used payment rails and are a streamlined form of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). In 2020 alone, ACH moved $61.9 trillion in transactions. Strictly for payments moved between US-based banks, these electronic payments operate as paperless checks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payments are issued in two forms: ACH credits (push) and ACH debits (pull). Understanding the difference between the two can help you understand how to better leverage ACH credits and debits in your everyday business transactions.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is an ACH Debit? 
<p>An ACH debit transfer “pulls” funds from the payer’s bank account. If you’ve ever set up a recurring bill payment online, this is an example of a pull. In order to initiate an ACH debit, the payer must give their account and routing numbers to the payment receiver (who requests the payment), and give them permission to access the funds. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">The Nacha Web Debit Account Validation Rule</a> requires the account to be verified before the first payment can be issued from it. While various verification methods are available, verification can happen by confirming the account number, or by the account owner giving permissioned access to it through an open banking portal.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is an ACH Credit? 
<p>An ACH credit transfer “pushes” funds to a bank account at the request of a payer. If you receive your paycheck through direct deposit, it comes through an ACH credit transfer, in which your employer is requesting that funds be moved directly from their bank account to yours. You can also make payments in the form of an ACH credit, but unlike an ACH debit, you would initiate the transfer.&nbsp;</p>
 How Do ACH Transactions Work? 
<p>ACH transactions happen in two key steps:</p>
 
 Initiating the payment: Before a payment originator can initiate a transfer, they must receive permission to either push or pull funds to or from the account. Originators can receive permission by signing an ACH authorization form or through verbal agreement. This authorization phase is also when the transaction is marked as either a one-time or a recurring payment.&nbsp; 
 Receiving the payment: Once the ACH transfer has been authorized, your bank account will either push or pull the funds, depending on whether it’s a credit or debit transfer. If there are insufficient funds to push or pull, the payment can fail. In some instances, this can result in overdraft fees for the account holder. 
 
 Direct Deposits and ACH Transactions 
<p>Direct deposits have become the preferred method for issuing paychecks, both for employees and employers. Depositing payment directly into an employee’s account via the ACH network is a streamlined option. It also removes the fraud risk and processing delays of paper checks. Direct deposits are a type of ACH credit transfer, where employers push funds to an employee once they’ve received and verified the employee’s account and routing numbers.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Nacha’s New ACH Debit Rules? 
<p>Nacha’s central role is to facilitate the ACH network. Their top priority is ensuring that funds transfers are secure. In order to better protect the network as a whole, as well as individual businesses and consumers, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/how-the-nacha-web-debit-rule-affects-your-organization/">Nacha implemented a new rule</a> that applies specifically to WEB (online-initiated) debit transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Nacha’s operating rules, originators of WEB debit entries are required to use a “commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection system” to mitigate fraud risk. As of March 19, 2021, Nacha added account validation as a central component of fraud prevention. Any WEB debit originator now has to validate an account before first use, or when an account number changes.</p>
 Common Questions About ACH Transfers 
 How Long Do ACH Debit or Credit Transfers Take to Clear? 
<p>Because they are processed in batches, ACH transactions can take longer than other forms of payment to clear at the receiving bank. Some banks may offer same-day ACH payments which adds an extra window for submitting transactions, but most financial institutions charge extra because they’re moving toward faster payment options.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Security Risks of An ACH Transaction? 
<p>As with any form of payment, there are security risks associated with ACH transactions. For example, with access to routing and account numbers, criminals can authorize fraudulent ACH transfers. Nacha regularly updates <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/current-fraud-threats">this page</a> with the most current ACH-related threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following Nacha’s guidelines and using secure ACH payment solutions will mitigate the security risks associated with ACH transactions.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Benefits of ACH Transactions Over Other Types of Payments? 
<p>ACH transactions are the most widely-used payment rail because they’re simple and secure. This makes them the obvious choice for exchanging payments via the internet. Some advantages of ACH payments include:</p>
 
 ACH is the backbone of every disbursement, bill payment, and P2P financial services app. It’s the universal standard for sending and receiving money. 
 Lower fees than wire transfers and other EFT formats. 
 ACH transfers are convenient, thanks to the ability to set up recurring payments, and you can make ACH payments from anywhere. 
 
 Are ACH Transfers Right for My Business? 
<p>Many businesses leverage ACH transfers to pay vendors and receive payments from customers, in addition to paying employee salaries. The speed, convenience, and security of ACH payments are behind today’s most successful businesses, assuring a positive impression of your brand. If your company is frequently moving money, making large payments or if it isn’t as important when the transactions goes through ACH transfers may be the right choice.</p>
<p>There are areas where ACH could be improved. It lacks a seamless returns process and there isn’t a dispute mechanism for consumers. It lacks transparency and immediacy in many ways, which is why when fraud occurs it can be costly for merchants and businesses.</p>

 GiD Report#184 — Every company is an identity&nbsp;company <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-183-a-more-constructive-model-for-nfts-9a704014ae4c"> last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The age of digital&nbsp;identity  Gensler: “DeFi will end poorly” without regulations  Meme of the week — Meta&nbsp;edition  Tweet of the week — Crypto&nbsp;edition  Headline of the week — Dinosaur&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. The age of digital&nbsp;identity <p>There was a time when every company became a tech company. Soon after, every company was a fintech&nbsp;company.</p><p>We’ve now reached the stage where every company is going to be an identity company. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook — wait, I mean Meta — wants us to ditch our monitors and smartphones for VR goggles so we can engage with each other in an all encompassing digital reality called the metaverse.</p><p>But we’re not going to get there without figuring out digital identity&nbsp;first.</p><p>For years, identity has been an afterthought for most companies. Need to check for age? Just tell me your birthday. We won’t actually confirm that it’s your real birthday, but at least we asked, right? Or you might outsource identity to Facebook or Google. But those platforms don’t care about identity — they care about ad dollars and engagement. You only need an email, any email, to create an account — real or fake. If you decide to manage identity yourself, your company’s servers are now the target of hackers and if headlines from the past few years are any indication, the hackers are pretty good at stealing our&nbsp;data.</p><p>As the stakes of our social and business interactions online have increased — with the pandemic pouring gasoline on the trend — the status quo isn’t good enough&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>For responsible parents, age restrictions matter. Kids are too smart for the honor system. But having to send a photo of your driver’s license to a questionably secure server every time you want to watch an R-rated movie or access a restricted service hardly makes for a convenient and safe experience.</p><p>David McCabe from the NYTimes has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/internet-age-check-proof.html">a new report on the end of anonymity as companies start to take identity more seriously</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>People in Japan must provide a document proving their age to use the dating app Tinder. The popular game Roblox requires players to upload a form of government identification — and a selfie to prove the ID belongs to them — if they want access to a voice chat feature. Laws in Germany and France require pornography websites to check visitors’ ages.</blockquote><blockquote>The changes, which have picked up speed over the last two years, could upend one of the internet’s central traits: the ability to remain anonymous. Since the days of dial-up modems and AOL chat rooms, people could traverse huge swaths of the web without divulging any personal details. Many people created an online persona entirely separate from their offline&nbsp;one.</blockquote><blockquote>But the experience of consuming content and communicating online is increasingly less like an anonymous public square and more like going to the bank, with measures to prove that you are who you say you are. This month, lawmakers in Washington, which has lagged other world capitals in regulating tech companies, called for new rules to protect young people after a former Facebook employee said the company knew its products harmed some teenagers. They repeated those calls on Tuesday in a hearing with executives from YouTube, TikTok and the parent company of Snapchat.</blockquote><p>Taking identity seriously is necessary and responsible. But relying on outmoded frameworks to do so is problematic.</p><p>The first problem is friction:</p><blockquote>Richard Errington clicked to stream a science-fiction film from his home in Britain last month when YouTube carded&nbsp;him.</blockquote><blockquote>The site said Mr. Errington, who is over 50, needed to prove he was old enough to watch “Space Is the Place,” a 1974 movie starring the jazz musician Sun Ra. He had three options: Enter his credit card information, upload a photo identification like a passport or skip the&nbsp;video.</blockquote><blockquote>“I decided that it wasn’t worth the stress,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>The second problem is security:</p><blockquote>Critics of the checks worry that the requirement will force users to give sensitive information to websites with limited resources to prevent hacks. Outside companies that offer age checks would be vulnerable, too.</blockquote><blockquote>“Either way, that’s still a treasure trove of data that’s exploitable,” said Daly Barnett, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online privacy and free speech advocacy&nbsp;group.</blockquote><p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) addresses both those problems with one stone. Verify your age once and now you can use that credential over and over without re-submitting any personal data. Friction problem&nbsp;solved.</p><p>Moreover, a company only needs to know that you’re, for example, over 18. They don’t need to know your birthday. They don’t need to know your ID number or your driver’s license’s expiration date. None of that personal information needs to be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>And because it isn’t being shared, there’s no “treasure trove of data that’s exploitable.” Instead, your data is safe with you. You control it, you own&nbsp;it.</p><p>Some companies like Twitter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/internet-age-check-proof.html">as the NYTimes reports</a>, are sticking to their guns in order to protect the original charm of the internet:</p><blockquote>Some services are resisting the checks. Twitter allows users to disclose their birth date but does not require it. If users want to view adult content — nudity is prevalent on the service — they must click through a warning but don’t have to prove they are 18 or&nbsp;older.</blockquote><blockquote>“At the heart of Twitter is the belief that there’s a huge value to the public conversation of people being able to speak pseudonymously to the world,” said Nick Pickles, a senior director of global public policy strategy at Twitter, “and also not requiring a significant amount of personal information to be provided before you can use online services.”</blockquote><p>But in light of smarter identity frameworks such as SSI, that becomes a false argument. Why not have it both ways? Ensure that only adults are accessing adult content while also ensuring that those who want to remain pseudoanonymous can stay just that — and not have to share a “significant amount of personal information” as a ticket to&nbsp;entry.</p><p>One thing’s for certain — the digital age we live in will only get more digital. But in order to get to a more constructive future, we need to get digital identity&nbsp;right.</p><p>Every company will now have to be an identity&nbsp;company.</p><p>This is a seminal moment in the history of the internet. The paths we choose will have a tremendous impact on our daily digital experience.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/internet-age-check-proof.html">Anonymity No More?

Gensler: “DeFi will end poorly” without regulations <p>First, here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/126ecd7a-0b02-4d9f-97f7-ffa2b24894a2">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>Global authorities have taken the first step to bring decentralised finance under regulatory oversight after rapid growth in the blockchain-based alternative to the traditional financial system.</blockquote><blockquote>Standards setters for anti-money laundering said on Thursday that creators, owners and operators of decentralised finance services should comply with rules designed to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, urged national regulators to apply standards to individuals who “maintain control or sufficient influence” over DeFi apps, it said in a&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>The guidance from FATF, an intergovernmental body based in Paris, is the first effort by global authorities to address the rapidly expanding world of decentralised finance, which has grown fivefold this year to $100bn locked up in projects, according to data group DeFi&nbsp;Pulse.</blockquote><p>Now, here’s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sec-chair-gary-gensler-speaks-144426838.html">SEC Chief Gary Gensler via&nbsp;Yahoo</a>:</p><blockquote>My broad thoughts are it’s one of the innovative areas in this crypto movement. I mean, we start with Satoshi Nakamoto who was pressing up against the definition of money and ledgers, sort of an old, thousands of years old technology, money and&nbsp;ledgers.</blockquote><blockquote>But decentralized finance has started to press up some other innovations. While that’s all interesting, it reminds me a lot about when peer-to-peer lending came along about 15 years ago. People said, well, I’ll lend money to you and it would just be peer-to-peer. And we had to take 3, 4, 5 years to bring it within an investor protection, and in some cases, banking regulation.</blockquote><blockquote>And I would say that’s what we’re going through right now. The same process, hopefully, we get to the other side where whatever innovation it’s there survives. But again, the public is protected. We protect against financial stability concerns as well. There’s a lot of lending going on. There’s a lot of trading going on. And without protections, I fear that it’s going to end&nbsp;poorly.</blockquote><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lassoing-a-stallion%3A-how-gary-gensler-could-approach-defi-enforcement-2021-10-21">the bad news for&nbsp;DeFi</a>:</p><blockquote>The first ugly truth about DeFi regulation is that it will inevitably come too late. Systems like UniSwap and Celsius were built in ways that challenge the fundamental premises of conventional financial regulation, but regulators will not be quick to shift their models to conform with the reality on the ground. Meanwhile, DeFi systems continue to grow, guaranteeing they’ll face increasing scrutiny.</blockquote><blockquote>Jai Massari, a partner focused on trading and markets at the law firm Davis, Polk and Wardwell, predicts a three-step process of reconciling those conflicting truths. Call it the Stages of Regulatory Grieving.</blockquote><blockquote>“I think it starts off with enforcement,” she says, “because enforcement is easier than regulation.” Those enforcements could be similar to recent actions that have led to large fines for crypto exchanges like Kraken or services like Tether. But they could also go further to include criminal charges against individuals, on which more&nbsp;below.</blockquote><p>In the short term, some DeFi services might be incentivized to continue operating in a Mad Max world in order to gain market share versus platforms that adopt a more compliant approach. In the long run, it will make sense for DeFi to get ahead of regulations and be compliant yesterday — what we call Green&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Again, that begins with digital identity — and for decentralized finance, it would make a lot of sense to adopt a decentralized form of identity.</p><p>Every company is an identity company — including DeFi.</p><p>Oh yeah, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/26/tether-partners-with-identity-startup-notabene-on-travel-rule-compliance/">that includes Tether,&nbsp;too</a>:</p><blockquote>Stablecoin issuer Tether announced on Tuesday that it has begun a trial partnership with Notabene to help it combat money laundering in cross-border transactions.</blockquote><blockquote>The partnership with the startup, which provides software to crypto exchanges to help them identify their users and track transactions, will help Tether to comply with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “travel rule,” which requires financial institutions to exchange customer information for both senders and recipients of relevant transactions.</blockquote><blockquote>The FATF is a Paris-based global, money-laundering watchdog. Its guidelines for crypto compliance have expanded to include exchanges and stablecoin issuers, which are known as virtual asset service providers, or&nbsp;“VASPs”.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/126ecd7a-0b02-4d9f-97f7-ffa2b24894a2">Global regulators target blockchain-based ‘decentralised finance’</a>  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sec-chair-gary-gensler-speaks-144426838.html">SEC Chair Gary Gensler speaks to Yahoo&nbsp;Finance</a>  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lassoing-a-stallion%3A-how-gary-gensler-could-approach-defi-enforcement-2021-10-21">Lassoing a Stallion: How Gary Gensler Could Approach DeFi Enforcement</a>  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-se-cs-gensler-is-calling-for-more-investor-protections-as-de-fi-blossoms-164203144.html">Why SEC’s Gensler is calling for more investor protections as DeFi&nbsp;blossoms</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/26/tether-partners-with-identity-startup-notabene-on-travel-rule-compliance/">Tether Enlists Startup to Help It Comply With Money Laundering Rules</a>  <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/cfpb-chief-warns-of-big-techs-deeper-incursion-into-financial-sector">CFPB chief warns of tech giants’ deeper incursion into financial sector</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/blockfi-to-launch-new-product-suite-with-private-firm-neuberger-berman/">BlockFi to Launch New Product Suite with Private Firm Neuberger Berman — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/us-sec-set-to-crack-down-on-stablecoins-in-new-report/">US SEC Set to Crack Down on Stablecoins in New Report — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122241/ethereum-defi-protocol-cream-finance-hacked-for-115-million">Ethereum DeFi protocol Cream Finance hacked for more than $130&nbsp;million</a>  <a href="https://frcusvi.org/tron-ceo-justin-sun-withdraws-4-2-billion-from-aave-colin-wu-explains-why/">Tron CEO Justin Sun Withdraws $4.2 Billion from Aave, Colin Wu Explains&nbsp;Why</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/coddsquad">/CoddSquad </a>— <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/crypto-investor-says-he-lost-6-figures-on-a-dog-inspired-defi-project.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail">This crypto investor says he just lost $470,000 on a dog-inspired DeFi&nbsp;project</a>   3.

<p>Welcome to our monthly roundup! October was nothing short of exciting as we gear up for a public release of Elemental Chat and shared our new Holo roadmap to keep our community up to date on what the future&nbsp;holds.</p> Q4 2021: Update on Milestones and&nbsp;Progress <p>Earlier this month, we shared our latest Leadership &amp; Org Update with you all. You may have noticed an <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/monthly-roundup-for-holo-holochain-99a372802e2a">uptick</a> in stories, blogs, apps, news and announcements coming from Holo recently. In large part this is simply because there is much more that can be built on Holochain than ever before. The proof of this reality is that the wider community of projects and developers are beginning to move with haste in their respective projects. Simultaneously the Holo development team is now unblocked. Certain feature development had been on pause until Holochain had finished updating to a necessary level of features and stability. This is&nbsp;huge.</p><p>In order to make the sequencing of our interdependent work more visible to our community, we refreshed <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">our roadmap for Holo</a> and included some key Holochain releases.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/q4-2021-update-on-milestones-and-progress-27eb0b0b7e5a">Read the full Leadership &amp; Org&nbsp;Update.</a></p> 3 More Holochain ReleasesI <p>In a Dev Pulse that was published last week, Paul talks through the latest 3 versions of Holochain that have been released. This Dev Pulse is packed full of information on not only the releases, but Dev Camp updates, networking fixes, and more information on Sweettest, a Rust-based Holochain testing framework. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/">You won’t want to miss this&nbsp;update!</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/">Read the full Dev&nbsp;Pulse.</a></p><blockquote>Gosh, now that the dev team has moved to weekly releases, there’s a lot to catch up on when I skip a week! The most recent Holochain releases have a number of bug fixes that improve performance and reliability, along with a new feature (<a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">post_commit</a>) and a few breaking changes.<br>- Paul&nbsp;d’Aoust</blockquote> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on Holo&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter.</a></p> RedGrid: Carbon Neutral By&nbsp;2030 <p>Earlier this month, Paul wrote an excellent thought piece on RedGrid, which is building the internet of energy on Holochain.

Dev Camp participants and community devs are getting real-time support for their Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools from the Holochain dev team. These community-created tools make it much easier to build Holochain applications. Dev Campers have been building their own app using these RAD tools. These apps will then be easy for non-developers to install and use using the new Holochain launcher.</p><p>We will continue to post updates on the <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Holochain Twitter.</a></p> Watch the replay of AMA&nbsp;48 <p>Earlier this month we hosted AMA 48, where we gave vital details of the HoloPort Alpha Program.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Stefan Würtemberger, Vice President Information Technology at Marabu Inks, will give a presentation on the impact of cyber attacks on businesses entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4866">And Suddenly It Burns Without Fire</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 10:10 am to 10:30 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Stefan some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “And Suddenly It Burns Without Fire - Impact of Cyber Attacks on Your Business”? 
<p>Yeah, you can expect how a company has massive problems and you can't see it. You will get the feeling how an IT department has to work to fight against hackers and restore the company's business. We will dive into incident and recovery management and afterwards we make a recap about lessons learned and go into preparation for the next attacks.</p>
 What are the most important experiences in dealing with cyber-attacks? 
<p>There are a lot of things you have to expect. The most critical thing is how the company reacts. You don't know what to do and when you don't have emergency planning, you have to handle that. And the most important thing is that you don't have fears about the cyber-attack. It’ll go away, and you won’t have a lot of fun in these times. It's the most horrible time for IT, when you have a cyber-attack.</p>
 How do you counter them and what can you do to prepare yourself? 
<p>We counter cyber-attacks in a couple of KPIs. We measure how much traffic we have, how many incidents we have in the company, and the preparation is much easier. You have to speak a lot with your colleagues, with the employees and prepare them how to handle and to work in a cyber-attack. And also, once they make errors by clicking links, how they should react and inform the business leaders and IT department to be prepared that we know that we could have the next cyber-attack.</p>
 What does it look like when it happens a second time and what are the lessons learned? 
<p>When a cyber-attack is in progress, the first impression is: you do nothing about it and you see that systems are not working correctly, and that's the horrible time for IT. In the progress of a cyber-attack, you see clearly how it comes and how it works from the attacker side and you fight against them, that the business is coming back to normal operation and the preparation is then to see how they come into the company, and then you have to prepare your business and the IT that you know where they're coming through and you close the doors and you prepare your network to the next level of IT security with certain technology, but also with the knowledge of the people and the awareness that it could happen any time and in any location and in every certain day.</p>

Twee: een hoge&nbsp;first time right&nbsp;ratio in de acceptatie van het private leasecontract. Kwantiteit én kwaliteit dus, tegen zo laag mogelijke kosten. Een uitdaging, want het acceptatieproces in de private lease sector is sterk gereguleerd en dat betekent dat ieder document zorgvuldig moet worden gecheckt door de acceptatieafdeling. Gelukkig zijn er manieren om het acceptatietempo én het first time right percentage te verhogen. Die beginnen niet bij je klant of bij de lease adviseur, maar bij je interne processen.</p>

This marks an exciting evolution for the Dock network, with the community participating for the first time in a successful vote to make a significant change to the Dock network.</p><p>The Dock community was presented with a proposal by the Dock Association to adjust the split of network staking rewards between validators and the Dock treasury. Prior to the vote, the split was 60% to the treasury and 40% to validators and stakers, originally modeled based on the rewards split on the Polkadot network. The recently approved proposal adjusts this split to an even 50/50 between the treasury and validators, thus increasing rewards to validators and their stakers.</p><p>The results of the vote can be viewed on the <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/1">Subscan Explorer</a> and this change has automatically taken immediate effect on-chain. We appreciate the community’s participation and look forward to future collaborations on governance for the Dock network.</p>

  <p>Since 2013 when it was released to the public, Docker has become an industry-standard tool for development teams to package applications into small executable containers. A year later, Kubernetes was released by Google to manage large amounts of containers, and provide features for high availability (HA) and auto-scaling.</p>

<p>While Kubernetes adds many benefits to your container management, you might find the process of setting up Kubernetes within your on-premise infrastructure quite challenging, especially on the first try. To overcome this challenge, managed Kubernetes is offered as a service by several cloud service providers.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn about the services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for using Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>This article will walk through the hands-on creation of a Kubernetes cluster to deploy a containerized Node.js application secured with Okta.</p>

<p>To follow along with the cluster creation steps, you will need the following:</p>

 
   An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a>. Sign up for an account to receive free AWS credits. 
   The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a> installed and configured on a local computer. 
   The <a href="https://eksctl.io/introduction/#installation"><code>eksctl</code> command line tool</a> installed on your local machine. 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, installed on a local computer to build a Docker image of the cloned Express.js application. 
 

 Introducing Kubernetes offerings on Amazon 

<p>While Kubernetes is open-source and can be used within your on-premise infrastructure, Kubernetes is also cloud-agnostic. Major cloud service vendors provide Kubernetes as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering to deploy and scale containerized applications across virtual machines. The Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) from Amazon Web Services is one example of such an offering.</p>

<p>The Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) lets you deploy, run, and scale your containerized application within a Kubernetes cluster consisting of EC2 instances acting as worker nodes. For customers using a hybrid cloud model, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/">Amazon EKS Anywhere</a> deployment option allows you to use Kubernetes clusters within a supported on-premise infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Fargate service on AWS also provides cloud customers with the ability to use Kubernetes, but in a serverless manner. When using Fargate, you get to run a pod within a Kubernetes cluster on demand. Fargate helps to reduce the operating cost (OpEx) of your infrastructure as you will only be billed for the pods and not the EC2 instance nodes.</p>

<p>Related: The article <a>Deploy a .NET application using AWS Fargate</a> shows a practical use of AWS Fargate.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we will focus on using Kubernetes through the Elastic Kubernetes Service.</p>

 Understanding the EKS architecture on AWS 

<p>The EKS architecture comprises three main components – clusters, nodes, and the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which forms the networking aspect. Let’s proceed to consider the clusters, and VPC.</p>

 EKS Clusters 

<p>An EKS cluster is composed of a control plane and worker nodes residing within a VPC created for the cluster. A cluster’s control plane is placed in an AWS-managed account and runs the Kubernetes software. The worker nodes, on the other hand, run in a user’s AWS account, and are EC2 instances that connect to the control plane through the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/">API Server</a> from the Kubernetes software.</p>

<p>An EKS cluster can be created through several tools such as the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">AWS console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Cloud Formation</a>, <a href="https://eksctl.io/"><code>eksctl</code></a>, or even <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, as well as other infrastructure as code tools. When using terminal-based tools such as the AWS CLI or <code>eksctl</code>, you provide the properties of the cluster to be created by EKS, either by using a configuration file or through command line arguments. Within the demo section of this article, you will use the <code>eksctl</code> command line tool to create a cluster.</p>

<p>With regard to the cluster’s security, the internal connection between the control plane and worker nodes uses a certificate file generated on setup. The cluster’s data stored within <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd">etcd</a> is also encrypted by default using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Key Management Service</a> on AWS.</p>

 The EKS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 

<p>An AWS virtual private cloud (VPC) is an isolated virtual network made up of smaller network components such as subnets and internet gateways, amongst others.</p>

<p>A VPC is required for creating a cluster. The VPC is also required to contain subnets within at least two availability zones. These subnets can either be public or private; however, it is recommended to have a combination of public and private subnets so that ingress traffic can be load balanced.</p>

<p>EKS has an uptime <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/sla/">Service Level Agreement</a> of 99.95%. As one of the strategies to ensure high availability (HA), an Auto Scaling Group can be used within each Availability Zone to monitor the nodes within a cluster, scaling them to meet your application’s demands or even restarting them when health probes fail repeatedly.</p>

 Creating a Docker container 

<p>With the knowledge you now have about EKS, let’s create a cluster having a deployment to run the Docker image of a Node.js application secured with Okta. We will reuse the Node.js application that was built for an earlier blog post, <a>Building a Simple Authentication in Express in 15 minutes</a>. You need only focus on creating a Docker image of the application.</p>

<p>The steps outlined below will guide you through building the Docker image of a Node.js app secured with Okta.</p>

<p>1. Open your terminal to execute the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git-clone</code></a> command below to clone the Okta-secured Node.js application from the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example">OktaDev repository</a> to your local computer.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example.git
</code>   

<p>2. Using your preferred code editor, open the <code>okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example</code> folder cloned above and create a file named <code>Dockerfile</code>. This file will store the steps for building a docker image out of the cloned application.</p>

<p>Next, paste the code within the code block below into the <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>

   <code>FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /okta-k8-app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD exec npm start
</code>   

<p>When the <code>docker build</code> command is executed, Docker will perform the following steps to build an image of the application.</p>

 
   Use <code>node:alpine</code> as the base image of the docker image about to be built. 
   Set the current working directory to <code>okta-k8-app</code>. 
   Copy all the files from the root directory (<code>okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example</code>) into the root directory of the docker image being built. 
   Run <code>npm install</code> command to install the node.js dependencies specified in the <code>package.json</code> file for the application. 
   Expose port 3000 to allow external HTTP requests to reach the Node.js application running on port 3000. 
   Lastly, execute <code>npm start</code> command to start the application 
 

<p>3. Create another file within the project directory and name it <code>.dockerignore</code>. This file will specify other files that should not be copied into the Docker image such as a <code>.env</code> file containing sensitive credentials.</p>

<p>Next, add the content of the code block below into the <code>.dockerignore</code> file;</p>

   <code>.git
.env
</code>   

<p>4. Execute the docker build command below to build a docker image of the application using the steps in the <code>Dockerfile</code> you created above.</p>

<p>The tag <code>-t</code> flag specified in the command below will attach a tag of okta-k8-app to the docker image about to be built. This tag will come in handy when you run the docker image.</p>

   <code>docker build . -t okta-k8-app
</code>   

<p>5. Optionally, create a <code>.env</code> file within the project directory to securely store the Okta client credentials.</p>

<p>Please refer to the article, <a>Build Simple Authentication in Express in 15 Minutes</a>, to create an Okta application, and retrieve the client credentials for the application through the Okta developer console before proceeding further.</p>

<p>Add the client credentials retrieved to the <code>.env</code> file in the format below. (Make sure there is no whitespace before values.)</p>

   <code>HOST_URL=&lt;OKTA_APP_HOST_URL&gt;
OKTA_ORG_URL=&lt;OKTA_ORG_URL&gt;
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=&lt;OKTA_APP CLIENT_ID&gt;
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;OKTA APP CLIENT_SECRET&gt;
OKTA_TOKEN=&lt;OKTA_APP_TOKEN&gt;
APP_SECRET=&lt;OKTA_APP_SECRET&gt;
</code>   

<p>6. Optionally, execute the <code>docker run</code> command below from your terminal to run the docker image built above. This command will allow you to test the running docker image from your web browser.</p>

   <code>docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 okta-k8-app
</code>   

<p>From your terminal’s output, you can see the logs, indicating that the application is running on port 3000.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With the Node.js application now running in the terminal, you can view the Node.js application within the web browser at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>

<p></p>

 Pushing the docker image to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 

<p>In the last section, you built the docker image for your application. Now you can proceed to create a registry within the Elastic Container Registry, and push the newly created docker image into it.</p>

<p>Execute the <code>ecr-public</code> command below to create a public repository within the Elastic Container Registry. The tag flag <code>--tags</code> will also attach a tag with a key of environment and value of development to the repository. This command works for the us-east-1 region, but does not work in all AWS regions.</p>

   <code>aws ecr-public create-repository --repository-name okta-k8-ecr-repo --tags Key=environment,Value=development --region us-east-1
</code>   

<p>The command executed above will return a JSON response by default to describe the created repository. Take note of the <code>repositoryUri</code> contained in the JSON response, as you will attach a tag containing the <code>repositoryUri</code> to the docker image.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, execute the docker tag command below to tag the docker image built previously.</p>

<p>Note: Replace the <code>&lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;</code> placeholder within the template section in the code block below with the REPOSITORY_URI of the docker image you pushed to the ECR in the format of <code>&lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;:latest</code> .</p>

   <code>docker tag okta-k8-app:latest &lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;:latest
</code>   

<p>Execute the command below to authenticate your computer’s docker client with your ECR repo through an authentication token.</p>

   <code>aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws
</code>   

<p>Next, execute the command below to push the tagged docker image to the ECR repository you created.</p>

   <code>docker push &lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;
</code>   

<p></p>

 Creating an EKS cluster 

<p>So far, you have pushed a docker image to the Elastic Container Registry. Let’s create a cluster in EKS that will use the docker image you previously pushed.</p>

<p>Use the <code>eksctl</code> CLI tool to create a cluster within EKS. <code>eksctl</code> is a third-party CLI tool written in Go that simplifies the management of EKS clusters by leveraging AWS CloudFormation to manage your cluster and other dependent objects such as VPCs, and subnets.</p>

<p>When creating a cluster, <code>eksctl</code> requires a very minimal configuration. It will attempt to create a cluster using its default values. However, you can specify the cluster configurations as command line arguments to the <code>eksctl</code> command, or more conveniently, specify a YAML file containing your cluster configurations.</p>

<p>When the <code>create cluster</code> command is executed without a configuration file, <code>eksctl</code> will create the following AWS resources, which the cluster depends on:</p>

 
   A VPC with two subnets. One is public, the other is a private subnet across three availability zones within the VPC. 
   A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">node group</a> containing two virtual machines as the worker nodes for the cluster. 
 

<p>Execute the <code>create cluster</code> command below to create a new cluster named <code>okta-k8-cluster</code> within the AWS region specified. This can take a considerable amount of time, so wait until the command is executed successfully.</p>

<p>Note: Replace the <code>&lt;AWS_REGION&gt;</code> placeholder with the region attached to your AWS account. For this tutorial, we are using the us-east-2 region.</p>

   <code>eksctl create cluster --name okta-k8-cluster --region &lt;AWS_REGION&gt;
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>After the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code> has been created, execute the command to switch your <code>kubectl</code> context to that of the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code>. Executing the command will enable <code>kubectl</code> to connect to your EKS clusters.</p>

   <code>aws eks --region us-east-2 update-kubeconfig --name okta-k8-cluster
</code>   

 Creating Kubernetes resources 

<p>At this point, you have an empty Kubernetes cluster running on EKS. Let’s proceed to create three resources within the cluster.</p>

<p>Using the three steps below, you will create three YAML files within the application directory to store the configurations for the following resources that will be created within the cluster: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Secret</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">deployment</a>, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">service</a>..</p>

<p>1. Create a file named <code>loadbalancer.yaml</code>. This YAML file will contain the configurations for creating a load balancer for the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code>, enabling you to access the application that will run within the cluster.</p>

<p>Add the content of the code block below into the <code>loadbalancer.yaml</code> file.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: okta-express-k8-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: okta-express-k8
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
</code>   

<p>Execute the command below to create a load balancer using the configuration in the <code>loadbalancer.yaml</code> file above. This command creates a load balancer within the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service on AWS, which you can access through an endpoint.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f loadbalancer.yaml
</code>   

<p>Next, execute the command below to get details about the load balancer we just created.</p>

   <code>kubectl get service/okta-express-k8-loadbalancer
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Note: Take note of the External IP returned among the details of the load balancer above. You will use the External IP in the following steps as an endpoint to access the application.</p>

<p>2. Create a file named <code>secret.yaml</code>. It will contain the fields for a Kubernetes Secret, storing the Okta credentials. A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Secret</a> within Kubernetes is a resource used to store sensitive data such as passwords and API keys that have been excluded from your application code for security reasons.</p>

<p>Replace the <code>&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP&gt;</code> placeholder in the code block below with the External IP value derived from the load balancer details in step 1.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: okta-node-app-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  HOST_URL: http://&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP&gt;:3000
  OKTA_ORG_URL: &lt;OKTA_ORG_URL&gt;
  OKTA_CLIENT_ID: &lt;OKTA_APP CLIENT_ID&gt;
  OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET: &lt;OKTA APP CLIENT_SECRET&gt;
  OKTA_TOKEN: &lt;OKTA_APP_TOKEN&gt;
  APP_SECRET: &lt;OKTA_APP_SECRET&gt;
</code>   

<p>Execute the <code>kubectl create</code> command below, from the directory where the files are located, to create a Kubernetes Secret using the <code>secret.yaml</code> file above. Make sure to replace the placeholders with their actual values.</p>

   <code>kubectl create -f secret.yaml
</code>   

<p>3. Create a <code>deployment.yaml</code> file and add the content of the code block below to define the properties of a deployment resource type.</p>

<p>The configuration file contains three parts that define a deployment. The metadata defines the resource information; the spec defines the number of pods to be created, the docker image to run within the pods, and a network port within the container to expose. The deployment will also mount the volume for the Kubernetes Secrets.</p>

<p>Note: Replace the <code>&lt;DOCKER-IMAGE-URI&gt;</code> placeholder within the template section in the code block below with the URI of the docker image that you pushed to the ECR.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: okta-express-k8-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: okta-express-k8
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: okta-express-k8
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: okta-express-k8
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: okta-express-k8
          image: &lt;DOCKER-IMAGE-URI&gt;:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: HOST_URL
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: okta-node-app-secrets
                  key: HOST_URL
            - name: OKTA_ORG_URL
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: okta-node-app-secrets
                  key: OKTA_ORG_URL
            - name: OKTA_CLIENT_ID
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: okta-node-app-secrets
                  key: OKTA_CLIENT_ID
            - name: OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: okta-node-app-secrets
                  key: OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET
            - name: OKTA_TOKEN
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: okta-node-app-secrets
                  key: OKTA_TOKEN
            - name: APP_SECRET
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: okta-node-app-secrets
                  key: APP_SECRET
</code>   

<p>Execute the kubectl create command below to create the deployment resource using the content of the configuration file above.</p>

   <code>kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
</code>   

 Modifying Okta client credentials 

<p>At this point, the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code> is almost ready for use. You’ve created a load balancer and a deployment resource. However, before a user can be fully authenticated through the Node.js application running within the cluster, you have to update the <code>redirect_uri</code> within the Okta credentials to point to the load balancer for the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code>.</p>

<p>Navigate to your Okta Developer Console and click on the application we’re using for this tutorial.
</p>

<p>In the LOGIN, section, click the Add URI button within the Sign-in redirect URIs subsection to add a new URI that will be used when initiating an authentication process. Add the load balancer external IP into the input field in the format below, replacing the <code>LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP</code> with your cluster load balancer’s external IP.</p>

   <code>http://LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP:3000/callback
</code>   

<p>Next click the Add URI button within the Sign-out redirect URIs subsection to add a new URI that will be used when signing out of the application. Add the load balancer external IP in the input field in the format below:</p>

   <code>http://LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP:3000
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Click the Save button to save the two added URIs.</p>

<p>At this point the application is fully set up and ready for use. With your web browser, you can access the Node.js application through the load balancer’s External IP in the format of <code>http://LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP:3000</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 More resources for Kubernetes on AWS 

<p>In this article, we covered basic aspects of the Elastic Kubernetes Service on AWS. You created an EKS cluster with a deployment and a service that uses the Docker image of a Node.js application.</p>

<p>Although this article did not focus on testing the scalability of the EKS cluster, you also created a load balancer within the ELB service to handle incoming traffic to the nodes within the cluster. Congratulations!</p>

<p>It’s David here from Magic. I am joining as one of the newest Magicians and as Product Lead. I am excited to welcome you to our October product&nbsp;update!</p><p>Since our last update, we’ve launched new features that make it even faster for you to get started with Magic and reach more customers.</p><p>In this post, I’ll cover the latest highlights and improvements.</p> Magic Login&nbsp;Form <p>Now with Magic, you can integrate a full end-to-end login solution to your web app with just two script tags. Your web app is future-proof as all login options and brand settings can be controlled through the Magic dashboard. Magic Login Form provides a complete login solution giving you full access to passwordless login and social logins. Magic Login Form provides a login form optimized for conversion and gives you control over your branding. All customizations can be configured from the Magic dashboard without requiring additional code&nbsp;updates.</p><p>To get started, head to our documentation <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form">here</a>. Magic Login Form is compatible with allow list and block list, session management, and other features.</p> SMS Login <p>Did I mention SMS login? In October, we released passwordless login support for short message service (SMS). With SMS login, any customer with a mobile phone can use their mobile phone number to login to your web app on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. To login, the customer will provide their mobile phone number instead of an email or other username and password combination. Next they will receive a one-time code and enter that to complete their login to your application.</p><p>SMS login has several advantages including:</p>  Mobile phones are popular in markets all around the world and can expand your application’s reach.  SMS login provides a convenient way for your customers to get signed in because it does not require a context change and users often have a mobile phone&nbsp;nearby.  Returning customers don’t need to remember a password to get signed in. This can improve your customer retention and eliminate your forgotten password support&nbsp;cost.  SMS login allows you to verify the mobile phone number for each new registered user when they complete&nbsp;login.  <p>To get started, open your Magic dashboard and navigate to Passwordless Login. From there, you can enable SMS in one click. SMS is compatible with the Magic Login Form, web, React Native, and Magic’s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/magiclabs">Wordpress plugin</a>. Users who sign up on your website will show in your user dashboard. SMS is supported in 38 locales. For more information, see our SMS doc&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/sms/build-a-demo/browser">here</a>.</p> Bitcoin Support <p>Web 3.0 developers can now connect to the Bitcoin blockchain using Magic. Bitcoin is the world’s most recognizable digital currency and offers a way for developers to connect their decentralized apps (dApps) with mainstream customers. Developers who enable this will be able to onboard new customers easily with Magic’s passwordless user login and a Bitcoin wallet address. Bitcoin is just one of the 18 blockchains Magic currently offers. Head over to our <a href="https://magic.link/posts/magic-bitcoin">guide</a> to integrate Bitcoin&nbsp;today!</p> Flutter SDK <p>We are also excited to share that you can now bring passwordless login to your iOS and Android-based Flutter apps with the new Magic Flutter SDK. Flutter has taken off as an efficient framework for developers to build iOS and Android based apps for both platforms, once. The Magic Flutter SDK speeds up your time to market and gives you flexibility to use popular Social and passwordless logins. To learn more, visit our docs&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/email/integration/flutter">here</a>.</p> Lastly <p>Everyone is invited to join us on Discord, where the Magic team and community gathers to chat, as well as help answer questions you might&nbsp;have.</p><p>Whether you’re a developer or just keen to<a href="https://community.magic.link/"> join the discussion</a> on auth, decentralized identity, or other modern infra like blockchain — come and say&nbsp;hi!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-product-updates-october-edition-859fd22153f2">Magic Product Updates: October Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology Monthly Report — October&nbsp;2021 <blockquote>Ontology is trying to build a platform with various tools and protocols all aimed at building a decentralized eco-system based on trust. The DLT initially focused on the Decentralized Identity space and is building solutions around credit scoring and data marketplaces. Although there is already strong competition in the oracle and data marketplace space, the market is large and Ontology’s existing applications in the identity solution space might help it enter these&nbsp;markets.</blockquote><p>-Messari, a leading crypto data analysis&nbsp;company</p> Developments/Corporate Updates  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet and are 80% done with testing.

  <p>When building an SPA (single page application) with React, routing is one of the fundamental processes a developer must handle. React routing is the process of building routes, determining the content at the route, and securing it under authentication and authorization. There are many tools available to manage and secure your routes in React. The most commonly used one is <code>react-router</code>. However, many developers are not in a situation where they can use the <code>react-router</code> library. Because of this, they may need to use Reach Router, Wouter, or maybe even no router at all.</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to quickly build a secure SPA using React, Okta, and Wouter. Okta easily enables you to manage access to your SPAs (or any application for that matter). By using the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> library you can quickly build secure applications with React. At the time of writing this article, <a href="https://github.com/reach/router/issues/429">reach-router does not support React version 17+</a>.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 14</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

<p>Table of Contents</p>
 
   <a>Create an Okta OIDC application</a> 
   <a>Create a React application with routing</a> 
   <a>Run your React application</a> 
   <a>Learn more about React</a> 
 

 Create an Okta OIDC application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once Okta is done processing your request it will return an Issuer and a Client ID. Make sure you note these, as you will need them in your application.</p>

 Create a React application with routing 

<p>Next, open your favorite IDE (I use Visual Studio Code) and use the task runner <code>npx create-react-app react-routing-demo</code> to scaffold your React project. You’ll be prompted to install <code>create-react-app</code>. Type y to approve.</p>

<p>This process takes a minute, so grab a cup of coffee or tea if you prefer. The task runner does a great job of getting your application started quickly, but you will need to add and edit a few of the files.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you will need to install some packages.</p>

<p>First, of course, wouter.</p>

   <code>cd react-routing-demo
npm i wouter@2.7.5
</code>   

<p>You will use Bootstrap along with the react-bootstrap library to style your app.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
npm i react-bootstrap@1.6.4
</code>   

<p>Next, you will get dotenv as a way of storing your sensitive Okta information.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@10.0.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will add the Okta React SDK to your project.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-react@6.2.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.6.0
</code>   

<p>With these dependencies installed, you can begin to create your app. First, add a new file called <code>.env</code> to the root of your project, and add the following items. Note here that the <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER</code> should match the issuer from the Okta CLI.</p>

 <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
</code> 

<p>Next, add a folder for <code>Components</code> and one for <code>Pages</code>.</p>

   <code>mkdir src/Components
mkdir src/Pages
</code>   

<p>In <code>Components</code> add a new file for <code>Header.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from "react-bootstrap";

const Header = ({ authState, oktaAuth }) =&gt; {
  if (authState?.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  const button = authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;Button
      variant="secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signOut("/");
      }}
    &gt;
      Logout
    &lt;/Button&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;Button
      variant="secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }}
    &gt;
      Login
    &lt;/Button&gt;
  );

  return (
    &lt;Navbar bg="light" expand="lg"&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Brand href="/"&gt;React Routing&lt;/Navbar.Brand&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" /&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav"&gt;
        &lt;Nav className="mr-auto"&gt;&lt;/Nav&gt;
        &lt;Form inline&gt;{button}&lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;
    &lt;/Navbar&gt;
  );
};
export default Header;
</code>   

<p>This component displays a login button for your users. This button turns into a logout button once the user authenticates. The component also provides a place to access the <code>Profile</code> page you will create.</p>

<p>Add <code>Profile.jsx</code> to the <code>Pages</code> folder. The code for this file is as follows.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { Container } from "react-bootstrap";

import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

import Header from "../Components/Header";

const Profile = () =&gt; {
  const { authState, oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    async function authenticate() {
      if (!authState) return;

      if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
        await oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }
    }

    authenticate();
  }, [authState, oktaAuth]);

  if (!authState?.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      &lt;Container&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please wait while we sign you in&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    );
  } else {
    return (
      &lt;Container&gt;
        &lt;Header authState={authState} oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Your profile page&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to your profile page &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    );
  }
};

export default Profile;
</code>   

<p>This page leverages the <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook to determine if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, then you will prompt them to log in with Okta. Otherwise, you will display a brief profile page.</p>

<p>Finally, add <code>Home.jsx</code> to the <code>Pages</code> folder with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import { Link, Redirect } from "wouter";

import Header from "../Components/Header";

import { Container, Row, Col, Card } from "react-bootstrap";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Home = () =&gt; {
  const { authState, oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();

  return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;Redirect to="/Profile" /&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;Container&gt;
      &lt;Header authState={authState} oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;

      &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Col sm={12} className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;React routing Demo&lt;/h3&gt;

<p>This page uses the <code>Redirect</code> component from wouter combined with the <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook to redirect authenticated users to the profile page. The page also serves as a landing page with some additional information about your application.</p>

<p>Finally, you will need to update your <code>App.js</code> file with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import "./App.css";

import { Router, Route } from "wouter";

import { Security, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

import Home from "./Pages/Home";
import Profile from "./Pages/Profile";

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";

const issuer = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER;
const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + "/callback";

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
      issuer: issuer,
      clientId: clientId,
      redirectUri: redirect,
    });

    this.restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;Router&gt;
        &lt;Security
          oktaAuth={this.oktaAuth}
          restoreOriginalUri={this.restoreOriginalUri}
        &gt;
          &lt;Route path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/Profile" component={Profile} /&gt;
        &lt;/Security&gt;
      &lt;/Router&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Version 6.0 of the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> library includes a few changes to be aware of, depending on which version of the package you most recently used.</p>

<p>First, you must provide the <code>restoreOriginalUri</code> property in the <code>&lt;Security&gt;</code> component. If you were previously using version 4.x, you will notice that you need to inject the <code>OktaAuth</code> object into the <code>Security</code> component rather than the issuer, client ID, and other information. You can read more about these changes on <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-react#migrating-between-versions">Okta’s React GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Here you are also importing the <code>bootstrap</code> CSS.</p>

<p>Finally, you are setting up the routing by wrapping the wouter <code>Router</code> in Okta’s <code>Security</code> component. This will give your routes access to the Okta API.</p>

 Run your React application 

<p>Your application is now complete. You can run it using <code>npm start</code> and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. From there you click the Login button, which will display the Okta login screen. Once you’ve logged in successfully you are redirected to the <code>Profile</code> page.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn more about React 

<p>With Okta React v6.0+, you no longer need access to the <code>react-router</code> package to set up routing in your React application. This version should make it easier and cleaner to set up Reach Router, Wouter, or to bypass using a router altogether.</p>

<p>You can find the example code from this tutorial in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-routing-example">oktadev/okta-react-router-example</a> project on GitHub.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Progress is often slowed down because of binary thinking. Binary thinking happens when complex concepts, ideas, and problems are overly simplified into being one side or another.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take me more than 30 seconds to scroll through my Twitter feed to see this type of behaviour in live action. Things get categorized as 100% good or 100% without any conversation around it, leading to divisiveness. We see examples of this very frequently when it comes to political conversations.</p>
<p>I’ve also noticed this type of behaviour within the self-sovereign identity world as well: “Such protocol is good, such protocol is bad”; “Such community is good, such community is bad.”</p>
<p>Now, if we take two communities within the SSI space – the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). I will sometimes hear people talking positively about one and negatively about the other. But why is this happening? Don’t we all have the same underlying values? Aren’t we all looking to better our lives through digital sovereignty?</p>
<p>I think the answer to this is clear and we need to get away from thinking in a binary manner about anything in our space. And if you really look at the overlap between both these communities: they are quite large.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Full blog post <a href="https://medium.com/@decentralized.identity/a-dif-toip-joint-statement-of-support-for-decentralized-identifiers-dids-v1-0-as-a-w3c-standard-16667ff3dba1">here</a>)</p>
<p>Even within certain communities I sometimes see examples of non-binary thinking: “Bottom-up approaches are good”, “Top-down approaches are bad”. I can confidently say that there is value in both top-down and bottom-up approaches.</p>
<p>If we all agree that there is value in regulated systems that we all participate in every day, then there is likely value in using digital versions of Government-issued IDs. This explains why Governments are taking current physical world trust models and putting them into the digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we can also all agree that Identity is more than a Government-issued ID.&nbsp; This means there are plentiful of opportunities of re-thinking existing trust models and deploying bottom-up approaches that use community or reputational-driven credentials. Getting Discord credentials issued to me because I’m a good developer or a good marketing person is a valuable thing.</p>
<p>There’s a world where both of these co-exist.&nbsp;Nothing is ever completely good or bad.</p>
<p>Non-binary thinking will accelerate digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 Digital Sovereignty – operating in the digital world (or metaverse), with an emphasis on Government’s role in the digital world. 
 Why organizations such as Mozilla, Google, Apple recently objected to the W3C decentralized identifiers standards – does this go against the independence of people? Does it have to do with energy consumption of proof-of-work blockchains? 
 Deciphering Interoperability – there’s a need to focus more of the conversations around portability. Rouven provides some easy to understand examples. 
 What’s happening in the DIF and what are some of the cross-community collaborations 
 Overviewing Top-down and Bottom-up approaches – the differences in governance,&nbsp; the importance of reputation, opening up portable reputations from siloed spaces. 
 What to control and what not to? Where do I fit into a Decentralized ID ecosystem? Some examples of services offerings, including how financial institutions can create new value offerings. 
 Verified vs Verifiable – why these two words are fundamentally different and how they sometimes wrongly used.

<p>As the quest for a Net Zero carbon emission economy and society intensifies, we at Mydex have been asking: how can we&nbsp;help?</p><p>This blog provides our answer, which falls into three categories. One is relatively small but direct. The other, much bigger but indirect. The third, long-term.</p> Paper, paper everywhere <p>The direct contribution is reduced paper use. Every day, millions of letters, statements, forms and documents get moved around manually, eating trees and energy (in paper production, transportation, printing, recycling etc).</p><p>Mydex personal data stores help reduce paper use by digitising data processes. Even though paper use is a relatively small contributor to climate change, accounting for around 1% of CO2 emissions globally, the numbers are still&nbsp;big.</p><p>There are approximately 28m homes in the UK. They each get some form of letter from their local authority once or twice per year, not taking into account social services, education or the electoral roll. The average letter of this type is 4 to 6 pages with all the blurb and well thought out guidance and information linked to the main content of the letter e.g. council tax. If you then add on the other 14 service providers (e.g. Government, Utilities, NHS, Charities, Financial Services) this number multiplies out many times&nbsp;over.</p><p>The numbers become eye-watering. Just take one tiny example: the Lasting Power of Attorney process which is currently being reformed because its costs are ballooning so high. It is now processing some 19 million bits of paper every year in England and Wales and getting overwhelmed by the volume, which is rising&nbsp;rapidly.</p><p>Money-wise, the resulting costs are high. We estimate local authorities spend at least £118m a year producing and sending paper documents to households. Expand this across all UK service providers and the figure quickly reaches £2 billion. Key point: behind every £ in this £2 billion lies a carbon emission.</p> The challenge of alignment <p>The less direct but much bigger potential Mydex contribution lies in reducing wasted and duplicated effort in service provision.</p><p>Every piece of paper that an organisation or individual processes represents just the tip of an iceberg of activities: all the things people and organisations do to plan, organise, coordinate and administer the production, exchange and use of goods and services.</p><p>One core underlying challenge spans them all: the challenge of getting the right things to the right places at the right time. It’s largely taken for granted in most discussions but our economy depends on its ability to do this efficiently. It’s what puts food on supermarket shelves, mobile phones in our hands, Covid vaccines in our bloodstreams. Whatever the detail of the particular product or service that’s being delivered, this underlying logistics challenge of right thing, right place, right time remains essential.</p><p>It brings one big problem with it however: it is very easy to get wrong. Take the simple example of a retailer planning for Christmas. You can very easily order things that don’t sell while not ordering things that would sell. You can order too little (which creates out-of-stocks) or too much (which leaves you with stuff you can’t sell). Or you might have exactly the right number of each item overall, but deliver them to the wrong stores or at the wrong&nbsp;times.</p><p>When such misalignments happen they result in one of two things. Peoples’ needs and wants are not met, even though they could be. Or time, money and energy is invested in producing things that don’t get&nbsp;used.</p><p>In fact, anything less than the perfect alignment of right thing, time and place generates waste at three levels: 1) the time, effort and energy expended in doing things that fail to deliver value; 2) the time, effort and energy expended in trying to correct the mistake, and 3) the time, effort and energy expended in trying to create systems that avoid the first two — such as excessive bureaucracy.</p><p>Result? Wide scale duplicated effort, error and delay, which manifests itself for both people and service providers as FERC — Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost. And here’s the point: behind every instance of unnecessary friction, effort, risk and cost lies both a carbon emission generated for no purpose at all and a financial cost. Pure&nbsp;waste.</p><p>This challenge of efficient logistics is big enough with standardised physical goods. It’s far more acute when it comes to delivering uniquely configured personalised services like health and care, public administration or financial services. Because everything needs to be customised to each individual — the chances of getting something wrong, somewhere along the line, multiply — as do the resulting wasted time, effort and energy (carbon emissions plus financial costs again). This is one of the reasons why these sectors haven’t achieved the same advances in productivity as traditional manufacturing.</p> Data and waste reduction <p>What all this means is that excellent data logistics — getting the right data to and from the right places at the right times — is the key to better operational logistics&nbsp;… which is the key to waste reduction: saved money, reduced carbon emissions. It’s a small tail that wags a very large&nbsp;dog.</p><p>The Economist highlighted this last week in <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/10/23/a-real-time-revolution-will-up-end-the-practice-of-macroeconomics">a cover story</a> on ‘the real-time revolution’ in economics. “Bad and late data can lead to policy errors that cost millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in lost output”, says its leader on ‘Data and the Economy’. Our growing ability to access better data faster is a “prosaic promise” it notes. But it is “transformative: better, timelier and more rational decision-making”.</p><p>“Troves of timely, granular data are to economics what the microscope was to biology, opening a new way of looking at the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>That’s precisely what Mydex’s personal data logistics infrastructure does: make troves of timely granular personal data available to (and from) the right people at the right time, enabling them to make the right decisions better, quicker, cheaper and to implement these decisions better, quicker, cheaper — saving money and&nbsp;carbon.</p><p>A society’s ability to eliminate the waste caused by wrong-thing, wrong-time, wrong-place processes — friction, unnecessary effort, unnecessary cost, and delay — depends on its available technology and infrastructure. Given one level of tech and infrastructure, you can only go so far in reducing this waste. Mydex’s infrastructure renders previously unavoidable levels of waste and cost avoidable and unnecessary. In doing so, it opens up huge opportunities for efficiency improvements and elimination of unnecessary carbon emissions) at every level, right the way through the provision of every personalised service.</p> How much&nbsp;waste? <p>Exactly how much wasted energy, time and money are we talking about? This is a sadly under-researched area&nbsp;, but here are some pointers:</p>  Research by the economists John Wallis and Douglass C North found that 45% of all US economic activity was devoted to ‘transacting’ where transacting is defined as “the cost of carrying out a transaction by means of an exchange.”  A McKinsey study of ‘interactions’, defined as “the searching, coordinating, and monitoring that people and firms do when they exchange goods, services or ideas” found that on average 50% of all US labour activity is devoted to this&nbsp;task.  In an interview, the former Chairman of the consumer goods giant Unilever Niall Fitzgerald noted that if somebody from Mars asked him to describe his business, he would have to say ‘Well, I spend 50p in every product finding all the raw material, manufacturing a product and putting it in a packet and getting it to the factory gate in a form ready for consumption. I then spend another 50p on everything I do thereafter — marketing, selling, advertising, retailer’s mark-up — the whole lot to get it from the factory gate into the consumer’s home, which could just be across the street by the way. They would say this has to be crackers.”  <p>All of these analyses converge on the same overall figure of around 50%: the proportion of total costs incurred simply trying to match and connect the right people to the right products and services at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>Proportionately speaking, these costs have ballooned over the last century, and continue to balloon. A century ago, 75% of all economic costs went into making things, and only 25% into connecting and ‘transacting’. Today it’s more like 50/50. This is where the next productivity revolution needs to happen. To make it happen we need the sort of data logistics infrastructure that Mydex&nbsp;offers.</p> The long term opportunity <p>Personal data stores also do something else: because they make the individual the point where information about them is integrated, they enable individuals to build up rich, rounded pictures of their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>In the longer term, as individuals’ PDSs mature to cover the necessary data points, it will be possible to calculate (or at least estimate) each individual’s own carbon footprint. Much as financial advice and health treatments deal with the unique details of each individual, this data will act as the raw material for new services that help people identify the best and most painless ways to reduce this footprint — whether relating to behaviour and lifestyle or technology and infrastructure.</p><p>This will help address the common feeling which blocks so much positive action by individuals: the sense of being overwhelmed by complexity and not knowing what to do or how to do&nbsp;it.</p> Genuinely green economic&nbsp;policies <p>The lesson here is that the best ways to achieve a net zero carbon economy are not always directly&nbsp;obvious.</p><p>Most attention is understandably focused on direct ways of reducing carbon emissions: substituting renewable energy sources for fossil fuels; improving insulation of homes, and so on. Of course it’s vital we do these things. But they are not the complete picture. They ignore the way that excess effort including energy use — carbon emissions — are embedded, institutionalised, in the way current service provision works.</p><p>At first sight, investing in infrastructure like personal data stores may seem far removed from a green agenda. But if such infrastructure enables the systemic change just described, then it’s a hugely powerful contribution. As The Economist notes: it may be ‘prosaic’ but it is ‘transformational’.</p> Addendum <p>While good, <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/10/23/a-real-time-revolution-will-up-end-the-practice-of-macroeconomics">The Economist article</a> is also partial and to that degree misleading and missing the point. Of all the ingredients in the recipe of ‘right data at the right time and right place to drive right decisions and right actions’, it&nbsp;misses:</p>  A large portion of ‘the right time’. It focuses on tech-driven data such as sensors, monitors and financial transactions, but ignores the importance of making old, traditional data (like <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">verified attributes</a>) available at the right time. This is just as, if not even more important.  It talks as if the only ‘right data’ is statistical or analytical data that informs policy decisions, ignoring the operational data needed to take the right actions to implement these decisions.  By focusing on the right policies and ignoring the use of data to improve the operational implementation of these policies, it misses most of the economic benefits actually on&nbsp;offer.  <p>Previous blogs looked at key considerations for <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/deploying-personal-data-stores-at-scale-ad35fb205e73">scaling personal data store infrastructure</a>; necessary <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">design underpinnings</a>; and the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">functionalities we’ve been developing</a> to make our personal data stores both really useful and really easy to&nbsp;use.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-hidden-key-to-carbon-reduction-d5872032fc7d">Data: Hidden key to carbon reduction</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how the ads you see across different sites and social media channels reflect your recent purchases or browsing patterns?</p><p>Well, that’s due to something called surveillance capitalism.</p> What is Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism is a process by which companies collect your browsing and buying patterns to understand your behavior and accordingly, display ads relevant to you. For example, let’s say, you buy a beautiful vase to give your mother on her birthday. Soon, you’ll see vase-related Google ads on any website you visit and similar ads on your Facebook&nbsp;feed.</p><p>Sounds strange? What’s really going on&nbsp;here?</p><p>Some companies like Google and Facebook allow you to access different online services through their login. They use a form of internet identity called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a>, and in the process determine which services you can access through their login. Further, they do mass surveillance of your online activity and capture personal data such as your purchases, search terms you use, the sites you visit, social behavior, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This data is then used to create your online avatar, based on intelligent predictions, and this avatar is sold to third-party companies. The underlying AI-powered engine estimates your age, background, and income potential along with your location-specific data.</p><p>Based on all this information, third-party companies display relevant advertisements to entice you to buy the products shown on the&nbsp;ads.</p><p>Many of us see this as a good thing because you can easily find what you want with little effort. So, what’s the problem&nbsp;here?</p> What’s the Problem with Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism infringes your security and privacy in more ways than you imagine because the real commodity that’s being sold here is your personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Further, this data is captured and used in a way where you have little control over it. After all, this is your data and you don’t know where it is stored, how it is used, and where it is displayed. And worse, all these are done for commercial gain by companies that you don’t even&nbsp;know!</p><p>In other words, your data is collected and used by third-party companies for their profits and you’re left in the lurch as you have no control whatsoever!</p><p>The problem with surveillance capitalism is that it can go beyond just marketing products and services. You can be provided certain information consistently to force you to form a desired opinion about economics, politics, etc. In this sense, advertisements can be used to influence your thoughts and behavior in a certain way. A case in point is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign-us-election-laws">Cambridge Analytica’s</a> handling of Facebook data that is believed to have violated American election laws by swaying people in favor of one candidate.</p><p>All of these go against the basic tenets of privacy as we know&nbsp;it.</p><p>So, what can you do about&nbsp;it?</p> Is There an Anti-dote for Surveillance Capitalism? <p>One possible solution can be <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, a new form of digital identity where you have complete control over your data, know where it is stored, and how it is used. You even have the choice to monetize your data if you choose to, and you get to decide to whom you want to sell your data as well. In other words, SSI empowers you to always be in&nbsp;control.</p><p>With SSI, you store your personal data in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital identity wallet</a> that only you can access. When you have to share your data with someone, simply choose the information required by the other person, compile it together, and send it securely.</p><p>Any information you share is protected by digital signatures that comprise a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">private-public key pair</a>. Hence, the chance for a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">data breach</a> reduces&nbsp;greatly.</p><p>Some of the advantages of using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a>&nbsp;are:</p>  You know where your data is&nbsp;stored.  You can choose to share or not share your data with another&nbsp;entity  The data you share is protected cryptographically by digital signatures, so unauthorized personnel can’t easily hack&nbsp;it.  You have the opportunity to monetize your data if you choose&nbsp;to.  You always have complete control over your&nbsp;data.  It protects your privacy and security.

  <p>There’s a lot of information out there about adding authentication to your app, which is helpful! But also overwhelming. It can be hard to find relevant and up-to-date information. Security best practices and technologies change, so refreshing your understanding and keeping up with current best practices is a good thing. Here are some notes I took while I reviewed my knowledge and applied my experience implementing auth.</p>

<p></p>

 Prefer OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 

<p>If you’re implementing authentication to a new application, the best practice is to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC). The combination of OAuth 2.0 with OIDC provides consistency across many integration providers, standardized ways to access information, and security.</p>

<p>Let’s establish a baseline for the rest of this post by familiarizing ourselves with the basics. This <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc">Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a> is excellent.</p>

<p>What I really like about using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect together is that it separates “the auths” and adds structure to each. We learned from the blog post above that OAuth 2.0 is designed for authorization – access to data (resources). And we learned that OIDC is a thin layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that adds login and profile information. Thus, authentication is the act of establishing the login session that confirms the user logging in is who they say they are. Now we can be specific in our vocabulary and understand how each standard complements the other.</p>

<p>When you’re using OpenID Connect, don’t forget that you can inspect the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-openid-configuration">OpenID Connect Discovery</a> document to get a listing of endpoints and supported usages. You’ll see references to some of the metadata available in the discovery response below.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, let’s continue!</p>

 Know your tokens 

<p>There are three different tokens at play in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Depending on the grant type you use (more on that coming up), you might not have all three tokens. It’s good to remember the kinds of tokens you’re working with and what each does. This makes documentation even easier to parse and team conversations less confusing by specifying the exact type of token instead of only using the word “token”.</p>



    
    ID token: The token returned from OpenID Connect containing information about the authentication of the end-user in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/21/beginners-guide-to-jwt">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) format.


    
    Access token: The token returned from OAuth flows that allows you to access the resource. Access tokens returned from Okta are in JWT format.


    
    Refresh token: A long-lived token that you exchange for the short-lived access token. Not all grant types support refresh tokens.



 Claim wisely 

<p>A JWT has the capability to add custom claims to it. Adding custom metadata directly to the payload of access and ID tokens means you can get properties tailored for your application right from the get-go, right? What a great idea! Or is it?</p>

<p>Custom claims are powerful, but remember that the contents of a JWT are visible to anyone who has one, such as an external developer calling your system and potentially the end user. You don’t want to add private information with the expectation that it’s safe from prying eyes. You also don’t want to overload the token with a bunch of custom claims that will bloat the token. Keep your tokens lightweight and make adding custom claims a considered decision.</p>

 Use the right grant type 

<p>I think this is where developers start feeling detail overload. There are different grant types, and depending on who the caller is and what sort of software process you’re working on, the optimal grant type changes. To add further confusion, some grant types (or flows) are OAuth 2.0 standards, and some are from OpenID Connect. Plus, there are updated security practices, and not all blog posts reflect the current recommendations. Yikes! Let’s cut out the extraneous stuff and focus on the need-to-knows.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with listing all the available grant types. We’ll define a high-level overview of each:</p>

<p></p>



    
    Authorization Code is a grant type used by web apps where the source code is private, such as a server-side web app. An authorization code and a client secret are required to get an access token. You can make the authorization code grant type even more secure for server-side web apps by using PKCE as well! More on that below.


    
    Client Credentials is a grant type used for back-end communications, such as API to API. Users aren’t involved in this flow, so there isn’t an ID token available.


    
    Device Code is a grant type primarily used for IoT and smart devices. The flow delegates user authentication and authorization through an external device, such as a smartphone app or browser. Device Code is available as an early access feature in Okta, or follow the steps in this post to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/02/19/add-oauth-device-flow-to-any-server">add OAuth device flow to any server</a>.


    
    Refresh Token is not a grant type, per se. It’s a long-lived token the application may receive to get longer access to resources. Authorization Code, Device Code, Hybrid, and Resource Owner Password flows support refresh tokens if the authorization server is configured to give the app refresh tokens.


    
    Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a flow to create a secret to use before exchanging the authorization code for tokens. This is not a grant type used on its own, but as an extra layer of security to the Authorization Code flow.


    
    Hybrid is a set of grant types from the OpenID Connect spec. The <code>code id_token</code> flow is the most common and combines two grants. It returns an access token via the Authorization Code grant and an ID token via the Implicit grant.


    
    Implicit is a grant type that used to be recommended for native and JavaScript apps. It is a simplified version of the Authorization Code grant but doesn’t require the authorization code exchange for the access token. Because of the security risks, OAuth 2.0 no longer recommends this grant type and it will be dropped in the upcoming OAuth 2.1 spec.


    
    Resource Owner Password grant type is a flow used by trusted first-party clients. Because of the risks involved in applications directly handling credentials, OAuth 2.0 no longer recommends this grant type and it will be dropped in the upcoming OAuth 2.1. There might be legacy applications requiring this flow, but that’s the only reason to use it.



<p>That’s still a lot of flows! And a lot to keep in mind. We’re busy developers! So let’s distill this down to the preferred grants.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s much better! We now have a reasonable number of grant types to work with: Device Code, Client Credentials, and a combination grant type – Authorization Code with PKCE.</p>


    
        
        Authorization Code with PKCE is the Authorization Code grant type powered by pixies proof key for code exchange. The flow adds a step to first generate a code challenge as an extra layer of security.
    


<p>Now that we have an updated list of recommended grant types, how do we know which one to use? You may need to use multiple grant types in a complete software system depending on the scenario and actors involved. You may have a SPA, a native application, back-end services and processes, and integrations with external parties. Each of these requires consideration for which grant type to use. Don’t worry; by checking the discovery endpoint you’ll know if your identity provider is up to the task of securely handling your needs!</p>

<p>We can use this handy-dandy flow chart to identify which grant type to use:</p>

<p></p>

 Keep it as simple as possible 

<p>We’re busy. And adding authentication and access security to our software is foundational, but it’s not the only feature of the software. As product developers, we need to get auth into the system and have the peace of mind that we’re covered without having to worry about all the details. To keep adding auth simple, use SDKs that already handle all those nitty-gritty details. Okta has SDKs for mobile, front-end, and back-end languages to get going quickly.</p>

<p>What’s that? You say that your needs are a little more complicated than simply adding an Okta SDK to your software system? When you need something more customized, incorporate <a href="https://openid.net/developers/certified/">OIDC certified libraries</a> into your system that allow you to still follow auth best practices while implementing custom needs.</p>

 Next steps 

<p>These are the key takeaways that helped me better understand auth and incorporate team discussion points we had when implementing auth in the software system I worked on. This post skims over the surface though and provides just the bare essentials for busy developers. If you want to dig in further and learn more, please check out the following links</p>

<p>I made this comic the for my friend, Nick. We meet for breakfast a few times a year. Last week was my fist meeting with Nick since leaving SAP, so I knew he'd ask about NuID. Nick is not into crypto, SSI, NFT's, or Web3 at all, he literally asked me "how big is an NFT...is it like a quarter...?" so I wanted to explain it to him in a context we both know well.</p><p>GOLF</p> Identities are a composite of identity <p>Where we are from certainly forms a part of our identity. And, where we are from has an identity of it's own. </p><p>Identities are a composite of what has, and is happening.</p> Recently golf has been on my mind with fall weather arriving in Texas <p>I live in San Antonio with Meagan and "The Girls" (Darby and Piper). San Antonio is a "low profile" kind of town that one might even call it "boring", yet, San Antonio has a lot of historical identity that is pretty cool.</p><p>There are the Missions of San Antonio, one of which is The Alamo. We also happen to have the 5-time NBA Champion (should be 6), San Antonio Spurs we host the PGA GOLF tournament just before The Masters.</p><p>The "<a href="https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1090358/foulois-facts-commemorating-the-first-military-flight/">birth of military flight</a>" took place in San Antonio. March 2, 1910 on Ft. Sam Houston and the city is now home to nearly 500,000 active-and-veteran military personnel and the largest Joint Base in the Department of Defense (<a href="https://www.military.com/base-guide/joint-base-san-antonio">JBSA</a>). San Antonio is, Military City, USA.</p> If the US is deploying our military, many are deploying them from San Antonio. If one of our women or men is wounded, they’ll likely come here, to Brooke Army Medical Center. <p>In 1970 my grandfather, <a href="https://dustoff.org/raymond-bosworth/">LTC. Ray Bosworth</a> was transferred from Ft. Rucker, in Alabama to Ft. Sam Houston, where he eventually retired after a three-decade career.</p><p>My uncle, <a href="http://www.virtualwall.org/db/BosworthRP01a.htm">Ray Paul Jr.</a> had been killed, on July 4th, 1968 in Vietnam while the family lived on base in Alabama and my Boz was at the test-board there. Mother Rucker is where all Army-Aviators, who fly helicopters of any kind go to flight school. My father, Joe Jablecki is one of them, as are Boz and Ray.</p><blockquote>LTC Ray-Paul "Boz" Bosworth Sr., LT Raymond Paul Bosworth Jr., PFC Jerry Lee Bosworth, Cecile (Pikor) Bosworth, and my brother Patrick all rest in peace at Ft. Sam Houston National Cemetery. </blockquote><p>The national cemetery is a place that allows the course where I learned GOLF and a lot about life, to use it's land temporarily, separated by only a 4’ tall fence.</p><p>What I mean by "allows" is that that the land is an asset of the cemetery, and it grants temporary-authority to the golf course for it to use until it is needed, for our people.</p> As the cemetery needs land, the golf course loses land. <p><a href="https://www.valero.com/">Valero Energy</a>, sponsors of the Valero Texas Open PGA tournament is another world-class organization, going about their business kind of like the Spurs do. I’m proud to have Valero headquartered here in San Antonio.</p><p>When I was in high school and college my family operated a landscape company that my step-dad, Tom Martin founded and owned. &nbsp;That business led him to knowing <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sa-obituaries/article/Benninger-excelled-in-business-and-charity-6319581.php">Ed and Nelda Benninger</a> closely during the time that Ed was President of Valero. Ed and Nelda lived in a beautiful home that Tom's company did the original design and landscape, and then many, many additional projects on. </p><p>Tom often joked that "Ed and Nelda put Jason Texas A&amp;M" and the dinner following our wedding-rehearsal was held at Gladys at the Strand, in 2004. The restaurant was amazing and had a fabulous private space, Ed’s Wine Room. Thomas Benninger was owner &amp; executive chef at Gladys..</p><p>The bond that Tom and the Benninger's formed through good business lasted for the rest of both of Ed and Nelda's lives. It was not really grounded in business at all, but about identity and reputation.</p> "Fish rot from the head" <p>Is a phrase I picked up from a talented professional management coach, who's now friend, named Alex Reidl. &nbsp;I hired him to conduct a workshop in Berlin with my leadership team in 2015. I say the phrase to describe something that I instinctively know, which is that that culture starts at the top - at the tip of the spear - with The Leader.</p><p>If I get to the top of an organization and realize there's a leadership problem, I'm done.</p><p>Ed Benninger was outstanding, as a person before he was an outstanding executive. I believe that Ed is still present in their culture today.<br><br>- Jason</p>

 InfoCert’s international expansion go faster and the Company aims to become the European Digital Trust Champion. 

<p>On October 27th 2021, Tinexta S.p.A. announced the signing of a binding agreement for the entry of Bregal Milestone into the share capital of InfoCert, with a minority stake.</p>

<p>Bregal Milestone is a European private equity fund managing more than €1.1 billion invested in technology sector. Bregal Milestone is part of Bregal Investments, a global group that has invested more than €15 billion since 2002 and currently has more than €12 billion in assets under management.</p>

<p>This operation will allow InfoCert to accelerate its ambitious international growth and development plan, which started in 2018 with the acquisition of Camerfirma and continued, more recently, with the acquisition of CertEurope and the investment in Authada. The support of a global partner such as Bregal Milestone, which has a specific know-how in the technology sector and an extensive network in Europe, will foster seizing the opportunities arising from the consolidation process of the Digital Trust.</p>

<p>The transaction involves an investment by Bregal Milestone of 100 million euros for the subscription of a dedicated capital increase up to a total share of 16.09% of InfoCert’s equity.</p>

<p>Combined with the acquisition of CertEurope, the investment of Bregal Milestone allows InfoCert to consolidate its role as a leader in the Digital Trust sector in Europe and at the same time to be able to offer to all its customers, especially in Italy, the best of the solutions and experience gained in over 20 countries.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>Using cloud services has now become an essential component of digital transformation.&nbsp; However, the dominant cloud service providers are not European and, following the recent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II </a>judgment, transferring personal data to these services has become increasingly problematic. This is just one factor behind the increased interest in the idea of the sovereign cloud.</p>
 The Impact of Globalisation 
<p>Globalization has provided many benefits allowing nation-states and organizations to obtain what they need, when they need it from wherever it is cheapest. This has reduced the costs for citizens and businesses alike but has created an increased dependency on ever more extended supply chains.&nbsp; The COVID epidemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions have called this approach into question. The notion of the sovereign cloud needs to be seen in this context.</p>
<p>Cloud sovereignty involves several areas, these include but are not limited to the protection of personal data. It also includes the protection of intellectual property, commercial secrets, as well as other forms of sensitive information. It concerns the influence that service users have over the legal frameworks that bind the service through a say in government. Also, their confidence in service continuity not only in the event of natural disasters but also of geopolitical conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
 The Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used. This can be achieved in several ways through legal, and technical measures as well as physical location. Within Europe, there are already <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80900/european-hosted-hybrid-iaas-cloud/">several cloud services</a> that are locally owned and delivered.&nbsp; However, these services find it hard to compete against the level of functionality provided by the global hyper-scale cloud services and the economies of scale that they enjoy.&nbsp; Therefore, using purely local providers often involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state-sponsored projects.&nbsp; However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyper-scale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close.&nbsp; Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control.&nbsp; Google, together with other hyper-scale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
 Privacy of Personal Data 
<p>This Schrems II judgment has crystallized the risks around the privacy of personal data highlighting the differences in the rules between jurisdictions.&nbsp; The consequences of this judgment are still being played out and can be very disruptive.&nbsp; For example, the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/census-2021-portuguese-dpa-cnpd-suspended-data-flows-usa_en">Portuguese Information Commissioner gave the Portuguese Census Office</a> twelve hours’ notice to cease and desist from using a US based cloud service.</p>
<p>The use of cloud services that are owned and operated by providers that are outside the jurisdiction where they are used creates a risk.&nbsp; This is that a provider in another jurisdiction may be legally obliged to obey instructions from their government and that this foreign government is not bound by commercial contracts made by providers with organizations outside of that jurisdiction.&nbsp; This risk is highlighted by the Schrems II judgment.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Board recommendations identify three points at which the privacy of data can be compromised – during transfer, at rest in storage, and while being processed.&nbsp; The recommendations cover contractual tools such including standard data protection clauses (SCCs), binding corporate rules (BCRs), codes of conduct, certification mechanisms, and ad hoc contractual clauses.&nbsp; The EDPB also provided an updated <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-12021-standard_en">Joint Opinion 1/2021 on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors</a>.&nbsp; In addition, the EDPB recommendations require supplementary technical measures and describe three approaches for which example use cases are provided.&nbsp; These technical steps include encryption, pseudonymization and multi-party computing.</p>
 Four Key areas of Sovereignty 
<p>There are four key areas of sovereignty which should be considered.&nbsp; These are data sovereignty, operational sovereignty, technical sovereignty, and sovereign ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data sovereignty – the customer should have control over the access to and the use of their data.&nbsp; This is what the technical measures from the EDPB are intended to enforce.&nbsp; Since many data processing regulations specify this, the customer should also have control over the physical location of their data and administrative access by cloud service administrators.&nbsp; With the exception of the location of administrators, data sovereignty is supported by all the major IaaS providers although not all customers make full use of the controls provided.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty – this is control over the jurisdiction where the administration of the service and its infrastructure is conducted.&nbsp; The EDPB technical measures are intended to mitigate that lack of this control.&nbsp; The major CSPs now offer a form of “cloud in a box” which the customer can locate and administer wherever they wish.&nbsp; Other clouds are working to enable third party administration through partnerships with managed service providers in certain regions.&nbsp; The major hardware manufacturers also provide a partial solution offering hardware as a service where the customer rents capacity in dedicated servers that are located where the customer chooses.</p>
<p>Technical Sovereignty – the customer is able to develop, deploy, move, and manage their workloads with the minimum of disruption. While there is significant openness in application development environments, the major hyperscale clouds are built on proprietary technical stacks and this makes it hard to move a workload to another cloud.&nbsp; It also makes it hard to manage the hybrid multi-cloud and on-premises IT environment that is now common in most organizations.&nbsp; There is a need for standard interfaces that customers can use to build, deploy, manage, and optimize their workloads independently of the cloud service used.&nbsp; This is still work in progress with VMware, OpenStack, Anthos, RedHat OpenShift all offering some level of solution to some of the problems.</p>
<p>Sovereign Ownership – the infrastructure used to provide the cloud service is normally owned by the CSP.&nbsp; This means that even if it is located in a given geography its use could be withdrawn by the CSP in the event of geopolitical conflict.&nbsp; Even if it were to be seized by a government the knowledge and external infrastructure required would make it difficult to make it operational.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>Most of the discussion around the sovereign cloud has focussed on data sovereignty and, while this is important, there are other areas that need to be considered to provide a fully sovereign cloud.&nbsp; For most organizations, the major driver for sovereignty is the need for compliance. In this respect, all the major CSPs provide or support substantial technical and contractual controls. However, the technical controls available are not always fully exploited by cloud customers.&nbsp; Recently announced partnerships which enable allow a local service provider to deliver a version of a global service provide a solution to some of the operational sovereignty concerns.&nbsp; However, it remains to be seen whether these will actually work out in practice. &nbsp;Where full sovereignty is required, there are other factors that need to be considered. The trade-off between functionality, cost and all the four aspects of sovereignty is one that organizations need to consider when deciding on how to deploy their applications.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Andrzej Kawalec, Head of Cybersecurity at Vodafone Business, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4921">Ransomware: What Happens When the Tech Stops?</a> on Thursday November 11 from 09:30 pm to 09:50 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Andrzej some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “Ransomware: What Happens When the Tech Stops?” 
<p>I'm really excited to be able to share with you a discussion about genuinely how we have become critically dependent on technology and in our day to day lives and our professional lives, when and how cybercriminals are able to turn off our technology and disrupt our lives. I think it's a key issue for us all to think about. In the talk, we'll talk a little bit about how not just ransomware, but cybercrime has evolved to become genuinely one of the greatest challenges and threats I think society faces. We'll also talk a little bit about the risk that we face, who are our targets? Are we all targets? And then what we can do not if but when we experience digital disruption. I find it one of the most fascinating subjects to think about, and I really look forward to sharing that with you.</p>
 How was it possible that Ransomware evolved into Ransomware as a service (RaaS), a fully functional business with a highly developed criminal ecosystem? 
<p>What one of the most fascinating aspects of how ransomware is involved is actually how the criminal world has evolved. If we think about the poster children for digital disruption, Uber, Netflix and the like. For me, the most significant digital disruptive industry is the cybercrime industry. Cybercrime has overtaken the global illegal drugs trade, and it is an industry that is characterized by brutal innovation.</p>
<p>It's an ecosystem, globally connected, using cloud based and SaaS technologies to prosecute operations in any country against any person in the world, built upon anonymity and an anonymous and untraceable currency. I don't think it's a surprise at that point that we are facing a pandemic of ransomware using some of the most understood and groundbreaking technologies. So, ransomware as a service is just an example of how that global cybercrime industry has been able to out innovate the digital adoption and normal industry.</p>
 How can employees be both your weakest link and first line of defense? 
<p>One of the things that we often do in technology and in business is we think about the process and the systems and the technologies, but actually at the heart of all the value that's created are people. Digital value is only created when you when a person can access data and those two things come together. Cyber criminals understand that and target the individual, the user, the employee. What we often do as a security industry is think about ways to protect or help that user. What we actually need to do is think of them not as a weak link, but actually as a first line of defense.</p>
<p>And increasingly, if I think about in a mid and post-pandemic world where individuals and users are being, you know, are really being pushed to their homes to hybrid working models, they are at the frontline of security, not just for themselves, but their families and their employers and the people they collaborate and partner with. So, employees, people, individuals are absolutely our first line of defense and our best hope when it comes to thinking and dealing with these threats, not just dealing with them, but also recovering from them. Now security is both a boardroom issue now, but also a spare room issue as we all work from its bearings and in places all around the world. A key focus and a key area that we will talk about is how you focus on the individual, the user, the person who creates the value.</p>
 Should you pay ransom? 
<p>One of the biggest questions anybody can face. Should you pay ransom? The FBI say no. Europol say no. By paying ransom, you perpetuate the cybercriminal industry and you finance illegal activity. It's not that black and white. It really isn't that black and white. For me, the failure is that the vast majority of organizations that do pay a ransom, I think only 6% get all their data back. They don't reduce their disruption significantly.</p>
<p>But the difficult choice that an organization or an individual has to make, is exactly that, it's a very difficult choice, and I think people will choose to pay a ransom, even though it feels uncomfortable and morally or legally difficult because they don't feel they have another choice. Everything we should do is to give individuals and organizations the ability to make a choice about whether to pay ransom or not. But I completely agree with the FBI and Europol and most organizations that say, you shouldn't pay ransom, you will not get all your data back and you are funding an illegal enterprise and industry.</p>

			<p>In 2017, we started Tokeny with the vision to make capital markets more accessible by building the most advanced tokenization platform. In only 4 years, our enterprise-grade tokenization platform has enabled financial institutions, governments, and companies to tokenize a total of 8 billion euro of assets on public blockchains in a compliant manner. We have achieved many milestones <a href="https://tokeny.com/three-years-of-tokeny-solutions/">since last year</a>:</p>
 
 PoC with major French banks: Team up with French banks to explore a digital interbank currency system 
 Blockchain50: Named in the CB Insights Blockchain50 
 Billboard launched: Launched the first no-MTF license required secondary market solution 
 Blockchain layer enhancement: Integrated with the Polygon blockchain network for superfast transactions 
 Added digital euro pair: Bring the digital euro to the T-REX Platform 
 Gas Tank launched: No more blockchain fees for both issuers and investors 
 ERC-3643: The T-REX Protocol recognized as ERC-3643 by the Ethereum community 
 A lot more exciting news is coming up…<br>
 
 
<p>Clearly, we are on the right path and are getting closer to reaching our goals. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, partners, and friends who have supported and trusted us — without your support, we wouldn’t be here. A big thank you also goes out to each member of the team, we are proud to have built a talented, passionate and agile team, and together, nothing seems impossible!</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>To date, we have built a complete compliance infrastructure that covers the entire value chain of tokenization: primary market, secondary market and lifecycle management. We’ve made the public blockchain suitable for financial institutions with a unique onchain compliance approach relying on digital identities.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The market is moving quickly, according to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">70% of institutional investors expect to invest in digital assets</a> in the future. Now that investors and technology are ready, we expect financial institutions to bring assets to the blockchain in massive numbers in the coming year. We are proud and excited to provide the technology shield for players to accelerate the digital transformation of capital markets.</p>
<p>We see a bright future for security tokens and the blockchain ecosystem. And we invite you to join us to become a part of this journey to build the future of finance, one that opens investment opportunities to everyone in a more efficient way.</p>
<p>P.S. This year, we managed to have a hybrid style celebration to combine online and offline activities. As you can see below, we had lots of fun. And we look forward to seeing what the future holds. Cheers!</p>

  <p>Greetings Oktaverse! I’m Tanay 🖖</p>

<p>I have been following Okta for many years, and I am very excited to finally join you all and get a chance to serve this wonderful community.</p>

<p>First things first, here’s a picture of me so that you can recognize me and say hi the next time we meet. 👇</p>

<p></p>

 Who I am and what I’ve done so far 

<p>I started my journey into the world of tech communities and open source back in college when I came across <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I got the chance to participate in a lot of their projects and regional community-building initiatives. Over time, I fell in love with writing and have published books on Firefox OS, virtual assistants with Raspberry Pi, and WebVR.</p>

<p>During my last years in college, I got the chance to join the Tech Speakers program by Mozilla, and I dove head-first into the realm of public speaking. After wrapping up my studies, I moved to Berlin and worked with start-ups like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://crate.io/">Crate.io</a>, and <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>.</p>

<p> Image from <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2020/09/03/five-years-of-tech-speakers/">Mozilla’s blog</a></p>

<p>Before joining Okta, I have been responsible for building a developer relations team from scratch and managing the various facets of developer relations like docs, user on-boarding, support, partnerships, certifications, and community building.</p>

<p>I love geeking out about space exploration, submarines, science, and Lego models. Next on my reading list are:</p>
 
   Letters from an Astrophysicist by Neil deGrasse Tyson 
   Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker 
   The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups by Daniel Coyle 
 

<p>Do you have any book recommendations for me? 🤓</p>

 What I’ll be doing at Okta 

<p>I am fortunate to have worked with some of the most vibrant developer communities and individuals across the globe. I hope to use all the skills and knowledge I have acquired to help you get started and succeed with Okta.</p>

<p>As a result of my experiences, my operating style in developer relations is motivated by the urge to:</p>
 
   Share fascinating things that I have recently learned 
   Serve my communities by empathetically understanding their pain points 
   Enable my communities to be their best selves and become successful 
 

<p>You’ll be hearing a lot more from me on topics around security and identity. I am also very excited to work on educational resources for you all in my favorite languages: JavaScript and Python.</p>

<p>Is there anything you’d like me to create or focus on first? 🧑‍🚀</p>

 How to get in touch 

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tanay1337">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tanay1337/">GitHub</a>. You can also write to me via my email <code>tanay.pant@okta.com</code>.</p>

<p>Please do reach out and let me know how I can enable you and support you with being the best at what you do! 🙌</p>

 Reference Libraries 

<p>Some of our most important work at Blockchain Commons is on specifications that improve the interoperability and resilience of cryptocurrency wallets. Our reference libraries allow developers to incorporate those specifications into their own code.</p>

<p>SSKR Security Review. However, there’s one more thing required before our libraries can be used in production releases: security reviews. Our vision is that third-party developers using our libraries will work with us to contract a security review from a third-party. They can take advantage of all the libraries already reviewed, and then they can increase that selection with a review of their own. Our sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, began that process this quarter by arranging a security review for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a> libraries through <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security (ROS)</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at ROS tested our software and noted potential security problems. We then worked with them to close all issues that we felt were a priority. Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to transparency, we have published the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/reviews/2021-security-review.pdf">review</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md">response</a>, which includes a listing of issues that we resolved, as well as those we did not (and why). Thanks to this review, we feel that the <code>bc-shamir</code> and <code>bc-sskr</code> libraries are the first of our reference libraries ready for production deployment.</p>

<p>Project Nayuki Port. We also released a minor new utility library, a port of the Project Nayuki QR library into Swift as <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/QRCodeGenerator">QRCodeGenerator</a>. We’d discovered that Apple’s native iOS QR generation is inefficient for QR codes where individual segments require different optimization. Nayuki does the right thing, by individually optimizing each segment, so we ported it over as a replacement for the native Apple libraries, for use in our own code and by other developers.</p>

 Reference Apps 

<p>Our reference apps provide exemplar use of our specifications (and libraries).</p>

<p>SeedTool Updates. The release of Seedtool was one of our big events in Q2. In Q3 we’ve continued that work through two notable upgrades, releasing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/README.md#version-history">1.1 in July, 1.2 in August, and 1.2.1 in September</a>. Some of the biggest updates included arbitrary key derivation, preset SSKR schemes, and developer functions that make it easier to test out QR &amp; UR-based requests and responses. We also added our first Ethereum support, through the ability to derive Ethereum private keys and addresses from your stored seeds. Our updated <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md">SeedTool Manual</a> describes all of the latest functionality.</p>

<p>QRTool Updates. Seedtool wasn’t the only reference app to get attention; <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QRTool</a> also received some minor updates in July, though those largely took the form of minor bug fixes. Updating QR Tool to use the Project Nayuki library port will be our next big update for QR Tool, sometime in the future.</p>

 Bitcoin Utilities 

<p>Other utilities make it easier to use Bitcoin and other blockchain and crypto-technology.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Standup Updates. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup</a> was one of Blockchain Commons’ first releases. It automates the installation of a secure Bitcoin Core setup on a Debian Linux device or virtual machine . However, Bitcoin Core is always changing, requiring occasional updates. Our newest version of Bitcoin Standup, 0.8.0, updates the scripts to work well with Bitcoin Core 22.0 (which made some changes to its code signing).</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin Standup 0.8.0 does more than that. We’ve always imagined Standup as an engine that can install a wide variety of cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, and the new version of Standup offers the opportunity for the first such addition: <a href="https://cypherpunkpay.org/">cypherpunkpay</a>, an easy and accessible server for receiving Bitcoin payments. This addition, though just a starting point, was one of the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> projects initiated by our 2021 interns, to offer cyryptocurrency support for activists.</p>

<p>Gordian Server Officially Released. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a> project took Bitcoin Standup as a jumping-off point and offered the same ability to easily install Bitcoin Core on the more accessible macOS UI. Like Bitcoin Standup it’s intended as the heart of a self-sovereign setup, where you can control both your wallet and your server. We released Gordian Server in some preliminary versions in 2020, but we’ve now polished it to improve its stability and ease of use, and have released it as the Feature-Complete <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>. Like our newest Standup release, this version of Gordian Server has also been updated to work correctly with Bitcoin Core 22.0.</p>

 Learning Resources 

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ goals has always been to improve the developmental understanding of Bitcoin. We also extend that goal to our own releases by working to make our specifications as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our popular <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a> has brought numerous developers into the industry. We’re thus thrilled to offer complete translations in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a>. This enormous amount of work was the product of a number of volunteers, some of whom were also working with us as interns, which means that the <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a> should again be thanked for their support. We hope that these translations will help bring Bitcoin development to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, which seems particularly important given El Salvador’s recent move to Bitcoin as a currency. (Learning Bitcoin also enjoyed quite a few minor edits as a result of the translations, as well as updates to include i2p and some recent revisions, resulting in our release of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases/tag/v2.1.0">version 2.1</a>; we’ve also got plans for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/TODO-30.md">3.0</a>.)</p>

<p>New SSKR Docs. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is a critical element of #SmartCustody in today’s digital-assets world, which is why our SSKR library received our first security review. We’ve also been expanding our docs to talk more about how and why to use secret sharing (and why not to). Our newest <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR docs</a> include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">Designing SSKR Share Scenarios</a>, which discusses many models for sharing (including all of the default scenarios now found in SeedTool), and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md">SSKR Dangers</a>, which talks about why we ultimately prefer multisigs to secret-sharing.</p>

 Building to Specifications &amp; Laws 

<p>Specifications and supportive references are the first steps in bringing new ideas to the industry. To reach their fullest potential, those ideas eventually have to become something more …</p>

<p>DID Standardization. The DID specification, which is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">1.0 candidate recommendation</a> for an international standard, is our next big technical step forward for self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, big centralized companies such as Apple and Google have taken notice and unsurprisingly raised complaints. We’ve offered some support with language and with championing the hard work already done, though the heavy lifting continues to be done by the editors, including Drummond Reed, Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, and Markus Sabadello.</p>

<p>Principal Authority. Many specifications and standards need legal support to reach their fullest potential. Our work in Wyoming has resulted in the state legislature arriving at a legal definition of digital identity that centers on the concept of principal authority. This quarter, we released <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">a paper</a> on how principal authority defines self-sovereign identity, and what the next steps are. (We also presented the paper and testified about it to the Wyoming legislature.)</p>

<p>eResidency &amp; Other Testimony. Overall, we’ve been thrilled to be working with Wyoming, creating some of the first and best laws for supporting blockchains, cryptocurrency, digital identity, and digital companies. In a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092109-01E-Residency.pdf">recent presentation</a>, we urged them to leverage the infrastructure they’ve created into an eResidency program that can extend these benefits to companies worldwide. In other testimony for Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, and the Netherlands we have provided support new laws for DAOs, updates to GDPR regulations and have advised how to avoid vendor lock-in and future-proof technology.</p>

 Other Future Expansions 

<p>Finally, we’re also looking to the future in other ways.</p>

<p>Ethereum Expansion. As noted, we’ve expanded Gordian SeedTool to support Ethereum key derivations. We’ve also been experimenting with selling some self-sovereign-identity NFTs to raise funds for Blockchain Commons. Generally, this all demonstrates our goal of bringing many of our philosophies, architectures, and models to the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we believe that #SmartCustody, and especially SSKR, could help Ethereum, which has a lot of its own challenges for responsible key management, such as the lack of true multisig. If you’d like to support our expansion into Ethereum, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> and let us know why you did (or watch for upcoming NFT auctions!).</p>

<p>Second Intern Program. Finally, we’ve just completed our second summer’s intern program, and we’re thrilled to have another batch of interns who we helped to introduce to the world of blockchain development and who in turn helped us push forward projects such as our Learning Bitcoin translations and revisions. They also: produced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS">secure development setup guide</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Pseudonymity-Guide">pseudonymity guide</a> that offered more support for activists and HRF; developed a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli program</a> for leaving behind your digital assets; worked on creating a stable version of Esplora; and more. Some of our 2021 interns have already gone on to other paid work in the field; we’re looking forward to seeing what they create next!</p>

<p>Thank you, as always, for your interest in Blockchain Commons and the improvement of the entire blockchain field. If you like what we’re doing, we again encourage you to become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Github sponsor</a> so that we can continue forward with our work of making the industry independent, private, interoperable, and resilient!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p>Digital identity is a core element of business, more essential than ever before as the workforce becomes increasingly more mobile. The key to enable more efficient work is to remove barriers to onboarding and access for employees within the organization, and those partners, suppliers, and contractors outside the organization while adding additional security to the onboarding and lifecycle management of identities. A way to do this is to leverage a network of trusted identities. This whitepaper discusses the approach to operationalizing validated identity data for enterprise workforce use.

<p>As we know, regulations are specific rules that are created and maintained by authorities. They apply to nearly every aspect of life, but within the gambling sector, they play a key role. Due to the nature of the industry where lives can be impacted through bad decisions and abuse, certain rules and limitations need to be made to ensure a safe playing field for users and operators alike.</p>
<p>However, one key issue that affects everyone in this sector is the speed at which technology advances, making it impossible for regulations to keep up with these developments. One of the most recent examples of this is the growing popularity of online gambling, which faces issues with cybercrime and fraud. In some cases, there are even gaps between old regulation and modern technologies – something that we at IDnow are collaborating with regulators to solve.</p>
 A look at Germany’s new Gambling regime 
<p>A great example to look at concerning regulations is Germany. The country has recently opened up online gambling with the introduction of a new treaty – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/glucksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielneuregulierungstaatsvertrag (GlüNeuRStV)</a>, alongside a new authority, Saxony Anhalt.</p>
<p>One key thing that surrounds these new regulations is the focus on player safety, as well as AML and KYC compliance requirements. It’s vital for operators to know who their users are, ensure proper verification is put in place, prevent at-risk users from participating, and combat fraud where possible.</p>
<p>In fact, in order to get and maintain a license, operators will need to demonstrate a robust age verification solution, alongside other KYC checks and meeting certain AML requirements.</p>
 Meeting KYC and AML requirements around Europe 
<p>To meet these strict requirements, both in Germany and across Europe, operators will need to invest in setting up proper, robust systems. The key focus of these systems are player protection and operator security – it’s vital to both keep players safe and secure, while also combatting things like fraud.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to list every requirement for compliance all around Europe, as every country and its regulators will have differences in opinions and what’s needed. However, one way for any operator to meet requirements on a wide scale is through remote eKYC solutions, which are flexible in meeting a wide range of requirements.</p>
<p>The best way of doing this is by working with a partner that specializes in KYC and AML compliance and is able to bring a wide range of tools to the table. Some of the most important requirements that must be met include controlling player activity through exclusions, meeting security and risk-management standards, preventing fraud, and meeting customer needs by mitigating risks and providing seamless onboarding.</p>
 Are Operator and Regulator Aims Meeting Consumer Requirements? 
<p>With so many different requirements needing to be met by operators to be compliant with regulator rules there comes a key question: What about the consumer? When it all comes down to it, for both the operator and the regulator the consumers are the most important party.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s vital to discuss how current operator and regulator aims impact the consumer and if they’re meeting ever-changing requirements. The most important thing to consider is that there are many different types of consumers – there are young, old, experienced, and new players that all need to be considered.</p>
<p>With a step forward into online gaming, you need to not only consider ease of access for players who may not be accustomed to online content, but also keep in mind the younger tech-savvy audience. For example, regulators and operators alike need to consider a whole new avenue of online-based fraud and ensure players are protected from it as best as possible.</p>
<p>Customers will also have specific requirements which may not be a key priority for both operators and regulators. Considering current trends globally, there is a key focus on things being quick and easy. Consumers (especially younger customers) require a seamless experience, many users want to be able to play a game or place a quick bet while on the train or bus, as well as being able to register in an instant.</p>
<p>There is also a key focus on security, especially surrounding data. It’s a vital point for the consumer to know that their data is being safely stored and meeting things like GDPR requirements.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in all this is that while operators and regulators would like to meet all of their consumers’ needs and more, it’s incredibly difficult to keep up with the pace of technology. Operators struggle to keep up with requirements as staying compliant has to be a key focus, while it’s impossible for regulators to know what will come next.</p>
<p>There is a definite overlap in some consumer requirements and current operator and regulator aims, such as a growing focus on security, however, it’s also easy to see consumer requirements, like lightning-fast onboarding, being pushed aside.</p>
 Automated ID Verification’s role in gaming 
<p>One key way to aid both operators and regulators in meeting consumer requirements is through automated ID Verification. This is a way to provide a seamless onboarding process for new players by providing fast, AI-Powered identity verification, such as our very own AutoIdent.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> covers both current operator and regulator aims, as well as customer requirements. It has a key focus on speed, usability, and security, while being a fully compliant verification tool. With AutoIdent, users can be verified within minutes, with a very simple process, solving both usability and speed requirements for consumers, while remaining compliant, reducing stress on operators and regulators, while meeting their aims for online services.</p>
<p>Overall, automated verification looks to be the way forward and is already becoming commonplace for operators and regulators alike. The UK’s gambling commission already recommends looking into AI-Powered services for onboarding processes and many operators have moved to such a system.</p>
<p>This benefits every party involved in the process, from making consumers’ lives easier, to reducing waiting times and increasing conversion rates, while keeping a high level of security.</p>

<p>Today, virtually every country is impacted by substandard or falsified drugs entering their system, from generics to more expensive treatments for cancer and pain management. And the full extent of this problem is not known – but the WHO conservatively estimates that 200 million people are affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up to 2 billion people around the world don’t have reliable access to essential medicines and health products: leaving a vacuum too often filled by substandard or falsified products. The W.H.O. estimates that for low and middle income countries (LMICs)<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products"> one in 10 medical products</a> is substandard. This costs billions upon billions of dollars per year, eye-watering sums that pale in comparison to the human cost: annually, 200,000 lives are lost in Africa to fake antimalarial drugs alone. </p>
<p>This is a global problem that is growing as supply chains become more complex with multiple steps in distribution compounded by the rise in online sales of pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we’ve partnered with the Distributed Pharmaceutical Analysis Lab (<a href="https://padproject.nd.edu/get-involved/distributed-pharmaceutical-analysis-lab/">DPAL</a>) of the <a href="https://science.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a> to reduce the damage to public health from substandard or falsified drugs by speeding up and expanding the process whereby they are identified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This partnership will harness our <a href="https://artifacts.ai/how-it-works/">Web 3.0 technology</a> to:</p>
 
 Make all relevant information directly available online for researchers and regulatory authorities&nbsp; 
 Create a trusted and secure chain-of-custody of drug samples and their metadata&nbsp; 
 Scale-up across the DPAL participant community&nbsp; 
 Deliver actionable findings that contribute to improved public health outcomes 
 
 Void of authority for post-market surveillance&nbsp; 
<p>Currently, there is no single global authority for monitoring the quality of generic medicine. And this lack of post-market, sustained and scaled system for collecting, testing, analyzing and providing real-time feedback to public authorities, distributors, and manufacturers hurts everyone. &nbsp;Study after study reveals pervasive poor quality and products that are worthless or even harmful to patients. Many countries in the developing world do not have the technological infrastructure or regulatory resources to keep low quality medicines off the shelves. And since the pharmaceutical trade is a lucrative global market, low quality medicine can cross borders and harm people anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This is why ARTiFACTS has teamed up with the DPAL program at Notre Dame. Together, we will make the process of managing and conducting post-market surveillance more efficient: helping to reduce the prevalence of fake drugs in the market. The partnership will provide the framework to accelerate testing of samples collected which is necessary to expand the coverage of countries and products that can be analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
 How did we get here?&nbsp; 
<p>A major factor that allows substandard or falsified drugs to penetrate supply chains across the developing world is the scarcity of regulatory and laboratory resources to conduct effective post-market surveillance. In 2014, the University of Notre Dame formed the Distributed Pharmaceutical Analysis Lab (DPAL) to expand testing of pharmaceutical dosage forms sourced directly from local pharmacies in participating countries.</p>
<p>DPAL provides high quality, validated&nbsp; chemical analysis of pharmaceutical samples from partners in the developing world.&nbsp; In collaboration with Chemists Without Borders DPAL uses analytical resources at academic institutions in the US to perform characterization of suspect medications that have been collected and screened in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, India, Nepal, or Malawi.</p>
<p>Made up from a network of 29 academic institutions across the US and around the world, DPAL has invented and successfully deployed a low-cost screening tool used in the field for processing thousands of samples to date. Paper analytical devices (PADs) are test cards that can quickly determine whether a drug tablet likely contains the correct medicines. They are cheap and easy to use, and don’t require power, chemicals, solvents, or any expensive instrument: so they can be deployed rapidly at large scale wherever a problem with pharmaceutical quality is suspected.</p>
<p>Following this initial success, and to further their mission to remove substandard or falsified drugs from LMICs markets, DPAL is now looking to scale up in order to gather more data, better understand statistical significance, and provide faster – even real-time – feedback to authorities to impact public health. The ARTiFACTS system will efficiently capture and record the physical location and scientific metadata produced as tasks are performed throughout the analysis cycle, enabling a dramatic step-up of the volume of samples processed.</p>
 No time to waste – why scaling up matters&nbsp; 
<p>Around the developing world governments, health departments and universities are working together to tackle this crisis with the ultimate goal of eliminating fake drugs from the market. But to achieve this, it’s first critical to understand where and how these drugs are getting to consumers in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hunt for falsified prescription drugs begins at pharmacies across the developing world. Secret shoppers sent out by local universities collect samples which are returned to the labs for initial testing. The samples and their results are recorded, bagged, and tagged – and separated into two groups. One set of samples will stay in-country and be sent to the relevant National Public Health Authority, and the other will be shipped over to the Lieberman Lab at the University of Notre Dame, where further tests are conducted and the results reported back to the relevant National Public Health Authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-initiative-launches-to-attack-problem-of-substandard-generic-drug-distribution-301404185.html">partnership with ARTiFACTS</a>, University of Notre Dame and the DPAL community will be able to reach more countries, assess more samples, and more efficiently deliver results to public health bodies in-country. Operating at scale will allow the DPAL research to improve public health outcomes by contributing meaningfully to post-market surveillance of pharmaceuticals in LMICs and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>America’s leading non-profit privacy advocate, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and">EFF</a>) has slammed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6058?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22SHOP+Safe+Act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1">SHOP SAFE Act</a>&nbsp;before Congress as good in theory but fairly ridiculous in practice, especially for privacy.</p>



<p>The EFF calls out as a significant privacy risk the proposed requirement to have ecommerce platforms verify the identity, address and contact information of any third party seller who uses their services. It argues that requiring a seller of any good online, including used goods (think mom and dad running a garage sale) to send their driver’s license or other government ID to the platform before making a listing unnecessarily exposes their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;to the platform. And given the broad nature of the Bill, the selling platform in this case could be anything from eBay, Amazon, Facebook and Craigslist to Gmail and other email providers if the seller decides to make the sale via email (e.g. if they sell a used bike to a colleague using email).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Imagine if you had to provide a copy of your driver’s license to Craigslist just to advertise your garage sale or sell a used bike. As over the top as that seems, it’s even worse when you think about how this would apply to services like Gmail or Facebook. Should you really have to provide ID to open an email account, just in case you sell something using it? Requirements like this threaten not only competition but user privacy, too,” the EFF writes.</p>



<p>The bipartisan Stopping Harmful Offers on Platforms by Screening Against Fakes in E-Commerce (SHOP SAFE) Act was&nbsp;<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4566">introduced</a>&nbsp;to Congress in March 2020 to protect consumers from the online sale of harmful counterfeit products. If the Bill passes, online marketplaces could be held liable for injury and damages suffered from these products. The way around being held liable is if the third party seller can be served a lawsuit in the United States or the platform meets 10 requirements before the counterfeit item is sold. The first of the 10 requirements is that the platform has “verified the identity, place of business, and contact information of third-party seller against governmental and other reliable sources.” Another requirement is that the platform has “conspicuously displayed the seller’s place of business, contact information, and identity along with manufacture location and shipping origin of the goods.” You can see the privacy risks to the mom and dad just wanting to offload some old books and clothes.</p>



<p>The Bill aims to offer ecommerce platforms incentives for more thoroughly checking third party sellers and hold those platforms liable for allowing dangerous counterfeits (e.g. a toy that breaks down and becomes as health hazard) to be sold. But while the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and">EFF</a>&nbsp;says protecting the consumer from dodgy products is a noble goal, it’s a case of hurting the consumer with a law that’s meant to help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redpoints.com/blog/everything-you-should-know-about-the-shop-safe-act/">commentators</a>&nbsp;say the SHOP SAFE Act has little chance of passing into law unless the increase in cybercrime and counterfeit products seen during the pandemic prompts lawmakers to tighten the screws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From our perspective, this Bill is yet another challenge in the ongoing battle to protect consumer privacy, but we can offer some protection through&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>. Sure, there would be no way around having to submit a verifiable name and address via government ID, but using a MySudo phone number and email address instead of their personal details when they contact the ecommerce platform at least limits the amount of personal information they expose. Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;consumer app and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;for delivering the same types of capability to customers.&nbsp;</p>

 Eine Diskussionsrunde zum Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten” warf vor allem Fragen nach Datensicherheit und Kosten einer Wallet auf, sowie dem Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen. 



<p>Das Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten’’ ist so aktuell wie nie zuvor, besonders vorangetrieben durch die Corona-Pandemie und die damit verbundene zunehmende Digitalisierung in nahezu allen Lebensbereichen. Dabei rückt jedoch auch die Frage nach der ,,Selbst-Souveränen Identität’’ in den Mittelpunkt, kurz SSI. Unter diesem Thema fand auch die online Veranstaltung ,,Digitale Identität’’ des BFM (Betriebswirtschaftliches Forschungszentrum) am 20. Oktober 2021 statt. Während einer angeregten Diskussionsrunde stellten sich vor allem die Themen der Datensicherheit, Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen, und Kosten für eine Wallet in den Mittelpunkt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unter der Expertengruppe befanden sich Irene Adamski als Vertreterin von Jolocom, sowie Fabiane Völter als Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin der Uni Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch als Zuständiger für die Kreditsteuerung der BAUR GmbH und Boris Lingl als Head of Blockchain bei DATEV, welche die Fragen des Publikums zu beantworten suchten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eine Brieftasche im Physischen. Eine einzige Identität, die man über mehrere Domänen hinweg verwendet, verspricht niedrige Komplexität und Unabhängigkeit von Intermediären, sprich die Identität liegt nicht bei Dienstleistern, sondern bei den Nutzer:Innen selbst. Damit ist SSI als ein Mittelweg zu sehen, welcher die Vorteile der Isolierten und Föderierten Identität zu verbinden sucht. Ein Anwendungsbeispiel sei Folgendes: Man kann über diesen Ansatz einzelne Informationen weitergeben, beispielsweise der Bank mitteilen, dass man über 60000€ verdient – jedoch nicht den genauen Betrag. So bleibt die Kontrolle der Daten stets bei den Nutzer:Innen einer Wallet. Als eine ,,Brieftasche im Physischen’’ kann man diesen Ansatz verstehen, aus welcher man einzelne Karten zückt, die einzelne benötigte Informationen herausgeben. Weitere Beispiele für die Anwendung einer Wallet sind z.B. Ummeldungsprozesse, Tickets in Öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, oder eben Nachweise über Einkommen. So ist eine Wallet gewissermaßen ein Zusatz für die basis ID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better safe than sorry – Datensicherheit bei der Wallet. Doch wie sieht es mit der Datensicherheit aus? Wie sicher ist eine Wallet wirklich? Kurz lässt sich sagen, dass dies immer in den Händen der Nutzer:Innen liegt. Im Falle einer Anfrage, etwas auszuweisen, können diese selbst an- und abwählen, welche Informationen sie teilen, oder es sogar komplett ablehnen. Die eigenen Daten liegen dabei allesamt verschlüsselt auf der eigenen Wallet. Ähnlich wie bei einer Brieftasche zieht man nur jene Informationen heraus, die man auch teilen möchte.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dies beantwortet jedoch nicht die Frage nach der Fälschungssicherheit. Eine falsche Identität wird zunächst durch die digital signierten Nachweise (Credentials) ausgeschlossen. Über Credentials kann der Verifizierer (z.B. BAUR) nachvollziehen, ob der Signaturschlüssel tatsächlich vom Landesamt kommt. Standardisierungsgremien sichern, dass keine falschen Identitäten angenommen werden, um Sachen anzufragen. So muss das Siegel original und geprüft sein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alle sollen mitgenommen werden. Ein zentrales Thema während der Diskussion, auf welches auch stets verwiesen wurde, war die Notwendigkeit einer Schulung oder Aufklärung der Nutzer:Innen. Zum einen darüber, nicht alle Daten mit allen teilen zu müssen, selbst wenn hierzu aufgefordert wird. Zum anderen vor allem im Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen. Alle Bürger:Innen sollen mitgenommen werden, und Lösungen müssen parallel angeboten werden, um niemanden auszuschließen. Einigkeit herrschte darüber, dass das Nutzen einer Wallet freigestellt werden soll. EU Bürger:Innen müssen aber die Möglichkeit haben, eine Wallet zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen zu haben. Daher kam der Begriff einer Übergangszeit auf, mit der definitiv zu rechnen sei.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI als globaler Trend. Noch steckt die Anwendung der Wallet in den Kinderschuhen. Doch die Corona-Pandemie hat den Vorteil eines Digitalisierungsschubes gebracht und Bürger:Innen bereits an das Nutzen eines QR Codes gewöhnt. In fünf Jahren, so wurde der Ausblick in der Diskussion gegeben, soll dies bereits weitgehend normalisiert sein. Erste Rollouts könnten bereits in zwei Jahren stattfinden, beispielsweise beim Einchecken in Hotels oder beim Studierendenausweis. Vor allem globale Trends zeigen die Wichtigkeit auf, sich mit dem Thema SSI zu beschäftigen. Dabei richtet sich ein Appell vor allem an Unternehmen, denen die Rolle zufällt, ihre eigenen Identitäten zu verwalten und voranzutreiben. Die technische Infrastruktur muss bereitgestellt werden, und Unternehmen werden damit gewissermaßen zu Vorreitern der Wallet. SSI, so lautete das Fazit, werde sich wie das Internet verbreiten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ein Markt im Werden. Nichtsdestotrotz handelt es sich um einen Markt im Werden. Daher konnte man auch die genaue Frage bezüglich der Kosten nicht vollständig beantworten. Festzuhalten ist jedoch, dass keine Kosten auf die Endnutzer:Innen der Wallet zukommen werden. Es zahlen die Parteien (Aussteller:Innen und Verifizierer:Innen), welche die Infrastruktur betreiben, doch diese Anfangsinvestitionskosten fallen nur für Forschung und Entwicklung an. Zusammenfassend bietet SSI großes Potential, da auch digitale Maschinen oder Organisationen diesen Ansatz nutzen können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es folgten eine Dankesrunde und der Abschied. –&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It feels so long ago that Magic unveiled its first auth solution in April 2020. JAMstack was having a moment, and so were NFTs. The world had just begun to reckon with shutdowns and social distancing. A surge in remote work showed us that online identity was overdue for a refactor. Centralized infrastructures were being challenged everywhere.</p><p>Back then, all it took was one line of code to implement Magic.</p><p>We used to hear lots of positive feedback about our whole developer experience. Those docs, you know? So&nbsp;clean.</p><p>A year since, the world of web development is again at a threshold. We’re inundated with feedback from users that want a multitude of sign-in options. They want to feel secure, they want to own their data. They desire convenience and seamlessness. Providing an auth experience that serves every user, no matter their technical acumen or accessibility needs, is a costly undertaking for app creators. That’s because building a Magic implementation never really was just one line-of-code. You still have to create buttons, composed into forms, connected to a server. Model user accounts, measure conversion rates, but wait… did I aria-label that button right? Hold on, we need a combobox? Now add social logins to the mix: what the heck is OAuth? Or WebAuthn? This login page is turning into infinite story&nbsp;points!</p><p>As we added more and more choices for sign-in, we heard feedback that Magic was harder to use, especially for no-code builders. So, what happened? And why should auth — something that every app needs — be so difficult to build and maintain? That’s a question that’s been bugging me for some time now. I lead the engineering team for developer experience at Magic, so we aimed to set a new standard to help our customers build auth more quickly, more securely, more accessibly, and more user friendly-y.</p> Occam’s auth <p>The aha moment came from the simple realization that most modern auth flows follow a discrete pattern: authorization and callback. You prompt a user to authorize themselves, traditionally with an email + password. Or, a more modern (<a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/passwords-suck-6524a8e7aeb5">and more secure</a>) approach would use social logins, or Magic’s own passwordless email/SMS flows. Once a user has submitted their proof-of-identity (“authorization”), the app has to then verify this information (“callback”). In the case of social logins, this requires checking a one-time code built around some fancy, math-y cryptographic stuff. Or, using Magic’s passwordless SDKs, you just call getRedirectResult for social logins and loginWithCredential for email/SMS. Building auth for the web essentially boils down to two big function calls. Noticing this, however, presents an opportunity to do what we engineers love to do best: abstract!</p><p>But we weren’t going to make just any abstraction.</p><blockquote>We want a new paradigm that speaks to the power of web development today and uses web primitives in such a way that the solution can slot into just about any tech&nbsp;stack.</blockquote><blockquote>We’re especially excited about no-code and low-code platforms like Webflow and Bubble, so we made it a priority to support those tools as natively as possible.</blockquote> Introducing (truly) plug &amp; play&nbsp;auth <p>Today, we’re introducing a new way to implement Magic auth for the web: Magic Login&nbsp;Form.</p><p>We think it delivers on the promise of Magic as the easiest, most flexible, and most extensible auth solution available. That’s because we want your frontend implementation to be as simple as copy &amp;&nbsp;paste.</p><p>Everything you need to start securely authenticating your users with any of Magic’s sign-in methods is two &lt;script&gt; tags&nbsp;away:</p><p>That’s all it takes to connect your app to Magic’s entire suite of auth features. You get a beautiful, accessible login screen with UI best-practices built-in — we’ll even remember which auth method users previously signed-in with. And better yet, your implementation is future-proof and automatically updates with Magic’s service. So, when Magic adds support for your favorite social login provider, you don’t need to deploy an update. Your users will see the latest changes automatically. All of this happens inside of an &lt;iframe&gt; hosted on your domain, so users aren't left questioning what service they're interacting with, reducing the risk of phishing.</p>An example of a fully-branded Magic Login&nbsp;Form<blockquote>At Magic, we think developer experience is user experience.</blockquote><p>So we’re trying to remove as many barriers between you and your creativity as possible. With Login Form, you can stop worrying about auth and start focusing on what matters to your users and your business. Though it’s still not quite “one line of code” for everything auth, it’s a hell of a lot closer than we’ve seen anywhere else, and we’re excited about its potential to improve the auth experience for everyone on the web, long into the&nbsp;future.</p> The first prototype <p>At Magic, we promote a culture of creative experimentation, and we put this into practice during bi-weekly “demo days.” Everyone on the team has an opportunity to share something they’re working on — whether it’s related to a milestone project, or just a blossoming idea. Some of our best features sparked this way, usually based on pure intuition and user empathy. This takes a lot of introspection as a team. If we’re knowledgable of ourselves, it tends to manifest in great products for our users. So, demo day is also an opportunity for us to invest in each&nbsp;other.</p><p>When Login Form made its first appearance at demo day — unplanned and off-the-cuff — it looked like&nbsp;this:</p><p>The inspiration for that demo had simmered for a while. When we talked about this “big idea,” to make auth simple and clean and future-proof, it was sandwiched between phrases like “pie-in-the-sky” and “someday…” But, to produce that working proof-of-concept was a matter of hours (it helps, of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s664NsLeFM">that we already had a universe in which to bake our apple&nbsp;pie</a>).</p><p>Demo day was a hit, but that’s only where the real work&nbsp;began.</p> The “real”&nbsp;work <p>For the developer experience team, Login Form meant so much more than a pre-packaged UI. It represented a whole new, opinionated implementation approach. Building a login page is pretty easy to “get”, even if you’re not an engineer. We’ve seen a thousand login pages before. But we still had to explain this implementation approach in a way that our product designers and marketing extraordinaries could relate to — we needed to help them tell a story. So, we went back to the drawing&nbsp;board.</p>Snapshots from the UI design&nbsp;process<p>It didn’t take long to find consensus on a UX pattern. Again, it’s a login page (a damn good login page). We started with a few design&nbsp;goals:</p>  Login Form should be adaptive to a developer’s Magic Dashboard settings, creating a seamless development experience. If you add some Google creds to your Magic account, then Login Form should instantly reflect&nbsp;that.  Logging in should be quick, easy, and frictionless — users should never feel lost in sea of sign-in options. So, we want to remember what sign-in method a user has previously used for an app, then we can focus them on the right form automatically.  Good design is inclusive design. Our entire login experience should reflect UI best practices and accessibility standards, above and beyond simple compliance.  The design should be extensible. While we’re super proud of our initial release, we’re already thinking about ways to make Magic Login Form even better. Simplicity and flexibility help ensure we’ve got room to grow moving&nbsp;forward.   A new onboarding experience for developers <p>Magic Login Form represents a new onboarding experience for end-users, so we wanted to revamp our own onboarding experience for developers to match. Learning about auth can quickly derail any developer’s good day. Striking the balance between good UX and good security can just boggle the mind. Even building on top of a solution like Magic can quickly spiral into a thousand-thousand esoteric questions. UX tends to be the last box on the auth checklist. So, how do we show-off the “easy button”? We started by looking at our own sign-up experience on Magic Dashboard.</p><p>After you’ve completed our passwordless email flow for the first time, you see a screen like&nbsp;this:</p><p>When we created npx make-magic, we sought to speed-up development of new projects using Magic. When we added this screen to our sign-up flow, however, we saw a mixed response. Some, especially those from a JAMstack background, were happy to see familiar tooling options. Others were unsure about what npx make-magic was doing in their system, and why they were being asked to start there. One developer was confused upon seeing npx, thinking that Magic worked exclusively for the NodeJS ecosystem—an impression we wanted to correct. The easiest decision for us was to strike this page from our sign-up flow completely.</p><p>We replaced this piece of the onboarding puzzle with a new Login Form settings page. From here, developers can access an interactive preview of their customized form. We also introduced a new featured card to Magic Dashboard’s home page, surfacing this new implementation approach with a beautiful, eye-catching design.</p> Now what? <p>Getting started with Magic Login Form is super easy. <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/">Log into your Magic Dashboard account</a> and go to Login Form. Try a demo for your very own plug &amp; play login page. You’ll also see a link to download a working implementation using your actual API&nbsp;keys!</p><p>We’ve also written some <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form">documentation</a> to help you build a plug &amp; play login experience from the ground up. And, of course, we have added a template to our CLI scaffolding tool to generate a working implementation in under a minute. Simply run the following command in your preferred shell:</p><p>npx make-magic --template plug-and-play</p> So long, and thanks for all the&nbsp;fish! <p>We hope you enjoyed this peek behind-the-curtain of the all-new Magic Login Form (fun fact: our internal code name was “Auth-in-a-box”). By the way, it’s totally free to try.

Easy for Users, Hard for Attackers  Works globally, across all cellular carriers, even in lossy service environments.  Enrollment, opting out, and authentication are beautiful, simple processes.  Confidence the user has access to their phone, and the phone number is&nbsp;valid.  When users change their phone number, they don’t stop using the service; they can migrate to a new phone number smoothly.

However, no easy way exists for consumers to authenticate numbers or associate them with businesses. Messages appear with only a number to identify&nbsp;them.</p><p>Users are habituated to ignore sender ids, or react with suspicion when numbers are&nbsp;changed.</p><p>💡 Include information about the sender in your message “Your <a href="http://ACME.co">ACME.co</a> Code: 123–123”, or use Domain-Bound Codes</p> Users can be on fraudulent sites <p>Some sites trick users into entering authenticator codes for other sites. A common ploy asks for a user’s phone number, and prompts the user to enter the code they receive.

Allowing paste makes your service more accessible, and a smoother end user experience.   Using numeric codes?

Showing a numeric keypad helps make entering codes as easy as&nbsp;possible   Supporting iOS users? Tag login boxes with textContentType   Operating systems such as iOS make it easy to fill in one time codes from SMS messages. Apple uses a text content tag of textContentType=.oneTimeCode to allow users to auto-fill new SMS codes into the&nbsp;page.   Building with Google Play? Consider auto-verification with the SMS Retriever API   Android’s Google Play Services offer a collection of <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview">advanced SMS tools for verification</a> of SMS codes, including supporting background verification.  With the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview">SMS Retriever API</a>, It is possible to build almost silent user and device verification, however, fallback support for traditional SMS is required, and informing users about what is occurring is critical for building user trust and&nbsp;comfort.   Building Web Applications? Use `autocomplete="one-time-code"`   Many browsers facilitate SMS message autofill through input code <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/work/play/emm-api/prov-devices">tags for autofill</a>, such as autocomplete="one-time-code". This can provide smooth user experiences cross-platform, and allow your product to take advantage of built-in browser functionality.

Zero trust refers to the alignment of maturing identity practices, an established understanding of user behaviors, and the application of least-privilege access security policy decisions to trust boundaries</p></blockquote> Research  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9558805?cmid=296e8b0d-a3de-4224-a628-b90d777ae944">Decentralized and Self-Sovereign Identity: Systematic Mapping Study</a> Špela Čučko Muhamed Turkanović <blockquote><p>The results suggest that validation research and solution proposals prevail, addressing decentralized identity in a general matter. Papers mainly propose systems/solutions, architectures, and frameworks, focusing on authentication, security, privacy, and trust, while there are hardly any studies researching usability, user experience, patterns, and good practices.</p></blockquote> Use Cases  <a href="https://www.peaq.com/blog/why-machines-need-self-sovereign-identities">Why Machines Need Self-Sovereign Identities</a> Peaq <blockquote><p>As the world becomes even more connected and more machines are hooked up to the internet, the ability for machines to move, trade and interact securely and efficiently becomes increasingly important to life and business. Today’s centralized networks do not enable this. Machines today exist on closed, permission-based environments which massively limit which other machines can be interacted with, what machines can do and where they can go.&nbsp;</p></blockquote> <a href="https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/video/is-the-biggest-tech-change-for-travel-since-the-internet-and-mobile-the-shift-to-self-sovereign-identity-tech-1594">Is the biggest tech change for travel since the internet and mobile the shift to self-sovereign identity tech?</a> CAPA TV <blockquote>  <p>What are some of the benefits of this new wave, such as reduced cybersecurity risk and enhanced travel experiences/personalisation?</p>  <p>Will this affect the way travel is distributed and paid for change?</p>  <p>What can players in the established travel eco-system expect?</p>  <p>When will we see this come about – where will we be by 2030?&nbsp;</p>  </blockquote> <a href="https://indicio.tech/identity-blockchains-and-energy-consumption/">Identity Blockchains and Energy Consumption</a> Indicio <blockquote><p>A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off ledger. This means that for those peer-to-peer interactions, identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/countering-marketplace-deception-with-mattereums-trust-as-a-service-platform-2615dc2c47be">Countering Marketplace Deception with Mattereum’s Trust-as-a-Service Platform</a> <blockquote><p>Marketplace deception is everywhere, at great cost and risk to consumers and businesses.

Old methods tied strictly to AD and LDAP registries with groups and their associated roles are only a narrow keyhole from the past into which we can view a broader IAM future. These systems will continue to be used in many enterprises but form only part of the many journeys available to users within the new IAM landscape.</p></blockquote> COVID-19  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vaccine-passport">What is a vaccine passport?</a> IBM <blockquote><p>A vaccine passport is a physical or digital health credential to confirm a person has been vaccinated for a particular contagious disease to enable travel.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.webistemology.com/vaccine_certificate_experience/">The Vaccine Certificate Experience</a> WEBISTEMOLOGY  Version 1 of the Ontario COVID Vaccine Certificate is a cumbersome experience that needs some work <blockquote><p>What I observed is NOT a user-friendly experience for either the customer or the business. For the experience to be improved it needs to be a single presentation operation of either a paper or digital certificate that the business can verify in one step.&nbsp;</p><p>The advantage of a paper and ID card presentation ritual is that it is difficult to hack. So if we are going to improve the presentation with a single credential as above, privacy and security MUST be protected.&nbsp;</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFo7YlxUaJk">Pramod Varma's message as India touches the 1 BN COVID Vaccination Certificates Milestone</a> eGovernments Foundation <blockquote><p>Pramod Varma, CTO, EkStep Foundation shares the journey of Digital Public Good- DIVOC (<a href="https://divoc.egov.org.in/">Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing</a>) envisioned a year back, for vaccination credentialing.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/10/13/divoc/">Understanding the Global COVID Certificate Landscape</a> DIVOC <blockquote><p>The DIVOC project is hosted and maintained by <a href="https://egov.org.in/">India’s eGov Foundation</a> and is available as an MIT-licensed open source software package DIVOC is also supported by various multilateral funding institutions, as well as a community of software contributors and adopters in various geographies.

 GiD Report#183 — A more constructive model for&nbsp;NFTs <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-182-bitcoin-goes-mainstream-c6490fdc470b">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Why most NFTs are scammy cash&nbsp;grabs  Cartoon of the&nbsp;week  How Bonifii x GlobaliD x Indicio enhance financial inclusion  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Hard Yaka portfolio company Forge is having a banner&nbsp;year  Stuff happens   1. Why most NFTs are scammy cash&nbsp;grabs Cryptopunks, the original blue chip&nbsp;NFT<p>Along with DeFi and last week’s Bitcoin ETF, NFTs are certainly one of the defining crypto developments of 2021. Is it art? Is it the future of the creator economy? Is it just a&nbsp;JPEG?</p><p>GlobaliD software architect /spacemandev had <a href="https://twitter.com/spacemandev/status/1449814635939614722">a spicy tweetstorm on the&nbsp;subject</a>:</p><blockquote>Why most NFTs are a scammy cash grab and a potential model for NFTs that would make it less…scammy</blockquote><blockquote>NFTs have been hailed as a new way to empower creators, and while they provide a unique new tool on how to raise money for artists, their current trend as collectibles is…..well a speculative bubble at&nbsp;best</blockquote><blockquote>Traditionally, a creator inspired model is that of Patreon or Ko-Fi, where the patron pays money over an interval of time to get access to rewards from a creator over that period of&nbsp;time</blockquote><blockquote>NFT Collectibles posit that you can pay a creator upfront large sums of money and over time, they’ll what…return value to you because of what reason? Without interval monetary spends, there’s no incentive for a creator to stick&nbsp;around.</blockquote><blockquote>They can just do a cash grab of an initial sale, make politican like promises about “future” rewards, and have 0 consequences by not living up to&nbsp;them.</blockquote><blockquote>A potential model for NFTs that could side step this hurdle is to actually borrow from the ICO boom of yesteryear. After a creator does an initial NFT drop, create a holding contract for all the funds whose members are controllers of the&nbsp;NFTs.</blockquote><blockquote>Original $ + royalty $ all get spent into this contract. Then the DAO authorizes releases of funds to the creator over some time interval as they continue to stick around and build the community, with NFT resales continuously filling the fund, along with any further NFT&nbsp;sales</blockquote><blockquote>For the creator, they know that they have a market for their work, there’s X$ set aside *just for them* if they produce, and for the members of the DAO, they know the creator won’t just up and leave after the initial&nbsp;sale</blockquote><p>Food for&nbsp;thought.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/galaxy-digital-affiliate-raises-325m-fund-for-nfts-interactive-gaming/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Galaxy Digital Affiliate Raises $325M Fund for NFTs, Interactive Gaming — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/pstav</a> — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/19/coinbase-and-nba-sign-partnership-deal/">Coinbase and NBA Sign Partnership Deal</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/15/nfts-are-an-internet-game-changer/">NFTs Are an Internet Game-Changer</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jack-dorsey-s-mining-ambitions-steam-bans-nfts-a-bitcoin-etf-preps-launch?rc=wsoyyg">Jack Dorsey’s Mining Ambitions; Steam Bans NFTs; a Bitcoin ETF Preps&nbsp;Launch</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/120917/meet-the-former-parafi-capital-investor-betting-big-on-nfts">Meet the former ParaFi Capital investor betting big on&nbsp;NFTs</a>  <a href="https://decrypt.co/84121/reddit-building-nft-marketplace-ethereum-token-rewards">Reddit Building NFT Marketplace to Join Ethereum Token Rewards — Decrypt</a>   2. Tweet of the&nbsp;week <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSacks/status/1450162259733491715">Adam Sacks</a> — via&nbsp;<a href="http://global.id/easwee">/easwee</a>:</p> 3. How Bonifii x GlobaliD x Indicio enhance financial inclusion <p>From <a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/10/bonifii-increases-financial-inclusion-with-globalid-digital-wallet-and-indicio-network/">the announcement</a>:</p><blockquote>Bonifii, the financial industry’s first verifiable exchange network for financial cooperatives, today announced the Bonifii credential, a decentralized digital identity that provides underserved individuals with access to traditional banking services in a way that maximizes their privacy and security. Bonifii created the digital credential in partnership with GlobaliD, a trust platform and digital wallet. The credential is underpinned by the Indicio Network, a global network built on Hyperledger Indy for decentralized digital identity using distributed ledger technology (DLT).</blockquote><blockquote>The Bonifii credential transforms the way new accounts are created by streamlining the delivery of information needed to open an account at a traditional financial institution. By enabling an end-to-end digital online application process, the credential offers a secure and meaningful entry point into accounts with financial institutions for millions of underbanked people, giving them a pathway to achieving financial stability.</blockquote><blockquote>“Now, financial institutions that use the Bonifii credential can achieve higher levels of assurance than traditional application methods. The identity of the account applicant can be verified from a variety of attributes that create trust and assurance,” said John Ainsworth, CEO and President of Bonifii. “This type of digitally verifiable KYC reduces fraud, increases financial inclusion, and provides friction-free interactions between account holders and financial institutions.”</blockquote><p>In the context of inclusion and interoperability, the vision here is super exciting. Individuals will be able to open an account with a credit union using a simple, universal credential that can later also be accepted by other financial institutions as it satisfies basic compliance requirements for account&nbsp;opening.</p><p>And because the credential is built on self-sovereign identity, there’s huge potential to reach those currently out of reach of the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p> 4. Chart of the&nbsp;week <p>Speaking of Patreon — from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/podcasters-rule-on-patreon-chart-li-jin-joins-a-crypto-firm?rc=wsoyyg">The Information’s Creator Economy newsletter</a>:</p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/podcasters-rule-on-patreon-chart-li-jin-joins-a-crypto-firm?rc=wsoyyg">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>This shows how well the company has sustained the boost in usage it had early in the pandemic. In March last year, Patreon said more creators had joined the platform than any month in its entire history. In January this year, it said it was generating $100 million in annualized revenue, which it earns by taking a cut of creators’ monthly incomes on the&nbsp;site.</blockquote><p>Established creators are running with the subscription model. What will they do with&nbsp;NFTs?</p><p>Also, a crazy stat from&nbsp;Axios:</p><blockquote>The internet employs almost as many creators (200,000 full-time equivalent jobs) as the rest of the U.S. entertainment industry represented by the largest&nbsp;unions.</blockquote> 5. Hard Yaka portfolio company Forge is having a banner&nbsp;year <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6858017118827479040/">True Global Ventures</a>:</p><blockquote>Forge’s total revenue grew 306% to $68.1M for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020; Placement fee revenues for Forge Markets, Forge’s private share trading platform, grew 291% to nearly $58 million, up from $14.8 million in the same period, while volume increased 203% in the period to $1.68&nbsp;billion!</blockquote><blockquote>This of course comes as great news as Forge recently unveiled its intent to go public, in a proposed merger with Motive Capital Corp, a SPAC sponsored by affiliates of Motive Partners. The proposed transaction values Forge at around $2 billion and is expected to be completed earliest in Q4&nbsp;2021!</blockquote> 6.

Description: As we move through Season Two of Hello User and pull apart top cybersecurity themes and myths around cybersecurity, we welcome Candace Worley, Chief Product Officer for Ping Identity. Candace shares some key takeaways from her time at Ping, along with McAfee and a short stint at Amazon. She talks about what it takes to run a mission-critical solution for companies, the changes she has seen in the industry, and how we can prepare against the innate trusting nature of humans. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [1:55] Throughout her long tenure in cyber, what changes hasCandace seen in hackers, vendors, and the response companies have to attacks? What were the benefits of working for a company that had a very large footprint in the enterprise space? [3:40] Candace and Richard give their take on the intention behind founders building security solution companies. Is it for the revenue? The security? Or maybe a mix of both. [7:19] Candace talks about the switch companies go through from being security first to software, and the typical implications and expectations that go along with that switch. [13:50] Candace feels there are two things at the core of security: data and identity. [14:30] While working as the Chief Strategist at McAfee, it became clear to Candace that if you have a really strong identity practice in place that is integrated into that security stack, your ability to mitigate the risk of material cyber-attacks is pretty good. [17:41] Where have we fallen down as an industry? [22:50] The fundamental issue in cyber security is that humans are innately trusting. [23:28] Why is Candace fascinated by the idea of moving towards risk-based identity? &nbsp; Quotes: •“Most security solutions founders see a problem that has a potential revenue opportunity associated with it.” —Richard   •“If you get your identity wrong, you’d better pray you got the rest of your cyber stack pretty bulletproof, because you just left the front door unlocked.” —Candace •“Vulnerabilities are sexy, yet identity is day-to-day work, and it takes a tremendous amount of effort.” —Richard •“The fundamental issue in cyber security is that humans are innately trusting.” —Candace &nbsp; Mentioned in This Episode: •Candace Worley •Ping Identity

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Donnie Wendt, Principal Security Researcher at MasterCard, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4909/2">Machine Learning: Cybersecurity’s Friend &amp; Foe</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 14:20 pm to 14:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Donnie some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your presentation: “Machine Learning: Cybersecurity’s Friend &amp; Foe”? 
<p>Sure. My presentation, it's designed to help the cybersecurity professional understand what machine learning is and how it's used for cybersecurity. Because when you look at a lot of the marketing material for most cybersecurity products today, machine learning and artificial intelligence appear to be this magical fairy dust. But in employing machine learning for cybersecurity, it really does offer tremendous benefit and great promise. However, there are many risks that security professionals must understand.</p>
<p>So my presentation really seeks to demystify machine learning and its underlying concept so that cybersecurity professionals can harness its true potential. I'll discuss some of the possible vulnerabilities and risks, including attacks on the process, data and models, and also explore implementing adversarial machine learning to test and protect our machine learning models that we use in cybersecurity.</p>
 How can Machine Learning improve Cybersecurity? 
<p>Well, one of the challenges in cybersecurity is really dealing with the extremely high volumes of data and the rate of emerging threats out there. I've also done a lot of work in security automation and quite simply, the amount of data and the rate of attack variants make manual analysis and detection impossible, or machine learning comes in as it can effectively and efficiently deal with massive amounts of data while discovering subtle changes and patterns in that data. So employing machine learning actually offers tremendous benefits to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>It has become a very vital component in many of our security solutions. There are many cybersecurity use cases that are perfect for machine learning, including things like spam filtering, malware, phishing detection, intrusion detection, biometric authentication, user behavior analysis, anomaly detection. The list goes on. It's like almost every cybersecurity use case we have is good for machine learning. So the power of machine learning is to analyze large amounts of data efficiently and accurately ensures that its use in cybersecurity is just going to continue to expand rapidly.</p>
 What risks are there to consider? 
<p>Researchers have proven that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs and attacks. A lot of times it will classify those attacks based on a machine learning phase, such as training or inference or based on whether they're causative or exploratory. For example, during the training phase, attacks are often what we call poisoning attacks, which can cause the models to learn the wrong behavior.</p>
<p>In the inferent stage, we look for exploratory attacks that seek to understand how our model works, which can then be a precursor to evasion or integrity attacks on our models. In addition to the attacks, we also have to understand the risks associated with bias and the inherent integrity issues within the data or the model we're using. That's why I'm a very big supporter of transparency and explicability of our machine learning models, so we do know what they're doing.</p>
 Which attacks are particularly dangerous? 
<p>Interesting, I see the most dangerous attack on machine learning is the one we don't detect, right? Because one of the leading areas in research right now is how we can detect various attacks during the phases of machine learning process. We have to understand where our weaknesses are with a given machine learning model or data. For instance, if you're doing online learning, you are more susceptible to a training phase poisoning attack because you're actually using live data to train your systems.</p>
<p>Another example is if you're using clustering algorithms for classification, you're much more susceptible to an evasion attack because it's easy to create something that looks like or looks similar to what you're clustering. So it's really, the main attack I see, the main weakness is the cybersecurity professionals not understanding necessarily how the models within the tools they're implementing work. So we really, that's why I came up with this presentation was to try to bridge that gap. It's not to make our cybersecurity professionals data scientists, but make sure they understand how these tools are leveraging machine learning.</p>

 🇺🇸 New York Attorney General Clamps Down on Unregistered Cryptoasset Lending Firms With Cease-and-desist Letters.  
 Last week the New York Attorney General, Letitia James, shared two cease-and-desist letters to cryptoasset lending firms. Under state law, such lending platforms must register with the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) if they operate from New York or offer services to its residents. These services are regulated under New York’s Martin Act which aims to protect investors when engaging with business handling securities. These letters were released to the public but were supposed to have the company names redacted. However, the file names clearly identified the two firms.<br><br>The first letter was sent to Nexo which failed to register as an issuer of securities in the state of New York. The Attorney General stated that it was ‘in possession of evidence that [Nexo] is unlawfully selling or offering for sale securities and/or commodities within or from the State of New York without having registered as required.’ The OAG’s primary concern is that New Yorkers are being exposed to ‘significant undisclosed risks’ by cryptoasset businesses. <br><br>The New York OAG outlined that Nexo has until October 28th to confirm it has ceased such activity and provide more information to the Attorney General as to why they should not investigate this matter further. In response, Nexo’s CEO Antoni Trenchev declared that the company uses IP geo-blocking to prevent New Yorkers from using their services. Nonetheless, the Attorney General urged Nexo to take all the measures needed to ‘preserve all physical and electronic record and data pertaining to the matters raised in this letter.’ This highlights the importance of establishing a strong compliance programme. A similar letter was sent to Celsius asking it to clarify its ownership structure and other operational arrangements. <br><br>In addition, three unnamed cryptoasset platforms received information request letters from the OAG relating to their operational structure, activities and products. On top of this the letter requests details of company policies which mitigate manipulative trading as well as suspicious transactions. This includes an audit of ‘all wallet addresses in which the virtual currency is held’, a list of third parties which may hold cryptoassets on behalf of these platforms and ‘a list of transactions by or through your platform or service [...] including all relevant transaction details.’ The OAG requested receipt all of this material and more by November 1st 2021.<br><br>Overall, this development shows that complex cryptoasset products are attracting increasing regulatory attention and highlights the importance of having robust compliance programmes in place to mitigate exposure to illicit activity and satisfy legal requirements. Indeed, the OAG’s press release reminded the industry of the shutdown of Coinseed and the multi-million dollar penalties imposed on Bitfinex and Tether earlier this year.

<p>Gosh, now that the dev team has moved to weekly releases, there’s a lot to catch up on when I skip a week! The most recent Holochain releases have a number of bug fixes that improve performance and reliability, along with a new feature (<code><a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">post_commit</a></code>) and a few breaking changes.</p> Holochain 0.0.109: Gossip improvements <p>The release from three weeks ago brought some important bug fixes in the network layer, improving performance and reliability.</p>  The conductor no longer tries to join networks that are already in the process of being joined. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1006">#1006</a>)  The genesis process no longer tries to self-validate ops that are produced for the first three source chain entries, which may require a network which isn’t available yet. Instead, a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.109/hdk/prelude/genesis/index.html"><code>genesis_self_check</code></a> callback can run against those ops as a reduced, network-disabled pre-validation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/995">#995</a>)  Multi-peer gossip messages (e.g., publishing and retrieval of DHT data) no longer wait until timeout when enough responses have been received. (<a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.110/hdk/prelude/genesis/index.html">#1009</a>)  Terminate a gossip round initiation if no responses are received. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014">#1014</a>)  Don’t gossip with stale peers. This fixes a bug with long-lived DHTs, in which newcomers couldn’t see old data. The bug had previously been blocking a number of initiatives, including the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">Holochain Launcher</a> and <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp/">DevCamp</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014">#1014</a>)  <p>There have been some other speed improvements and fixes:</p>  The conductor can now run 50 validations concurrently. This helps speed things up when some validations are slowed down waiting to retrieve DHT data. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1005">#1005</a>).  Commits to the source chain with the new <code>ChainTopOrdering::Relaxed</code> flag now store both header and entry; previously the entry was mistakenly being dropped.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00109">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.110: More gossip improvements <p>The release from two weeks ago brought more networking bug fixes, which have made gossip even more reliable.</p>  Agents now try to republish their authored source chain data until they receive the expected number of validation receipts. This helps ensure the data will stay available when the agent goes offline. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1024">#1024</a>)  Improvement to database write efficiency when storing information about peers. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1007/">#1007</a>)  DHT requests are only sent to local agents if they’re authorities. This saves on internal chatter. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1027">#1027</a>)  ‘starts-with’ queries on link tags now work. This was working in the LMDB storage layer but not in the SQLite storage layer. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1027">#1027</a>)  <p>Lair, the keystore for Holochain, is also undergoing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">a lot of changes</a>. There’s been a lot of work to get Holochain ready for Lair’s new API (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1017">#1017</a>), but your hApps won’t be affected by these changes. It does mean, though, that Lair and Holochain will be getting new features, including:</p>  Seed bundle importing will allow you to use <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/">DeepKey</a> to create an identity and one machine and connect it to your identity on another machine (Lair <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/70">#70</a>).  NaCl’s <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html">box encryption</a> algorithm will be added to the HDK in addition to the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.110/hdk/x_salsa20_poly1305/index.html">existing</a> secret box encryption (Lair <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/73">#73</a>).  <p>If you manage conductor configs yourself, you’ll need to know that the Lair keystore config section has some breaking changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1031">#1031</a>) as a result of the above.</p><p>Sweettest has also gotten some updates that make it more versatile (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1030">#1030</a>). Not sure what Sweeettest is? Read on; I’ve written a bit about it after the next section.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00110">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.112: Post-commit hook and DNA info <p>Last week’s release brings new developer-facing features and breaking changes. (Note that there is no official 0.0.111 because of a release automation issue.)</p><blockquote>The biggest new feature is the <code>post_commit</code> hook. This lets you write a callback that’s called after every zome call that commits data. Your callback will receive a list of headers that have just been written, and can then do whatever it likes except commit new data. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1000">#1000</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Read more about <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">how to use <code>post_commit</code></a> in your hApp at the community wiki.</blockquote><p>Breaking/new: Some info available via the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.112/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html">zome_info</a></code> host function -- the DNA ID, hash, and properties — have been split out into a new <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.112/hdk/info/fn.dna_info.html">dna_info</a></code> host function. This information is no longer available via <code>zome_info</code>, and the <code>zome_name</code> property has been renamed to <code>name</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1044">#1044</a>) Additionally, a DNA’s zomes are now available via <code>dna_info</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1052">#1052</a>) and a zome’s entry type definitions are now available via <code>zome_info</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>).</p><p>Breaking: The structs <code>HeaderHashes</code> and <code>HeaderHashedVec</code>, which wrap vectors of other structs, have been removed. As this was only used in the previously unimplemented <code>post_commit</code>, it shouldn’t affect any of your existing code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)</p><p>New: <code>call_info</code> is partially implemented. A zome call can use this function to get info about how and why it was called. Currently it only gives the current source chain head, but in the future it will give information about capability context and how it was called (by a client, another zome or DNA, or a remote agent). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1047">#1047</a>)</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.112/CHANGELOG.md#20211021140006">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Sweettest: Rust-based Holochain testing <p>Sweettest is a Rust-based testing framework for Holochain apps. It has tools for creating conductors, loading hApps into them, and networking those conductors together. The Holochain dev team created it for testing Holochain and its various subsystems in different scenarios. And because it’s written in Rust, they can test everything from within one language ecosystem with simpler tools for automation and continuous integration. Besides the convenience of putting tests inline with code, they can reuse all of Holochain’s public-facing types like HDK and conductor API input/output structs. There’s no need to recreate a bunch of type definitions in TypeScript or depend on JavaScript client bindings.</p><p>Right now the Holochain team’s big focus is on testing sharding and scaling. They need rigorous sharding tests that ensure everything is successfully getting validated by the right DHT peers, no signals or messages are getting lost, and there are no bottlenecks. On top of sharding, they’re also testing how Holochain performs in large networks with lots of traffic, with an eye to analyzing what disruptions it’s encountering when it does struggle. This will become very important in the near future, because we’re just about to open up public access to hosted apps like Elemental Chat. If we can gather good data that pinpoints the source of problems, that helps us find solutions quickly.</p><p>From what I understand, they use Sweettest to run both small-scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit tests</a> and large-scale integration tests. Because Holochain is a framework for peer-to-peer computing, it becomes important to test the same chunk of code in multiple contexts, such as on different machines as they interact with each other.</p><p>Although its primary usage right now is testing Holochain, Sweettest can also be used as an alternative to Tryorama for testing hApps. That’s because the Holochain conductor is basically a runtime for hApps — much of the functionality can’t be tested without an actual hApp to plug into it. In fact, a lot of our Sweettest tests are built around hApp functionality.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a>, the Node.JS-based Holochain scenario testing suite, is still our ‘official’ way of creating scenario tests for developers to test their hApps. But if you want to try something different — and don’t mind a bit of do-it-yourself — Sweettest might be worth a try.</blockquote><p>All of our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/holochain/tests">examples</a> are specific to testing Holochain, of course, and some of them use zomes generated on the fly rather than compiled into a DNA. But they do show how to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/holochain/tests/multi_conductor.rs">construct multi-conductor scenarios</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/holochain/tests/agent_scaling.rs">test time-to-consistency</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat/pull/100/files#diff-bea9f70b22dade9abf9f6a3e7ac3c9c6d34fa336a214077a98761ea757cac7fbR1-R174">test a hApp</a>. Hopefully they’ll give you a decent idea of how to create your own scenario tests.</p> DevCamp 8 <p>How it started: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How it’s going:</p><p>😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;👩‍🏫🤯😤😊😎🤔🤓💪👍👨‍💻👩‍💻</p><p>Seriously, the level of excitement, thoughtfulness, and engagement has been wonderful to watch — and it’s remained high through the first three weeks of DevCamp and this week’s ‘reading break’.</p> Holochain In Action: Mapping important modules <p>The most recent Holochain in Action session explores the current landscape of modules you can use in your hApps already, along with the unknown territory at the edge of the map. Where are the gaps? What modules do we need to build next? How can we make sure we create things that will <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-in-action-composability-in-the-real-world">compose</a> together well? (This is an important subject; composable modules are easier to work with, which means that more people can build better apps. We’ve touched on this in our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-in-action-composability-in-the-real-world">coverage</a> of a previous HIA session.)</p><p>One thing I really loved about this session is that the participants used <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn</a>, a Holochain app, to do their mapping. You can see their excitement as they all connect to each other, peer-to-peer, and start working together. Hooray for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@zhangkaiyv?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> zhang kaiyv</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/highway?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Not every customer who walks through the door of your dealership on a sunny weekend afternoon can breeze through the auto financing process with no issues. This group could comprise as much as <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/auto-loan-debt-study/">18% of the borrowers </a>who step into your dealership. In our quickly-evolving economy, many borrowers can have multiple sources of income, thin credit, or a compromised FICO profile. Verifying income with consumer-permissioned data is a digital solution that can help clear stips and smooth out those tricky loan approvals in real-time.</p>
<p>If you have a borrower sitting in your financing department, the team at your dealership has already invested time with them. They’ve shown them several vehicles, developed rapport, and maybe took a test drive. Don’t lose the sale just because the customer isn’t carrying a stack of freshly-printed pay stubs. Using Finicity Lend’s income verification, the borrower permissions access to the data in their bank account, generating a verification of income (VOI) report. The results that are returned show a high level of accuracy in determining actual income. This <a href="http://finicity.com/connect">low-friction experience</a> cuts down total time spent on each loan application, finishing the verification process in real-time. The borrower doesn’t have to scramble to collect documentation from various sources just so they can leave with the car.&nbsp;</p>
 Extend Credit With Confidence. Get More Approvals. 
<p>Tightened auto lending guidelines and a pandemic-influenced drop in consumer demand are causing <a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/consumer-credit-activity-continues-to-rise-from-pandemic-lows--auto-loan-subprime-performance-lags/">a slump in subprime originations</a>. When your customer falls in love with a car and is ready to buy, you don’t want limited lending options to cost you the sale. Traditional FICO models are a good start, but when credit scores aren’t enough to get the green light, Finicity Lend augments the credit decisioning with real-time income data that makes the credit decisioning process faster and more efficient for lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today’s lending process is in the midst of a vast digital transformation, placing Finicity, a Mastercard company and its open banking technology at the forefront of this data revolution. <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-a-thin-credit-file-and-how-will-it-impact-your-life/">62 million Americans have a thin credit file</a>, with only one to four tradelines listed. While they may be more than capable of financing a car, traditional credit scoring models could result in a denial of these applications. With Finicity Lend’s income verification, permissioned data access to their bank accounts gives a more robust picture of their actual financial health. The borrower can be issued a loan that they can be approved for and repay. Finicity’s open banking network covers 95% of direct deposit accounts in the United States, greatly increasing the number of buyers you can assist in buying a car. Accurate income data helps satisfy loan stipulations and lets buyers purchase a vehicle right away.&nbsp;</p>
 Reducing Risk 
<p>When a borrower misrepresents their income, it’s nearly always to gain access to more credit than they can handle. 2020 was a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415005688/en/Landmark-Point-Predictive-Fraud-Study-Details-Record-Year-for-Auto-Loan-Fraud-in-2020">record year</a> for fraud in the auto industry, reaching a whopping $7.3 billion in losses. One of the biggest increases came in income and employment misrepresentation. With a 100% year-over-year jump in falsified incomes, one of the most important investments you can make is in prevention. Be sure that you have accurate data with Finicity Lend’s income verification.&nbsp;</p>
 Higher Verification Success Rates Translates to Fewer Lost Sales 
<p>With the increased confidence and efficiency that comes with Finicity Lend’s income verification, good sales don’t walk out the door just because there’s not enough paperwork on hand. Verified, real-time data gets the sale closed. Over the course of a fiscal year, lost sales and fraud can cause extensive damage to your bottom line. Finicity income verification is fast and secure. The speed of the process means you can invest time and effort into higher-return work activity. This positive snowball effect can show up in the win column of your balance sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many design teams, <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> made the transition from Abstract + Sketch, to Figma in the last couple of years. One of the common resistance points internally before making that switch, was Figma’s lack of Git-style branching that Abstract enabled. The design team had come to rely on branching and had built a lot of our processes around&nbsp;it.</p><p>During the transition we tried to structure our files, projects, and design system in a way that would help maintain some (though not all) of the benefits we got from branches.</p><p>I hope some of the ideas here spark inspiration for ways you could improve your project and file structures, however keep in mind that this system was designed for our specific needs (yours are probably different) and that these decisions should change over time in a culture of continuous improvement. I highlight some of our learnings at the end of the article. As always, your mileage may&nbsp;vary!</p> Structure <p>We are on a <a href="https://www.figma.com/pricing/">Figma Organisation plan</a>, and structure our teams in a way that roughly maps to our cross-functional product&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Each team has three main types of “projects” (folders, if you&nbsp;prefer):</p>  Source files  Work in progress&nbsp;(WIP)  Archive   Source files <p>A source file is like our main branch. They are one or more files that contain a reasonably up to date version of each screen in the product, and typically not a lot more. We try to keep these files as slim as possible, with as little screen duplication as possible. We do this to reduce the impact of breaking changes further down the road, and to simplify manual effort when&nbsp;merging.</p><p>The rule of thumb is that if someone can look at a screen in the live product, and put together an accurate version of that screen in Figma in under 2 mins, then what’s in the source file is enough. We don’t need an exhaustive lists of all the error states for a form, as long as there’s one solid example of what an error looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>These files are often the starting point for design work on existing products. Streamlined source files enable us to quickly duplicate flows and have them be immediately useful without a lot of busy work removing edge and error&nbsp;cases.</p> Work in&nbsp;progress <p>This is usually where the Figma part of the design process starts. We have a project template file which specifies a basic page structure, and a standardised cover sheet. This will be copied into the work in progress folder and named with the project name, and JIRA ticket number where applicable.</p><p>This file acts as our branch. Branching is unfortunately very manual right now, but not too difficult at our scale of two to three designers per&nbsp;product.</p><p>Screens are copied from the source file (which should be up to date), and design exploration is done from there. Our template specifies an Exploration page, which carries the expectation of no pre-defined structure, as messy and exploratory as the designer wants to be. We don’t critique people’s exploration pages.</p><p>We also specify a Handoff page, where engineers know to look for final screens, design specs and flows. Redlines (using <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739918456607459153">Figma Measure</a>), and custom annotation components are commonly used&nbsp;here.</p><p>Between those two pages, the designer can add as many pages as they need. Typically these progress in order, and new pages are often created at points where feedback is required. We’ll limit pages to only the stuff we want feedback on, so design dead ends and exploratory screens don’t distract people away from what you need actual feedback&nbsp;on.</p> UI kits <p>In our design system team we have a UI Kits project. These UI kits contain any commonly used UI components that are more product-specific than our Design System supports. Each product has a UI kit that’s owned and managed by that product&nbsp;team.</p><p>A note on naming: You’ll see the UI kits have an 05 in front of their name. This is part of our design system’s naming convention that I’ll dig deeper in with another article. We use this numbering system throughout our files to keep libraries in a consistent order in the library panel. Themes first, then assets, components, patterns, and UI&nbsp;kits.</p><p>When it comes to how we structure our files, one of our few hard rules&nbsp;is:</p><blockquote>WIP and Source files should not contain any local components</blockquote><p>The reasons we do this are&nbsp;to:</p>  Reduce library management noise<br>If every WIP or Source file is published as a team library, trying to find the right libraries to enable/disable to get a particular version of a particular component becomes a nightmare very&nbsp;quickly.  Make all screens easily portable/reusable by designers<br>If local components are in a file, but aren’t published as a team library, when someone copies a screen to another file, all links to that main component are lost. The result is an orphaned instance that doesn’t update when the main component is updated because changes aren’t published &amp; pushed. This is totally invisible to the designer, as it visually appears like a standard instance.  Unpublished local components lead to broken instance&nbsp;linksHaving a single published team library allows screens to be easily&nbsp;portable Merging <p>Once a design has been approved and development is in progress or completed, the new screens will be copied back to the Source file, replacing existing screens where necessary. Because no published components exist here, screens can be replaced safely without worry of affecting other work in progress.</p><p>For changes in UI kits, components will often be labelled as [BETA] while in progress, or given a version number, or something similar that lets us manage multiple versions of a component existing simultaneously while the work is in progress. When the screens are merged and we want to clean up those UI kit duplicates, we will follow the process here: <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/how-to-deprecate-old-components-in-figma-design-systems-7978ea8e045e">How to deprecate old components in Figma design&nbsp;systems</a>.</p> Archiving <p>Once complete, the work in progress file has the cover status changed to Archived and it is moved to the Archive folder. The archive then acts as an easy way to see the process behind a piece of work, the comment discussions, and document experiments and directions that could potentially be drawn on&nbsp;later.</p> Things we’ve learned so&nbsp;far   Cover status badges are a huge pain to maintain and keep up to date. No one remembers to change them to the right status, so they’re effectively useless. Occasionally we’ll do a big batch-change of everything in the Archive folder, as having these visibly well marked is really beneficial for searches. Some kind of background API integration that synced files with JIRA in real-time would be amazing here.&nbsp;*dreams*  There can be some confusion around what the right level of detail is to keep in a source file. We suggest keeping an open mind, and working with your teams to find the right balance for each team, as their products may have different needs.  Figma’s new Branches feature does not really meet our needs as it is currently designed. Once merged, the process part is a lot more hidden and difficult for others to find than our archived files. That archival side may not be an issue for you, which is fine. The other issue is that our styles and components live in separate libraries. If we need to make a change that includes both a style and component change, that can‘t be done in a single branch. There’s also no good way of testing the effect your branch changes will have on linked instances in other files right now. Again, a multi-file branch system would solve&nbsp;these.  Having a JIRA ticket number in file names is really useful for search, however search only returns results from teams you are a member of, making cross-team discoverability a lot worse than it should be. This is especially true for larger orgs with more teams, or stricter permissions than we have (anyone is free to join any team at&nbsp;Onfido).  <p>I hope that’s sparked some ideas about how you could structure your own teams and files.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the ninth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/ButNeverSaved">John Francisco</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologySpanish">Spanish community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology when I met Sesameseed. They had recently launched staking with Ontology. I really liked their ecosystem and started to learn more about the&nbsp;project.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>As an end user in my beginnings knowing Ontology, I was very fascinated by its infrastructure and its staking. I later learned that it is aiming to provide digital identity solutions that companies and day-to-day users need, today. I like technology, therefore, this led me to become even more interested in Ontology.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The community is very important in every project. For this reason, building communities and giving them the tools they need to understand the project is vital for the future and its success. Being a Harbinger is having the responsibility of spreading the word about the future, leading new generations to contribute and generate change in all aspects of technology, and that is what Ontology does, day after&nbsp;day.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>As I have mentioned before, the community is very important; it is the heart of every project. It is the starting point because they direct the course of the project anyway; they help to build a better future. For that and many more reasons, being part of Ontology is being that new paradigm of improvements towards the&nbsp;future.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Each community has its own, however Ontology allows all its members to be part of the project in a more direct way, such as via the Ontology Harbinger program. This program is where you can contribute your knowledge about Ontology’s technology and long-term objectives more directly. Ontology makes you special by being part of its community, part of its ecosystem and as an end user you feel that you have done something important for today and the future of Ontology.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Telegram is a very important channel for Ontology; it is the place where the community feels welcomed by the moderators and administrators. There is a more direct interaction and it is the perfect place to disseminate what Ontology is. As a secondary channel, Twitter is an essential part of the communication ecosystem because it interacts with the most technical and intrepid users who also contribute as the Ontology community.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>In the first instance it was an arduous path, but I did it. Now my responsibilities do not merely include being a single guide to a member of the community but also being an ambassador for Ontology anywhere and for everyone. To be a Harbinger, my biggest advice is, be part of Ontology, understand Ontology and be more than a community member. Understand Ontology’s potential and how you can contribute to the project in a healthy way. Learn every day from Ontology because technology advances every day and without stopping.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Amazing, fascinating, visionaries.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Communication is vital for a community to grow and prosper. Ontology and the Harbinger program open the doors for the community to grow and have solid foundations for its expansion to other horizons.</p><p>The members of the community are the visionaries and owners of having the project in their hands, with their contribution, their knowledge, their way of understanding Ontology leaving an enriched legacy of pure knowledge, they make and will make Ontology and its community even stronger in&nbsp;time.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Its decentralized identity solutions that return to the end user control over their data. It is important that community members utilize these tools and be an example to others who may later come to adopt them, too. We need to demonstrate to those around us how Ontology’s tools benefit our everyday lives. We can use ONTO to manage our digital identities or build wealth through staking and show our friends and family how convenient and easy it&nbsp;is.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			 Guarantee Asset Ownership with Blockchain Passports 
<p>In the DeFi world, digital assets are stored in blockchain wallets. Obviously, wallets are not identities, they are anonymous addresses and contain no data on the owner’s identity. A private key is the ‘password’ of the wallet, whoever knows it can access the wallet. It cannot be changed, but it can be stolen. In other words,&nbsp;a wallet is more like a browser for blockchain, where you can see what is inside, but you cannot be sure that you are the only one that has access to your assets.&nbsp;This causes a number of issues:</p>
 
 Lack of ownership guarantee:&nbsp;If the private key of the wallet is accessible by another user, then who owns the assets?&nbsp;<br>
 
 Lack of compliance:&nbsp;For token issuers or DeFi protocols, it is impossible to comply with regulations if the owner of the digital asset is unidentifiable and eligibility criteria cannot be enforced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 
 
<p>So, what is the solution? Digital identities. Just as our assets are secured by tying our identity to them in the real world,&nbsp;digital identities can serve as blockchain passports in the DeFi world to guarantee the ownership of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
 
 Link digital identity to tokens:&nbsp;Use a token standard that codes ownership of tokens with a digital identity into the token, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-an-official-standard-for-permissioned-tokens/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8CICjIIuDtTtwwrilIOs32jMUt8WvZHzkBCGzD6Fq2JW_uP4pcxEcwOeQ-xfJF4N4CT92b">ERC3643</a>, the official permissioned token standard. With this standard, token recovery is even possible due to the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8CICjIIuDtTtwwrilIOs32jMUt8WvZHzkBCGzD6Fq2JW_uP4pcxEcwOeQ-xfJF4N4CT92b">ONCHAINID</a>, a decentralized digital identity system. 
 A functional blockchain passport:&nbsp;Once the tokens are issued, they will be allocated to a wallet associated with the digital identity. Furthermore, digital identity functions go far beyond this, and can allow you to recover/transfer tokens, add/delete wallets (e.g. Metamask, Ledger), etc. 
 
<p>More interestingly, when personal data (e.g. country of residence, age…) is verified by trusted parties (e.g. government, big four, KYC providers…), the proof of the verification is stored onchain in the digital identity, making these proofs reusable. For instance, identity owners can grant access to their proof of age to a DeFi protocol that only accepts users above the age of 18.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without revealing their personal information, the DeFi protocol can determine if the identity holders are over 18 years old via the verified proof.&nbsp;Digital identity is thus like a privacy-protected blockchain passport, making it easier, safer and faster to explore DeFi.</p>

<p>An important change is beginning to sweep the world of personal data. For many years, people have debated the question ‘what if individuals — e.g. citizens, customers — were able to assert genuine control over their own&nbsp;data?’</p><p>Now the debate is moving on to how to make this happen, at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Look at some recent developments. In recent&nbsp;weeks:</p>  The UK Government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1016395/Data_Reform_Consultation_Document__Accessible_.pdf">legislation to reform UK data protection laws</a>, includes (amongst many less positive things) new provisions for data intermediaries including for “Personal information management systems, which seek to give data subjects more control over their personal&nbsp;data.”  The UK Department of Culture Media and Sport’s latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">paper</a> on its new National Identity and Attributes Trust framework specifically mentions citizens being able to hold verified attributes in their own personal data&nbsp;stores.  The Scottish Government’s proposed <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a> includes a provision “where people can choose to save their personal information securely to an individual ‘locker’ (a digital attribute store), in order to reuse when they wish to apply to other services”.  The UK Government via its Government Digital Service is to provide a One Log-in for Government which includes the concept of a personal data store to enable citizen control over how their data is being shared across Government. Tom Read GDS Chief Executive Officer said that “One Log-in for government is currently the organisation’s most important piece of&nbsp;work.”  Scottish Government has <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">just signed a contract</a> with Mydex CIC to improve recruitment of citizens to participate in projects to co-design public services that ensures privacy via the use of its Inclued platform and personal data stores.The UK NHS and BBC are now experimenting with personal data stores for health and media consumption records  <p>In other words, multiple different parties and people are converging on the same solution — of providing citizens with their own personal data stores — to solve multiple different problems.</p><p>The big question now is how to enable this to happen at scale, safely, securely and efficiently. One key element of this is useful, easy-to-use interfaces, the taps and switches that mean people can use the infrastructure without having to think much about it. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">written about this&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>But operational deployment as scale presents its own challenge. It’s one thing to build something in a lab to illustrate an idea’s potential. It’s quite another to make the transition to 24/7/365 operations, working at scale in the real world. Answering the question ‘how’ requires robust answers to many hard questions relating to infrastructure resilience, security, system architecture, governance, trustworthiness, business model and legal compliance. Here’s a checklist of these questions in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>Are its underlying design principles fit for purpose, robust and built to&nbsp;last?</p><p>We talk about this issue <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">in detail&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Is the individual’s data really&nbsp;secure?</p><p>It’s very easy to make promises about data security, but very difficult to keep these promises permanently, especially when a system is operating at scale. Here are some of the safeguards that need to be&nbsp;built.</p>  All data should be encrypted in motion and at&nbsp;rest  Distributed architecture: every PDS is separately and individually encrypted (which means the system is not creating a massive centralised database that becomes a honeypot for&nbsp;hackers)  No knowledge operations. Every individual should hold their own private key to their own data: the PDS operator does not have access to this private key, and cannot look into the personal data stores it provides or make any changes to who can send or collect data from it only the individual can.  Everything the company does relating to the security of information management should be independently assessed and certified. To be legitimate, the PDS provider should be certified under ISO 27001 for information security Management.  <p>The Mydex platform displays all these criteria.</p><p>How does the PDS operator cover its costs and make its&nbsp;money?</p>  Is the PDS’s business model open and transparent? Does it, for example, publish a public price tariff, where what organisations are paying, for what, is open for all to&nbsp;see?  How does this business model affect the PDS provider’s incentives? For example, some PDS providers have generated business models where they take a ‘cut’ every time data is shared. This generates an incentive for the PDS provider to maximise the amount of data that is shared, thereby creating a potential conflict of interest between it and the citizens it is supposed to be&nbsp;serving.  <p>To make their offerings attractive to organisations that want to retain control, other PDS providers have created halfway-house ‘personal data stores’ which remain inside the organisation’s operational boundaries, where the individual signs in using the organisation’s systems, and where the organisation places restrictions on what data the individual can share with who. Such faux personal data stores may generate revenue streams for the technology provider, but they generate a conflict of interest with the citizen that defeats the object of having a personal data store in the first&nbsp;place.</p>  Does the PDS provider’s business model create revenue streams that are stable, e.g. designed to last in perpetuity?  <p>Mydex’s business model is designed to be open, to avoid conflicts of interest and to be stable. The model is very simple. Organisations pay a fee to connect to the platform, to enable safe efficient data sharing with individuals. There is no limit on what data can be delivered or accessed by who and for what purpose that is under the control of the individual at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>Does the PDS provider have governance structures designed to ensure its trustworthiness in perpetuity?</p><p>In a new ‘market’ like this, many would-be PDS providers are start-ups that are hungry for funding. Many of them seek funding from venture capitalists who, by definition, are seeking ‘an exit’ in the form of an IPO or trade&nbsp;sale.</p><p>This brings two dangers. First, it incentivises the PDS provider to create a business model that focuses on financial extraction — making money out of citizens and/or organisations — rather than genuine service provision.</p><p>Second, it means that any promises it makes in terms of commitments to privacy, data protection, business model or anything else may only last until the venture is sold. For a PDS provider to be legitimate, its business model and governance must include legally enforceable guarantees that mean it cannot simply go back on its promises in event of ownership of the organisation changing&nbsp;hands.</p><p>That is why Mydex has chosen to be a Community Interest Company — because CIC status builds in legal requirements on the company to stay true to its mission of empowering citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>Is the IT infrastructure robust and capable of operating at&nbsp;scale?</p><p>Many people operating in IT today have a ‘hacker mindset’. They love writing bits of code that do cool things, and every time they come across a new technical challenge they automatically start writing another, separate, bit of code. Hackers are often brilliant at creating cool point solutions. But as these point solutions add up, they generate complexity and chaos. People with the hacker mindset are not good at building robust, integrated, efficient solutions that operate at scale. For that, we need an engineering, infrastructure-building mindset that is always asking ‘how does this piece fit with everything else that has already been built? Will it work stably and reliably, at volume?’ This requires an engineering mindset, not a hacker&nbsp;mindset.</p><p>Can the system scale without generating mounting risks, costs or complexity?</p>  Providing a million personal data stores that are being used to store and share data, day in and day out, is very different to building a demo in a lab. Having robust software development, testing and deployment systems is essential if the flaws of the hacker mindset are to be&nbsp;avoided.  If the system can only work on a particular device such as a smartphone, everyone has to have access to such a device, these devices need to be designed so that they can ‘talk’ to each other, and problems arise if the device is lost, stolen or malfunctions. The only way millions of people can access their data from multiple different devices is if their data is stored (safely) in the&nbsp;cloud.  Some ways forward, such as Open Banking, envisage individuals giving permission for their data to be ported from one service provider to another without it being deposited in the individual’s personal data store. This, proponents claim, cuts out the unnecessary extra step of having a data ‘middleman’. The approach works fine for just one or two transactions. But it creates complexity and cost catastrophes as volumes rise. It’s why (for example) telephone exchanges were invented rather than every telephone line trying to create its own unique connection with every other&nbsp;line.  <p>Independent scrutiny and certification</p><p>It’s very easy for start-ups to make grand claims about what their technology can do or what their beliefs are. Selling ‘brochureware’ and ‘vaporware’ is a time honoured practice in software: Step 1) sell what you intend to make. Step 2) Use the money made from these sales to actually make what you promised. But an operation that works day in, day out, at scale cannot be fed by ‘vision’ and the apparent confidence of the salesman. What’s needed is independent scrutiny and certification.</p><p>That’s why Mydex is independently certified for data management security under ISO27001 and with Fair Data and why it has met the requirements to be listed on UK Government procurement frameworks like G-Cloud and to gain an Open Banking&nbsp;licence.</p><p>Built-in regulatory compliance</p><p>For any system to scale efficiently it has to make it easier, not harder, for service providers to comply with data protection regulations. This requires dedicated tools and infrastructure that a) ‘designs in’ compliance with key principles such as data minimisation under GDPR and b) enables both citizens and service providers to manage related processes simply, quickly and where possible, automatically.</p><p>Leaving compliance to data protection regulations aside to a ‘different department’ — creates a gap and disconnect between ‘legal’ and operations and is not something that can work efficiently and effectively at&nbsp;scale.</p> Summary <p>We know, because we’ve been there. Bringing new ideas to life in a lab environment is a positive, necessary thing to do. But making sure they can be implemented at scale, robustly, reliably and resiliently involves another — very different — set of considerations. This blog sums up our experience of what these considerations are.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/deploying-personal-data-stores-at-scale-ad35fb205e73">DEPLOYING PERSONAL DATA STORES AT SCALE</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) is a biannual gathering of identity enthusiasts where ideas and problems related to Internet <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">identity</a> are exchanged and discussed.</p><p>The 32nd edition of IIW took place from October 12th -14th 2021, and it was a mix of online and offline audiences.</p><p>Affinidi had a presence at IIW as it was a unique opportunity to showcase Affinidi’s work in the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> space and to understand the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">latest trends</a> in this&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Here are some things we did at&nbsp;IIW.</p> Demo of Schema&nbsp;Manager <p><a href="https://www.affinidi.com/">Affinidi</a> has built a Schema Manager to manage, create, clone, update, and reuse <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credential</a> types and existing schemas, and this was showcased at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>This tool is sure to come in handy for developers, product managers, and engineers who are looking to build an SSI application and face the problem of ensuring <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust</a> between actors (mainly, Issuers and Verifiers).</p><p>Essentially, the Schema Manager allows you to create any custom VC to meet the needs of a given situation or application. You also get to choose the attributes for each VC, and once you’re done, the tool generates a JSON schema that you can include as part of your&nbsp;code.</p><p>The schema you create can be public or private, depending on your preference. Also, you have the choice to publish it as a searchable schema so others can reuse&nbsp;them.</p><p>You can try our <a href="https://ui.schema.affinidi.com/">Schema Manager&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Group Discussion: What does NOT get adoption for SSI? AKA Failures in&nbsp;SSI <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/launganik/">Kamal Laungani</a>, the Global Developer Ecosystem (GDE)Manager at <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/">Affinidi</a>, was the convenor of a group discussion on the failures of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">SSI</a> and the reasons for its non-adoption</p><p>This group of eminent participants talked about how hard it is to adopt <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> and the reasons for the same were deliberated.</p><p>Some of the barriers discussed were:</p> Onboarding for&nbsp;humans <p>There is a lack of understanding on why privacy is important and what can be done to preserve one’s&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Also, there is not a whole lot of simple content that explains what Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI is and how it can be a potential game-changer for the security and privacy of online identities.</p> Onboarding for IT and DevOps and&nbsp;IAM <p>There is a gap between community knowledge and information available for IT, DevOps, and IAM professionals. Further, the lack of a well-defined ecosystem and a limited or no incentives model is making adoption more difficult.</p> Short term barriers vs clarity of immediate benefits <p>Since SSI is an emerging field, there are many short-term barriers such as developmental cost, a well-developed and easy-to-understand tech stack, and web 3.0 skill sets. Also, there is little clarity on the immediate benefits because the ecosystem is not in place and there seems to be a lot of uncertainties around government legislation.</p> Legacy integration <p>The big jump from <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Web 2.0 to Web 3.0</a> raises questions on integration with existing systems and apprehensions about building a complete infrastructure from&nbsp;scratch.</p> Who goes&nbsp;first? <p>Right now, this is a classic chicken and egg problem. Companies have few incentives to build applications and are waiting for greater adoption. In turn, users are apprehensive as well because there aren’t enough applications in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>So, this question of who goes first is impeding the growth of SSI&nbsp;greatly.</p> High Project&nbsp;Costs <p>The overall uncertainty coupled with high developmental costs are a barrier for SSI adoptions because the project costs/risks are high, so wrangling internal buy-in is not&nbsp;easy.</p><p>All these reasons were believed to contribute to the low rate of SSI adoption, and this has led every attendee to ponder over what can be done to address these concerns.</p><p>Based on these discussions, we, at Affinidi, have also started pondering over questions on the high costs, how to make it easy for people to know the importance of preserving their privacy through SSI, and what we can do as an organization to drive its adoption.</p> Attending Other&nbsp;Programs <p>Besides the Schema Manager demo and the group discussion, we attended many discussions, workshops, demos, and events, all of which have greatly enriched our knowledge and understanding. We hope to convert these insights into actionable items shortly, so make sure you stay abreast of all that’s happening at Affinidi by being a part of our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a> and following us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p><p>If you have any specific questions or feedback, reach out to us on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>Over the past five years, GraphQL has established itself as the most popular alternative to REST APIs. GraphQL has several advantages over traditional REST-based services. First of all, GraphQL makes the query schema available to the clients. A client that reads the schema immediately knows what services are available on the server. On top of that, the client is able to perform a query on a subset of the data.</p>

<p>Both of these features make the API much more flexible. The server can freely extend the API or make different parts of it available to different clients without breaking any client code. Another major advantage is the ability to perform complex queries. This reduces the number of API calls a client has to perform, and therefore improves performance.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to consume GraphQL in an Angular client. First, I will create a simple GraphQL server using Express. Then I will use the Apollo library to create a service in Angular that connects to the API and performs queries on it. I will implement a simple application that lets you browse the characters of the Star Wars franchise and look up details about their races and home planets. I will not assume any prior knowledge of Express, Angular, or GraphQL. I will assume that you are familiar with JavaScript and Node and have an up-to-date version of the <code>npm</code> package manager installed on your computer.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 14</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

<p>Table of Contents</p>
 
   <a>Implement a GraphQL server with Express</a> 
   <a>Create an Angular GraphQL client</a> 
   <a>Integrate OIDC for auth</a>     
       <a>Add JWT authentication to the server</a> 
       <a>Add Okta to Angular</a> 
     
   
   <a>Learn more about Angular, GraphQL, and single-page applications</a> 
 

 Implement a GraphQL server with Express 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to implement the GraphQL server using the Express framework. To start, open your terminal in an empty folder of your choice. This will be the folder that will contain the server project. Inside that folder, run the following command to initialize your Express project.</p>

   <code>npm init -y
</code>   

<p>This will create a <code>package.json</code> in your folder containing the project information and dependencies. Next, you need to install the dependencies required for this project. In your terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm i -E express@4.17.1 graphql@15.6.1 express-graphql@0.12.0 cors@2.8.5 \
  body-parser@1.19.0 csv-parse@4.16.3
</code>   

<p>To make the server work, you will need some data. I have chosen to keep it simple and use existing CSV data from Kaggle, a machine learning and data science community. Joe Young has put together Star Wars character data from the Fandom Wiki and made it freely available at this link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars">https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars</a>. You will need only two files from his collection for this project <code>characters.csv</code> and <code>species.csv</code>. You might have to create a Kaggle account to download the data. Place the files into your project folder.</p>

<p>GraphQL uses a global schema to define the queries allowed on the API and the data they return. Create a file <code>schema.graphql</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>type Query {
  characters(offset: Int = 0, limit: Int = 10): CharactersResult
  character(name: String!): Character
  species(name: String!): Species
}

type CharactersResult {
  count: Int
  characters: [Character]
}

type Character {
  name: String
  height: Int
  mass: String
  hair_color: String
  skin_color: String
  eye_color: String
  birth_year: String
  gender: String
  homeworld: String
  species: String
}

type Species {
  name: String
  classification: String
  designation: String
  average_height: String
  skin_colors: String
  hair_colors: String
  eye_colors: String
  average_lifespan: String
  language: String
  homeworld: String
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Query</code> type defines the entry point of the schema. It defines three queries: <code>characters</code>, <code>character</code>, and <code>species</code>. The data returned by these queries is defined in separate types in the schema file. Now, create a new file <code>app.js</code>, and fill it with the code below.</p>

   <code>const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const { json } = require('body-parser');
const fs = require('fs');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql');
const parse = require('csv-parse/lib/sync');

const app = express()
  .use(cors())
  .use(json());

const schema = buildSchema(fs.readFileSync('schema.graphql', 'utf8'));
const characters = parse(fs.readFileSync('characters.csv', 'utf8'), { columns: true });
const species = parse(fs.readFileSync('species.csv', 'utf8'), { columns: true });

const root = {
  characters: (args) =&gt; {
    return {
      count: characters.length,
      characters: characters.slice(args.offset, args.offset + args.limit)
    };
  },
  character: (args) =&gt; {
    return characters.find((ch) =&gt; ch.name === args.name);
  },
  species: (args) =&gt; {
    return species.find((ch) =&gt; ch.name === args.name);
  },
};

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema,
  rootValue: root,
  graphiql: true,
}));

app.listen(4201, (err) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    return console.log(err);
  }
  return console.log('Server listening on port 4201');
});
</code>   

<p>This is all the code you need to write to create the GraphQL server. The <code>graphqlHTTP</code> middleware registers the handlers on the <code>/graphql</code> route of the express server. The <code>root</code> object defines so-called reducers that will be called whenever a client queries the API. They are responsible for collecting and returning the data.</p>

<p>The nice thing about GraphQL is that you can immediately try it out. In your terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>node app.js
</code>   

<p>Now open your browser at <code>http://localhost:4201/graphql</code> and you will be presented with an interactive console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the left side, you can try out queries. Give it a go by pasting the following query into the query editor in the browser and pressing the play button at the top.</p>

   <code>{
  characters(offset: 2, limit:3) {
    count
    characters {
      name
      homeworld
      species
    }
  }
  species(name:"Human") {
    classification
    homeworld
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You should see this result on the right side of the screen.</p>

   <code>{
  "data": {
    "characters": {
      "count": 87,
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "R2-D2",
          "homeworld": "Naboo",
          "species": "Droid"
        },
        {
          "name": "Darth Vader",
          "homeworld": "Tatooine",
          "species": "Human"
        },
        {
          "name": "Leia Organa",
          "homeworld": "Alderaan",
          "species": "Human"
        }
      ]
    },
    "species": {
      "classification": "mammal",
      "homeworld": "Coruscant"
    }
  }
}
</code>   

 Create an Angular GraphQL client 

<p>Angular provides a command-line tool that makes it easy for anybody to set up and maintain an Angular project. The Angular CLI tool can be installed globally using <code>npm</code> by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -g @angular/cli@12.2.10
</code>   

<p>This package provides the global <code>ng</code> command. With this, open the terminal in a folder of your choice and create a new project by running the command below.</p>

   <code>ng new graphql-client --routing --style=css
</code>   

<p>This will create a folder <code>graphql-client</code>, install the Angular framework into it, set up all the necessary toolchains, and create a default application skeleton that you can extend.</p>

<p>The Apollo library offers a convenient GraphQL client. Navigate into the new project folder and add it to the project by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng add apollo-angular
</code>   

<p>When asked to confirm the installation of the library, answer with <code>y</code>. Next, you will be asked to provide the endpoint URI. Type in <code>http://localhost:4201/graphql</code> and press enter. Now that the basic setup is done, you are ready to create a few components.</p>

<p>Start by creating three components: a <code>Navbar</code> for the page navigation, <code>Home</code> for the home page, and <code>Browse</code>, containing a page to let you browse through the query results. In the terminal, run the following commands.</p>

   <code>ng generate component navbar --module=app
ng generate component home --module=app
ng generate component browse --module=app
</code>   

<p>In an editor of your choice, open <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> and replace its content with the following two lines.</p>

   <code>&lt;app-navbar&gt;&lt;/app-navbar&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</code>   

<p>There are only two components here. The first will show the navigation bar. The <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> is a special component in Angular. The Angular router is responsible for reading the navigation URL and deciding which component to show based on the requested path. The <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> will then show that component.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html</code> and paste the code below into the file.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="navbar"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    GraphQL Angular App
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a routerLink="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a routerLink="/browse"&gt;Browse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Notice the <code>routerLink</code> properties on the anchor tags. These links are similar to relative links inside regular HTML. But instead of reloading the page, they instruct the router to replace the active component in the <code>router-outlet</code>.</p>

<p>The navigation bar could use some styling. Open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.css</code> and fill in the CSS code below.</p>

   <code>.navbar {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  background-color: #333333;
  color: #ffffff;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

nav ul {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

nav li {
  margin-left: 8px;
  margin-right: 8px;
}

a {
  color: #ffffff;
  text-decoration: none;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, update the <code>Home</code> component by pasting the following line into <code>src/app/home/hone.component.html</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Consuming GraphQL with Angular&lt;/h1&gt;
</code>   

<p>To style the component, open <code>src/app/home/hone.component.css</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>h1 {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 4rem;
}
</code>   

<p>Before you can start work on the <code>Browse</code> component, you need a service class that encapsulates the calls to the GraphQL API. This class is the core part of this application and demonstrates just how easy it is to communicate with the server using GraphQL. Open the terminal in your project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate service characters
</code>   

<p>This will create a new file <code>src/app/characters.service.ts</code>. Open this file in your editor and replace its contents with the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Apollo, gql, QueryRef } from 'apollo-angular';

export interface Character {
  name: string;
  homeworld: string;
  species: string;
}

export interface CharacterDetail extends Character {
  height: number;
  mass: string;
  hair_color: string;
  skin_color: string;
  eye_color: string;
  birth_year: string;
  gender: string;
}

export interface CharactersResult {
  count: number;
  characters: Character[];
}

export interface Species {
  name: string;
  classification: string;
  designation: string;
  average_height: string;
  skin_colors: string;
  hair_colors: string;
  eye_colors: string;
  average_lifespan: string;
  language: string;
  homeworld: string;
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class CharactersService {

  private charactersQuery: QueryRef&lt;{characters: CharactersResult}, { offset: number}&gt;;
  private findCharacterQuery: QueryRef&lt;{character: CharacterDetail}, { name: string}&gt;;
  private findSpeciesQuery: QueryRef&lt;{species: Species}, { name: string}&gt;;

  constructor(private apollo: Apollo) { 
    this.charactersQuery = this.apollo.watchQuery({
      query: gql`query characters($offset: Int!) {
        characters(offset: $offset) {
          count
          characters {
            name
            homeworld
            species
          }
        }
      }`
    });

    this.findCharacterQuery = this.apollo.watchQuery({
      query: gql`query character($name: String!) {
        character(name: $name) {
          name
          height
          mass
          hair_color
          skin_color
          eye_color
          birth_year
          gender
          homeworld
          species
        }
      }`
    });

    this.findSpeciesQuery = this.apollo.watchQuery({
      query: gql`query species($name: String!) {
        species(name: $name) {
          name
          classification
          designation
          average_height
          skin_colors
          hair_colors
          eye_colors
          average_lifespan
          language
          homeworld
        }
      }`
    });
  }

  async getCharacters(offset: number): Promise&lt;CharactersResult&gt; {
    const result = await this.charactersQuery.refetch({ offset });
    return result.data.characters;
  }

  async findCharacter(name: string): Promise&lt;CharacterDetail&gt; {
    const result = await this.findCharacterQuery.refetch({ name });
    return result.data.character;
  }

  async findSpecies(name: string): Promise&lt;Species&gt; {
    const result = await this.findSpeciesQuery.refetch({ name });
    return result.data.species;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation of the service consists of three parts. At the top of the file, I declared the TypeScript types related to this service. Each type represents the result of a query. The second part is the constructor. Here, the Apollo queries are defined. The queries make use of the <code>gql</code> tag to template strings. This tag translates the strings to GraphQL documents. Finally, the member functions of the service make the queries publicly available to components in your application.</p>

<p>The queries are asynchronous and return promises that resolve the query result once a response from the server has been received.</p>

<p>With this, you can now implement the <code>Browse</code> component. Open <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.ts</code> and change its content to match the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Character, CharactersService } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-browse',
  templateUrl: './browse.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./browse.component.css']
})
export class BrowseComponent implements OnInit {
  offset: number = 0;
  count: number = 0;
  characters: Character[] = [];

  constructor(private charactersService: CharactersService) {}

  async ngOnInit(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }

  async updateCharacters() {
    const result = await this.charactersService.getCharacters(this.offset);
    this.count = result.count;
    this.characters = result.characters;
  }

  showPrevious() {
    return this.offset &gt; 0;
  }

  showNext() {
    return this.offset + 10 &lt; this.count;
  }

  async onPrevious() {
    this.offset -= 10;
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }

  async onNext() {
    this.offset += 10;
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The function <code>updateCharacters()</code> uses the <code>CharactersService</code> to obtain a list of characters from the server. The functions <code>onPrevious()</code> and <code>onNext()</code> are callbacks that can be used to page through the results. Now, open <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.html</code> and copy the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="browse"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Browse Characters&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Homeworld&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Species&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr *ngFor="let character of characters"&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a [routerLink]="['/character']" [queryParams]="{name: character.name}"&gt;{{character.name}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;{{character.homeworld}}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a [routerLink]="['/species']" [queryParams]="{name: character.species}"&gt;{{character.species}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;div class="pager"&gt;
    &lt;button class="prev" *ngIf="showPrevious()" (click)="onPrevious()"&gt; prev &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button class="next" *ngIf="showNext()" (click)="onNext()"&gt; next &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The component displays the character data in a table and provides navigation buttons to page through the results. It also provides links to routes that will display details of a character or its species. You will be implementing those routes later.</p>

<p>The CSS file <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.css</code> can be used to provide some styling to the browse component. Update the contents to the code below.</p>

   <code>.browse {
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.browse &gt; * {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 800px;
}

table {
  margin-top: 16px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  border: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
}

tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #dddddd;
}

th, td {
  padding: 4px 8px;
  border-right: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
  border-left: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
}

.prev {
  float: left;
}

.next {
  float: right;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, create the two components that will display the character and species details. Open the terminal again and type in the following commands.</p>

   <code>ng generate component character --module=app
ng generate component species --module=app
</code>   

<p>This will create the files for the two components. Open <code>src/app/character/character.component.ts</code> and paste the following code into it.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { CharacterDetail, CharactersService } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-character',
  templateUrl: './character.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./character.component.css']
})
export class CharacterComponent implements OnInit {
  character!: CharacterDetail;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, private characterService: CharactersService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(async (params) =&gt; {
      this.character = await this.characterService.findCharacter(params.name);
    });
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This is a simple component that reads the character’s name from the query parameters in the URL and then uses <code>CharactersService</code> to obtain the character detail. The corresponding template simply shows the queried data. Open <code>src/app/character/character.component.html</code> and copy the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div *ngIf=character&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.mass}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.hair_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.skin_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.eye_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth Year:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.birth_year}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.gender}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a [routerLink]="['/browse']"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>The component showing the species information follows the same pattern. Open <code>src/app/species/species.component.ts</code> and update the content to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { CharactersService, Species } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-species',
  templateUrl: './species.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./species.component.css']
})
export class SpeciesComponent implements OnInit {
  species!: Species;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, private characterService: CharactersService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(async (params) =&gt; {
      this.species = await this.characterService.findSpecies(params.name);
    });
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>src/app/species/species.component.html</code> and paste in the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;div *ngIf=species&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.classification}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designation:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.designation}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.hair_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.skin_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.eye_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Lifespan:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.average_lifespan}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.language}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeworld:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.homeworld}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a [routerLink]="['/browse']"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>I already mentioned how the Angular router is responsible for deciding which component to render, based on the path in the URL. In the file <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> you can define these associations.</p>

   <code>import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { BrowseComponent } from './browse/browse.component';
import { CharacterComponent } from './character/character.component';
import { SpeciesComponent } from './species/species.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'browse',
    component: BrowseComponent,
  },
  {
    path: 'character',
    component: CharacterComponent,
  },
  {
    path: 'species',
    component: SpeciesComponent,
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
</code>   

<p>You are now ready to test the application. Make sure your server is running as described in the previous section. Then open a terminal in the client Angular project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>ng serve
</code>   

<p>Open your browser, navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code> and you should see the homepage of your app. You can use the navigation bar to go to the browse page. You should see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Integrate OIDC for auth 

<p>Every good application needs some user control. Okta lets you add user authentication easily to your application.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You will need them in the next steps.</p>

 Add JWT authentication to the server 

<p>Adding authentication to the server is easy. Open a terminal in the server’s project folder and install a few more dependencies by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm i -E @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0 express-bearer-token@2.4.0
</code>   

<p>Now, create a new file <code>auth.js</code> with the content below.</p>

   <code>const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier');

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  issuer: '/oauth2/default'
});

module.exports = async function oktaAuth(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const token = req.token;
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).send('Not Authorized');
    }
    await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, 'api://default');
    next();
  }
  catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).send(err.message);
  }
};
</code>   

<p>This module exports an Express middleware that checks the bearer token of an incoming request and verifies its validity. To use this middleware, open <code>app.js</code> and add the following <code>require</code> statements to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>const bearerToken = require('express-bearer-token');
const oktaAuth = require('./auth');
</code>   

<p>Then, update the creation of the Express server with the declaration of the middleware to match the following.</p>

   <code>const app = express()
  .use(cors())
  .use(json())
  .use(bearerToken())
  .use(oktaAuth);
</code>   

<p>The <code>bearerToken</code> middleware extracts the bearer token from a request header. <code>oktaAuth</code> then checks the token. You can now run <code>node app.js</code> again to start the server. Only now, if you try to access the API you will get a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> error response from the server.</p>

 Add Okta to Angular 

<p>To allow the client to access the GraphQL API, you need to also add Okta authentication to the Angular application. Open a terminal in the client’s project folder and install the <code>okta-angular</code> dependency by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-angular@4.1.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.6.0
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> and create an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance by adding the following lines after the existing import statements.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const config = {
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
}
const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth(config);
</code>   

<p>Make sure to replace the <code>{...}</code> placeholders with your OIDC app settings.</p>

<p>Next, add <code>OktaAuthModule</code> to the array of <code>imports</code> in the <code>NgModule</code> configuration.</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>Also, create a new <code>providers</code> property that configures the module by pasting the code below after the <code>imports</code> array.</p>

   <code>providers: [{ provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth }}],
</code>   

<p>You now need to configure the router to accept the login callback from Okta. Open <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add the following import statement to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthGuard, OktaCallbackComponent } from '@okta/okta-angular';
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>routes</code> configuration object to match the code below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'browse',
    component: BrowseComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'character',
    component: CharacterComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'species',
    component: SpeciesComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'login/callback',
    component: OktaCallbackComponent
  },
];
</code>   

<p>Here you have added the <code>OktaAuthGuard</code> to the three routes that display character data. When a user who isn’t logged in attempts to access these routes, they will now automatically be redirected to the Okta sign-in page before gaining access.</p>

<p>In the last section, you added authentication to the server. This means that any access to the server now needs to provide an access token. To provide this token, open <code>src/app/graphql.module.ts</code> and replace the existing <code>createApollo</code> function with the implementation below.</p>

   <code>import { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const uri = 'http://localhost:4201/graphql'; 
export function createApollo(httpLink: HttpLink, oktaAuth: OktaAuth): ApolloClientOptions&lt;any&gt; {
  const http = httpLink.create({ uri });
  const auth = setContext(async (_, { headers }) =&gt; {
    const token = oktaAuth.getAccessToken();

    return token ? { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } } : {};
  });

  return {
    link: auth.concat(http),
    cache: new InMemoryCache()
  };
}
</code>   

<p>The function now expects an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance as the second argument. This means that you have to add it to the <code>deps</code> array in the <code>NgModule</code> provider for the Apollo options. Update the <code>deps</code> array to match the following.</p>

   <code>deps: [HttpLink, OktaAuth]
</code>   

<p>Finally, you want to provide feedback to the user’s sign-in status and also provide manual ways of logging in and out of the application. Open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.ts</code> and replace its contents with the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-navbar',
  templateUrl: './navbar.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./navbar.component.css']
})
export class NavbarComponent {
  
  constructor(public authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private oktaAuth: OktaAuth) {}

  async login() {
    await this.oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
  }

  async logout() {
    await this.oktaAuth.signOut();
  }

}
</code>   

<p>The <code>OktaAuthStateService</code> can be queried to provide the user’s status. The callbacks <code>login()</code> and <code>logout()</code> can be used to sign the user in and out. Now, open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html</code> and add the following lines as the first element inside the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.</p>

   <code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="!(authStateService.authState$ | async)?.isAuthenticated" (click)="login()"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(authStateService.authState$ | async)?.isAuthenticated" (click)="logout()"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>This will show a Login button if the user is not logged in and a Logout button if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have completed the implementation of an Angular app that consumes GraphQL from a Node/Express server. The application is secured with Okta’s authentication service. You can now start the app by running <code>ng serve</code> in your project folder. Make sure the server is also running as described above. Open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4200</code> to open the app. When you click on Browse in the navigation bar, you will be taken to the Okta sign-in page. Once you logged in, you will be redirected to the character browser. You should see something like the image below.</p>

 Learn more about Angular, GraphQL, and single-page applications 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a single-page application that consumes a GraphQL API using Angular. You’ve seen how to create a GraphQL schema that describes the queries and the results that the server supplies.</p>

<p>GraphQL provides a flexible way of implementing APIs that can be extended without breaking existing clients. Clients can specify the data they want to receive and can combine multiple requests into a single query. This makes GraphQL faster than traditional REST APIs because the number of API calls can be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The app you have written consists of a server and a client. The server uses Express to parse incoming requests before passing them to the GraphQL middleware. The client is built using Angular and uses the Apollo library to interface with the GraphQL API. If you want to learn more about GraphQL, Angular, or single-page apps in general, feel free to follow the links below.</p>

  <p>In the era when data has replaced oil as the most valuable commodity, APIs have become an important logistical foundation of modern digital business. As a result, APIs have also become a popular target for cyber attackers, and therefore effective API security is essential. However, focusing only on the operational aspects is no longer enough.</p>
<p>Security teams typically struggle to keep up with the increasing volume and scale of APIs, and traditional security and API management solutions do not address all API security challenges. A new approach is needed, according to Alexei Balaganski, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole and Isabelle Mauny, co-founder and field CTO of 42Crunch.</p>
<p>Join these experts as they discuss the benefits of an integrated, continuous, and proactive approach to API security that combines proactive application security measures with continuous activity monitoring, API-specific threat analysis, and runtime policy enforcement.</p>
<p>Alexei Balaganski explains how the security and compliance risks that APIs are exposed to are shaping the future of API security solutions and provides an overview of the latest innovations in protecting the whole API lifecycle.</p>
<p>Isabelle Mauny shows how a continuous API security model can be achieved and shares a recent case study from a global manufacturer, with an overview of the 42Crunch Developer-First API Security Platform.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/continuous-api-security-protecting-digital-business"></a>

			 Eloi Garrido is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Eloi Garrido. I graduated as an electronics engineer with a master’s degree in embedded systems from Delft University of Technology (NL) and right away moved into programming. I lived in the Netherlands for several years, where I met my partner, and after several attempts I managed to convince her to come to the sunny south. Since my early years, I’ve been interested in technology and tinkering with anything that has a spark. Still, to this day, my parents blame me for any appliance that has stopped working at home.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Since early 2017 I ended up falling into the crypto rabbit hole and preaching to my friends about it. However, at that point it was mostly a hobby and a bit of an obsession, but still something that at the time didn’t cross my mind could become a profession.</p>
<p>Soon after returning from the Netherlands to Barcelona, I started looking for my next professional adventure and landed at Tokeny, and it felt like the planets aligned, the rest is history.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny has been a pleasure, very welcoming since day one and surrounded by very talented and engaged people. The team has always been flexible and adaptable, even in the face of our current world situation, allowing me to grow and partake in interesting projects.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I’m a sucker for anything tech related. When I’m not checking the latest toys, I like to gather around friends and family for some relaxing long meals or gaming sessions.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>From a personal point of view, I dream about having a comfortable and joyful life with my loved ones without any complications. On a global scale, I would love for all of us to stop fighting inwards over every detail and work together towards our general betterment, what couldn’t we achieve then?</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>A bit of a generic statement, but I would love to see hate disappear, or at least mostly reduced. So that people would focus more on what makes us similar than what differentiates us, all this would leave us with more time to enjoy life instead of wasting it in squabbles.</p>

<p>The Zero Trust model is the belief that no one should be trusted from inside or outside your network, until their identity has been verified. Zero trust refers to the alignment of maturing identity practices, an established understanding of user behaviors, and the application of least-privilege access security policy decisions to trust boundaries. In this week's State of Identity, host, Cameron D’Ambrosi debunks the buzz around zero trust architecture with Ryan Case, Chief Cybersecurity Architect at SailPoint. They provide first-hand guidance on identity-defined security architecture and how it enriches authorization with both contextual and intelligent access information to make objective decisions. In this session, you'll learn how to reduce friction to end-users while enabling deliberate identity verification and policy decisions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Thomas Tschersich, Chief Security Officer at Deutsche Telekom, served as an advisor in the preparation for the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4864">Cyber Council Panel on Cybersecurity Predictions 2022</a> which will see CISOs, CIOs, and CSOs discuss next year's cybersecurity threatscape on Wednesday, November 10 from 09:30 pm to 10:10 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Thomas some questions about his predictions.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into the “Cybersecurity Trends 2022”? 
<p>Yeah, actually, well, when I look at the recent developments, I believe that DDoS attacks will be definitely an ongoing trend next year as well. So we see a couple of thousand attacks every month. And the second thing which will drive us will be, in my prediction, the ransomware topic, as this is still growing. We might see some new deep fakes. So cases with CEO fraud, with really deep faked videos instead of just cheating email conversations or phone calls. But that's in a nutshell what I do expect.</p>
 Which three Cybersecurity types of attacks do you expect being most threatening to your organization and why in 2022? 
<p>So I have no special type of attack in mind here. I would turn that a little around. So what I do expect most threatening not only for us but for all organizations, is still that we don't have the basics under control. What do I mean by that? Not having the basics under control is, for me, not more and less than cleaning up our infrastructures by introducing software updates really in a timely manner to the new detection of vulnerabilities. So we're all not good in doing so. And the result is that more than 95 percent of the attacks are being successful just because of missing software updates or bad configurations of systems.</p>
<p>This should keep us awake at night and this should be the priority number one, two, and three for next year, really to get it fixed. And so we need to bundle our forces so we need a better exchange between enterprises to share whether an update is working or not. So not to do testing in any case at any company so we can become better just by sharing that knowledge. But we also need better support from vendors. There are still a lot of also huge vendors existing which are not really open and honest about their vulnerabilities and which are not really supporting their clients on a daily basis.</p>
 Which three Cybersecurity topics are most important to you and why in 2022? 
<p>Look, as the whole industry is now moving more and more into cloud services, the perimeter of the company is paralyzing itself. So there is no perimeter to protect any longer, actually no perimeter like in the past. So there's not the one and only perimeter. So, therefore, I believe concepts like Zero Trust becoming increasingly important to bundle the security more to the endpoint and on the other side, to the data itself and not any longer to the corporate network infrastructure. So this is for me, one definite trend we have.</p>
<p>The second thing which is closely aligned with that is that prevention only is not sufficient enough for the future. It's more about having capabilities to monitor the status, to monitor your infrastructure, and then to be able to react fast if there are some anomalies being detected there. Yeah, this is the biggest challenge for most of the organizations, as a lot of organizations were pretty much focused on shielding themselves, building a fence around their infrastructure. And that's more or less one hundred percent of the cyber protection. And nowadays, you have to assume that attackers will be successful at one point in time, and therefore, you need to have these better monitoring capabilities without for sure losing the preventive approach totally. So but it's shifting the forces, and that's definitely one of the priorities for me and my team.</p>
 What are your three biggest challenges in implementing Cybersecurity and why? 
<p>I would say the challenge, number one, is the shortage of resources, of skilled resources, at the market and it's the challenge number two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and ten, and so on. That's the biggest issue currently, really to find the right people for your team to find the right resources to deal with security as the market is demanding so much at the moment. It is totally empty. So we're investing a lot in training and education for our people to train them by ourselves. So that's the only way out at the moment. And yeah, I guess this is what we need to solve. Otherwise, we got lost in the cybersecurity arena. It's not that much a technical issue because there are a lot of technical solutions available and in place. It's more the people to run those infrastructures.</p>

 A look into how we’re ensuring compliance without removing the “De” from&nbsp;DeFi. <p>Decentralized finance is the new frontier of investment and value propagation on the internet. It offers a new, innovative method for investing in assets. It removes the hassle of going through regulated channels and submitting many documents for verification of personal data. On the surface, this seems like an ideal solution for many people since it gives them a way to invest and keep their assets and earnings anonymous to those it doesn’t concern. It also introduces an added element of security for many individuals since they are in complete control of their finances.</p><p>Unfortunately, DeFi also opens up a nest of issues, including users bypassing Anti Money-laundering (AML) laws and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines. Given the decentralized nature of the sector, however, how can compliance even be implemented? Compliant DeFi, something we’re proud to be pioneering at Shyft Network, would deal with these issues and other regulatory elements such as Know Your Customer (KYC) rules without forcing users and companies to conform to a centralized data store. Recent regulatory constraints such as the FATF Travel Rule and stipulations in the Infrastructure Bill mean that DeFi needs to start taking compliance seriously.</p> Not As Counter-Intuitive As It First&nbsp;Seems <p>Compliance in the financial sector helps to bring confidence to the consumer, financial institutions, and regulators. Unfortunately, the side effect of this added consumer confidence is the financial institution’s storage of personal user data, shared at will with governments. Since there’s no decentralized methodology for collecting and storing information in decentralized finance, implementations of KYC, CFT, and AML rules must become more innovative. Luckily, Shyft has been looking into the problem, and we’ve developed several solutions that fit the needs of decentralized finance platforms the world&nbsp;over.</p><p>The biggest issue we’ve seen with compliance is that it tries to impede the very soul of decentralization. Regulators are afraid that decentralized applications (DApps) don’t have a central body responsible for their function. The FATF Travel Rule (among others) underlines the reasoning behind regulators’ insistence on establishing a compliance framework for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In essence, the most significant concern regulators have boils down to accountability. If someone does something illegal within the realm of DeFi, who is responsible for the fallout? Is it the decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO’s) members? Is it the DApp that facilitated the illegal action or collected the proceeds on behalf of the perpetrators? Is it the stakeholders of the blockchain where the illegal proceeds were stored? There exists a need for this sort of accountability in the cryptoverse, but the implementation cannot go against the core foundation of why decentralized finance exists. We cannot create a decentralized platform and then centralize its data for compliance purposes. The solution, therefore, is to find a way to decentralize this data collection and verification process.</p> A Way&nbsp;Forward <p>Shyft Network has spent a considerable amount of time assessing, analyzing and researching these challenges, developing a solution that works well with current compliance regulation, and marrying it to an approach that maintains the spirit of decentralization. The solutions we are developing examine the existing framework of decentralization and use those as a base for creating a network that exists in harmony with current implementations. The Shyft Network doesn’t force any users to make fundamental changes to how their underlying systems work. Instead, it’s a modular implementation that allows for secure financial transactions with minimal risk to users. Solutions we’ve developed to deal with the compliance problem in DeFi&nbsp;include:</p>  Veriscope GDPR/AML Compliant Discovery Mechanism: Veriscope is one of Shyft Network’s most recent innovations to offer Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) like crypto exchanges a way to deal with the FATF Travel Rule and reach compliance. Veriscope is a decentralized solution (in holding with Shyft’s focus on keeping the decentralization in DeFi) that helps VASPs deal with the regulatory requirements instituted by authorities.  Proof of Identity and Whitelisted Addresses: The Shyft Network can work with both centralized and decentralized entities to bring about equality in verifying user information. DeFi participants can submit their data to a verifying oracle which will be used to safelist their address for transactions. Once the address has been whitelisted and linked with the user’s identification, they can participate in DeFi transactions freely. Recently, Shyft Network <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-kylin-network-to-deploy-data-oracles-for-compliant-defi-infrastructure-fcc2c7c3a233">partnered with Kylin</a> to develop these decentralized oracles in keeping with their goal to provide a safe, secure way for financial institutions to interact with the DeFi&nbsp;space.  Risk Assessment Mechanisms for DeFi Projects: To ensure that bad actors don’t abuse the system or take advantage of users, wallet transactions with smart contracts will be continually monitored for signs of untoward behavior. DeFi platforms that want to know more about their users can easily access this information to ensure that they have a more trustworthy network.   Expanding Markets Mean More Compliance is Necessary <p>DeFi is a space that will see exponential growth in the coming years. Early adopters already have their hands full, trying to keep abreast of the burgeoning growth and development of decentralized applications. However, as the popularity of DeFi grows, the threat of regulation will always linger, and facing it head on is the best way to deal with it. Compliance allows decentralized platforms to stay one step ahead of regulators, giving users the peace of mind they want. Shyft Network will be continuing to lead this charge to create proactive, innovative compliance in its network. Stay tuned to find out&nbsp;more!</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/dYp9t44D">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t)</a></blockquote>

<p>This quote from Tech Crunch commentor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/with-liberty-and-privacy-for-some-widening-inequality-on-the-digital-frontier/">Cillian Kieran</a>&nbsp;caught our eye: “Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.”</p>



<p>The quote comes from an&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/with-liberty-and-privacy-for-some-widening-inequality-on-the-digital-frontier/">article</a>&nbsp;on “widening inequality on the digital frontier” which poses valuable questions about whether we now need “a material perspective on widening privacy disparities — and their implication in broader social inequality — to catalyze the privacy improvements the U.S. desperately needs.” Kieran raises the material argument since, he says, the law doesn’t always recognize the emotional perspective of privacy as harm or as a driver for regulatory change.</p>



<p>Kieran makes two great points: First, almost all users in the US (except those who live in California under the CCPA) have no rights to opt-out of aggressive data collection and targeted advertising. But the fact that Californians&nbsp;can&nbsp;opt out implies there are harms from targeted advertising, which we know to be true and have discussed&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/06/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">here</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/digital-advertising-may-present-national-security-risks-us-senators/">here</a>. So why aren’t we protecting the millions of users who live anywhere other than California from these harms?</p>



<p>Kieran cites the example of targeted advertising leading to discrimination in<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-targeted-ads-and-dynamic-pricing-can-perpetuate-bias">&nbsp;housing and employment opportunities</a>, “sometimes in violation of federal law” where it “impedes individuals’ autonomy, preemptively narrowing their window of purchasing options, even when they don’t want to.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, Kieran points out&nbsp;money talks, including in digital privacy protection. He points to Apple making noises about privacy being a human right all while building and marketing luxury products only some can afford.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He argues: “… if those declaring privacy as a human right only make products affordable to some, what does that say about our human rights? Apple products skew toward<a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Infographics/iPhone-Users-Earn-Higher-Income-Engage-More-on-Apps-than-Android-Users">&nbsp;wealthier, more educated consumers</a>&nbsp;compared to competitors’ products. This projects a troubling future of increasingly exacerbated privacy disparities between the haves and the have-nots, where a feedback loop is established: Those with fewer resources to acquire privacy protections may have fewer resources to navigate the technical and legal challenges that come with a practice as convoluted as targeted advertising.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We deserve meaningful privacy protections that everyone can afford. In fact, to turn the phrase on its head,&nbsp;we deserve meaningful privacy protections that no company can afford to omit from their products.&nbsp;We deserve a both/and approach: privacy that is both meaningful and widely available.”</p>



<p>Kieran says the only way to close the disparity gap and get meaningful protections is via privacy legislation and privacy tools. Lawmakers must set the standards and engineers must have no reason not to embed user data privacy controls in products they develop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He says: “We need privacy rules set by an institution that is not itself playing the game. Regulation alone cannot save us from modern privacy perils, but it is a vital ingredient in any viable solution.”</p>



<p>Which brings us back to where we started:</p>



<p>“Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.”</p>

We held our new <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1447849522604883969?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Astro, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He introduced the research report “<a href="https://messari.io/article/ontology-layer-1-trust-network-for-decentralized-identity-and-data?utm_source=messaricrypto&amp;utm_medium=tweet&amp;utm_campaign=ontology-trust-network-data">Ontology: Layer 1 Trust Network for Decentralized Identity and Data</a>”, written by Messari Hub Analysts, and answered questions from members of the community.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, introduced her work experience at Ontology in the article “Women in Fintech: Greatest Achievements with Goodbox, Pensionbee, TomoCredit, Ontology and LXME”, published in <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/women-in-fintech-greatest-achievements-with-goodbox-pensionbee-tomocredit-ontology-and-lxme/">The Fintech Times</a>, a leading financial technology newspaper. She said blockchain and crypto are founded on egalitarian principles and she is very glad to be representing women in a more male-dominated industry.  Ontology published #EVM 101 series articles “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/what-are-ethereum-virtual-machines-and-why-should-you-care-930a739171a9">What Are Ethereum Virtual Machines and Why Should You Care?</a>” on Twitter, introducing the features and advantages of Ontology EVM: Increasing interoperability between Ontology and Ethereum; developers will be able to seamlessly migrate assets between both blockchains. Allowing users to access EVM-based projects deployed on Ontology, whilst enjoying lower gas fees and faster block production.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Messari — <a href="https://messari.io/article/ontology-layer-1-trust-network-for-decentralized-identity-and-data?utm_source=messaricrypto&amp;utm_medium=tweet&amp;utm_campaign=ontology-trust-network-data">Ontology: Layer 1 Trust Network for Decentralized Identity and&nbsp;Data</a></p><blockquote>Trust has been the centerpiece of commerce, community, and happiness. In the course of human history, trust has changed its meaning from a person’s word to a bill of exchange, to a legal document and, most recently, in the 21st century, to technology. In the last decade, blockchain has created “trustless” systems where individuals do not need to trust anyone except software to verify transactions. Blockchain brought not only trust to the masses through shared access of decentralized information but has also fundamentally changed the future of trust ecosystems.</blockquote><p>Ontology, with its MainNet launch in June 2018, is building infrastructure for a peer-to-peer trust network with a decentralized identity framework that allows users to have full control over their data for real-world use cases. While traditional economies rely on third party service providers to facilitate trust, Ontology enables decentralized trust that aims to integrate the blockchain and different business sectors through partnerships to provide distributed services including distributed communities, data verification, data exchange, and credit across industries.</p><p>Cointelegraph — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/likes-out-facebook-blackout-sparks-ideas-for-web-3-0">Likes out: Facebook blackout sparks ideas for Web&nbsp;3.0</a></p><blockquote>Over the past few years, the influx of moral concerns surrounding privacy breaches, data gathering, censorship and fake news has fuelled the conversion for a renovation of the social media platforms that have come to dominate our democracy. The prevalence and severity of such issues have even begun to deter conscious users away from centralized behemoths like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, in favor of more liberating alternatives. The rapid emergence of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, specifically its native features of decentralization, transparency and community reward, has empowered the rise of these next-generation initiatives.</blockquote><p>Going forward, a move toward decentralized identity solutions is essential to ensure data privacy and security. By facilitating end-to-end technology run on blockchain, decentralized solutions enable private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. In contrast to centralized solutions, decentralized systems ensure private data remains immutable and secure and is only able to be shared when users consent to provide information.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

   In the late 1990s, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were the forerunners of Managed Security Service Providers (MSSP). Some ISPs began supplying firewall equipment to their customers at that time, and if the customer desired, the ISP would also manage the firewall.

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">our last blog</a> we talked about diverse, practical ways in which we help people and organisations use personal data to get stuff done — to enrich peoples’ lives and improve service quality in a way that cuts friction, effort, risk and cost for both&nbsp;sides.</p><p>The tools and capabilities we discuss in that blog are great. But to be truly valuable, they also need to be robust and ethical. They need to be based on sound design principles.</p><p>Below are some of the design principles that underpin our infrastructure and services — principles designed to ensure that what we do truly does serve citizens, today and into the&nbsp;future.</p>  Safe, efficient data logistics Our personal data stores (PDSs) use APIs to enable safe efficient data sharing between individuals and organisations. Organisations can deposit data in an individual’s PDS, and individuals can share data with these organisations. Our PDSs don’t only provide safe storage facilities. They also provide safe, efficient data sharing capabilities which keep the individual in control. We call this ‘personal data logistics’.  Individual the point of integration Our personal data stores enable individuals to aggregate data about themselves that is currently dispersed across many different service providers. For example, most UK citizens have over a dozen relationships with different financial service providers: one or more banks and building societies, loan providers, mortgage providers, savings providers, investment services, pensions, insurances and so&nbsp;on.  <p>It’s only by aggregating data from all these service providers (and by adding additional information that only the individual knows) that it’s possible to gain a true, fully-rounded picture of an individual’s financial circumstances, and therefore to be able to give truly personalised, relevant advice. That is why we applied for and got an Open Banking&nbsp;licence.</p><p>Our infrastructure is designed to enable the provision of such genuinely personalised advice across every walk of life: money, health, career,&nbsp;etc.</p>  An asset for life By enabling individuals to aggregate data (including <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">verified attributes</a>) about themselves in their own personal data store, we provide them with an asset for life: an asset that grows in value over time as more data is added to&nbsp;it.  Seek win-wins Many data relationships are adversarial, where one side seeks to extract value from another. We seek to enable mutually beneficial, productive relationships between citizens and bona fide service providers. For example, as the data in an individual’s personal data store grows in richness and value, citizens can bring this data with them to relationships with service providers, helping both sides access and use the data they need for better services at lower&nbsp;cost.  Neutral In line with the above, our platform is not designed to help one organisation gain competitive advantage over another. It is designed to enable all sides to improve the way they operate, by helping everyone involved reduce friction, effort, risk and cost for example. So our charging structure doesn’t favour one organisation over another and it doesn’t incentivise us to try and make money out of individuals’ data either. (For example, if we charged a fee per data transaction, our revenues would grow with the volume of data sharing and that could incentivise us to pressurise individuals into sharing more data than they want to. So we&nbsp;don’t.)  Truly independent Our personal data stores are truly independent and under the control of the individual. They do not sit inside any data-holding service provider’s organisational boundaries and do not depend on any service provider’s systems and technologies. Individuals don’t have to use any organisation’s identity processes to access their data. Organisations which deposit copies of an individual’s data in that individual’s personal data store cannot tell the individual what they should or shouldn’t do with it, or who they can or can’t share it&nbsp;with.  <p>This is important because the more fashionable personal data stores become, the more people there are out there pretending to offer personal data stores but where, if you look a little more closely, it actually continues the organisation’s control of individuals’ data (by doing one or more of the&nbsp;above).</p>  Safety and security Each individual’s personal data store is separately and individually encrypted. This means our infrastructure is distributed, not centralised — so that it is designed to be the opposite of a honeypot for hackers. (If a hacker wants to access the records of millions of people in a centralised corporate database, they only need to succeed in one hack. For a hacker to access the records of a million people on our infrastructure, they would have to succeed at a million separate, different hacks, each time accessing the data of only one individual. That makes the hacker’s incentives a million times a million less attractive (a million times harder, for a millionth of the&nbsp;reward).  No knowledge Each individual holds their own encryption key to their PDS, which we don’t have. We have designed our systems so that they do not look at an individuals’ personal data or who is delivering it or requesting it. We have provided the tools needed for the individual to be in control and able to see who is using their data for what purpose and approve such uses. We cannot see and don’t want to see their data. As a Community Interest Company we want to help people, not exploit them or intrude upon&nbsp;them.  Interoperable There is no point in doing all the above good things if the end result is to trap people inside a system that they can’t get out of. People have to have choices; genuine alternatives. Competition over who can provide the best genuine data empowerment can only be a good thing. For this reason, we expect many personal data store providers to emerge, and we are fully committed to enabling users to transfer their data from our systems to other systems and vice versa. We believe in interoperability.  Commercial integrity Our business model is designed to support all the above principles. We are a Community Interest Company. Yes, we are commercial — to fulfil our mission we have to cover our costs. But we are not in this to maximise the profits we can make, but to maximise the benefits citizens can get from their data. So we don’t charge individuals for having a PDS. Instead, organisations pay us for enabling safe, efficient data sharing relationships with customers.   Summary <p>As the concept of personal data stores grows more fashionable, we’ve got no doubt that clever people will invent many exciting new tools that do wonderful things. That’s great. It’s how it should&nbsp;be.</p><p>But for such creativity to really deliver value, it must be built on solid foundations. We believe design principles like the ones listed above provide the foundations our society needs to put personal data on a new, trustworthy footing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">DESIGNED FOR INTEGRITY</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining today. After some time we are having a guest from the house, from Ubisecure, and he is a guest who has been in Ubisecure for 12 years. So let me introduce to you, Keith Uber.</p>
<p>He is the VP Customer Success at Ubisecure. As an identity and access management product expert, he leads the Sales Engineering team and is involved in many stages in the planning and design of demanding customer implementation projects. Keith is active in various industry organisations, and has a keen interest particularly in government mandated digital identity systems. Having been involved in dozens of IAM implementation projects, he is quick to identify organisation’s needs, and provide suitable configuration, integration and roadmap guidance.</p>
<p>Hello Keith and welcome.</p>
<p>Keith Uber: Hello, Oscar. And thank you very much for having me. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is really great talking with you. You had really long experience in Ubisecure and in the industry so have super interesting things to tell us. We will talk about mergers and acquisitions today. But before that, we’d like to hear a bit more about yourself, so please tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Keith: For me, digital identity became part of my career when I moved to Finland in 2000. So this was the height of the .com boom. I got a job working for Sonera, which is now Telia, one of the largest Telco operators in the Nordic countries. As part of that role, one of my jobs was to help Telia to combine the login systems for various small start-up companies, various small projects that they had acquired during the .com phase. They acted as a kind of a technology incubator for many small companies too so they had a huge portfolio of disparate services, all with different ways to sign in and authenticate. That’s where my journey started.</p>
<p>So I have a background as a software engineer. I have a Bachelor of IT and previously worked in logistics field as a software developer. But after moving to Finland, I later studied software business then continued after graduation joined Ubisecure and I’ve been working with identity and access management, particularly customer identity and access management ever since then. So in various roles I have been involved in so many different customer projects, not only individual customers, but also entire industries or government services that are going online. So I’ve been really fortunate to have a wide range of experience in quite a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very interesting. Sounds to be your first contact with digital identity there in Sonera – was the previous name for what is Telia today. So you mentioned several small companies that they had these challenges of authentication, login, registration, this kind of stuff. I’m guessing, we talk about 2000 is that there were not standards like we had today about digital access management. So well, I can imagine challenging has been that time, today, still challenging, but we have standards, and that is great.</p>
<p>But also that comes to the topic of today, right? So company can acquire smaller organisations. And one of the challenges is, for instance, if a company – let’s move from Telco to, let’s say e-commerce – can be a big e-commerce place acquires a smaller one, another e-commerce place, and what the customers would, by knowing that if they read that on the news, they will expect that “OK, and now I can log in from one place to another automatically, right?” That’s what the customer would expect. I think that’s one of the challenges I guess you are going to tell us more. But in your opinion, why is identity an important topic when it comes to mergers and acquisitions?</p>
<p>Keith: I think the most important part of mergers and acquisitions is that the customer is the value of the company. They’re the consumer who is buying the services or the people interacting with the company. So in a merger or acquisition or divestiture, when a company splits into two, it’s important that you retain those customers, that you don’t by mismanagement or mistake accidentally isolate your customers, make it difficult for them to sign in, or make it difficult for them to start to enjoy the services of the company that you’re also acquiring. So that’s all about keeping that valuable asset, keeping the customer happy.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree because it might be that you, as a customer, one can be super happy with a service, with a company. And after that, after the merger/acquisitions, well, things don’t work so smooth anymore for the customer, right? And that can make as you said, have the customers unhappy.</p>
<p>Keith: In most cases, mergers are all about acquiring some type of complementary company or company that offers a service that is enjoyable for the current user population. So it’s all about allowing them to start to consume more and more services so you get more revenue for every customer.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now if you put the shoes of company that knows that they are going to be merged or there is acquisition already in place and start to plan how we are going to merge the systems, et cetera. What are these, for you, are the top, the key identity considerations that this organisation has to go through?</p>
<p>Keith: You spoke about the importance of standards and how the industry has really standardised on some key identity standards. So for companies who are looking to grow through either being acquired or acquiring other companies, it’s important that they have their identity management under control. They’re using standardised systems, they’re using the same standards that other services use, that makes the migration and integration process much, much easier.</p>
<p>And part of that underlying is all about data quality. So making sure that you’re keeping your user information, your user database, not only secure but up to date that it’s full of verified and valued information that could be easily used to match accounts as you go through that merging process.</p>
<p>Another really important thing is to really plan carefully about how that merger will look from the end user perspective, what will they retain, which account will they retain, will become their core account, or will you allow the customers to sign in using both types of credentials that they already have? And then what’s the timeline, for example sunsetting the unused or the system that will be turned off.</p>
<p>Generally, in terms of mergers and acquisitions, you want to simplify the IT systems by merging them and then sunsetting or turning off the system that you don’t choose to continue with. And that’s all about reducing the overall costs for not only licensing of the system, but also uptake and management of the system and simplifying the IT architecture to reduce, for example, simple things like customer support, when somebody has trouble logging in, or resetting a password, or enabling a new authentication method that is common across the whole organisation.</p>
<p>There’s a slight risk there that by combining multiple systems, even two or three into one, you’re also putting your eggs into one basket so there’s of course a risk of having a single point of failure. But on the flip side, you have more people, more IT resources looking at one system, focusing on one system and having expertise in that one system and keeping that up-to-date and smoothly running. And all modern identity and access management systems are fully reliable at scale in that type of scenario.</p>
<p>Oscar: And I guess also, one point is we’ve been talking mostly about customers, but about the workforce, about the employees I think they are also important considerations.</p>
<p>Keith: Oh, absolutely. The backend staff, who need to access these systems, and as the internal employees also merge, you want to make that as smooth as possible so that the company that’s being required, they also feel like fully-fledged employees, as soon as we can.</p>
<p>During this mergers and acquisitions process, often the process is followed very, very closely, especially for publicly listed companies, and you want to try to achieve merging both IT systems as quick as you can, so that you can show that the corporate acquisition has been a success on both the technical level and on a sales level. So in terms of planning for an IT organisation, it’s important to start that planning very early in the process and getting ready and planted well, so you can do that quickly and efficiently, and move to that new common platform as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think you mentioned the fact that the system has to be consolidated, you know that that’s the biggest part of these projects of identity and access management, in cases of mergers and acquisitions. So to start seeing, what are the drawbacks and the benefits of consolidating these systems?</p>
<p>Keith: The benefits I would hope would be improved information security, probably moving away from an older legacy style identity access management system to a newer one. You bring with that new functionality, which might simplify the IT architecture. So for example, rather than having custom registration processes or custom tools for user management, you might move to out of the box solutions where those facilities are provided as a standard part of the package. In many cases, you might combine the move with a move from on-premises to cloud. Most companies are moving towards the cloud, if they have that on their corporate strategy for IT then they can make that change either at the same time or prepare to do that shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The risks, as you say, is a very simple thing can be if, for example, consumer facing services, a lot of users are already logged in to devices, or they’re already logged in with their browser and different password managers, different browsers and applications remember the user in different ways. And if you start to upset the flow of how those passwords are remembered and presented to applications, you can very easily sort of lock your users out. For a wider consumer population, the sheer frustration of having to remember their password or go through a password reset process can be a big difference, it’s a difference between giving up and downloading the next app of your competitor, so it requires a bit of careful planning to make that flow as smooth as you can.</p>
<p>Typically in that system, you’d allow the users who are migrating off the old system to sign in ones using the old system. Ideally, you would be able to migrate any existing password hashes from the old system to the new system, or have a very smooth onboarding flow to allow them to either set a new secure password or log in using a strong authentication method, either government or banking ID used by users in that region, or some other existing strong authentication method that the user already has.</p>
<p>Oscar: That remembers me some cases of being involved in which the passwords have been hashed, has to be of course, but long time ago, and when there were less agreed standards about that, and that can be tricky if the system that is- the new system that is importing this hash passwords is not compatible with the old system. So that can create, of course, can create problems, so that’s why standards is- fulfilling the current standards, and of course, also having some backward compatibility. It’s super important into this.</p>
<p>Keith: There are really simple benefits, for example, in many older legacy systems, the username is based around either a randomly generated number or letter combination, or it’s provided by the user themselves. And for many end users, it’s a challenge to even remember what their username is.</p>
<p>In the extreme situations, we see corporate systems, for example, B2B systems where the customer needs to put in not only the customer number, but they also put in a user ID as well as a password. To migrate to a system where you maybe simplify that more like consumer facing services where you could either centralise around using your email address as your identifier, which is much, much easier to remember. Or allow the user to link their account to an existing account, such as a social media account, or LinkedIn, or other Microsoft account, for example, to allow the users to sort of move away from having a proprietary username format, and move on to having, for example, a corporate email address or their personal email address as their account identifier.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and now moving to how to make this consolidation in a good way, how to have success in this CIAM consolidation, what are the – what’s a good approach? Could you tell us the main points about that?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, I touched earlier the importance of data quality. So to make sure that the data is clean before you start to do any type of migration, it’s really important to understand what data in each system is and how it’s validated and make sure that those formats are valid in the new system. There’s a very clear decision point of to which system you’re going to migrate, which system will be the ongoing system in the future. So typically, that would be one of the two existing systems, to the more modern of the two, to the one which is with the more capabilities and more features, longer lifecycle.</p>
<p>But it may be that you choose a third system, a new system to replace both and migrate those systems to the new. And that provider, for example, jump forward, for example, to support newer scenarios, such as not only different types of strong authentication techniques, or identity protocols, but also things like identity delegation, or electronic power of attorney, these types of services, which existing legacy systems might not support out of the box.</p>
<p>From the end user perspective, so whether they’re B2B users or consumer users, it’s really important to have very clear communications that, OK, the company has been acquired, the name is possibly changing, the brand is changing. Please be aware of this from the very beginning. And then very clear communication about when things change in the IT system. So allow the users to be aware that when they log in their login screen might change, might look different. They might have to set a new password or re-verify their email address, for example. It’s really important to have that communication in as clear user focused language as possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Keith: A lot of IT teams make the mistake of using the language that they understand and not the language that their user understands.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I have seen actually some examples like that. I don’t remember the names, but sometimes come one email saying “OK, we are having this transition to a new brand.” And it looks so simple that “OK, yeah, nice.” And other times it’s completely techie jargon, then “Oh, my God, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Keith: That’s right, yeah. Then you have to decide whether to move everything in one go. So have a certain date where you migrate everything in one go, do a big bang approach. Or you’re migrating applications, sort of one by one or user groups one by one. Some of that can be done, for example, as the user logs in, you can migrate users on a user-by-user basis. Or it kind of depends how much the applications are shared across the different companies; how many users use applications from both of the companies involved in the merger.</p>
<p>Oscar: So those are the main points for consolidation of identity and access management systems.</p>
<p>Keith: From a technical perspective, it’s important to try to identify if there’s a common attribute between those two systems. So if you have a trusted attribute from each of the user repositories, for example, an email address that has been verified or a phone number that has been verified, even identity number, social security number or national identity number. These can be used as common attributes to allow automated migration of users so that they can log in automatically. In cases where, for example, password hashes can be migrated, or where the user is signing in using a government or national ID platform.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And in terms of compliance, normally, what are the compliance points that are relevant in this type of projects?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, so particularly, it’s around collecting consent where required from the user about other data is going to be, maybe data controller will be processed or will be changed during that process. So using again your IAM tools to collect that as the user signs in again, explaining that and communicating any changes to the terms and conditions. In cases where the system is in different geographical areas or different legal jurisdictions, there may be requirements, for example, for storage of user data within certain countries’ boundaries. So you may have to replicate data or have data stored within a region, you have to think carefully about those situations, especially in global or cross regional mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, certainly. And we’ve already touched in several aspects beyond the technical, the technical side, of course. We talk about standards, we talk about security, but we also talk about compliance for instance. And we talk about branding and how to communicate these things. Many people are definitely involved in all these projects that are connected to the migration of identity and access management. But this is way beyond what identity people work on that. So if you can close telling us what is your ending piece of advice, advice for companies that are today planning on mergers and acquisition?</p>
<p>Keith: I’d say definitely take advantage of the opportunities that moving to a new identity and access management system can provide for customers. So for example, if you haven’t been able to take advantage of things like linking accounts to existing user accounts, allowing users to have federation – meaning that when they’re signed into your system, they can also sign into complementary services, giving the users new tools around managing their own account, having a really good user dashboard and a way to agree or modify their permissions for the system.</p>
<p>I think beyond just the roar savings in turning off one system, or reducing the support costs for having to deal with multiple different systems, there’s real advantages in moving to one common system that has the new corporate brand, is smooth and secure for the end user, and gives them also new functionality.</p>
<p>They see that, “OK, it’s the advantage is I get to sign in. But oh, I also get this new thing. I also get a more secure account or easy way to sign in.” I think that’s something to use as an advantage in that. Also, a real big move and a real good opportunity is to think about at that stage moving to the cloud, if you’ve been hesitating about moving your identity and access management system to a cloud-based service, it can be a good time to do that during a merger and acquisition.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. And as one of these last things you are talking about and – is one of the first things you talk about today is a customer, taking the opportunity to bring a better experience to the customers.</p>
<p>Keith: The way you sign in is often the front door for the service, the first place that the user ends up in when they click on a link from marketing or when they’re trying to login to their own account and you want to make that as a smooth process as possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Well, thanks a lot, Keith, for telling us this about mergers and acquisitions. And for the people who would like to follow, continue this conversation with you, what are the best ways to follow up or get in touch with you?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, the best way to get hold of me is in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithuber/">LinkedIn</a>.

<p>Marketplace deception is everywhere, at great cost and risk to consumers and businesses. Regulation alone won’t fix it. Can Mattereum Asset Passports and Product Information Markets help secure trust in B2B and B2C&nbsp;trade?</p><p>On October 13, 2021, the Federal Trade Commission issued a<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/penalty-offenses-concerning-endorsements/npo_endorsement_template_letter.pdf"> Notice of Penalty Offenses</a> to over 700 companies, putting pressure on American businesses to disengage from deceptive practices such as fake reviews and false endorsements or else face civil penalties.</p><p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-puts-hundreds-businesses-notice-about-fake-reviews-other">FTC Puts Hundreds of Businesses on Notice about Fake Reviews and Other Misleading Endorsements</a></p><p>The<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/penalty-offenses-concerning-endorsements/list-recipients-endorsement-notice.pdf"> list of companies</a> on the notice include some of the largest companies in the world across a range of industries, such as Alphabet, Inc. (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Shell Oil, Starbucks, McDonalds, and many others. A quick skim through the list gives the impression that almost any household name company actively deceives consumers as part of their ongoing business strategy, at least according to the&nbsp;FTC.</p><p>This form of marketplace deception is not limited to B2C relationships. On October 14, 2021, Reuters<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-deals-with-new-defect-787-dreamliner-wsj-2021-10-14/"> reported</a> that aerospace giant Boeing had notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that it had discovered defective parts for its 787 Dreamliner fleet which were sourced by a supplier and manufactured by another&nbsp;company.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-deals-with-new-defect-787-dreamliner-wsj-2021-10-14/">Boeing finds new defect in continuing struggle to produce Dreamliner 787</a></p><p>These forms of marketplace deception are seemingly omnipresent in trade at all scales. While regulation may be able to get many businesses to more authentically engage with consumers and other businesses, some of these entities are of such a size that they can simply absorb civil penalties en masse and proceed with business as&nbsp;usual.</p><p>To combat this endemic deception of consumers, we need a combined effort of effective regulation and technological solutions to secure trust in digital commerce. More specifically, we need to establish standards for consumer protection, and implement the protocols capable of meeting&nbsp;them.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol is well-suited for tackling the challenge of holding companies to account for their stated claims, specifically by offering buyers warrantied claims around their purchased goods powered by an incentivized network of third-party expert certifiers. Let’s explore how Mattereum as a trust-as-a-service platform can help create more authentic relationships between businesses and consumers and between businesses themselves.</p> How do we build Trust-as-a-Service? <p>Ultimately, Mattereum is building a system to secure truth in trade at all scales: documenting and offsetting negative externalities, creating a circular economy of reuse, recycling, and upcycling of goods, and designing incentives which align profitability with sustainability. Let’s unpack the Mattereum approach and explore how it would work in B2C and B2B contexts.</p> Asset Passports: Living Product Documentation <p>The Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) is the core mechanism of the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>In short, a MAP is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification. Other warranties in a MAP may include authentication methods, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, tokenization (or connections to any smart contract or software system), and many others. These warranties are essentially “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">legal lego</a>” of various contract terms that will range greatly between different asset classes and will accrue around assets over&nbsp;time.</p><p>All claims are cryptographically signed, secured, and backed by financial stake, giving all warrantors accountability and skin-in-the-game for their assessments. This framework also provides access to dispute resolution protocols in the event of systemic or commercial fallout via an arbitration clause in the contract.</p><p>Asset Passports are not a static structure but a dynamic, living documentation that evolves throughout the product lifecycle. Once this initial documentation is established, we need a suitable incentive mechanism in place to supply and secure warrantied product information without relying wholly on centralized institutions.</p> Product Information Markets: Breaking Out of the Silos of Separate&nbsp;“Truths” <p>In both B2C and B2B contexts, trust is heavily centralized. We source our product knowledge from companies either directly or through ratings programs they design and companies source their materials and product information with trade partners or distant multiple-degree connections in their supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Instead of relying on companies to secure trust and accountability when they are incentivized to stack the deck in their favor and shield themselves from liabilities, we propose a more decentralized, networked solution that can bring in third-party expertise to supply and secure warranties in a structure we call production information markets&nbsp;(PIMs).</p><p>In short, a PIM is method of incentivizing truth in markets by allowing industry experts to make money from their niche knowledge and face consequences for erroneous claims. For the crypto-savvy, the PIM model makes use of a cryptoeconomic system — or protocol-based<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design"> mechanism design</a> — to incentivize a particular set of behaviors within the network, in this case the supplying and securing of production information over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Together, the living product documentation and bundle of warranties of the MAPs and the incentive structure enabled by PIMs can help create more authentic B2C and B2B relationships which don’t rely on deceptive business practices at the expense and detriment to&nbsp;many.</p> Mattereum Trust-as-a-Service: B2C <p>The Mattereum model is a win-win for businesses and their customers. Any of the 700+ companies listed in the FTC Notice of Penalty Offenses — ranging from tech giants to telecomms to food services — would benefit from embracing a more decentralized approach to securing information and accountability around the sale of goods and services. Fake reviews and shady endorsements simply don’t work well within the Mattereum Protocol. By design, any and all faulty information has consequences.</p><p>Companies can take initiative by integrating the Mattereum Protocol into their launch process or wait for their customers to do so down the line. The former option is certainly ideal.</p><p>An Asset Passport can be generated at any point throughout a product’s lifecycle. Of course, having a MAP at the beginning of the cycle at the point of manufacturing or even design stage would allow for much more information-rich documentation over the course of time, but MAPs can be created even years after initial product&nbsp;release.</p><p>Instead of putting the burden on companies to create and implement their own trust frameworks, they can instead plug their operations into an existing protocol. This makes adoption easier than a patchwork, disconnected solution.</p><p>There is a potentially huge long-term effect in this approach. If a credibly-neutral, autonomous, decentralized third-party system for warrantying product information takes off, it will put pressure on businesses to improve the quality and authenticity of their offering. Failure to adapt to the new paradigm will result in a flight of customers to more provably trustworthy competitors.</p><p>This is key: product information markets turn the trustworthiness of an enterprise into a competitive advantage in the marketplace while also maintaining regulatory compliance. All in the same&nbsp;system.</p> Mattereum Trust-as-a-Service: B2B <p>As above, so&nbsp;below.</p><p>While the FTC notice highlights a severe misalignment in the average business-consumer relationship with a list of companies that looks like a library catalog, this trust problem also extends to the deals which happen much farther upstream to the corporate supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Between mineral and materials sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, the sheer scale of supply chains makes it difficult to document product information before it reaches digital or physical storefronts.</p><p>The only other sources of truth available beyond the manufacturer are the specialist firms which rate and certify objects of a particular domain: fine art, collectible cards, instruments, vehicles, etc. However, these institutions are limited in their capacity by their lack of a shared record of an object’s history. Best case there’s an entry in a single database. Worst case: a single paper certificate.</p><p>This disconnected certification system and lack of initiative and coordination in securing product information creates opportunities for even the world’s largest companies — such as Boeing — to be supplied defective or counterfeit parts, components, or ingredients at real risk to public health and&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Had Boeing integrated MAPs within their supply chain and production process, they could have paired their incredibly detailed product specifications with warranties supplied by third-party engineering firms and other entities. Clear lines of accountability throughout a vast web of B2B&nbsp;deals.</p><p>While we delineate B2C and B2B for explanatory purposes, ultimately the benefits of provable authenticity cascade throughout the entire system. If a business sources materials from verifiable and transparent sources, the company will be less likely to perpetuate faulty parts or information downstream to its own customers.</p><p>The goal of Mattereum’s trust-as-a-service approach is simple in theory but profound in its potential: to power a market economy that doesn’t prey on individuals and institutions, while aligning profitability with sustainability.</p><p>The cost and optics of civil penalties will get us nowhere. Let’s try something different.</p><p>About Mattereum</p><p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta. Mattereum is building an innovative trust-as-a-service platform for securing trust and liquidity in the sale of physical assets, creating durable secondary markets, and removing negative externalities of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets and industries.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/countering-marketplace-deception-with-mattereums-trust-as-a-service-platform-2615dc2c47be">Countering Marketplace Deception with Mattereum’s Trust-as-a-Service Platform</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Multi-cloud deployments are becoming increasingly common as organizations seek to remain competitive in the digital economy and address demands for increased remote working. But while cloud migration is enabling business success, it is not without its identity and access challenges.</p>
 
<p>Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and&nbsp;Beyond Trust&nbsp;for a discussion&nbsp;about the risks associated with cloud environments and how to use IAM and PAM to protect this expanded attack surface against threat actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Paul Fisher, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole outlines the identity and access challenges associated with multi-cloud deployments. He explains why IAM is essential, and why PAM is also important&nbsp;in terms of traditional privileged access management and secrets management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Brian Chappell, Deputy CTO at Beyond Trust highlights the need to address the complexity and interoperability issues arising from siloed identity stores, native toolsets, and conflicting shared&nbsp;responsibility models. He also outlines the benefits of standardizing management and security controls across the IT ecosystem, and other cloud security best practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				  Bitcoin has given blockchain the carbon footprint of Godzilla; but when it comes to identity, blockchain-based distributed ledgers are light on energy use and long on benefits  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Blockchain has become synonymous with cryptocurrency, and crypto is rapidly becoming to energy consumption what crack cocaine once was to addiction. Headlines about <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-miners-allegedly-steal-2-million-of-electricit-1846295318">bitcoin miners stealing electricity</a> to “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952">Bitcoin consumes ‘more electricity than Argentina</a>” have generated much heat but not always a lot of light (this article <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume">from</a> Harvard Business Review offers a nuanced view of the energy consumption controversy).</p>
<p>The problem is that this mental shortcut can leave the impression that the energy intensive computation required to validate bitcoin transactions — which is known as “proof of work”— is a process required by all blockchains, thereby making the technology environmentally unfriendly in general</p>
<p>It isn’t and here’s why:</p> 
			  
				
				
				  
 An identity blockchain like the Indicio Network uses signatures rather than mathematical computation to generate proof. No complex mathematical processes are needed. You either accept the signature or you don’t. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 A write to the ledger (and one write can be the basis for millions of identity credentials) or a look up on the ledger uses no more energy, and possibly less, than browsing a web page. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off ledger. This means that for those peer-to-peer interactions, identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>As most of our digital interactions are on a one-to-one basis, there is no need for them to take place on the blockchain; the blockchain is simply the root of trust for the identities of the parties issuing credentials: once these identities have been looked up and confirmed by each party, everything else happens peer-to-peer. And with Peer DIDs, each communication is cryptographically unique — a huge advancement in privacy and security requiring no more energy than, say, using encrypted email.</p>
<p>Although harder to quantify, the energy saved from using a technology that enables you to trust information online is&nbsp; also something to&nbsp; be taken into account. The&nbsp; same goes for more efficient and effective usability and much better risk mitigation. But the point doesn’t require this detailed analysis to hold true: All blockchains are not Bitcoin and identity blockchains using Peer DIDs are low energy consumers.</p>
<p>That’s why we run the Indicio Network and believe in and advocate for this technology: and that’s why it would be a huge loss&nbsp; if a low energy use of blockchain were to be mistakenly seen as having the carbon footprint of Godzilla.</p>

<p>In a hyperconnected world, it’s hard to name a transaction, financial or otherwise, that takes more than a few moments. Much of our business and personal lives take place on a tiny mobile screen. Instant results are the universal expectation. Buying a pair of shoes, commenting on a social post, and paying utility bills are all part of consumers’ continuous, uninterrupted flow. If it happens on a screen, it has to be now, now, now. Secure account opening is no different. Make your customer wait, and they’re gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While account opening should take only seconds, issues like manual uploads and microdeposits add delays. Finicity, a Mastercard company, is addressing this new reality aggressively, stripping away friction points in the account set-up, onboarding and funding process. Open banking introduces new ways for financial institutions to verify account ownership and authenticate credentials. Accounts are opened and funded in moments, with a full package of data that includes account owners, details and balances. This creates the perception of immediacy that the end-user expects throughout their on-screen day.</p>
 Locking Fraudsters Out of the System 
<p>Understandably the risk, compliance, and customer experience balance is delicate. Efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. That’s why Finicity built its payment solution behind a driving principle: Pay Confidently. This means secure, lightning-fast account credential and balance verification. Financial service providers can verify account ownership and simplify the process by implementing their own application pre-fill functionality. Access to bank account data with instant account verification boosts sign-ups, reduces non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees and lowers abandonment rates. The connectivity is also useful when customers have an existing relationship with an FI but want to move money or add services. Data services help FIs verify account details and balances in milliseconds so they can move money accurately and securely.</p>
<p>Throughout the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, online fraud attacks rose by 250%. By far, the majority of them were account takeover scams, where fraudsters steal credentials and account information to siphon funds away from account holders. <a href="https://m.bankingexchange.com/news-feed/item/8593-online-banking-shift-leads-to-significant-uptick-in-fraud">These attacks rose by a staggering 650%</a>. In 2020 alone, the FTC tracked $3.3 billion in fraud losses to consumers. The convergence of fast-paced digital banking growth and a new wave of inexperienced customers created an opportunity for criminals to exploit. Finicity built its payment solution to cancel out these threats. Finicity Pay uses secure, tokenized access that yields no meaningful data if hacked. Our account verification service instantly and accurately identifies the account holder, stamping out account takeover scams before they get started. The user experience is positive, fast, and most importantly, onboarding is completed at the exact moment that the consumer wants to complete it.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Finicity Open Banking? 
 
 95% Market coverage of direct deposit accounts. From the largest FIs to the smallest credit unions&nbsp; – Finicity has you covered. Receive fast, reliable financial data that has been permissioned by the consumer for their benefit. Finicity is leading the industry towards direct API connections, signing Data Access Agreements with the largest financial institutions, payroll providers and wealth management companies. 
 Added intelligence and deep learning. The analytics layer in our data services enables accurate, confident payments and verifications. Our added intelligence helps mitigate fraud risk, reduce payment failure and fees, enable onboarding, and maintain compliance. 
 
 A True Partner&nbsp; 
<p>The open banking wave is just beginning to rise. COVID-19 has only accelerated the shift to digital banking options that offer faster, slicker ways to set up new accounts, move money and make payments. From October 2020 to August 2021 alone, Gen Zers and Millennials doubled their<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2021/08/16/bank-of-america-is-losing-its-grip-on-millennials-as-fintechs-reinvent-the-checking-account/?sh=509842fe2822"> adoption</a> of digital banks as the primary holder of their accounts. Open banking is the backbone behind the innovation and lifestyle options that are driving fintech app growth.</p>
<p>This is where Finicity provides a differentiated experience. As an innovation partner, Finicity’s development team can identify the best tools to suit your unique use case with the transparency and control that consumers demand. If they feel they can easily set up a new account and then pay quickly and safely, they will adopt your platform.

 GiD Report#182 — Bitcoin goes mainstream <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-181-the-future-will-be-self-sovereign-d0218fff9989">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Bitcoin ETF has finally&nbsp;arrived  Flare launches its Songbird test&nbsp;network  A primer on&nbsp;DeFi  Meme of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. The Bitcoin ETF has finally&nbsp;arrived. The first Bitcoin ETF is now trading on the NYSE, Photo: Jayson Photography<p>2021 will be remembered as the year that Bitcoin went mainstream. First came the Coinbase IPO, a watershed moment for the industry as the largest U.S. exchange touched a market cap of over $95 billion on its first day listed on the&nbsp;NASDAQ.</p><p>Soon after, El Salvador’s 40-year-old president Nayib Bukele announced that Bitcoin would be considered a national currency. (That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/world/americas/bitcoin-el-salvador-bukele.html">experiment is ongoing</a>.) There are rumblings that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/bitcoin-set-become-legal-payment-154644863.html">Brazil might follow suit</a>. (Brazilians have bought more than $4 billion worth of cryptocurrency this year, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-have-bought-over-4-billion-in-cryptocurrency-this-year/">according to their central&nbsp;bank</a>.)</p><p>And this week, Proshares has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/first-bitcoin-futures-etf-to-make-its-debut-on-the-nyse-tuesday-proshares-says.html">launched the first Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. on the NYSE</a>. (Exchange traded crypto products have already launched in Canada and across&nbsp;Europe.)</p><p>Countless Bitcoin ETFs have been proposed over the years. Until now, the SEC has rejected the idea, but SEC chief Gary Gensler recently softened his tone, noting that an ETF based on Bitcoin futures was more palatable to the enforcement agency. Since mutual fund rules would apply, Gensler <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline">believes such a setup would provide “significant investor protections</a>.”</p><p>A Bitcoin ETF is a big deal because it provides institutional investors access to crypto exposure through a highly regulated investment vehicle.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/business/dealbook/bitcoin-etf-proshares.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>“2021 will be remembered for this milestone,” said Michael Sapir, the C.E.O. of ProShares. Investors who are curious about crypto but hesitant to engage with unregulated crypto exchanges want “convenient access to Bitcoin in a wrapper that has market integrity,” he said. For nearly a decade, crypto entrepreneurs and traditional finance firms have sought permission to launch a Bitcoin E.T.F. in the U.S., but their applications have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/business/bitcoin-etf.html">delayed</a> or denied by the S.E.C. Many remain&nbsp;pending.</blockquote><p>It’s also just the beginning:</p><blockquote>“This is an exciting step but not the last,” Douglas Yones, the N.Y.S.E.’s head of exchange traded products, told DealBook. He foresees a range of crypto-linked E.T.F.s getting approval, eventually. Tomorrow’s E.T.F. launch is another sign of crypto’s mainstream legitimacy in a year of milestones for the industry, including the crypto exchange Coinbase going public. Critics <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/why-the-big-short-guys-think-bitcoin-is-a-bubble.html">remain wary</a> of cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/15/business/news-business-stock-market#crypto-industry-players-mobilize-in-washington-to-shape-new-rules">as do regulators</a>, but the digital asset craze of 2021 shows few signs of&nbsp;abating.</blockquote><p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/business/dealbook/bitcoin-etf-proshares.html">Bitcoin Comes to the Big&nbsp;Board</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/15/cftc-fines-tether-and-bitfinex-425m-for-untrue-or-misleading-claims/">CFTC Fines Tether and Bitfinex $42.5M for ‘Untrue or Misleading’ Claims</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline">SEC Set to Allow Bitcoin Futures ETFs as Deadline&nbsp;Looms</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/crypto-lender-celsius-network-raises-400m-in-a-bid-to-reassure-regulators-report/">Crypto Lender Celsius Network Raises $400M in Bid to Reassure Regulators</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/stripe-is-hiring-a-crypto-team-3-years-after-ending-its-bitcoin-support/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20Node%20Oct.%2012%2C%202021&amp;utm_term=The%20Node">Stripe Is Hiring a Crypto Team 3 Years After Ending Bitcoin&nbsp;Support</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/13/global-finance-watchdog-says-133b-stablecoin-sector-remains-niche/">Global Finance Watchdog Says $133B Stablecoin Sector Remains&nbsp;Niche</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/consensys-acquires-treums-team-nft-platform/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">ConsenSys Acquires Treum’s Team, NFT Platform — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/coinbase-plans-to-launch-nft-marketplace/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Coinbase Plans to Launch NFT Marketplace — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/167a35ad-0fca-430d-a72d-b5967c557c04">SEC throws sop to US investors with bitcoin ‘lite’ equity&nbsp;ETFs</a>   2.

  Data is widely considered the “new oil" because data has great value and provides direct and secondary revenue streams. But, also like oil, data can leak from organizations that depend on it. Therefore, data security and the prevention of data leakage is imperative for business as well as regulatory compliance reasons.

<p>Preparing to move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials, Credenxia is working with Dock to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) application to create, issue, manage, and verify credentials instantly. This PoC is now complete!</p><p>Helping businesses around the world work smarter, better, and faster, <a href="https://www.credenxia.com/">Credenxia</a> offer a digital platform that uses cloud and smart technology to verify employee identity and establish proof of qualifications. With a mission to simplify management of the workforce, Credenxia understood the need to provide alternatives to their existing centralized verification solutions.</p><p>The better solution? Verifiable credentials. These are digital versions of an individual's identity documents, academic achievement, licenses and more. Verifiable credentials use cryptography, providing assurance as to who issued the credential and who it belongs to, as well as guaranteeing the legitimacy of it. Verifiable credentials sit in a digital wallet on the individual’s mobile device, giving users back control over their identity.</p><p>What are Verifiable Credentials and what makes it a better option?</p><p>These digital certificates are stored on an individual's digital wallet that can reside on a mobile device. If the accreditation requires a time stamp on how long it is valid for, the verifiable credential can be time stamped, anchoring them to the Dock blockchain. These credentials can be digitally presented to a third party for instant verification. Users receive the certifications and identity from the issuing body, i.e. qualifications from educational organizations, they own it and use it entirely on their own free will.</p><p>It saves a workforce several days on the time it takes to issue and verify an individual's identity and credentials. A university can take months to prepare, issue and print certificates and diplomas, and an employer would spend weeks verifying an employee’s identity and accreditations. With verifiable credentials, hundreds of certifications and identities can be legitimately issued and verified instantly, saving hours and days of tedious work.</p><p>In addition, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof and use cryptography to ensure that only the issuer can make changes to the credentials, and only the intended recipient can present the credentials in a verifiable way.</p><p>Dock’s work with Credenxia</p><p>To date, Credenxia has provided a centralized solution with verification through their cloud-based portal. Wanting to offer an alternative to their existing centralized solutions that provides the added benefits of using verifiable credentials with blockchain technology, Credenxia approached Dock to help them develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) application. The vision was to give back control over one’s credentials and identity and allow instant verification of credentials.</p><p>Using Dock’s API, Credenxia will also offer decentralized solutions, building an application where credentials are held by an individual and where all data held is correct and legitimate, using an identity verification service to verify details of individuals prior to registration.</p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert said of the collaboration “Credenxia’s use of verifiable credentials is a great use case and we’re excited to support them in bringing this product to the market. Credenxia are getting in on the ground floor with this technology which will significantly reduce verification times and costs for their customers”.</p><p>Credenxia CEO Terry Jones said of the collaboration, “We are very pleased to have completed the Proof of Concept with Dock. It is a key strategic imperative for Credenxia to offer existing and new clients a decentralised option that maintains highest levels individual data privacy and integrity. Dock has led the way, by releasing the first public W3C credential verifier, which utilises the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM). Meeting the highest global standard in what will be a rapidly evolving digital compliance landscape is essential for our future growth roadmap. Following the PoC, I am confident that the Dock framework will support these objectives.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a new type of unique identifiers that can be controlled solely by the user. With zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs. They will then be able to prove control over their DID and allow counterparties to find their public encryption key, signature verification key and public services. Those services can be used to interact with the user’s&nbsp;DID.</p><p>The DID specification has matured over the last couple of years and is about to become a formal W3C standard. It defines a universal abstract data model representation for identifiers and their verification material (e.g. public keys), relationships and services. The specification is extensible by design which means new types of services, verification materials and other features can be supported. In the core, the specification contains a simple interface to resolve a DID Document from a DID (similar to an Ethereum Account from an ENS name) by anyone who knows the DID of the user. The DID Document will then contain the relevant information to enable use cases such as sign up, sign in, data encryption, secure communication, verifiable authorship and data provenance etc. Since DIDs are URI-compliant, they also make perfect sense for web ontologies.</p><p>For the Decentralized Identity (or Self-Sovereign Identity) Community in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, W3C and <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2021/09/OIDF_OIDC4SSI-Update_Kristina-Yasuda-Torsten-Lodderstedt.pdf">OIDC4SSI</a> in <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation (OIDF)</a> and many others, DIDs have been a central component and building block for user-centric identity solutions for&nbsp;years.</p> Other DID-like Identifiers&nbsp;… <p>However, the Ethereum community is exploring other identifiers like NFTs and <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a> as identifiers (as a byproduct) with similar goals as DIDs in mind. Both can be created and solely controlled by the user. ENS is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ’vitalik.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses and metadata.</p><p>A lot of Web3 users have been using ENS names as their identifiers (see <a href="https://etherscan.io/enslookup">Etherscan</a>). Also <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/23/twitter-to-add-bitcoin-lightning-tips-nft-authentication/">Twitter is experimenting lately with NFTs</a> and therefore ENS names since they comply with the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a> standard. We can expect more traction in the near&nbsp;future.</p> ENS names are now DIDs&nbsp;… <p>DIDs are not a replacement for Ethereum Accounts and ENS. Instead, DIDs can be seen as an abstract representation of those which makes it easier for developers to build applications across different chains and platforms. Many developers in the Decentralized Identity Community are already building a lot of Open Source tooling/products and protocols facilitating trust, privacy, security and data sovereignty, to integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem and vice versa. Some of the Open Source components include decentralized agents (e.g. <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a>), secure communication (i.e. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>), capabilities-based authorization and delegation frameworks (e.g. <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCaps</a>), login w/ identity wallets (i.e. <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">SIOPv2</a>), user-controlled confidential (e.g. <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/kepler">Kepler</a>) or public storage (e.g. <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a>) and&nbsp;more.</p><p>DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts have been already defined and used. Examples&nbsp;include:</p>  did:ethr:mainnet:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a  did:safe:0xff6229bc3655cf0204e850b54397d3651f5198c4_eip155.1  did:pkh:eth:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a  <p>We have now defined a DID-representation for ENS names such&nbsp;as:</p>  did:ens:mainnet:vitalik.eth  <p>This has two purposes:</p>  to wrap existing ENS names as DIDs to facilitate interoperability of emerging technologies in the Decentralized Identity and Ethereum community,  to define a canonical way to augment ENS names with DID capabilities (e.g., encryption) as mentioned above.  <p>We have already officially registered a DID method specification for <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID registry</a> and are now looking for an appropriate home of the specification for further development. We are happy to donate the specification including the <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/ens-did-resolver">ens-did-resolver</a> implementation.</p><p>Now, every ENS name can be represented as a DID with no extra steps. The default DID Document will always contain the ENS registry as the public profile service and the current owner of the ENS name as the controller of the DID which already enables use cases such as issuing and proving control of verifiable attestations (i.e. based on W3C Verifiable Credentials) which can be used for sign up and sign&nbsp;in.</p><p>Through the ENS registry, standardized TEXT records (as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> specification) can be added to the ENS name to enable more DID-like features, e.g., encryption, delegation, confidential storage, communication etc.</p><p>For example, to enable encryption for a <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> DID, just add the following TEXT records to your ENS name (see did:ens:ropsten:<a href="https://app.ens.domains/name/awoie.eth">awoie.eth</a>):</p>ENS Text Records for&nbsp;DIDs<p>You can now use <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> with <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver">did-resolver</a> in your own projects.</p><p>Using DIDs as a standard representation for Decentralized Identifiers will increase interop and synergies between different platforms, chains, applications and communities.</p><p>Wanna talk about how to use ENS names as DIDs? <a href="https://discord.gg/Er4E5xRdPj">Join our&nbsp;Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">ENS names are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>500,000 OCEAN available for sustainable data-oriented projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Ocean ecosystem becomes self-sustainable</a> as the builders of the Web3 data economy leverage Ocean Protocol to create products, services, and resources that the community finds valuable.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">The OceanDAO website</a> has up-to-date information on getting started with OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO’s next funding round — Round 11 — has 500,000 OCEAN available ($400,000 USD at today’s prices). Submissions are due November 2nd; we encourage you to submit early for better feedback and engagement with the community. The rest of this post has details about Round&nbsp;11.</p><p>Thank you to all of the OceanDAO participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 11 Updates, Announcements and Guidelines  Round 11 Parameters <p>Amount</p><p>There is 500,000 OCEAN in grant funding available in Round&nbsp;11.</p><p>Grant Funding Categories</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your current Project Deliverables to remain in a good standing to be eligible to participate in future Rounds. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a>.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>To continue incentivizing completion and outcomes, we are continuing Funding Tiers, which can be acquired by Teams delivering on their grant promises. Below are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round 11. “Unleashing Data” has two tiers ($3,000 USD, $10,000 USD max); other categories have four tiers ($3,000 USD up to $35,000 USD&nbsp;max).</p><p>“Unleashing Data” Category (max per&nbsp;team):</p>  Open to&nbsp;All    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  <p>2. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: $1,000 USD of legitimate consumptions in the previous month AND the team has received less than $30,000 USD funding&nbsp;total.  <p>All other Categories (max per&nbsp;team):</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during application process. Introduced to related projects.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (non-outreach) have 60,000 OCEAN available as “air cover” without having to compete against other groups. Beyond that, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  60,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  380,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>Core Tech Initiatives</p><p>Proposals that work on any of the following fall under the “Core Tech Initiatives” earmark, for air cover when&nbsp;voting.</p>  Enhance Ocean’s Fine-Grained Permissions to support Verifiable Credentials (vs just Ethereum addresses) in allowlist and denylist. (The schema already allows&nbsp;it.)  First-class integration with WebSockets as a data service. It would include a fork of Ocean Provider, plus affordances elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack.  First-class integration with Arweave as a data service. It may already have some support; this needs to be validated. Then the aim is to remove friction and leverage Arweave more fully. It may be as a fork of Ocean Provider, and/or elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack  First-class integration with Filecoin as a data service. It already supports via IPFS; the aim here is to remove friction and leverage Filecoin more fully. It may be as a fork of Ocean Provider, and/or elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack  <p>Burn</p><p>As with DAO Rounds 8, 9, and 10, any remaining funds not granted in Round 11 will be burned. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">Here’s how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>Rules:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  [New] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Category].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds not granted, are&nbsp;burned.  <p>Voting Parameters</p><p>OceanDAO is a nascent monthly grants program and has a lot of mechanisms still being designed and developed. The OceanDAO roadmap aims to deliver stable systems for existing and future participants across: voting and funding. It has also been designed to improve voter &amp; token holder representation.</p><p>Whilst Quadratic Voting is a key deliverable for OceanDAO, Sybil vector attacks cannot be taken lightly. Which is why intermediary steps have to be taken before moving to QV, so as to avoid the following:</p>  Willingly create an opportunity for a Sybil&nbsp;attack  Overlook a well-orchestrated attack  Become a central authority in grant-voting outcomes  Fracture voter &amp; grantee participation.  <p>There are 2 major improvements being rolled out for OceanDAO Round 11. The key concept is that these changes are designed to reduce the impact of whale voters, increase the impact of voter representation, and make the process easier to navigate for all participants.</p><p>Single Ballot:</p>  All Grant Proposals will now be listed in a single voting ballot together (as opposed to each proposal having their own Y/N&nbsp;ballot)  OCEAN can only be used to vote once (as opposed to each proposal’s Y/N ballot being voted on with your full OCEAN&nbsp;amount).  <p>Weighted-Ballot System:</p>  Voters will be able to use OCEAN&nbsp;once  Voters will be able to distribute their votes across several&nbsp;projects  1 OCEAN = 1&nbsp;Vote  <p>Note that we are still moving towards QV, which is currently implemented on Snapshot. Also, going forward, we will be deploying digital identification (DID), snapshot strategies that support this, and the required UX to reduce friction, and reduce sybil attack&nbsp;vectors.</p><p>Town Hall</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Town Hall</a> has been running weekly since the beginning of OceanDAO. Currently the DAO is expanding and with this growth so will the Town&nbsp;Hall.</p><p>Town Hall will widen its scope and begin to include the entire Ocean Ecosystem. The call will continue to take place at the same time as already planned. Keep an eye out for new format changes as they are introduced.</p> Round 11 Information <p>As a builder, submit your project proposal on the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-11/71">Round 11 Ocean Port Forum</a>.

Introduction <p>Have you ever thought about monetising the data that your organisation generates? You might imagine that this involves dealing with data brokers, but with Ocean you can sell your data directly to your customers with no third party in-between. Ocean makes this all super easy for you with some pretty cool tech under the&nbsp;hood.</p><p>Using <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is already a big improvement on the alternatives that are out there, but it gets even better. Ocean Market is completely open-source and made freely available under the Apache 2 license. This means that you can fork Ocean Market and set up your own data marketplace in just a few steps. This guide will walk you through the process, you’ll be surprised how easy it is. No prior blockchain knowledge is required!</p> 2. Before You&nbsp;Begin <p>If you’re completely unfamiliar with Ocean Market or web3 applications in general, you will benefit from reading these guides&nbsp;first:</p>  To use your clone of Ocean Market, you’ll need a <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets/">wallet</a>. We recommend <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">getting set up with metamask</a>.  You’ll also need some <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets-and-ocean-tokens/">Ocean tokens on a testnet</a> to use your marketplace.  When you have the testnet tokens, have a go at <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/marketplace-publish-data-asset/">publishing a data asset</a> on Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Now run through the process of <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/marketplace-consume-data-asset/">consuming a data asset</a> on Ocean&nbsp;Market.   3. Required Prerequisites <p>Make sure that you have all of the necessary prerequisites:</p>  Git. Instructions for installing Git can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>.  Node.js can be downloaded from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a> (we’re using version 16 in this&nbsp;guide)  A decent code editor, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio&nbsp;Code</a>  You’ll need a Github account to fork Ocean market via&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.  <p>In addition to the above list, knowledge of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> will help you make a quick start to adjusting the styling and prior experience with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> will help but isn’t required.</p> 4. Quickstart: Data Marketplace up and running in under 1&nbsp;hour!  4.1 Fork Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>The first step is to log into Github and navigate to <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market">https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market</a>, you’ll need to log in or create a Github account. Now you need to click “Fork” in the top right-hand corner. If you are a member of an organisation on Github, it will give you the option to clone it into either your personal account or the organisation, choose whichever is suitable for&nbsp;you.</p> 4.2 Clone the market&nbsp;locally <p>Now we need to clone the market fork locally so that we can start making changes to the code. Upon forking Ocean Market, GitHub will take you to the repository page. Here, you should copy the URL of the repository. To do this, click on the green “Code” button and then click the copy icon to copy the HTTPS URL. Make sure that you have git installed and set up and installed on your computer before proceeding, see <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">this</a> guide if you’re not familiar with&nbsp;git.</p><p>Now you’re ready to make a local clone of your forked version of the Ocean Market. Open up the terminal, or command prompt on Windows. At this point, you may wish to navigate to the directory where you want this repository to live `cd Desktop` for example, but it’s also perfectly fine to clone it in the home directory.</p><p>To clone the repository, enter the following command into your terminal:</p> git clone <a href="https://github.com/your-profile/market.git">https://github.com/your-profile/market.git</a> <p>You need to replace the link with the HTTPS URL that you copied from GitHub. Once you enter the command, you’ll see the percentage completion reported, and then git will let you know when it’s done. Now let’s navigate into the market directory that we have just&nbsp;cloned:</p> cd market  4.3 Install the dependencies <p>Installing the dependencies is a vital step for running the market. It’s a super simple process, thanks to npm (node package manager). Make sure you have node.js installed, otherwise it will fail. In Ocean Market, we use node.js version 16 and it’s highly recommended that you use the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Enter the following command to install the dependencies:</p> npm install <p>This command will take a few minutes to complete and you’ll see some warnings as it runs (no need to worry about the warnings).</p> 4.4 Run your Market fork for the first&nbsp;time <p>At this point, you are ready to run your data marketplace for the first time. This is another straightforward step that requires just one&nbsp;command:</p> npm start <p>The above command will build the development bundle and run it locally. Once it’s complete you should see the following output:</p><p>Great news — your data marketplace has successfully been built and is now running locally. Let’s check it out! Open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>. You’ll see that you have a full-on clone of Ocean Market running locally. Give it a go and test out publishing and consuming data assets — everything works!</p><p>That’s all that’s required to get a clone of Ocean market working. The whole process is made simple because your clone can happily use all the smart contracts and backend components that are maintained by Ocean Protocol Foundation.</p><p>So you’ve got a fully functioning data marketplace at this point, which is pretty cool. But it doesn’t really look like your data marketplace. Right now it’s still just a clone of Ocean Market — same branding, name, logo etc. The next few steps focus on personalising your data marketplace.</p> 4.5 Change your Market&nbsp;Name <p>It’s now time to open up your favourite code editor and start getting stuck into the code. The first thing we will be doing is changing the name of your data marketplace. A decent code editor (such as VS Code) makes this incredibly simple by searching and replacing all the places that the name&nbsp;appears.</p><p>Let’s start by searching and replacing “Ocean Marketplace”. In VS Code there is a magnifying glass symbol in the left-hand panel (arrow 1 in the image below) that will open up the interface for searching and replacing text. Type “Ocean Marketplace” into the first textbox, and the name of your marketplace into the second textbox (arrow 2). To make things simple, there is a button to the right of the second textbox (arrow 3) that will replace all instances at once. You can take a moment to review all the text you’re changing if you wish and then click this&nbsp;button.</p><p>Next up, we need to repeat the process but this time we’ll be searching and replacing “Ocean Market”. As you can see in the screenshot below, we have called our fork “Formidable Data&nbsp;Market”.</p><p>Now let’s change the tagline of your site. Open up the folder called “content” and then open the file called “site.json”.</p><p>On line 4 in this file, you can enter the tagline that you want for your data marketplace.</p> 4.6 Change the&nbsp;Logo <p>The next important step to personalising your data marketplace is setting your own logo, we highly recommend using your logo in SVG format for this. The site logo is stored in the following location:</p> src/images/logo.svg <p>Delete the “logo.svg” file from that folder and paste your own logo in the same folder. If you rename your logo “logo.svg” everything will work without any problems.</p><p>At this point, it’s a good idea to check how things are looking. First, check that you have saved all of your changes, then cancel the build that’s running in your terminal (Ctrl + C or Cmnd + C) and start it again `npm start`. Once the build has finished, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a> and see how things&nbsp;look.</p><p>As you can see in the screenshot above, changing the site name and tagline has worked well. However, our logo doesn’t look quite right… To fix this, open up the Logo.module.css file from src/components/atoms/Logo.module.css. In this file, you can see the styling that is being applied to your&nbsp;logo.</p><p>Delete lines 7, 8 and 9 and save the file. Now open up <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>and refresh the page (no need to restart the build&nbsp;here).</p><p>Awesome! Now our logo is fixed and looking&nbsp;great.</p> 4.7 Change the&nbsp;Styling <p>Hopefully, you like our pink and purple branding but we don’t expect you to keep it in your own data marketplace. This step focuses on applying your own brand colours and&nbsp;styles.</p><p>4.7.1 Background</p><p>Let’s start with the background. Open up the following CSS&nbsp;file:</p> src/components/App.module.css <p>You’ll notice in the screenshot above that we are setting our “wave” background on line 3. Here, you’ll want to use your own background colour or image. For this example, we’ll use an SVG background from <a href="https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/">svgbackgrounds.com</a>. We save the new background image into the src/images/ folder (same folder as the logo), then we change the CSS to the file location of the new background (see line 3 in the image&nbsp;below).</p><p>If we save this file and view the site at this point, we get an ugly white section at the top (see image&nbsp;below).</p><p>To fix this we need to change the starting position of the background image. In this situation, we can just delete “13.rem” from line&nbsp;3.</p><p>Now when we view our data marketplace we can see that the new background starts at the top and fills the whole page.&nbsp;Perfect!</p><p>4.7.2 Brand&nbsp;Colours</p><p>Next up, let’s change the background colours to match your individual style. Open up the following file: src/global/_variables.css. Here you’ll see the global style colours that are set. Now is the time to get creative, or consult your brand handbook (if you already have&nbsp;one).</p><p>You can change these colours as much as you wish until you’re happy with how everything looks. Each time you save your changes, the site will immediately update so you can see how things look. You can see the styles chosen for this example in the image&nbsp;below.</p><p>And the screenshot below shows how it’s currently looking.</p><p>4.7.3 Change&nbsp;Fonts</p><p>The final part of the styling that we’ll alter in this guide is the fonts. This is an important step because the font used in Ocean Market is one of the few elements of the market that are copyright protected, if you want to use the same font you’ll need to purchase a license. The other copyrighted elements are the logo and the name — which we have already&nbsp;changed.</p><p>If you don’t already have a brand font, head over to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> to pick some fonts that suit the brand you’re trying to create. Google makes it nice and easy to see how they’ll look and it’s simple to import them into your&nbsp;project.</p><p>The global fonts are set in the same file as the colours, scroll down and you’ll see them on lines 36 to&nbsp;41.</p><p>If you are importing fonts, such as from Google fonts, you need to make sure that you include the import statement at the top of the _variables.css file (Google Fonts provides you with this import statement so you just need to copy and paste&nbsp;it).</p><p>As with the colour changes, it’s a good idea to save the file with each change and check if the site is looking the way that you expected it to. You can see our eclectic choices&nbsp;below.</p><p>4.8 Change the Fee&nbsp;Address</p><p>At this point, we have made a lot of changes and hopefully you’re happy with the way that your data marketplace is looking. Given that you now have your own awesome data marketplace, it’s about time we talked about monetizing it. Yeah, that’s right — you will earn a commission when people buy and sell data assets on your marketplace.</p><p>When someone sets the pricing for their data assets in your marketplace they are informed that a commission will be sent to the owner of the data marketplace. In order to receive this commission, you need to set the market to send the commission through to your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>This important step is the last thing that we will change in this guide. To change the address that the marketplace fees are sent to you need to set your address as an environmental variable. Create a new file called&nbsp;.env in the root of your repository. It is important that the file is saved in the right place, your file structure should look the same as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Now copy and paste the following into the&nbsp;file:</p> GATSBY_MARKET_FEE_ADDRESS=”0xxx” <p>You need to replace “0xxx” with your Ethereum address and save the file. And that’s it, you now have a fully functioning data marketplace that will earn you revenue every time someone uses&nbsp;it.</p> 4.9 Build and host your Data Marketplace <p>All that’s left is for you to host your data marketplace and start sharing it with your future users. To host your data marketplace you need to run the build&nbsp;command:</p> npm run build <p>This takes a few minutes to run. While this is running you can get prepared to host your new data marketplace. You have many options for hosting your data marketplace (including AWS S3, Vercel, Netlify and many more). In this guide, we will demonstrate how to host it with <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge</a>, which is completely free and very easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Open up a new terminal window and run the following command to install&nbsp;surge:</p> npm install — global surge <p>When this is complete, navigate back to the terminal window that is building your finished data marketplace. Once, the build is completed enter the following commands to enter the public directory and host&nbsp;it:</p> cd public  Surge <p>If this is your first time using surge, you will be prompted to enter an email address and password to create a free account. It will ask you to confirm the directory that it is about to publish, check that you are in the market/public/ directory and press enter to proceed. Now it gives you the option to choose the domain that you want your project to be available on. We have chosen <a href="https://formidable-data-market.surge.sh/">formidable-data-market.surge.sh</a> which is a free option. You can also set a CNAME value in your DNS to make use of your own <a href="https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain">custom&nbsp;domain</a>.</p><p>After a few minutes, your upload will be complete and you’re ready to share your data marketplace. You can view the version we created in this guide&nbsp;<a href="https://formidable-data-market.surge.sh/">here</a>.</p> 5. Conclusion <p>Well done for making it to the end of this guide. We’ve covered all of the most important steps for getting your own data marketplace setup:</p>  Forking Ocean&nbsp;Market  Changing the&nbsp;Logo  Setting the name and tagline for your data marketplace.  Customising the styling using your own fonts, colours and background.  Setting your own Ethereum address as an environmental variable to receive the marketplace fees.  Building and publishing your data marketplace.  <p>Hopefully you’ve enjoyed this guide and found it productive.

<p>Vince walks into a casino and the security at the entrance wants to know if Vince is over 21 years old, as that’s the rule to legally play in the&nbsp;casinos.</p><p>Now, Vince is in a dilemma. He wants to prove that he is over 21 years old, but doesn’t want to disclose any other information to the security such as his name or address. How can he do&nbsp;that?</p><p>For starters, it is not possible through physical IDs such as your driver’s license or passport as they will have your name on it. So, how can Vince prove his age without disclosing any other personal information?</p><p>Think about it for a&nbsp;moment.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">selective disclosure</a> comes into play.&nbsp;.</p> What is Selective Disclosure? <p>Selective disclosure is one of the pillars of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and it enables individuals to share just what is needed by the recipient to process the data and take actions based on&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the above example, selective disclosure allows Vince to share just his age with the security as that alone is enough to decide if he should be allowed to enter the casino or&nbsp;not.</p> Benefits of Selective Disclosure <p>The benefits of selective disclosure are:</p>  Enhances the privacy of the user as minimum information is exchanged  Empowers users to determine what data must be shared with&nbsp;whom.  Reduces processing time for the recipients as only a small set of information has to be verified.  No storing and the related <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security</a> hassles for recipients  <p>Now that you know what selective disclosure is and its associated benefits, let’s jump to its implementation.</p> How Does Selective Disclosure Work? <p>One of the best ways to implement selective disclosure is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, a tamper-proof and cryptographically-verifiable way of sharing Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p>Here is what a VC looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>There are three entities to a VC and they are issuer, holder, and verifier, and together, they form what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>. A VC will have the three key components, namely,</p>  Metadata that identifies the issuer and the&nbsp;holder  Claim, which is the data that a holder wants to share with the&nbsp;verifier  Proof that includes digital signatures of both the issuer and the holder for authenticity.  <p>Let’s look closely at the claim, as this is where selective disclosure is implemented.</p><p>In the above example, there is only a single claim, that the holder is an alumni of a specific institution.</p><p>Let’s look at another&nbsp;VC.</p> {  <a href="http://twitter.com/context">“@context</a>”: [<br>     <br>   <a href="http://schema.org/">“http://schema.org/</a>",<br>   <a href="https://w3id.org/security/v2">“https://w3id.org/security/v2</a>",<br>   <a href="https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1">“https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1</a>"  ],  <a href="http://twitter.com/type">“@type</a>”: “Person”,  “firstName”: “Jane”,  “lastName”: “Doe”,  “jobTitle”: “Professor”,  “telephone”: “(425) 123–4567”,  “email”: “jane.doe@example.com”,  “proof”: {     “type”: “BbsBlsSignature2020”,     “created”: “2020–04–25”,     “verificationMethod”: “did:example:489398593#test”,     “proofPurpose”: “assertionMethod”,     “proofValue”:   “F9uMuJzNBqj4j+HPTvWjUN/MNoe6KRH0818WkvDn2Sf7kg1P17YpNyzSB+CH57AWDFunU13tL8oTBDpBhODckelTxHIaEfG0rNmqmjK6DOs0/ObksTZh7W3OTbqfD2h4C/wqqMQHSWdXXnojwyFDEg==”,     “requiredRevealStatements”: [4,5]   }  } <p>This contains a ton of information about the holder such as firstname, last name, job title, email, etc. Many times, the holder may not have to share all this information with potential verifiers. At the same time, an issuer may find it cost-effective and convenient to issue these credentials in one&nbsp;go.</p><p>So, how do you balance between what the issuer offers and what the holder&nbsp;wants?</p><p>You guessed it — selective disclosure!</p><p>When an issuer creates and sends a verifiable credential, the holder stores it in his or her digital wallet. When it is time to share it with the verifier, the holder compiles the required credentials together into a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier.</p><p>Every time, when a holder shares a verifiable presentation with the verifier, he or she digitally signs it using public-key cryptography. Essentially, the holder signs with his or her private key and the verifier decrypts this information with the associated public&nbsp;key.</p><p>Likewise, the verifiable presentation will also contain the issuer’s digital signature that is signed using its private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Now, you may wonder how the holder can store each credential separately and compile it separately to have the issuer’s signature on each of&nbsp;it.</p><p>To make the question clear, in the above example, let’s say the holder shares only the phone number with a verifier. This is selective disclosure. But how will the issuer’s signature that applies to all of the credentials can be used for just one? Isn’t it a single block of content to which the entire signature applies?</p><p>Well, that’s where <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a> come&nbsp;in.</p> Implementing Selective Disclosure using BBS+ signatures <p>BBS+ signatures are a good way to implement selective disclosure as it allows the holder to share a part of a verifiable credential with a verifier.</p><p>The above verifiable credential of Jane Doe is an example of selective disclosure as it uses BBS+ signatures. Here is the line that shows this for&nbsp;you.</p> “type”: “BbsBlsSignature2020”, <p>As a result, the holder can send just her phone number to a verifier, her email address to another entity, and so on, and all of it will have the same digital signature.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of Selective Disclosure <p>At Affinidi, we have implemented the BBS group signature schema on our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#">tech stack</a> to give holders the flexibility to build a presentation with only the required fields from a credential. These fragments are cryptographically verifiable as they are signed by the BBS+ signature.</p><p>Specifically, we have created an API to create and share the URL for the VC fragment.</p><p>The createShareUrl is the API that enables selective disclosure in Affinidi’s tech stack. It takes credentialID as a required parameter and optional selective disclosure fields array to build fragment VCs. Of course, the chosen VC should support selective disclosure.</p><p>If this parameter is provided and the VC supports selective disclosure — the fragment from VC will be builded first and then shareUrl will be created for&nbsp;it.</p><p>To learn more about this API and how you can leverage, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or <a href="http://developers@affinidi.com">email us</a>.

			<p>The digital asset space continues to thrive and attract institutional investors, as according to PitchBook, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">$17 billion worth of institutional capital</a> has poured into the sector this year alone. Moreover, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">70% of institutional investors expect to invest in digital assets</a> in the future. Since the funding in the space has exploded, traditional custodians are trying to figure out how they fit in as new players on this value chain. Custodian banks have been slow to adapt and are now struggling with managing digital asset custody. Even worse, they mix up crypto-currencies and tokenized financial securities.</p>

<p>It is natural that custodians need time to understand how blockchain technology works. Once that happens, the lucrative opportunities that await on the other side will become clear. Here, we listed a few benefits and opportunities:</p>
 
 New safekeeping service<br>
 
 
<p>As digital wallets are the access points for digital assets, custodians can provide custodial wallets for investors.</p>
 
 Reduced operational costs<br>
 
 
<p>When all investor positions are kept on the blockchain, it eliminates the need for reconciliation of depository in the process. This reduces the heavy reconciliation costs.</p>
 
 Immediate services<br>
 
 
<p>Custodians can provide immediate value-added services such as owning the recovery process for lost security tokens, reporting, tax certification, lending services and other collateral management services to investors.</p>
<p>We used the word ‘immediate’ because with the blockchain, processing these services will use a single truth of information. Issuers, agents and investors can access the real-time data at any time. Services can be provided promptly by avoiding the lengthy process of flowing information throughout the traditional chain of custody and the risk of human errors.</p>
 The main challenge is not regulation but the adoption of the new model&nbsp; 
<p>People often think the main challenge in this space is regulation, but it is actually not true. Instead, the real struggle for financial institutions including custodians is adopting new processes and new tools. When it comes to compliance, it is mostly about verifying the eligibility of investors. This can’t be performed by identifying investor wallets, as they are browsers for the internet of value, not vaults.&nbsp; That is where digital identity comes into play, but how does it work? Let’s take a look at the main characteristics in the blockchain-based model of custody to provide some clarity:</p>
 
 Smart contracts<br>
 
 
<p>The smart contracts represent the asset(s) on the blockchain infrastructure. They code compliance rules into the security tokens, and only eligible investors can hold these tokens. The serious protocols for tokenized securities usually include a token recovery function that can be triggered by authorized agents.</p>
 
 Tokens<br>
 
 
<p>The tokens that have eligibility rules embedded into themselves are permissioned tokens, and they can only be traded between eligible counterparts.</p>
 
 Digital identity 
 
<p>Investors have a digital identity that stores verified identity proofs onchain, and smart contracts can check these proofs to verify the eligibility of investors.</p>
 
 Wallets<br>
 
 
<p>Once the smart contract code confirms the eligibility of the investor, the permissioned tokens will be allocated to wallets associated with the investor’s digital identity. If the private key or access credential is lost, the permissioned tokens can be recoverable to another wallet. This can be processed after the verification of identity by token issuers or third-party agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Use cases: recovery of security tokens 
<p>It is therefore obvious that custodians need access to the token smart contracts, not to the wallets, for safekeeping investors’ assets. For example, issuers of tokenized securities using the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Protocol, now recognized as ERC3643 by the Ethereum community,</a> are able to appoint a custodian bank as the recovery agent and grant that bank access to the recovery function of the smart contracts. In practice, the security tokens can be recovered in just a few steps:</p>
 
 Declare the loss of the wallet: The investor creates a request to recover their tokens to the custodian bank. 
 Verify the digital identity – <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>: The custodian bank verifies the token holder’s identity with a standardized KYC process to validate the provenance of the request. 
 Recover the same tokens in the new wallet: If the verification is positive, the custodian bank triggers the recovery function and the lost tokens are transferred to the new investor wallet. This new wallet will also be added to the ONCHAINID of the investor. The custodian can perform this operation even if he doesn’t have access to the investor’s wallet. 
 
<p></p>
 Time to embrace and explore the new technology&nbsp; 
<p>Traditional custodians have an important role to play in digital asset custody, but they need an updated approach. There are some quick actors who are already reacting to it and updating their model. Recently, US custodian bank State Street launched a digital finance division to expand into the space. Why? It was because of client demand. Certainly, the demand will continue to increase, and as we mentioned earlier, seven out of ten institutional investors plan to invest in digital assets.</p>
<p>The good thing is that the technology has matured after years of use and securing billions worth of digital assets. Custodians can implement the technology quickly and straightforwardly. It is time to move and keep up with technology in order to gain a competitive advantage, those who react slower risk falling behind the competition, or other new players enter into this space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Nadine Chakar, the lead of the new digital finance division at State Street, said, “This space is evolving at warp speed. I believe the winners will be those who embrace change versus those who stand back and watch – they will be disintermediated or disrupted. Business leaders, including myself, must set the tone that standing still is not an option.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new proposal has been submitted to adjust the staking rewards emissions on the Dock network to a 50/50 split with 50% of emission rewards going to validators and stakers, and 50% going to the Dock Treasury.</p><p>This would increase the amount of staking rewards to validators and stakers who participate in securing the Dock network, who are currently receiving 40% of rewards and reduce the Treasury’s allocation from 60%. The initial division of staking rewards was based on Polkadot’s reward split, but we feel that adjusting to a 50/50 split is a better fit to align incentives across the network, increasing the rewards to validators while adequately funding the Dock Treasury to develop and operate the network.<br><br>This proposal is live on the Dock Network and can be viewed in the Governance portal here: ​​<a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy">https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy</a>. All Dock token holders can vote to influence the outcome of this proposal and should participate in determining this important change to the network.</p> How to vote   Go to the <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy">Governance portal</a> where you will see the Referendum. Click Vote on the proposed Referendum.  <p>2. 	Select which account you want to use to submit the vote and click 	Aye or Nay. Select a Conviction amount which lets you choose to lock-up tokens in order to put more weight behind your vote. You can also chose to not lock-up your tokens as part of the vote.</p><p>Once the voting period ends as shown in the Governance portal, if the referendum passes, then it will move to be executed by the Association Council. Otherwise, the rewards split will remain as it currently is with a 60/40 split.<br>For assistance with voting on the referendum, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/elections-and-voting/proposals">documentation</a> or contact our team at support@dock.io.</p>

<p>We believe individuals should be able to access and use their own data to be able to manage their lives better. Currently, this isn’t possible because every individual’s data is dispersed across dozens (probably over a hundred) different organisations that hold it and don’t make it available. This is absurd and&nbsp;unfair.</p><p>Over the last 14 years we have built the infrastructure needed to make citizen data empowerment possible — infrastructure capable of providing every individual with their own personal data store, where they can safely and securely collect their own data, use it and share it under their own control. This infrastructure is now live and operational, officially recognised as a supplier to public services on procurement platforms in both England and Scotland and independently accredited for data management security under ISO&nbsp;27001.</p> Unleashing the potential <p>But what we’ve also learned over these 14 years is that core infrastructure is not enough. A parallel: it is extraordinary and wonderful that we have water infrastructure that brings fresh, safe water to our homes and offices, and a national grid that does the same with electricity. But if we didn’t have taps and switches to turn the water and electricity on and off as and when we need them, they wouldn’t be half as valuable as they&nbsp;are.</p><p>So, over the past few years, we’ve also been building the taps and switches that are needed to make our citizen empowering personal data logistics infrastructure really useful. This blog outlines some of&nbsp;them.</p> Smart directories <p>One of the really big, time consuming, frustrating and expensive things every individual and every organisation has to contend with is what we call ‘matching and connecting’. Individuals want to find the services they need to help them with a particular task, but often they don’t know who they are or where to find them. They might not even know that such services exist. Likewise, organisations offering a particular service often struggle to find and reach the particular people who really want or need this&nbsp;service.</p><p>A huge amount of time, money and effort is wasted by both individuals and organisations trying to solve these puzzles, often in expensive and unsatisfactory ways.</p><p>With smart directories, individuals can allow selected organisations to see an anonymised profile of themselves (shorn of any data that would identify the particular individual), and the selected organisations can see whether individuals fit the criteria their service is designed for. If there is a fit, the organisation can use the platform to send a message to the individual. If the individual decides to accept the message and respond, a connection is established.</p><p>Smart Directories lie at the heart of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">the work we are currently doing</a> with the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/tag/office-of-the-chief-designer/">Office of the Chief Designer in Scotland</a> and <a href="https://connecting.scot/">Connecting Scotland</a> to radically reduce the costs of finding and working with citizens to help co-design public services.</p> Automated form&nbsp;filling <p>There is little more dispiriting and irritating than having to fill in forms, especially when you have to do it time and time again, providing the same information to different people. Using our platform and its ability to enable the sharing of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">verified attributes</a> in particular, if an individual says ‘Yes, I would like this service’ it is possible for the necessary information (and only the necessary information) to be automatically sucked out of their PDS and sent to the service provider so that service provider doesn’t have to waste time, money and effort checking to see if it is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>This eliminates friction, effort, risk and cost for both sides while radically speeding up the process. Using our infrastructure, what used to take weeks or months (the individual painstakingly and manually filling out a form; the organisation painstakingly checking every piece of information within the form — often having to pay external service providers for the privilege), can now take&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>This approach is central to the Scottish Government’s planned <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>, which could revolutionise both citizens’ experience of accessing and using public services in Scotland and the costs these services&nbsp;incur.</p> Circles <p>In many service situations, different groups of people need to talk to each other to make arrangements, coordinate diaries, deal with changes, share results of meetings, organise follow ups, and so on. Often this is done by phone or email where the information gets lost or becomes difficult to find and where separate processes are then needed to share associated data.</p><p>To address this need, we have created what we call ‘Circle’ capabilities by which an individual can create a specific circle of contacts for a particular need (a bit like a WhatsApp group) but where a) all data generated by the conversation is automatically recorded into the individual’s PDS and b) where if related information needs to be shared it can be, automatically, again via the individual’s PDS.</p><p>Individuals having to manage their cancer journeys provide a good example. Each cancer journey requires a lot of organisation and coordination, with different groups of people for different purposes. For example, the patient will need to arrange and attend appointments and share clinical data with medics; to coordinate arrangements with carers (both paid and unpaid); to manage related domestic arrangements with friends and family (can someone walk the dog while I’m recovering from chemo?); and to connect with specialist service providers.</p><p>In our work with <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">Macmillan My Data Store</a>, we have created specific Circles (e.g. for friends and family or small service providers) where all of these tasks can be undertaken safely and efficiently, thereby lifting an energy and emotional burden off cancer patients while helping service providers work more productively.</p><p>The same core technologies are now also being used in the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/revolutionising-healthy-ageing-200a7edd1016">Revolutionising Healthy Ageing</a> project, where multiple different service providers need to come together to create an integrated, joined-up service for citizens that deals safely and respectfully with multiple aspects of their&nbsp;lives.</p> Web apps <p>For services like these to work, people and the services they engage with need an interface. Traditionally, this interface has been provided by a single, isolated service provider via their website or app. But this requires individuals to sign in to each particular service and doesn’t enable dots to be joined between different providers. And if it’s an app, it creates a new dependency on Silicon Valley monopolists like Google and Apple with their app stores, while requiring that the individual has a smart&nbsp;device.</p><p>What’s more, the interface acts as a data suction device — sucking the user’s data into the systems of the app provider. In other words, the current approach is not only not inclusive, inefficient and restrictive, it is also privacy invading. Our answer: our web&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Web apps can be used on any device connected to the Internet, independently of the Silicon Valley monopolists’ app stores. Our architecture for web apps goes further, placing data that is generated in the individuals’ own personal data&nbsp;store.</p><p>And there is something else. With our Web Apps front line service providers (who know each step of a process inside out) can map each of these steps out, identifying exactly what information needs to be shared when, to create a seamless journey. We have developed the technology by which the resulting interface — the App itself — is generated without the front line service providers having to know anything about software or code. This means the people who really know what each service needs can quickly and easily generate interfaces with service users, as and when they need&nbsp;them.</p><p>With each Web App directly linked to the individual’s PDS, any information that needs to be shared (for example, a form needing to be completed) can be automatically sucked out of the PDS. This makes access to service modules like Smart Directories and Automated Form Filling instant and&nbsp;easy.</p> Citizen Co-design <p>For any service to be really useful, the most important input is that of the user — because users are the only people who really know what it feels like to use a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Every service module we develop — including all of the above — has been developed working with citizens who actually use the service. We have developed skills and processes to facilitate this and we are continuing to research how to best engage with citizens to really make their contributions easy, fulfilling, informative and actionable. This is part of the work we are doing on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">co-design of public services</a> discussed above.</p> Our Inclued&nbsp;platform <p>Many service providers don’t need just one of the above. They need them all — and more. They need channels to communicate and engage with citizens, to send and receive messages and to integrate that ability to act on these messages.</p><p>Working with Glasgow City Council we have built a platform, called <a href="https://mydex.org/platform-services/#inclued">Inclued</a>, which does all these things. Using Inclued, the Council can use the above capabilities to present citizens with incentives and offers, create communities, and seek feedback or direct engagement to gain insights and improve the targeting of their services. Inclued also eradicates form filling through secure, informed data sharing. Inclued is now being used as part of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">our work with the Scottish Government</a> and Connecting Scotland and our work with <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/revolutionising-healthy-ageing-200a7edd1016">Blackwood Homes and Care</a> as part of the three year programme with three local communities working on Healthy&nbsp;Ageing.</p> Consent Management Dashboards <p>For all of the above to work — for citizens to remain in control of their data and to have continued trust and confidence in what’s happening — they need quick, easy, simple ways to see which service provider has had access to what information, for what purposes. They need tools which enable them to make changes — such as withdrawing consent — when and if they want to; and to exercise their rights under data protection legislation if&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Currently this is practically impossible. Most of us have data sharing relationships with over 100 organisations (across health, financial services, public administration, education skills and employment, travel, retail, leisure, media and so on). Currently, to do anything relating to data with them, we have to jump through hoops, signing in to each different organisation’s website or app, navigating our way through to MyAccount, scrolling through Settings and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The costs and hassle of doing this in a consistent way across 100 or more different relationships are so prohibitively high that hardly anyone bothers. What we have today is an entire data ecosystem and economy built on learned citizen helplessness — the realisation that exercising genuine control over your own data is such a vast, time consuming, hasslesome task that it’s not worth even&nbsp;trying.</p><p>We are changing that by building consent management dashboards that enable citizens to see and manage all their data relationships simply, quickly and easily from one place within their PDS. This includes the ability to create general permission and consent settings. What if, for example, instead of being confronted with a separate, different pop-up each time you visit a web site to set permissions for cookies, your PDS could instantly inform the web site that (for example) ‘I am happy with cookies for performance analytics but not for third party advertising).</p><p>Our consent management dashboard is still work in progress. There are still many bits of functionality that need to be built. But the core is there, working to support all of the above service&nbsp;modules.</p> Summary <p>Giving individuals the means to exercise control over their data — to be able to access and use their own data for their own purposes — is easy to say but hard to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Doing it in a way that also helps service providers benefit from citizen empowerment adds another level of challenge.</p><p>We’re not finished with this task by any means. But we have made a good start. Many core capabilities and functions are built and already adding value for both citizens and bona fide service providers. We’ve got many more in the pipeline.</p><p>The opportunity to unleash the full personal, social and economic potential of personal data is immense. And we are now on our&nbsp;way.</p><p>However, for all these services to be truly valuable they have to demonstrate built-in integrity. That’s the subject of our <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">next&nbsp;blog</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">FLICKING THE SWITCH OF PERSONAL DATA</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The 2020 pandemic and resulting work-from-home experience yielded an important conclusion regarding cybersecurity: identity is the new perimeter. Sixty-three percent of all data breaches exploit weak credentials, and incidents like SolarWinds highlight the need to focus cybersecurity on identity and access management (IAM) systems. Many organizations used the pandemic to accelerate their digital transformation projects with a focus on identity, but met additional challenges such as:</p>



<p>Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): employees (new and existing), contractors, and freelancers require flexibility regarding the types of devices used and their capabilities to ensure proper identity verification, authentication, and credential storage.</p>



<p>Passwordless authentication: some devices are capable of securely storing credentials that can be used for proof-of-possession by an individual. This can be a convenience and productivity boost and reduce cybersecurity risks.</p>



<p>Biometrics: with new use cases for remote identity verification, and to further ensure proper identity binding to device-based credentials, biometrics can be combined with proof-of-possession to enable passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>Software-defined perimeters: in addition to or instead of virtual private networks (VPNs), multiple authentication flows can be combined to secure authorized access to specific resources within a perimeter. This can prevent data breaches, even in cases of VPN compromise (as in the SolarWinds attack), while enabling fine-grain audit for data protection compliance.</p>



<p>These challenges can make digital transformation a daunting challenge for many CISO and IT managers already under pressure to maintain their status quo password-based IAM systems. Luckily, the new concept of “auth journeys” lets them move beyond the limitations and complexities of existing AD and LDAP-based approaches. “Auth journeys” combine both authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) into processes defined at the user experience (UX) level instead of low-level auth protocols like OAuth, OIDC, SAML, etc.</p>



<p>An authentication journey is a workflow comprised of multiple steps in authentication and authorization processes available within an enterprise. Such steps include multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometrics, geolocation, PIN, credential checks, and even traditional methods (e.g., username &amp; password). Most IAM systems are never fully replaced but include old and new systems and are carefully migrated over rollout periods that last weeks or months. Journeys provide a mechanism to define rollouts, migrations, deprecated methods, upgrades, and credential recovery paths. Journeys are full lifecycle processes that include onboarding, offboarding and internal steps like Active Directory conditional access checks. IT departments can define minimal journeys for all users, specific roles, and then let users choose their own devices and options for MFA via self-service portals, which allows convenience for users. Some additional benefits of authentication journeys include:</p>



  Compliance &amp; auditing: KYC/AML laws vary globally, so journeys can be customized as remote onboarding becomes more widespread. Onboarding processes can be assessed at various IAL levels and resulting credentials tied to auth processes to directly link the IAL and AAL levels. If logging is part of the journey (as an internal step), auditing can be directly associated with both onboarding and auth processes.  



  Reduction in costs &amp; complexity: A wealth of powerful and effective authentication and authorization technologies are available in the market, but most are complex to manage from a system-level perspective. The security context is lost when dealing with sessions, roles, tokens, and other protocol-specific mechanisms at a low-level of process programming. By managing journeys as high-level definitions of authn and authz processes, CISOs can elevate management of access risks of associated resources above the machine-level programming of OIDC and JWT tokens used to implement such processes.  



  Better vulnerability management: explicit auditing, vulnerability analysis, threat modeling and accessibility enablement that actually improves security and reduces help desk password-reset costs. As in the cyber world, IAM vulnerabilities should be managed, shared and fixed at the journey level, not at the level of a specific protocol implementing a security policy incorrectly.  



  Credential-based onboarding and authorization: new verifiable credentials permit on-demand provisioning for new employees, contract and temporary freelancers who can present such trusted credentials upon signup instead of requiring out-of-band, a prior enrollment in AD/LAP registries. Such credentials, which have expiration dates and explicit privileges, can also encapsulate capabilities to be used in authorization flows.  



  FIDO: allows storage of encrypted credentials across many devices and modalities including security keys, biometrics, mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops with a password. FIDO allows developers to focus on high-level journeys in the IAM perimeter while providing device and security policy options.  



  Privacy, Accessibility, Inclusion and Diversity: Ultimately, such flexibility regarding authentication journeys allows each user to choose their own devices, biometric modalities, and credentials for access to specific resources within their enterprises. Such flexibility enables new paths that help protect user privacy, enable accessibility, and promote inclusion and diversity.  



<p>Journeys let users define their own authentication methods that comply with GRC (Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance) requirements while making choices explicit for IT managers. The IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) landscape may seem to be getting more complex, but only because we’re trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Old methods tied strictly to AD and LDAP registries with groups and their associated roles are only a narrow keyhole from the past into which we can view a broader IAM future. These systems will continue to be used in many enterprises but form only part of the many journeys available to users within the new IAM landscape.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that the word ‘fungibility’ was but an obscure term understood only by economists and asset and commodity traders. Fewer even know that this peculiar word derives from the Latin verb fungi, meaning ‘to perform.’ From these arcane origins, the word is everywhere today, thanks to the meteoric rise to popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), those little nuggets that can turn...</p>

 Lead/Org Update <p>You may have noticed an <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/monthly-roundup-for-holo-holochain-99a372802e2a">uptick</a> in stories, blogs, apps, news and announcements coming from Holo recently. In large part this is simply because there is much more that can be built on Holochain than ever before. The proof of this reality is that the wider community of projects and developers are beginning to move with haste in their respective projects. Simultaneously the Holo development team is now unblocked. Certain feature development had been on pause until Holochain had finished updating to a necessary level of features and stability. This is&nbsp;huge.</p><p>In order to make the sequencing of our interdependent work more visible to our community, we refreshed <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">our roadmap for Holo</a> and included some key Holochain releases.</p> Milestones Clarity Tied to Weekly&nbsp;Updates <p>We’ve renamed a few milestones for clarity but mostly we’ve included additional milestones to be able to more effectively tie our regular development updates to the milestones so that everyone can better understand where we&nbsp;are.</p><p>You will notice that we now have 9 of the Phase 3 milestones completed. An additional 7 of the milestones are what we call our work in progress, each of which is focused on by a specific sub-team. Every week, across the board, we are delivering features into test networks, usable builds for our community, and public releases.</p> Sharding Ready for Developers <p>In the past month the Holochain team released what we call the “Sharding Ready” release. If you are looking at it on Github, it is the release that is numbered 0.0.107. They have since delivered two additional releases that solidify and make those fundamental changes usable by community developers and by the Holo team. These releases of Holochain are precisely what the participants of the Dev Camp are using now for building, testing and deploying their own Holochain applications.</p> New Tools Make Rapid App Development Possible <p>Some amazing tools have also been made available on the tails of the Holochain release. The Launcher, our scaffolding tool, and the Dev Hub all make it easier for developers to adopt Holochain by saving them work and shortening their learning&nbsp;curve.</p><p>The Holochain Launcher is a dashboard that allows end users to install and run Holochain applications locally. This means that Holochain apps are easy to demo, easy to configure for testing by QA teams and community members — and ultimately easy for non-technical users to simply install and begin running on their own computers.</p><p>The scaffolding tool is the first in a set of Rapid Application Development tools — what’s known in the software world as RAD tools. The scaffolding tool provides a kickstart to the process of building an application. It allows new developers to lean on patterns that other more established Holochain developers have designed. It will also let non-developers who are members of product teams use business terms and logic for setting up the basics of an application. For example, if you are designing a blog, the scaffolding tool is where you would define concepts like a post and a list of&nbsp;posts.</p> Dev Campers Show RAD Tools&nbsp;Working <p>Session 3 of Dev Camp is where they introduced the RAD scaffolding tool to the participants and then assigned homework to participants to scaffold their first Holochain application. After that they will package the application and then run it from inside the Launcher.</p> DevHub Makes hApps Testable, Available to&nbsp;Devs <p>The DevHub is another tool that is being tested by a few of our community developers now. It’s a developer console where hApps are uploaded and tested, and where they will be reviewed/rated by other ecosystem developers. This component is critical to Holo in the sense that our Publisher Portal will look to it as the source for all Holochain applications that can be published to the Holo network for&nbsp;hosting.</p> Work in&nbsp;Progress <p>This week our team just finished getting all the various applications and services related to the Holo Platform updated to the Sharding Ready release of Holochain. This means that now Holo hApps and Infrastructure are working with a version of Holochain that exceeds all of our prior baseline performance metrics as compared to the previous releases of Elemental Chat.</p><p>There is so much underway — so we’ve added a small overlay to the roadmap that shows the following parts we are already working&nbsp;on.</p> Next Up: Elemental Chat Public Release (still just a Prototype) <p>Yes, with the performance gains with Holochain, we’re now preparing to let people use Elemental Chat on Holo. We’re working through testing and release processes now so stay tuned for announcements.</p> Publisher Portal &amp; HoloFuel Readying for Pre-Release Testing <p>The Holo team is steadily working on the first pre-release of the Publisher Portal as well as a release of the HoloFuel app with basic transactions of Test Fuel. Development on these two applications had paused previously because certain features required changes in Holochain that are now available with the recent Holochain update.</p> Holochain 0.1.x HDK&nbsp;Release <p>Holochain is preparing to do their first bump to a 0.1.x release. This indicates a greater level of usability and reliability. Our release numbering is based on the standard of <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, where the first number is a major release, the second is a minor release and the third is a patch. Each time a project moves over one decimal in a startup project, it is a milestone worth celebrating as it typically indicates increased stability and documentation for the developers who are dependent on the&nbsp;project.</p> HoloPort Registration Useability <p>Another effort currenlty underway in the Holo team is the new key generation process for HoloPorts. This work will revise the current HoloPort Registration process, adding in critical steps for security as well as making the process more extensible for both our operations team and for the hosts who are registering. This will specifically set us up to build other features required for beta like multi-port registration and identity verification.</p> Wrapping it up with Community &amp; Customer&nbsp;Service <p>As we move forward today we are entering a period of increased complexity for our Community and Customer Support folks. For most of our Dev cycles up until now, we’ve had two sets of users — Hosts and Holochain developers. Others who follow the project have wanted to know what is possible with this new tech, what is available and how it works, and many others have wanted to better understand how it all relates to our token and eventually HoloFuel. This past month, however, saw us push forward to have multiple new tools and applications that are being used by many more developers and now also the end users of the applications those developers have&nbsp;built.</p><p>This means that non developers are asking more questions on our support channels and forums. This will only increase as we do pre-releases of HoloFuel and the Publisher Portal and as other projects make more and more Holochain apps available on the Launcher. We’re going to be working diligently with the community on ways to direct those questions to all the right&nbsp;places.</p><p>So thank you for all the interest and engagement — and a special thanks too for your patience as we stretch and evolve through these wonderful growing&nbsp;pains.</p><p>-Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/q4-2021-update-on-milestones-and-progress-27eb0b0b7e5a">Q4 2021: Update on Milestones and Progress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
