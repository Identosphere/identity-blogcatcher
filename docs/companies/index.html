<p>Are you following the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-04-29/apple-iphone-tracking-operating-system-update-facebook-privacy/100100172">brouhaha</a>&nbsp;in big tech?&nbsp;Apple made a serious privacy change and Facebook is hitting backhard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On&nbsp;April 27, 2021, Apple introduced&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT) feature&nbsp;as part of its iOS 14.5 update.&nbsp;Knowing there would be pushback, Apple announced the ATT feature a year ago but delayed the launch to give app developers&nbsp;time to adjust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT&nbsp;forces&nbsp;apps to ask users, clearly and up front:&nbsp;Do you want&nbsp;us to track your activity across&nbsp;other companies’ apps and websites?&nbsp;The app can&nbsp;briefly&nbsp;justify its reasoning for tracking and, most importantly, the user can say yes or no.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">Facebook is&nbsp;going blue in the face</a>&nbsp;arguing the move will hurt&nbsp;everything from&nbsp;its&nbsp;bottom line to&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">small business</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;free market economy.&nbsp;It&nbsp;tried using&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">“educational screen”</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;implied it would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking">charge a fee</a>&nbsp;tousers who&nbsp;say no to&nbsp;tracking, and even put&nbsp;its case in&nbsp;full-page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-04-29/apple-iphone-tracking-operating-system-update-facebook-privacy/100100172">ads&nbsp;in major newspapers</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook isn’t the only app affected by ATT, but it is the&nbsp;most&nbsp;affected. Let’s dive in.&nbsp;</p>



 What does ATT do?&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>ATT puts user consent&nbsp;to&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;up front for the first time and gives the user unprecedented&nbsp;control&nbsp;over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every time a user opens an app for the first time after the&nbsp;iOS 14.5&nbsp;update,&nbsp;a&nbsp;pop-up privacy prompt&nbsp;will&nbsp;tell them&nbsp;the app wants to track&nbsp;their activity&nbsp;across the internet, give a brief justification,&nbsp;and&nbsp;ask their&nbsp;permission&nbsp;to allow it.&nbsp;Thenevery app that has asked permission&nbsp;will appear&nbsp;in a tracking menu in the iOS privacy settings so the user can review and change their choice at any time, for all apps or certain ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saying no to the privacy question stops cross-app tracking. This means the app can no longer use the user’s IDFA (ID for Advertising) or other identifiers such as hashed email addresses to aggregate data&nbsp;about the user across&nbsp;other&nbsp;apps and sites on the internet. The IDFA is&nbsp;a unique number Apple has been assigning since 2012 to each user’s device to knit together their data and activity&nbsp;across web sites and apps&nbsp;and build a highly detailed user profile for&nbsp;personalized advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the app, a ‘no’ answer will mean&nbsp;turning off the&nbsp;data&nbsp;tap&nbsp;that&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;its&nbsp;targeted advertising and losing a revenue stream if they sell the aggregated data to others, including&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a>.&nbsp;And they’re&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">not allowed</a>&nbsp;to restrict access to features for those who opt out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Facebook’s case, a user saying&nbsp;‘no’&nbsp;to tracking&nbsp;would have&nbsp;no effect on Facebook tracking what a user does on&nbsp;its own platform, but it&nbsp;would stop&nbsp;Facebook aggregating data about&nbsp;that user&nbsp;across&nbsp;other&nbsp;apps&nbsp;and sites.&nbsp;Clearly,&nbsp;it’s this&nbsp;aggregated data product&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;extraordinarily&nbsp;valuable to Facebook’s ad revenue because&nbsp;it shows advertisers exactly what users are browsing and buying. (See&nbsp;<a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">Signal’s&nbsp;recent&nbsp;hilarious targeted ad campaign</a>&nbsp;proving this point, which Facebook shut down.)&nbsp;Of course&nbsp;a user&nbsp;saying&nbsp;‘yes’&nbsp;to tracking&nbsp;would mean&nbsp;the&nbsp;app&nbsp;can&nbsp;continue its free-for-all&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance</a>&nbsp;on the user’s devices.&nbsp;Situation normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>Importantly, the users who opt out will still&nbsp;see&nbsp;ads, just not as&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">spookily relevant</a>&nbsp;ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to&nbsp;ATT,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;had to click on a link&nbsp;in their phone settings&nbsp;to reset their IDFA,&nbsp;which would&nbsp;interrupt data tracking.&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;ATT effectively&nbsp;randomizes&nbsp;the opted-out users’&nbsp;IDFAs&nbsp;and&nbsp;breaks&nbsp;the tracking.&nbsp;Under iOS 14.5, if a user selects ‘Allow apps to ask’ under Settings &gt; Privacy, each app&nbsp;they use&nbsp;gets to implement the&nbsp;ATT&nbsp;privacy prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Highly charged emotional responses to ATT&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>With&nbsp;ATT,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;allows&nbsp;apps to make their case to the user:&nbsp;why we’re asking for your permission for cross–apptracking.&nbsp;And it’s interesting to see how different companies are&nbsp;doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Apple first announced the change, Facebook was the most vocal dissenter&nbsp;and still is.&nbsp;Although an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/ios-14point5-apple-iphone-software-leads-to-german-antitrust-complaint.html">antitrust complaint filed in Germany</a>&nbsp;against Facebook is serious stuff too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook argues&nbsp;ATT will&nbsp;be bad&nbsp;for not only&nbsp;its&nbsp;business&nbsp;but&nbsp;small businesses everywhere that rely on targeted&nbsp;(arguably&nbsp;more&nbsp;effective)&nbsp;advertising.&nbsp;They said&nbsp;it was&nbsp;a hit to&nbsp;the&nbsp;free market economy.&nbsp;And&nbsp;they even&nbsp;implied the possibility of a fee&nbsp;for&nbsp;users&nbsp;who&nbsp;opt out of&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;—&nbsp;a&nbsp;bullying tactic that many&nbsp;experts&nbsp;agree&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">won’t come to pass</a>and a statement&nbsp;that&nbsp;Facebook has since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">clarified and denied</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Electronic&nbsp;Frontier&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;(EFF)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">calls&nbsp;Facebook’s pushback</a>&nbsp;“a laughable attempt&nbsp;…&nbsp;to distract you from its poor track record of anticompetitive behavior and privacy issues as it tries to derail pro-privacy changes from Apple that are bad for Facebook’s business”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes,&nbsp;Facebook will take a hit from ATT but&nbsp;it will&nbsp;still make ad revenue and&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">plenty of it</a>.&nbsp;Absolutely, less relevant ads&nbsp;will&nbsp;mean fewer clicks, fewer sales and less revenue. But, like&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">Google</a>, Facebook still has&nbsp;loads of&nbsp;first party data from which to profit,&nbsp;which explains why the&nbsp;<a>EFF says</a>&nbsp;“Facebook’s&nbsp;laughable&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;against Apple&nbsp;is&nbsp;really&nbsp;against&nbsp;users and&nbsp;small&nbsp;businesses”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Requiring trackers to request your consent before stalking you across the Internet should be an obvious baseline, and we applaud Apple for this change. But Facebook, having built a massive empire around the concept of tracking everything you do by letting applications sell and share your data across a shady set of third-party companies, would like users and policymakers to believe otherwise.&nbsp;Make no mistake: this latest campaign from Facebook is yet another direct attack against our privacy and, despite its slick packaging, it’s also an attack against other businesses, both large and small,” the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">EFF article notes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course&nbsp;Facebook’s&nbsp;is&nbsp;just&nbsp;one perspective&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;companies are using various emotive techniques to justify tracking and&nbsp;to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;(bully?)&nbsp;users into selecting ‘allow’&nbsp;at&nbsp;the ATT privacy prompt.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">Copping heat</a>&nbsp;right now&nbsp;is&nbsp;Canada’s&nbsp;Weather Network&nbsp;app&nbsp;that’s using&nbsp;fear without any justification&nbsp;to make users agree to tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Our position on ATT&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>With ATT,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;is giving&nbsp;users more visibility about tracking and more power to opt out.&nbsp;We feel these are legitimate steps by Apple to enhance consumer privacy. They’re in touch with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer mindset</a>&nbsp;around privacy&nbsp;and they’re responding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;of course&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;also&nbsp;has the luxury of making this change without disrupting its own revenue streams.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a primarily&nbsp;hardware business,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;can readily choose&nbsp;this as a battleground.&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;may be&nbsp;doing this to&nbsp;disrupt&nbsp;Google,&nbsp;and Facebook is just&nbsp;hefty&nbsp;collateral damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What the early&nbsp;opt-out&nbsp;stats say&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Early stats from&nbsp;<a href="https://branch.io/">Branch Metrics</a>&nbsp;on Twitter&nbsp;say,&nbsp;of the people&nbsp;who had the “Allow apps to request to track” box checked&nbsp;in iOS 14.5,&nbsp;only&nbsp;4% of users allowed tracking. That means 96% of people&nbsp;didn’t want&nbsp;tracking. For those who argue that&nbsp;generally&nbsp;users want tracking, these stats are strong rebuttal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What&nbsp;we recommend&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We’ll always recommend that you answer ‘no’ to the ATT privacy prompt. Disabling cross-app tracking is good for your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>. Do it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT is clearly a huge leap for data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;but it doesn’t stop tracking within a single app&nbsp;(remember, it’s only for cross-app tracking). You still need&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized and protected</a>&nbsp;across different services.

			<p>In the previous article, we have discussed <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-3-services-digital-asset-marketplaces-provide-to-issuers/">three services a Digital Asset Marketplace (DAM) can provide to security token issuers</a>. Now, let’s dive into the benefits it can offer to security token investors. Before going into the details, we have listed the standard structure that a DAM provides to investors in this chart below:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 1. Access to curated offerings 
<p>For investors, the main benefit of a DAM is to easily discover curated investment opportunities. The marketplace operator selects issuers of securities depending on its positioning and the value they offer to Investors.</p>
<p>With this selection of investment opportunities, the investor can now access curated offerings and participate in projects that meet their preferences and ensure they only subscribe to projects based on their level of quality. And the whole process is fully digitized, from subscribing to offerings, to making payments, to signing digital signatures. Not only does it facilitate the process, but also provides a smooth digital experience for investors.</p>
<p>A DAM must be compatible with the most adopted blockchain identification systems used on the market. So it allows Investors to directly use their Blockchain Account to prove who they are without submitting the same information for each token. As a result, investors can access various offerings without having to repetitively provide the same information, for example for KYC/AML checks.</p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Primary Market Interface     
	 
		 
			 2. Manage their digital asset portfolio  
<p>The DAM also provides a real-time view of their digital assets through the investor dashboard, enabling investors to better manage their portfolios. Investors can utilize this data to develop a cohesive investing strategy based on their goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. In addition, a built-in communication tool can help investors easily track the announcements and status of their securities on the platform, which helps investors better allocate their assets and adjust their investment strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>For each security token, investors can access the details of the asset, his positions, transaction history and other information.</p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Portfolio Interface     
	 
		 
			 3. Improve liquidity 
<p>Being able to manage digital asset portfolios is important for investors, but equal importance is the transferability of these digital assets. After analyzing the portfolio, investors can then go to the secondary market on the DAM to rebalance their portfolios by selling and buying digital assets on a peer-to-peer basis. Depending on the services fee set by the DAM, the transfer fees can be as little as a few cents and take only a few seconds to execute, compared with days or weeks in the traditional financial world. </p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Secondary Market Interface     
	 
		 
			<p>Ultimately, DAMs bring better liquidity and transferability to their investors through an easy-to-use interface that is also friendly for non-blockchain investors. This is crucial for investors because, with the recent hype about digital assets, more and more investors are turning their eyes to this market and are getting ready to participate. Now more than ever, there is a need for a non-crypto newbies-friendly marketplace. Such a platform makes it easy for traditional investors to take part in the new era of investment to subscribe, manage and transfer their security tokens.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to explaining more in the next article. If you can’t wait, this is an excerpt taken from the ebook we published with CoinTelegraph, <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-era-of-digital-asset-marketplaces/">download here</a>.</p>

  <p>When thinking about the C-suite’s priorities, people tend to focus on growth, security, digital transformation or, more recently, keeping a remote workforce running. All of these aspects are important to keep the business profitable, remain at the forefront of innovation, maintain shareholder satisfaction and ensure that employees are safe, equipped and content. Yet, there is something that underpins every one of these priorities: digital trust. And without it, every area of the business would cease to function.</p>
<p>Digital trust is a concept no business leader can ignore today. With most of the world working online, digital trust is vital in order for CXOs to trust that employees are doing their jobs, that the workforce is keeping security threats at bay, and that trust is cultivated with customers.</p>
 The fundamentals of trust in an evolving cybersecurity landscape 
<p>Trust will always be intangible and requires belief in three key aspects: reliability, truth and ability. We need to have belief that someone or something will deliver on the promises made, can be relied on to be truthful, and is capable of what they set out to achieve in order for us to place our trust in it. The issue of digital trust has come to the fore for CXOs amidst the challenges presented by the pandemic in the last year, as we have shifted to a remote working structure.</p>
<p>In this context, it is even more vital that organisations are aware of which employees, partners and customers they can trust to access their data and systems. Vice versa, these employees, partners and customers must trust that an organisation can protect any personal data they share.</p>
<p>Effective security tools and policies, especially those focused on seamlessly managing the identities of users, help to drive stakeholder trust. And an organisation with stringent security in place can trust that each stakeholder only has as much access to business systems as required.&nbsp; This symbiotic online relationship between organisation and stakeholder is digital trust.</p>
 How organisations can cultivate digital trust through their security policies 
<p>Business and IT leaders must be transparent about the cybersecurity measures and policies they are implementing to foster trust and staff buy-in.</p>
<p>We have seen an increase in the number of cyberattacks during the lockdown period as malicious actors attempt to take advantage of the increased threat vectors. F5’s <a href="https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/2020-phishing-and-fraud-report" title="2020 Phishing and Fraud Report">2020 Phishing and Fraud Report</a> saw a 220% increase in phishing attacks during the pandemic compared to the yearly average.</p>
<p>Okta’s <a href="https://www.okta.com/uk/resources/whitepaper-the-digital-trust-index/" title="Digital Trust Index">Digital Trust Index</a> found that 34% admit to not knowing if their employer has done anything to protect them from cyberthreats, indicating that businesses need to do more to communicate and educate employees.</p>
<p>This is problematic for CXOs, because user uncertainty around cybersecurity measures puts the business at greater risk. If employees are unclear about what is and what isn’t protected by the organisation’s security platforms, they are unable to apply best practice online, so are less able to identify issues when they arise. CXOs must improve their communication with employees to ensure they are effectively educated on their organisation’s cybersecurity measures.</p>
 The importance of education 
<p>Security must always be the first layer of trust. For employers, partners and customers, it is vital they feel secure sharing their data. And for trust to be cultivated by organisations, education is crucial.</p>
<p>Amidst the need for better education, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly evolving, with new tricks and methods tried out frequently. CXOs have a responsibility to ensure that this education is a continuous process. Since the shift to mass remote work, many office workers have become more aware of phishing, data breaches and new risks such as deepfake fraud. But businesses must also ensure they are staying ahead of the game as much as they can in order to combat these new threats with new approaches, and engaging in ongoing conversations with employees while doing so.</p>
<p>In the enterprise, it begins with a Zero Trust approach focused on validating identity before trusting anyone in the digital realm. The ultimate strategy puts identity at the heart of digital security, and invokes risk-based access policies and continuous and adaptive authentication, meaning identity validation is required for user access to be granted. As enterprises move towards this, it is vital that users are kept afoot with the evolving nature of the cybersecurity policies in place. The growth in knowledge across all levels of the business will lead to improved understanding and a stronger belief in the reliability, truth and ability that together form the basis of digital trust. When this is applied effectively, this trust from employees, partners and customers will not only mitigate harm, but will ultimately drive loyalty, revenue and value for organisations. Whether they are aware of it or not, digital trust reinforces each priority on CXOs’ agendas, and will continue to grow in importance as we delve deeper into a digital world.</p>

<p>Covid 19 has impacted the way many businesses work today, and one of the key factors that changed for many of our clients at IDnow were reported spikes in remote verification. The pandemic impacted how we onboard users. The biggest question that came up was how do operators’ onboard players remotely and can IDnow handle the capacity of the volume spikes?</p>
<p>Since March 2020 Covid 19 not only transformed the world and how we operate, but also player behaviour. This is exactly the transition we have observed in online gambler behaviours. Data shows that the online market increase by 29% active users and 7% of players were made up of inactive accounts. What brought on this change?<br>
Businesses adapted very quickly to respond to the pandemic however there were some businesses that unfortunately suffered for not planning; and therefore, some operators were able to leverage this advantage more than others. There are clear differentiators between reactive and proactive business behaviours. Player behaviour changed as bets went up by 12% due to operators creating longer-lasting online slots i.e., longer than an hour.</p>
<p>In May 2020, operators who were active in regulated markets were instructed to perform extra checks including affordability checks, the prevention of reverse withdrawals, and restrictions on bonus offers which came into play eventually on October 31st, 2020.</p>
<p>In a webinar we held with Martin Lycka, SVP Compliance at GVC-Entain, he was able to share his views on responsible gambling:<br>
“Like any other market responsible gambling is critical to its long-term sustainability and this will be the case in Germany. Operators such as Entain and others have rolled out very sophisticated responsible gambling processes, policies and protocols.”</p>
<p>In the run-up to the planning for the Euro’s, there are many other factors that were considered from the end-user experience.</p>
 
 How to keep fans engaged while they are unable to physically attend matches at stadiums? 
 How to create a safe and engaging environment for supporters? 
 How to enable youth and amateurs to keep playing and enjoying football? 
 
<p>Euro 2021 football tournament is expecting a spike in volume by up to 5 to 10 times more than usual. The excitement is visible as the absence of last year’s Grand National also had a clear impact, with only the virtual race running in 2020.<br>
Grand national this year broke records shared from sportsbook apps and across exchanges, with £92.8m traded on the big race, which made up 71% of the £131m bets across the three-day Festival. This represented a 28% increase from 2019.<br>
Cheltenham Festival broke records with £210m in total betting volume; with more bettors at home, the online betting industry is experiencing spikes more than ever before.</p>
<p>Sports has had major setbacks by pausing plans for the partial return of fans to stadiums on the 1st of October 2020 and this due to the rapid spike in Covid-19 cases. It will continue to add growing fears that clubs could go out of business due to potent spikes, and we might continue to see this with the ease of lockdown.</p>
<p>IDnow is prepping for the Euro’s focusing on the user experience and rising cases of fraud. From an operator’s perspective, how does IDnow ensure that players are verified satisfactorily while maintaining the operator’s player conversions? There was a lot of effort made by gambling operators to stay on top of constant changes in online gambling regulations with new guidelines. They have shared that KYC providers like IDnow are seen as a positive influence and KYC facilitator.</p>
<p>IDnow is an identity verification company and has been serving customers with their compliance requirements in some of the most heavily regulated markets with a platform of secure and efficient products. IDnow has seen processes move forward by developing close relationships in Germany with the youth protection ministry. We have worked diligently to ensure our products are compliant with KYC requirements.<br>
Players also can take comfort in knowing that appropriate measure are being put in place for their safety.</p>

   Reactive APIs are a powerful way to handle and serve large amounts of data and large numbers of requests in a web application. They rely on a “server-side event” model in which the client (e.g. your browser) subscribes to “events” on the server, and the server “pushes” events to the client as they become available.

  <p>Reactive APIs are a powerful way to handle and serve large amounts of data and large numbers of requests in a web application. They rely on a “server-side event” model in which the client (e.g. your browser) subscribes to “events” on the server, and the server “pushes” events to the client as they become available.</p>

<p>For simple CRUD applications this is not very useful. However, in situations with millions of “subscribers” it can offer improved performance versus the standard “request-response” paradigm.</p>

<p>Spring Boot 2.0 provided reactive web technology by integrating with <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/reactive-rest-service/">WebFlux</a>, a framework built on top of <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>. Using WebFlux you can create reactive APIs easily in Spring Boot. However, because most Spring Boot applications are CRUD-ish and are backed by relational databases, reactive APIs may not provide much benefit because the underlying database transactions (querying, updating, etc) are synchronous/blocking.</p>

 What is R2DBC? 

<p><a href="https://r2dbc.io/">R2DBC</a> is an API which provides reactive, non-blocking APIs for relational databases. Using this, you can have your reactive APIs in Spring Boot read and write information to the database in a reactive/asynchronous way.</p>

<p>In this tutorial you will develop a Spring Boot application that:</p>
 
   Communicates with an H2 database using R2DBC 
   Integrates with Okta for security using OAuth 2.0 
   Serves reactive streams of data to a secured web page 
 

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<p>Prerequisites: <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">Java 11</a></p>

 Create a Spring Boot Project with R2DBC 

<p>Click <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.4.5.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.dev&amp;artifactId=okta-r2dbc&amp;name=okta-r2dbc&amp;description=Spring%20Boot%20App%20for%20Okta%20%2B%20R2DBC&amp;packageName=com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc&amp;dependencies=lombok,data-jpa,data-r2dbc,webflux,okta,h2">this link</a> or go to <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> and select the following options in your browser:</p>

 
   Project: <code>Maven Project</code> 
   Language: <code>Java</code> 
   Spring Boot: <code>2.4.5</code> 
 

<p>Under Project Metadata, set the values to the following:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.dev</code> 
   Artifact: <code>okta-r2dbc</code> 
   Name: <code>okta-r2dbc</code> 
   Description: Spring Boot App for Okta + R2DBC 
   Package: <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc</code> 
   Packaging: <code>Jar</code> 
   Java: <code>11</code> 
 

<p>Select the following dependencies:</p>

 
   Spring Data JPA 
   Spring Data R2DBC 
   Spring Reactive Web 
   Okta 
   H2 Database 
   Lombok 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Generate to download the project files. Unzip the file and import the project files into your favorite IDE.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect Application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



 Configure and Secure Your Reactive Spring Boot Application 

<p>Open your IDE and edit your application’s configuration file at <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://MY_OKTA_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId=CLIENT_ID
okta.oauth2.clientSecret=CLIENT_SECRET

spring.data.r2dbc.repositories.enabled=true
spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:h2:mem://./testdb
</code>   

<p>Make sure <code>MY_OKTA_DOMAIN</code>, <code>CLIENT_ID</code>, and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> are replaced with values from the Okta CLI.</p>

<p>Open the Java class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add the <code>@EnableWebFlux</code> and <code>@EnableR2dbcRepositories</code> annotations to the main class:</p>

   <code>@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>@EnableWebFlux</code> enables the reactive API, and <code>@EnableR2dbcRepositories</code> configures the application to use reactive database repositories via R2DBC.</p>

<p>Create the persistent entity representing an application user:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;

@Data
public class UserEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    private Long id;
    private String email;
    private String name;
}
</code>   

<p>Define a reactive <code>R2dbcRepository</code> to manage this user entity:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

import org.springframework.data.r2dbc.repository.R2dbcRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends R2dbcRepository&lt;UserEntity, Long&gt; {
    Flux&lt;UserEntity&gt; findByEmail(String email);
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>R2dbcRepository</code> interface abstracts away much of the complexity of managing reactive database connections, but some major differences between this and the non-reactive <code>JpaRepository</code> should be noted:</p>
 
   Methods like <code>findById()</code> which return one entity will instead return a <code>Mono&lt;&gt;</code> object. 
   Methods like <code>findAll()</code> which return lists of entities will instead return a <code>Flux&lt;&gt;</code> object. 
 

<p>A thorough explanation of these reactive types is outside the scope of this tutorial. For a more thorough introduction you can check out the official documentation <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono">here</a>. For now it is enough to know that these reactive types represent data that is changing or not-yet-whole, and it is the responsibility of the caller to “react” to the results as they become available.</p>

<p>Next you will create an OAuth-enabled <code>UserDetailsService</code> which will manage our user authentication and security with OAuth 2.0. Create a file at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain.UserDetails</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain;

// imports omitted

public class UserDetails implements OidcUser {

    private final String email;
    private final OidcIdToken oidcIdToken;
    private final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; claims = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    private final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; attributes = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

    public UserDetails(String email, OidcUserRequest oidcUserRequest) {
        this.email = email;
        this.claims.putAll(oidcUserRequest.getIdToken().getClaims());
        this.attributes.putAll(oidcUserRequest.getClientRegistration().getProviderDetails().getConfigurationMetadata());
        this.oidcIdToken = oidcUserRequest.getIdToken();
    }

    @Override
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getClaims() {
        return new HashMap&lt;&gt;(claims);
    }

    @Override
    public OidcUserInfo getUserInfo() {
        return new OidcUserInfo(getClaims());
    }

    @Override
    public OidcIdToken getIdToken() {
        return oidcIdToken;
    }

    @Override
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getAttributes() {
        return new HashMap&lt;&gt;(attributes);
    }

    @Override
    public Collection&lt;? extends GrantedAuthority&gt; getAuthorities() {
        return Collections.singletonList(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("USER"));
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return email;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This <code>OidcUser</code> object represents the authenticated user and loads user information from the various claims provided by the OAuth identity provider.</p>

<p>Create the user service at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain.DbUserService</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain;

// imports omitted

import java.util.Map;

public class DbUserService implements OAuth2UserService&lt;OidcUserRequest, OidcUser&gt;, ReactiveUserDetailsService {
    private static final String CLAIM_NAME = "name";
    private static final String CLAIM_EMAIL = "email";

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public DbUserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public OidcUser loadUser(OidcUserRequest oidcUserRequest) throws OAuth2AuthenticationException {
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; metadata = oidcUserRequest.getIdToken().getClaims();
        String email = (String) metadata.get(CLAIM_EMAIL);
        String name = (String) metadata.get(CLAIM_NAME);

        Flux&lt;UserEntity&gt; userLookup = userRepository.findByEmail(email);
        UserEntity userEntity = userLookup.blockFirst();

        if (userEntity == null) {
            userEntity = new UserEntity();
            userEntity.setEmail(email);
        }

        userEntity.setName(name);
        userEntity = userRepository.save(userEntity).block();

        return new UserDetails(userEntity.getEmail(), oidcUserRequest);
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails&gt; findByUsername(String username) {
        return null; // not used
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>DbUserService</code> handles requests from OAuth 2.0 to automatically load users into the database. The user’s information will be created or updated on each login via the reactive connections provided by <code>UserRepository</code>.</p>

<p>Secure the application by creating a configuration file at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.config.SecurityConfig</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.config;

// imports omitted

@EnableWebFluxSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public ReactiveUserDetailsService userDetailsService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        return new DbUserService(userRepository);
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain configure(ServerHttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http
            .csrf().disable()
            .authorizeExchange()
            .pathMatchers("/", "/index").permitAll()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2Login()
            .authenticationSuccessHandler(new RedirectServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler("/protected"))
            .and().build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>@EnableWebFluxSecurity</code> annotation secures the application according to the settings defined in <code>configure()</code>. There are some small differences between this and the normal security configuration classes usually seen in non-reactive Spring Boot apps, but it should appear familiar. To note:</p>
 
   The home page (<code>/</code> and <code>/index</code>) is exposed and not protected by authentication. 
   All other requests/pages are protected 
   OAuth 2.0 login behavior is enabled by <code>.oauth2Login()</code> 
   After a successful OAuth 2.0 login, the user is redirected to a protected page: <code>/protected</code>. 
 

<p>Now to create the web pages. Create a file at <code>src/main/resources/pages/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Home&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is the main page for the application and does not require authentication to access. Next create a file at <code>src/main/resources/pages/protected.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Protected&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Okta login successful!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>For serving these pages with WebFlux you will create an application router that maps HTTP requests to resources in the codebase.</p>

<p>Create a Java class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.ApplicationRouter</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@Configuration
public class ApplicationRouter {

    // (1)
    @Value("classpath:pages/index.html")
    private Resource indexHtml;

    // (2)
    @Value("classpath:pages/protected.html")
    private Resource protectedHtml;

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction&lt;ServerResponse&gt; route() {
        return RouterFunctions
            // (3)
            .route(RequestPredicates.GET("/index"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))

            // (4)
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/protected"), request -&gt; pageResponse(protectedHtml));
    }

    private static Mono&lt;ServerResponse&gt; pageResponse(Resource page) {
        return ServerResponse
            .ok()
            .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_HTML) // (5)
            .body(DataBufferUtils.read(page, new DefaultDataBufferFactory(), 4096), DataBuffer.class);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In this class you can see the following:</p>
 
   The page resources created above are injected as <code>Resource</code> objects at (1) and (2). 
   A mapping to the unprotected <code>index.html</code> page is defined in (3). 
   A mapping to the protected <code>protected.html</code> page is defined in (4). 
   (5) When creating the server response (which is a reactive <code>Mono</code>), the <code>TEXT_HTML</code> content type is specified. This makes sure your browser renders the content as an HTML page and not plain text. 
 

<p>One more step is necessary to get the application running. R2DBC does not automatically generate the database schema, so you must do it yourself.</p>

<p>Create a file at <code>src/main/resources/schema.sql</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>CREATE TABLE USER_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR2,
    name VARCHAR2
);
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>@Bean</code> which will automatically detect and execute this script on startup. Open your main application class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add a <code>ConnectionFactoryInitializer</code> bean:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean // added
    public ConnectionFactoryInitializer connectionFactoryInitializer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        ConnectionFactoryInitializer initializer = new ConnectionFactoryInitializer();
        initializer.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        initializer.setDatabasePopulator(new ResourceDatabasePopulator(new ClassPathResource("schema.sql")));
        return initializer;
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>initializer.setDatabasePopulator()</code> will pick up the <code>schema.sql</code> file and execute it to create the <code>user_entity</code> table on startup.</p>

<p>Open your command line tool and run the application:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/okta-r2dbc-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and you should see the unprotected index page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/protected</code>. You should be prompted to log in with Okta, and after successfully authenticating returned to the protected page:</p>

<p></p>

 Stream Data to a Webpage Using R2DBC 

<p>You’ve successfully implemented R2DBC in your Spring Boot application, but the behavior is still non-reactive: querying and saving users during authentication is still a synchronous, blocking process. Now you will implement a non-blocking API endpoint which reads from the database using reactive techniques.</p>

<p>Create a persistence entity at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database.HeartbeatEntity</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

// imports omitted

public class HeartbeatEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    private Long id;

    private Long timestamp;
    private String username;
    private String text;

    // getters and setters omitted
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>@Repository</code> for this entity at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database.HeartbeatRepository</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

@Repository
public interface HeartbeatRepository extends R2dbcRepository&lt;HeartbeatEntity, Long&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Open the initialization SQL file at <code>src/main/resources/schema.sql</code> and add the table definition for <code>HEARTBEAT_ENTITY</code> so it looks like this:</p>

   <code>CREATE TABLE USER_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR2,
    name VARCHAR2
);

CREATE TABLE HEARTBEAT_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR2 NOT NULL,
    text VARCHAR2
);
</code>   

<p>The database model for <code>Heartbeats</code> is complete, now you’ll create:</p>
 
   A service to generate and save heartbeats to the database 
   An HTTP endpoint routing to serve a reactive stream of heartbeats 
   Simple JavaScript to display the stream on a web page 
 

<p>Create the heartbeat service at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.service.HeartbeatService</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.service;

// imports omitted

@Service
public class HeartbeatService {
    private final HeartbeatRepository heartbeatRepository;

    @Autowired
    public HeartbeatService(HeartbeatRepository heartbeatRepository) {
        this.heartbeatRepository = heartbeatRepository;
    }

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000) // 1 second
    public void create() {
        HeartbeatEntity heartbeatEntity = new HeartbeatEntity();
        heartbeatEntity.setTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        heartbeatEntity.setText(randomString());
        heartbeatEntity.setUsername("system");
        heartbeatRepository.save(heartbeatEntity)
                .log()
                .then()
                .subscribe();
    }

    private static String randomString() {
        int lower = 'A';
        int upper = 'Z';

        return IntStream.range(0, 10)
                .mapToObj(i -&gt; {
                    double range = upper-lower;
                    char charIdx = ((char)(lower + (range * Math.random())));
                    return new String(new char[]{charIdx});
                })
                .collect(Collectors.joining());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>create()</code> method is marked with Spring Boot’s <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation, which will cause the method to be called asynchronously on a schedule you define. Specifying <code>fixedRate = 1000</code> means the method will execute every 1000 milliseconds (i.e. one second).</p>

<p>To enable scheduling, you must also add the <code>@EnableScheduling</code> annotation to a configuration class. Open the main application class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add it:</p>

   <code>@EnableScheduling // &lt;-- added
@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }

    // other code omitted
}
</code>   

<p>Open your application router at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.ApplicationRouter</code> and modify the <code>route()</code> method to add a routing for <code>/heartbeats</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@Configuration
public class ApplicationRouter {

    // other code omitted

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction&lt;ServerResponse&gt; route() {
        return RouterFunctions
            .route(RequestPredicates.GET("/index"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/protected"), request -&gt; pageResponse(protectedHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/heartbeats"), request -&gt; {
                Flux&lt;Long&gt; interval = Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
                Flux&lt;HeartbeatEntity&gt; heartbeatEntityFlux = heartbeatRepository.findAll();
                Flux&lt;HeartbeatEntity&gt; zipped = Flux.zip(heartbeatEntityFlux, interval, (key, value) -&gt; key);

                return ServerResponse
                    .ok()
                    .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM)
                    .body(zipped, HeartbeatEntity.class);
            });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Within the <code>/heartbeats</code> routing you are:</p>
 
   Defining a <code>Flux</code> named <code>interval</code> which will publish a <code>Long</code> object every second (the value of the <code>Long</code> is not important here, just that it publishes every second) 
   Defining <code>heartbeatEntityFlux</code> which is a <code>Flux</code> of all <code>HeartbeatEntities</code> in the database 
   Creating a “zipped” <code>Flux</code> which interpolates items from the two <code>Flux</code>. An item will be published from <code>interval</code>, and then one from <code>heartbeatEntityFlux</code>, and then one from <code>interval</code>, etc. 
   Returning this stream with a <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>text/event-stream</code> 
 

<p>Open the protected HTML page at <code>src/main/resources/pages/protected.html</code> and modify it:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Protected&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        $(function() {
            var cnx = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/heartbeats');
            cnx.onmessage = function (e) {
                var data = JSON.parse(e.data);
                var htmlText = '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.id+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.timestamp+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.text+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
                $( "#heartbeatTable &gt; tbody" ).append(htmlText);
            };
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Okta login successful!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heartbeats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table id="heartbeatTable"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;ID&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Timestamp&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The JavaScript function:</p>
 
   Opens a streaming connection with the <code>/heartbeats</code> endpoint defined above 
   Creates an HTML table row whenever new data is received from the stream 
   Appends that table row to the body of <code>heartbeatTable</code> 
 

<p>Start the application again:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/okta-r2dbc-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/protected</code>. When the page loads you should see a streaming, constantly updating list of heartbeats.</p>

 Introduction &amp; Digital Trust Challenges 
<p>Mathieu: I wanted to start the conversation today, John, by making the statement that achieving digital trust is difficult. Some background to this, and showing in trends overall, is that businesses, governments, and organizations, are adopting digital mediums to interact with their customers, their employees, their vendors, and their citizens. Everyone’s on a digital transformation journey today. Secondly, people are demanding more privacy in all their activities nowadays, and I think we’re seeing the best signals for this coming from the largest companies in the world. Apple is a very good example of this; they’re using privacy as a feature inside of their marketing, but they’re implementing capabilities inside of their operating system and their ecosystem to really push user-centric consent and privacy. At the same time, the laws around privacy are changing rapidly, and everyone’s trying to adapt to these. That brings us around again to the statement I started off with; achieving digital trust is difficult. I think people realize it’s tough to achieve today, and there is a great deal of fraudulent behaviour and other issues that seem to get in the way of people conducting businesses online.</p>
<p>This takes us to where we are today, in the internet era where there is a trust gap. To illustrate my comment about fraudulent behaviour; a very straightforward example of this that occurs frequently is phishing attacks that happen online. It’s quite easy for someone to gain access to my email address, which is a central point for me to interact with all sorts of different organizations. It’s very easy for someone who gains access to that to reset my passwords for various accounts that I have all over the place. Once they’ve reset my password, then they are able to take over my account. This happens every day, because it’s very easy for people to impersonate other people on the internet. That’s one side of it, and then there’s another side; there are just tons of things that aren’t possible to do on the internet today at all. When we start talking about more high-value, high-risk transactions, these are situations that are the most challenging. Most of the value that’s generated out of the internet today comes from advertising or e-commerce, but high-value high-risk transactions still rely on this real-world or paper credential era. As we’re looking to move from the current internet era towards this new era of digital trust, I think it would be helpful if you were able to give an overview of how we got here. Perhaps we can take a step back, before the internet era, and discuss the paper credential era — I think that sets a good framework for where we’re going with these new digital trust models.</p>
<p>John: Sure. Thanks for that introduction, Mathieu; it’s good to be here. That’s a lot of material to work with there, so I’ll give it a crack.</p>
<p>First, we’re talking about digital trust and trust in general. That’s a very high-level idea, so let’s break that down a little bit. When we talk about trust, generally speaking, we’re going to focus on a relationship between two parties. For example, perhaps between me and another individual like you; or between me and a business that I’m going to do something with, or a business to a business. My full-time job is with the province of British Columbia, and there’s a trust model between the government and its citizens. In all of these cases, I’m talking about a relationship between two parties. The determination of trust is a combination of things; do I have some type of method of conveying trust between those two parties in the context of a transaction, and do I have an understanding of why I would trust that other party?</p>
<p>In the case of a business to a business transaction, we tend to develop relationships through human interaction. We find each other’s business, we’re going to become a supplier or a customer, and then we tend to have a mechanism by which we formalize that relationship. We call it a contract, and contracts are everywhere. That’s one of the key mechanisms we have in society for establishing a formal relationship, and defining the boundaries of that relationship. If somebody goes outside of those boundaries, it’s governed by the contract. And, what is the contract governed by? Well, it’s governed by law, that has been set forth by a democratically elected society, in our case. Those laws set out the boundaries for what can happen between businesses, between people and businesses, and between governments and people, and governments and businesses. That is the nature of our society right now.</p>
<p>Essentially, personal identity is given to you by the government in a lot of ways; that is, in an administrative sense, and not your philosophical sense of being, and who you are. Rather, the fact that you can say that your name is John Jordan, and your age and so forth; those attributes or characteristics of you are attested to by the government, based on an administrative process of registration and their authority to manage that. In the same way for businesses, we have business registries, and they have a process for creating legal entities. It is these sources of truth, or these administrative authorities, which allow us to enter into contracts. We know who that party is, and we have physical evidence of this through an identity document, such as the BC services card, which we commonly call a driver’s license. Or, contracts such as the legal contracts that are drawn up and can be referenced, like articles of incorporation and so forth.</p>
<p>Back before these things we call computers were around, it was difficult to create or recreate these documents, because printing presses were big and expensive, and there were techniques that could be deployed by them to prevent fraudulent copies of these things. Because things happened at paper speed, the risks were relatively low in terms of the wide-scale ability to defraud.</p>
<p>So, that’s in a way the foundation of our society: we have Acts; those Acts create powers in the government to identify persons, including humans and legal entities, and the rules by which those entities can interact. We formalize those rules and contracts, and that’s how the world effectively operates, in a lot of ways. However, now in the era of the web, we don’t have a way to convey that architecture into the web. In turn, the web has introduced a new actor, that we don’t have an equivalent for in the physical world. On the web, we have this idea of ‘login’; there’s an intermediary between me and another person, or between me and the business I’m trying to do something with, and so forth. This intermediary has no defined role in any of our legal structures; there’s no such thing as ‘the login service’ in the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia. Likewise, in the Freedom of Information and Personal Protection Act, there’s no concept of ‘login’; there are only ‘persons.’ Because we have this login service, there’s a sort of ‘middle person’ in between our relationships, which has some very significant consequences.</p>
<p>One of the consequences is that it means that none of my relationships online are confidential: meaning that they’re not known only between me and the party I’m trying to interact with. If I go to the gym, or I go to rent a car, or I go to the doctor or the lawyer or whatever, that interaction that happens is private. It’s not known, generally speaking, by any other entity, including the government. If all of my relationships were known, then we would be very unhappy — we call that surveillance, and that would be an erosion of our privacy.</p>
<p>As a result, we don’t even have the conditions on the web for privacy. By the very architectural structure of it, there must be a login service in order for me to connect to another party. By definition, that means it’s not confidential. Often, the information or data that I exchange with that other party is subject to loss; that other party I’m talking to gathers a lot of information about me, and if they don’t protect it well, it can be stolen. Then, the really bad side effect occurs, which is that personal information that has been stolen about me can be replayed. It can be used by a malicious third party that has gained access to it through possibly poor stewardship of it by the business that I did business with, or worse; they sell it. A bad actor can replay that information and pretend to be me, and we call that identity theft. I think I’ve outlined here the two big, unforeseen consequences of the login architecture of the web, which is that a) none of my relationships are confidential and b) the data that is exchanged through that non-confidential interaction can be lost and replayed without my permission and knowledge, and therefore I can be impersonated.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I covered all of your domains, but to me, these are the fundamental flaws. It’s not as if that concern was foreseen 20 or 30 years ago; it was simply the way we built computer systems. Computer systems were expensive, and we needed a way to share them. The way to share them was to provide access to that computer system, which we accomplished through a new ceremony or ritual called login. To use a funny word, there’s no analogue of that digital ritual in the physical analog world. So, this is where we find ourselves, in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s so much to unpack there. I love the focus on relationships over and over again between two parties. When you think about login being this new party that shows up in the middle there; at the end of the day, there’s a reason why it showed up — to try to make things more secure or make it actually happen. However, they inherently ended up removing value from the system altogether. It seems as if there’s a back and forth in technologies, where things go from distributed, to centralized, to back to distributed. It feels as though in the real world, or in the paper credential era, it’s really a distributed way of doing things. There’s nothing centrally stored: everyone has their credential or their ID, and they use it how they wish, with the relationships that they interact with. Whereas, in this internet era, you lost that direct connection or direct relationship with the entities that you were interfacing with.</p>
 The Credential Trust Triangle &amp; The Role of Trust over IP 
<p>Mathieu: People are always curious about this when they’re looking to move into this next phase — let’s call it the digital trust phase. They play inside of the model, and the model has been represented in different ways. The one that’s gotten the most traction, is this <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/WP0010-toip-foundation-whitepaper/trust/vcred_trust_triangle/">Credential Trust Triangle</a>. There’s another model which looks like a diamond, so I could call it the Credentialed Trust Diamond, which is otherwise known as the Government’s Trust Triangle. Is that type of model similar to the model that existed in the paper credential era? How is this model being replicated or ingested into this new digital trust era?</p>
<p>John: I discovered the Trust Triangle, as we call it, in around 2017. As we started to understand it, we said, “But, this is how we do things already in the real world.” Sometimes, I talk about, “Let’s just forget this really awful nightmare of the last 40 years of computing and remember how we did it back in the old days, when we developed relationships with our friends, our business partners and so forth, and we had the underpinning of the government.” You know, the government is there; we don’t always know it or acknowledge it, but I described how the government underpins the ability for us to establish these trusted relationships. We can go back to that now.</p>
<p>When we talk about the trust triangle, we use this jargon called “Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers,” and that exactly maps to the world that we have today. We often play those roles at different times and in various interactions. To give an example: let’s use the business registries because I’ve been doing a lot of work with BC Registries over the years. Originally, we would say that BC Registries is going to be a Verifier. It’s going to take on the Verifier role; you’re going to show up at BC Registry’s door, and you’re going to say, “I’d like to incorporate a business.” They say, “Great, tell me some things about yourself, so that I can understand who I’m doing business or working with. And then, what is it you want to do?”</p>
<p>They’re verifying this information. They have a business process to approve it, and when they approve it, they become an Issuer. What they issue to you, are your Articles of Incorporation and perhaps other documents (I don’t dive into the super gory details of the corporation). The ultimate expression of your successful administrative act of creating a corporation is your Articles of Incorporation. You would take those Articles of Incorporation; you might go down to the bank and open a bank account with them, using proof of your identity, proof of your Articles of Incorporation, and proof of you being an officer in that company. At that point, the bank has been acting as a Verifier, and then they issued you a bank account. All the while, you as the individual, and you as the individual representing the corporation, are what’s called the Holder.</p>
<p>So, the Holder is the person or entity that receives things from Issuers, and presents them to Verifiers. This is extremely common. As soon as you put the jargon aside, you realize that this is exactly what happens in any trusted interaction — all of them. The fact that you play all three roles; it depends on where you are in a particular process what role you might be playing. You might not always play all three, but you’re likely going to play a couple of them. That’s the way we’ve always organized things, and it has simply taken a while for the computing world to come to a place where we recognized that there is a way to replicate that set of relationships using digital technology.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what the role of the <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip/">Trust over IP Foundation</a> is trying to do, which is to introduce a couple of things. One is to bring a little more structure to the set of technical capabilities that allow us to do this, and the second, (and this is really a key differentiator of the Trust over IP Foundation mission) is that it recognizes that there are actually two parts to trust. There’s the technical or mechanical aspect of trust, which I referred to earlier as contracts. Those are technical documents, that are highly structured and understood and recognized by law, and in the paper physical world. And then, there’s a set of governing authorities and aspects that make that contract enforceable. That’s why I talked about the Business Corporations Act — it’ll be named different things in different jurisdictions, but it’s always there. That’s exactly the legal framework, under which a contract is even valid. That’s what makes it possible to have a corporation, or a non-profit society, or different legal entities that can be recognized in a court and able to enter into agreements, and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>That’s the governance framework. In fact, in the digital world, it’s the same. It’s just that we have no way, digitally, of representing a contract, or an agreement, or even a relationship, in some legally recognizable way. That isn’t something that was foreseen by the technical model of the web, so yeah, that’s the mission of the Trust over IP Foundation. The uniqueness of it, is this bringing together of the business/legal aspects, combined with the technical aspects, that allow us to create the conditions for trusted digital relationships. We hope that if there’s broad adoption of this, the big vision is that if parties choose to have any contractual relationship possible, using the internet as the communications mechanism and essentially replacing the web model, then there would be no logins. Relationships will be peer-to-peer, and there would be trusted interactions between those peers. Ideally, privacy laws and other laws would recognize those interactions as equivalent to what we have today in the physical world. Contracts would be upheld, and all the correct legal terms would be able to be upheld in the court systems of your jurisdiction. It’s a big vision, but I think that’s where we want to go. I think that would be a fair representation of the goals of the members.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I would agree with that. Having had many interactions with several dedicated and smart members of the Trust over IP, I think that that’s everyone’s goal. The internet has done such incredible things and created so much value. But now, to take it to that next step; it’s about creating this other layer that gives us this digital trust. You’ve described perfectly the trust triangle model of the Issuer, Holder, and Verifier, where today, the Verifier in scenarios is often referred to as the ‘Relying Party.’ In that model, they’re relying on data from someone. Whereas, today, they don’t have to rely on anything specific. Whatever they’re given at the point of a transaction can be verified against its source. It can be verified that it’s reliable, that it’s authentic, and its provenance; there are transparency features with this too. All of this is made possible, and the whole model fits within the dual stack architecture that you just described. That is, the governance and the technical layers, where you have the business, the legal, and the tech, on the technical side.</p>
<p>To finish off this dialogue, John; right after this discussion, we’re going to have some working group leads have a conversation with us, to talk a little more about the different working groups and different layers within the dual-stack architecture. Would you mind giving listeners of the podcast, who might not be familiar with this, what are these four layers? How do they play together? And, why do they matter so much in this model?</p>
 The Role of Working Groups in the Community 
<p>John: Sure. As I mentioned, the idea of the Trust over IP model or stack is that it has two sides. One side is concerned with the technical means by which to establish trusted digital relationships. That is, peer-to-peer connections, with protocols that can work through those peer-to-peer connections. In particular, protocols that allow for what we call <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">verifiable credentials</a> to be issued to Holders, and for Verifiers to be able to request from Holders cryptographically protected proofs that they’re holding these credentials, and sharing the data that’s held with them under the control of the Holder.</p>
<p>The other side is the governance side, which says that the services and means by which these technical capabilities are offered actually have a set of rules and actors behind them, that you can inspect. You can decide if you like how they’re operated, and therefore, make a determination about their trustworthiness. The working groups are structured in similar fashions: we have working groups who are focused on the technical stack, and we have working groups concerned with the governance stack.</p>
<p>Essentially, the first set of working groups looked at creating a community of practice around how we create governance artifacts, and decided to have a community of practice around how we create technical artifacts. Then it was decided to have a group where we understand what it would take if we want to put these things into practice. So, we have the Governance Stack working group, and the Technology Stack working group, both of which are more concerned with creating the generalized tools, documents, standards, and so forth. And then, we have the Ecosystem Governance working group, and the Utility Governance working group. I might be messing up the names; I apologize, they’re not in front of me right now.</p>
<p>However, these are communities of practice, where practitioners come together and share their expertise and their experiences so that they can help others create new ones, faster and better, with less friction. We can learn from each other, and it’s been just about a year that we’ve been together. I think the real value that we have right now in Trust over IP, is this idea that there’s a community of practitioners out there who are learning together, sharing with each other, and creating outcomes. Whether it’s implementation guides, or blueprints, or other kinds of knowledge-based artifacts, they can codify how to create digital ecosystems or communities, where there’s a common set of trust interactions that they want to be able to describe to their members.</p>
<p>I think that is really an important part of the Trust over IP organization, and is something that’s new and different. What I’m really happy about, and what I think is going to be our area of growth, is that we are bringing people into this world who would never have been involved in the more technical communities out there. We have organizations, that are not technology-based organizations. They obviously use technology, and they recognize the importance of trusted digital relationships to their business. They want to learn more and participate in the growth of that, and they see it as a competitive advantage to their businesses, to be able to understand how to do that. I think that’s clearly the direction that we want to continue; to keep growing that community. And, more and more, helping others understand why it’s important that they have <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">trusted digital relationships with their customers</a>, with their citizens, and with their friends and family, for that matter.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think it’s incredible to see the number of ecosystems that have been popping up over the past year. New ones that are popping up, as well as existing ecosystems, are coming into the Trust over IP for guidance on how to build with digital trust in the core of their <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">digital transformation strategy</a>. I think it’s been over the past year since the Trust over IP has been active; the popularity around verifiable credentials is growing like crazy. I think everyone is interested in it.</p>
<p>Once people get their beaks wet a little bit with verifiable credentials, they begin to be aware of all of the other activity that should be taken seriously: the governance pieces that we’re talking about at the core, and the peer-to-peer communication channels that totally disrupt the way we do things via APIs today. Once people start realizing this stuff, they begin to see the value beyond the simple economic efficiencies, or the checkbox compliance stuff that people use these tools for, today.</p>
<p>The last comment is that I really echo your thoughts of the community. The community is strong; it’s vibrant, and it’s growing. You and everyone else have done a fantastic job of bringing these people together. As you alluded to, it’s so interesting to see people from different areas that you would never talk to in your day-to-day life, but you’re able to learn from them. The power of these open communities, is that you could build on top of what’s happening, in order to really leverage the learnings and the failures of other projects, and build on top of that experience. I think in this digital age, or in the age of digitally native people and products, the value ultimately comes from community. Whoever has the strongest communities is going to create the strongest digital value. So, I love how the Trust over IP is set up to really push this forward. A huge thank you, John, for what you have done to move this forward. It’s incredible to see the community growing around this.</p>
<p>John: Well, thanks, and really it’s the members that do this, so thank you for this as one of our members. To all the other members who are working hard and well, I look forward to the next year and seeing where it goes.</p>
 Introduction to Working Group Leads 
<p>Mathieu: Hey guys, thanks for doing this. Some of you may be new to the audience listening to this, and some of you have been on existing podcasts before. What I wanted to do today with each one of you is to have you give a brief introduction on yourself; your background, what expertise you bring to the Trust over IP, and what interested you in the Trust over IP, to begin with. Let’s start with a newcomer to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7EbSvsNpYPKK1WVAXANGWo">podcast</a>; I’ll throw it over to Karl; if you want to open it up, Karl? </p>
<p>Karl: Thanks, Mathieu. My name is Karl Kneis; I’m the COO of idRamp. Our background is in building enterprise ecosystems, solving complex identity problems, and service delivery for multinationals. Our interest in Trust over IP, particularly, was based on our experience working with corporations and business organizations solving ecosystem development problems. We find that the need for repeatable design patterns and open source standardized frameworks helps our customers save time and money. These features simplify adoption of the new <a href="https://northernblock.io/">technology around verifiable credentials</a>, so Trust over IP was very much a natural fit for idRamp. We joined up as founding members, and I’ve been working on hosting the Ecosystem Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you, Karl; we’ll get to the Ecosystem Foundry in a few minutes. Maybe I’ll shoot it over to someone who’s participating in another foundry working group; André Kudra. André, you’ve been on the podcast before, talking about identity and access management, and how verifiable credentials and the Trust over IP stack could be used for those use cases. I know Karl is familiar with what you guys do as well, but, André, would you mind giving a brief introduction for any newcomers, on yourself, your expertise, and what brought you to the Trust over IP?</p>
<p>André: Absolutely, Mathieu, thank you for the opportunity to be here again. My name is André Kudra; I’m the CIO of Esatus AG in my day job. In my night and weekend job, I fill various roles in SSI community groups. I’m a trustee of the Sovrin Foundation, and my company Esatus is a founding and steering member of Trust over IP. I am also a board member of the Teletrust IT Security Association in Germany, with more than 340 members. I try to promote Self-sovereign Identity everywhere in these groups. Since 2015, when we first ran into SSI, I saw that this is the way ahead. Last year, when the community convened to form Trust over IP as the organization that will deliver the missing trust layer in the network world, we said, “Well, we absolutely have to be part of this group, and we have to be part of the community in this new foundation, Trust over IP.” From the European perspective, since we are based in Germany, we want to bring the European angle into the works. Since the beginning, I’ve proudly been serving on the steering committee and as the co-chair of the Utility Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you, André; it’s fantastic to have you back on here. Now, I’ll throw it over to Scott. Would you mind giving a brief introduction on yourself and what brought you to the Trust over IP?</p>
<p>Scott: Thanks, Mathieu. I’m Scott Perry; I’m an auditor in the identity and cybersecurity space, and I’ve been doing that for my whole career. I became very focused on the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) area about 15 years ago, when I was working with the US Federal PKI. We were creating standards around how you can interoperate identity credentials in that ecosystem. I am also a licensed WebTrust Auditor and a player in that ecosystem, where you exchange secure certificates that get attached to websites. So, I have worked with several different governance authorities. I was seeking fairness by actually participating in the rules that are established between interoperable trust. I got involved in the verifiable credentials in the SSI space about five years ago, working to establish the governance framework for the Sovrin Foundation. I have architected the Trust Assurance Framework for Sovrin as well. I’m a co-chair of the Trust over IP Governance Stack working group, and it’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, Scott. Last but not least; someone who’s been on the podcast before, with quite a popular episode. Paul, a lot of people are interested in what you’re bringing to the community, but for those who don’t know you: would you mind giving a brief introduction on yourself and what brought you to the Trust over IP community?</p>
<p>Paul: Sure. I’m Paul Knowles; I’m the head of the Advisory Council of the Human Colossus Foundation. At the foundation, we have combined expertise in three synergistic domains; decentralized authentication, decentralized semantics, and decentralized governance. We sit at the centroid point of those domains. My background is with clinical trial data management and statistical analysis, and in that domain, they have 25 years of very rich semantic experience. At Trust over IP, when it was first developed, there wasn’t a space specifically for semantics; at Trust over IP, they work with a dual stack model of governance versus technology, which doesn’t mention semantics at all. So, I approached the leadership group and suggested, “Why don’t we set up a semantics group so that we can talk about how data can geometrically and semantically fit together?” This is something you need to do for good machine learning, and analytics, and stuff. At Trust over IP, I’m the convener of the Inputs and Semantics working group. The Input side is more about authentication, and the Semantics side is more about deterministic semantics. I’m happy to be here and looking forward to the chat.</p>
 Trust over IP – Working Groups Overview 
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; What I’d like to do now, is jump into the day-to-day of what’s happening inside of the Trust over IP. There are tons of activities happening throughout various working groups within the Foundation. For background; when the Foundation came to be just over a year ago, there were four initial working groups that were established. There were two working groups that fell within a ‘Stack’ category and two that fell within ‘Foundry’ categories. The two that fell within the Stack category, were the Technical Stack working group and the Governance Stack working group. The two that fell within the Foundry category were the Utility Foundry working group and the Ecosystem Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Throughout the past year, as Paul described, he, and others, realized that there was a gap in the work that was happening. A new working group was created — the Inputs and Semantics working group — which fell inside the Stack category, as well. We’re going to go through each of these working groups to give a better idea to the audience of what’s actually happening within the Trust over IP. I think an exciting one I would like to start with is the Ecosystem Foundry working group, which sits at that top layer of the Trust over IP stack. Karl, you’re very lucky to have visibility into this and to be a chair of this working group. Could you give a bit of background of why you got into the Ecosystem Foundry within the Trust over IP? Why you took that leadership position, and how things have evolved, and what’s happening within the Ecosystem Foundry? </p>
<p>Karl: Well, part of my background included over 20 years of working with enterprise architecture, solution architecture, service delivery, and in that ecosystem development space. When the opportunity came up to form the Ecosystem Foundry working group, I was very eager to volunteer to chair that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: What happens from session to session, now? Are you seeing the rise of more ecosystems that are using the Trust over IP stack? What direction is this going in?</p>
<p>Karl: The Ecosystem Foundry working group is focused on acting as the ‘front door’ of that business layer of the Trust over IP stack that you saw in the introduction. As that front door, we help business organizations and consortiums incubate their governance frameworks and their ecosystems. We want those aspects to be shared as open-source, repeatable design patterns, for whatever or whoever their stakeholders may be.</p>
<p>We have a diverse community that is growing at a pretty regular and rapid pace. For example, we have the Yoma ecosystem that’s sponsored by UNICEF, focused on helping youth in Africa up their skills and promote themselves for employment opportunities. We have the Global Legal Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), which has been acting as a pioneer in adapting verifiable credentials as global legal identifiers. The Good Health Pass ecosystem that was recently formed as a working group within Trust over IP, is working with ID2020 in the World Health Organization to create interoperable solutions working with many different providers. I think that ecosystem alone has roughly 80 people that I’ve seen in some of those meetings, all from different organizations; medical, private consultants, government folks — very dynamic.</p>
<p>There’s another ecosystem sponsored by Identidad and the United Farm Workers, that’s focused on helping migrant farmers have an identity and use identity in their food distribution networks. We have education ecosystems, and the list goes on. There are so many; I couldn’t easily go through the whole list. But, at the end of the day, what we see is that businesses have a need for a standardized architecture and a standardized approach to these governance questions, that they can reproduce and repurpose to help them do business. Some of the discussion in the industry around governance is a little bit confused because governance is often perceived as a blocker or a bureaucratic inconvenience. In the Foundry working group, we can see that we’re leveraging all the great thinking that comes out of the Stack working groups to incubate and form these business models, and help accelerate adoption of this new technology. First and foremost, we’re standardizing trust across different business communities and business objectives.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, Karl. Scott, since you’re a co-chair or the chair of the Governance Stack working group, are the Foundry working groups’ customers’ to the work that you’re doing? How do you collaborate with the Ecosystem Foundry working group? I know this is probably the broadest question I could ask, but could you perhaps give a bit of background on what governance is in the context of digital trust? </p>
<p>Scott: Sure. You’re exactly right in what you’re saying, as far as the way that Karl’s group and my group interrelate. Karl’s group is out there, doing the outreach and working with a diverse group of needs in the marketplace. Karl needs standard specifications, recommendations, templates, white papers, and tools, so that he can provide that outreach for his customer base. So, that’s what the Governance Stack working group is focused on; where you start.</p>
<p>If you’re building a house, you have got to have a blueprint. If every builder that’s building a house has a standard set of how blueprints look — they have certain colours, certain notations, certain categories — then, when they get that blueprint, they know exactly how to build a house. Likewise, you have to start with the blueprint of what a governance framework looks like, and so we’ve spent time and energy on putting together what we call the ‘governance meta-model.’ That is, the standard set of categories and requirements that every governance framework needs to have. It also needs to have the structure so that when they become interoperable, you know exactly where to find certain pieces of information. Certain pieces of information are required in every governance framework, and it also has to have the flexibility to be able to work with a variety of different risk models associated with it. Some ecosystems are dealing with lots of requirements due to the mitigation of risks; some don’t have those constraints. So, we need to be able to provide all of the options in order to serve a wide variety of different needs.</p>
<p>We do have very focused areas that we’ve already invested in; we have a scope. You have to define what the ecosystem is, what are the boundaries of it, what the components are, and the players and actors that participate in it. Who governs it, whether there’s an authority or a designated party that drives the requirements that are listed in ‘must’ statements, or ‘should’ statements, or ‘may’ statements. These outlined requirements drive the directives that happen from the governance authority: what are the principles that are operating within that governance authority. Certainly, the Sovrin Foundation has advanced many of the principles of SSI, and some of those are actually baked into some of the governance frameworks that we’re seeing. So, we also need to have objectives within those governance frameworks. What are they? What are the outcomes they’re trying to achieve? It obviously needs to be risk-based to drive the mitigation, because, in the broad spectrum of things, governance frameworks try to reduce risk in some way, shape, or form and should include privacy and security by design.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Awesome; we’ll get back to governance a little later on in the conversation. I’d like to hop over to the other Foundry working group.</p>
<p>André, I think it’s interesting, and Scott described this too, that they’re serving the Foundry working groups. You obviously want to make sure that you’re serving it with a purpose, so having the business requirements being driven down from the Ecosystem working group is really pushing where a lot of the innovation and standards need to happen throughout the rest of the stack. André, you have a similar experience to Scott through the Sovrin Foundation. Additionally, you have quite a nice lens, in that you are not only working on an ecosystem solution through IDunion, but you’re also co-chair of the Utility Foundry working group, which is on Layer One of the Trust over IP stack. Would you mind giving a little more background on the activities that are happening at Layer One at the Utility Foundry working group, and how you look at the collaboration with the rest of the organization?</p>
<p>André: Absolutely, Mathieu. I think we need to start off by getting a better picture of the utility we are talking about. Everyone is talking about utilities. These are the fundamental things that are laying the foundation for everything else that’s happening on the dual stack. A utility is something that everyone has a different understanding of. To try to put it in layman’s terms; we are building an infrastructure that is comparable to things like a mobile telephone network. With a utility, we’re essentially creating the trust infrastructure where you can have the cryptographic trust mechanisms in our network that everyone can use. The utilities are building the fundamental block of infrastructure upon which the use cases are based. These are then defined by ecosystems, with the governance in place.</p>
<p>This is what the Utility Foundry working group is dealing with. We help everyone who wants to embark on their own utility journey, with getting up to speed and getting started. In more practical terms, what we do is that we give them a guideline, based on which they can execute their own journey. This is the six-stage model that we have laid out, which is called our Utility Project Lifecycle Management Guide. First, you gather your information in the ‘learn stage,’ then you convene to get the people who want to do it, to get together and build your utility. Then, you define the management and governance scope, and the methods and tools that you want to use, and then you actually create. So, before that, that’s all data gathering and getting up to speed. In the ‘create’ stage, you actually get together and establish a legal entity, which you may want to have. In the ‘implement’ stage, you implement the governance model, and onboard the members. Then, you maintain everything, which means you run the ledger, the utility, the infrastructure, on which the trust layers above are built. As I’ve mentioned, you have to have some kind of governance framework, that is, in fact, governing the network, and the utility, and the actors of the utility, and the participants in the network</p>
<p>This is what we helped people to understand, and to traverse through these stages to ramp up their own utility. As an example, IDunion is a very major initiative in Germany, and it is both a utility project as well as a project that is funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in Germany to implement use cases. This is precisely what we are doing; getting through these stages and making it work on this example. Sovrin has been the pioneer in that round, having done all that without the Trust over IP stages being there to guide them.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Wonderful. I think we share the same thought, André. I’ve repeated this over and over again; people tend to overlook this layer sometimes, as it’s not the most attractive aspect from an outside perspective. However, the need to have this root of trust under the stack is crucial, and I think the work that the Utility Foundry working group is doing to provide that base for everything to function is tremendously important.</p>
<p>André: I don’t want to forget to mention that this is obviously something that is not only driven by me; I have great help there. Dan Gisolfi from IBM has been the co-chair all along, and obviously, you, Mathieu, are doing a tremendous job with supporting all the activities and throwing in many work hours. So, let’s take this opportunity to thank you, also, for being there.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Right, that’s why I talked it up! Thanks, André.</p>
<p>Paul, how do you see your work in the Inputs and Semantics working group being inside this? As a Stack working group, you’re also functioning as a supporter to the Foundry working groups. The way I look at the activities that your working group is doing, is that for this stack to take off and for adoption to really pick up, a lot of the stuff you’re doing is going to facilitate that. What’s the output that’s coming out of the working group, and how are you collaborating with the various ecosystems?</p>
<p>Paul: As you mentioned, it’s a different lens than the other stack groups. Where they look at governance versus technology, we look at data inputs versus semantics, or data entry versus data capture, if you like. Because we’re still obviously a very full space without having to specify where people are in the four-layer stack, it’s turned into a bit of an innovation space. That is, people who are working with centralized solutions and everything, still have a space in this whole ecosystem to be able to express what they’re doing, and their needs. They are bringing all of their expertise within their domains into this rich space.</p>
<p>I would say, for anybody new coming into Trust over IP, the Inputs and Semantics working group is a nice entry point from a centralized space. They can come in, they can learn about decentralized technologies, and then, when the time’s right, they can be pushed into the ecosystem side, or the utility side, or the technology, or the governance. I think it’s a nice place to enter the space.</p>
<p>We work on a vertical structure and a horizontal structure. When I say a horizontal structure; we’ve got a bunch of task forces underneath that. We have the Notice and Consent task force, the Privacy and Risk task force, and the Storage and Portability task force. All of these discussions happening in those groups feed back into the Inputs and Semantics working groups so that we can start thinking about how some of this stuff knits together. We’re building this huge amount of expertise. For example, in the Storage and Portability task force, we’ve had people from Inrupt talking about solid pods; next week, they’re talking about authentic chain data containers. We’ve got all these new technologies coming into this space. As a group, we find out what the best bits of those are, and we try to work together to get a nice, interoperable solution for all of those things.</p>
<p>We work on a vertical structure, as well. We’ve got a Healthcare task force, and underneath the Healthcare task force is an FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) focus group. Those guys have been super busy at the moment, because of the Good Health Pass Collaborative. I co-chair the Common Data Models and Elements group. In that group, the EU and the World Health Organization have said that FHIR is the common data model that they want to use, so obviously, all the work they’re doing in the FHIR focus group is super important for that whole initiative, as well. It’s a very active group, and it’s pretty unrestrained with the stuff that can come into it. I hope that answers your question.</p>
 Selling Digital Trust to C-Level Executives 
<p>Mathieu: That was fantastic. I really love that all of you have showcased the collaborative aspect of the Trust over IP; how the Foundation is able to work with different communities, and people are able to come in, people are able to share stuff. You mentioned Inrupt just now, Paul; and Karl, when talking about the Good Health Pass earlier, you mentioned a couple of other organizations. I think that’s not talked about enough: how friendly the community is, and how easy it is to work together and learn from each other. Everyone has the same goal of driving digital trust forward, and that benefits everyone. It’s more about growing the pie together.</p>
<p>From that perspective, I think what we would like to do now, is maybe open it up and have a little more of a discussion. We’ve covered the different working groups, and I have a few topics here that I’ll throw your way. I’ll throw the first one towards you, Karl. Anyone else, please feel free to jump in, as I’m sure you have thoughts of your own, and experience around this as well. The first thing I would like to ask, Karl, is: how has your experience been, selling the Trust over IP stack to enterprises or to C-level executives? How do you approach these conversations?</p>
<p>Karl: Well, our enterprise customers come to us with enterprise stacks, right? A typical enterprise already has a pretty robust, and usually complicated, governance and their own conglomeration of technology that’s architected together. What we do, is show them how Trust over IP can be used to augment those existing investments in existing ecosystems, to help amplify standardization, amplify interoperability, and ‘future-proofability’ (I think that’s not a proper word). We help them to adopt incrementally things like verifiable credentials and great new utilities, like the ones you’re hearing about in this session. Again, these things are a toolset for the Trust over IP stack to help organizations. Most of our customers are established enterprises, so they come with all of that baked in, and that’s my day-to-day reality. However, in Trust over IP, we also have what we call ‘green-field ecosystems,’ meaning that they’re starting from scratch, and they don’t have to traverse all that. To use your term, the way it’s ‘sold’ is to say, “You have a hundred questions; well, here’s a hundred answers.” It’s a simple way to help answer repeated problems around creating trust in a digital and distributed ecosystem, if that answers it.</p>
<p>André: If I may add a bit to that: obviously, people have often heard a variety of things about&nbsp; SSI, and the missing trust layer on the internet, and so on. They don’t have a defined understanding of what’s going on and what this can do for them. In fact, the dual stack model helps very well, to slice and dice the problem and illustrate connecting points for the solution, and for their understanding. You effectively can use the model to pick people up where they are standing, and traverse through the dual stack and make it more tangible to them. Then, in the end, you can come to an understanding, where you tell them, “Look, if you embark on this journey, you have the potential of cutting your own complexity.”</p>
<p>It’s exactly what you’re talking about, Karl. The complexity and conglomerates of infrastructure, which has heterogeneous governance and processes that are not well aligned, so you can help them portray a better future. In this new model, they can reduce the complexity and use the modules that Trust over IP with its technology components is delivering, to solve this and get to a leaner organization that is more future proof. That’s exactly the same way that I perceive the situation. Trust OIP is a great vehicle for transporting all these messages in a concise and consistent way.</p>
<p>Scott: Mathieu, I think one of the things that’s key, is that, as Karl had mentioned, people come with their own sphere of control. If they issue credentials, they can manage what it is. However, we’re dealing with situations where an ecosystem creates and issues credentials, whether it’s for SSI or for other purposes. Other ecosystems that are not related need to be able to rely on that. Where are they going to go to create that transitive trust between ecosystems?</p>
<p>That’s what we’re trying to define within our organization. We see that, for example, with the Good Health Pass, where you have health credentials that are very focused and very health-related. But, these individual credentials are being used for travel — a totally different industry — and they have to be able to work together to compare the requirements between those needs, between the issuers and the verifiers, in order to benefit the populace.</p>
<p>Paul: I’d also add that in a truly decentralized economy, or a dynamic data economy, we call it; there are three main domains that need to be truly decentralized. There’s identity management, there’s data management, and there’s access management in those spaces. You’re in a data life cycle; you can think of it as data entry, data capture, and data exchange. In those three spaces, it’s really about authentication, in that what you enter into the system comes from an authentic source. There are deterministic semantics, meaning that once data has gone into the system, you have to capture and structure it. You want to know that those items that you’re capturing are deterministic, meaning that no matter how many times you copy it across various networks, that same hash always equates to the same thing.</p>
<p>The last piece is decentralized governance, and that’s all about access management and authorization; that’s more the data exchange part. When you talk about decentralized governance, you want to make sure that there are no roadblocks getting in the way of those sorts of access issues. It’s quite rich; it’s not only focused on verifiable credentials. I think a lot of people come into this space and think it’s all about authentication, but it’s actually broader than that. It’s about authentication, determinism, and authorization. We can handle all of that somewhere in the organization, or within the foundation.</p>
 ToIP Governance Models 
<p>Mathieu: Just to riff off of the comment about the fact that if you’re creating credentials within an ecosystem, you don’t necessarily know how they’re going to be used in the future. With the comment about health credentials being used for travel, this comes back to ensuring that when you are creating a supply of credentials inside an ecosystem, you want to make sure that it’s good quality data. It’s the same thing over and over again: if you have garbage in, there’s garbage out. You want to make sure that what’s coming in, is high quality.</p>
<p>Scott, some of the stuff when you’re talking about building governance models, and maybe working with the Good Health Pass to do these things — what are some of the components that you take very seriously within the governance models, if it comes to registries? How do you look at that whole concept?</p>
<p>Scott: Well, there are a variety of ways that you can get transitive trust. You start with the cryptographic layer; making sure that we’re all using the same cryptographic tools. We have machine-readable rules engines, and the rules need to be built, and everyone needs to have agreement on what rules need to be put into these engines, and on the output. There are requirements, but also you have great disclosure. As Paul was mentioning, you have to have clarity on what the payloads are in transactions. Finally, you need to have clarity on the requirements: what do you require when I issue a credential? What am I getting, when I get the credential? What was built into the credential? What verification was done when the credential was issued? What’s included in the payload of that credential so that it can be used outside of its potential sphere? We’re focusing mostly on disclosure and clarity of requirements to allow others to actually use it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: When an external organization comes in, and there’s been quite a few that come in through the ecosystem foundry and directly to the foundation, as well for consultation. The Ontario government is a good example of one that came into the Trust over IP, and I know the UK government had come in as well. Anyone could jump in here, who was involved with these consults, but how does the Trust over IP guide these public sector groups? Are there differences between guiding the public sector versus the private sector? </p>
<p>Scott: Well, I could start it off because I have been working with the UK, and I was involved in the Ontario activity. These are interested communities; they want to promote digital life, digital communication. We’re still in the midst of a pandemic, and we’ve changed our focus around how digital life is. We want to improve digital life, and we want to foster trusted communication, because our lives have been restricted over the last 14 months or so. How do we create the communication and interoperability standards, to allow these communities to foster more trustworthy online communication? They’re interested parties, but they’re basically incubating the ecosystems that would fall more into Karl’s realm.</p>
<p>Karl: You have the side question there, about, how did we convene that? How did we respond? It’s an open community, where we all collaborate. We say, “Okay, there’s this call for a response: is this worthy of the community, to put together different resources, to try to articulate a response?” When something like the BC Government project comes up, it’s a great opportunity to educate a large group of people on best practice approaches to decentralized architecture, decentralized design, and all the principles around trust. The way I like to discuss it with some of my customers, is removing the need for trust. That’s the problem: the fact that if I need to trust you, to me, that’s a problem. Personally, I’d rather just not have to trust you. What is it you say, Paul? Assurance, not trust.</p>
<p>Paul: Yes,&nbsp; cryptographic assurance, right!</p>
 Digital Trust Ecosystems &amp; Collaborations 
<p>Mathieu: André, I think that what’s happening in Germany is extremely exciting, where people are taking this architecture and this viewpoint very seriously. How does Germany go about approaching this whole thing, really looking to adopt the Trust over IP architecture?</p>
<p>André: Yes, I think we still need to pull them in a bit more to Trust over IP, so I’m trying my best here to make that happen. I think it’s good, that at the higher political levels in Germany, at least they have an understanding of what’s going on there in the world. They are leveraging the great momentum that the SSI community has built throughout the last few years. We are very happy that, on the highest political levels, the understanding is now there that with Self-sovereign Identity, and with the European ecosystem of leveraging Self-sovereign Identity, they can have a distinction against ‘Big Tech.’ Plus, they can have an interoperable and open ecosystem that will help to drive European interests and organizations forward.</p>
<p>I think this is now well-known, and the momentum is ever-growing. In fact, this month, coming from the Chancellery in Germany, there will be a project that has been driven for the past month. The first pilot will become public, and then I think we will see a lot of stuff happening. This is on top of the IDunion initiative, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, so there are lots of different streams working in the same direction in SSI. I think this is based on the understanding that this is a global topic, which Trust OIP is helping to shape, and build, and make more understandable and digestible for everyone who wants to get on the journey.</p>
<p>Trust over IP has such a great resource pool of talented people who are thought leaders and experts in their fields. Trust over IP is a great point where you can tap into this knowledgeable resource pool. This is exactly what we see happening with Good Health Pass and the government transportation works that have already been done. This wouldn’t be happening if there wasn’t the notion that the thought leaders of the world are getting together to work on these topics, and everyone sees the benefit of tapping into that. I totally see the value and the advantage that the Trust over IP is providing there.</p>
<p>Paul: It’s a nice place to incubate new collaborations between the people that are interested in decentralized technologies without necessarily being at the government levels. I’ve seen a lot of people that are working in spaces, and then they think, “Oh, I love what you’re doing, we’re doing this. Oh, that’s cool.” They collaborate, and they build some kind of new technology, so that’s really nice to see — it’s very organic. It’s not all about Trust over IP; they can shoot off and do their own side projects and then come back to Trust over IP and explain what they’ve done and what kind of things they’ve solved. So, in that way, I think it’s a super organic space.</p>
<p>Karl: I think André hit a really important point for me in the day-to-day; the value of Trust over IP is that you’d be hard-pressed to find any community that has such a diverse set of very well-informed and intelligent members on the subject. I don’t think most budgets could support paying, even on a consulting basis, to get this diversity of skill and diversity of perspective. For me, personally, that’s the day-to-day value that’s really immeasurable when you consider the commitment to the community. The reciprocal value back to me, is simply learning from all these fascinating minds, and these projects like the IDunion project and all the LISSY work out there, that in turn, is inspiring ecosystem and utility envisioning in the United States. I know that US senators, for example, have been discussing the great work that André’s been talking about.</p>
<p>Scott: To add to Karl’s point, the Good Health Pass joined with Trust over IP in solving a global problem. They marshalled nine drafting groups together, and there’s been a concerted effort in the last month to put documents out. We have 150 pages right now; very well constructed recommendations. It’s just a tremendous amount of effort that could not be done, unless you have an organization putting them all together.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s tough to keep up with all the momentum that’s happening in the space. I echo your thoughts, Karl, and everyone else. With the number of intelligent, hard-working, well-intentioned people that are going in the same direction, it’s tough to keep up. It’s interesting that as more projects or ecosystems are popping up, they’re laying the foundation for others. Something you maybe didn’t think was possible yesterday, is today, and you have the blueprint in front of you to create a project based on that.</p>
<p>Karl: Another wonderful aspect is that you also have competitors — companies that are competing directly in the same space, doing the same thing — joining their minds together and coming up with better and more powerful solutions for their customers, because of that reciprocal benefit. It’s something you hear about with newer members: sometimes they’re shy about their own Intellectual Property or their own companies. But quickly, as you start to participate in the community, you’ll see that there are very fluid and agile ways to share ideas and really improve your own commercial objectives while improving the greater objectives around digital trust and interoperability.</p>
<p>Paul: For all of this to work, there’s an interesting space that’s going to be developing over the next couple of years in the data governance authorities, at the jurisdictional level, and even more for the trust ecosystems within those jurisdictions. You’re forcing this sense of collaboration, for people that are trying to solve a common problem or working for a common purpose. I think Trust over IP is just a fantastic framework to start noodling these spaces, which are becoming inevitable for the whole thing to work. It really is a fantastic space to be noodling in.</p>
<p>Mathieu: One aspect that excites me quite a bit, and I know André brought this up in the past, too, is that there’s so much momentum behind verifiable credentials as a whole. If you take the bigger umbrella, the whole digital identity space is understanding some of the benefits that come with verifiable credentials. But, one of the underappreciated innovations that I think is going to disrupt so many things is the API-less aspect to it. I could completely disrupt spaces and be significantly more agile than others, by being able to leverage services without needing to do an integration.</p>
<p>André: Totally. This is one key part of my speeches these days. We call it Self-sovereign Identity, and the ‘identity’ word implies we are dealing only with identity, but in fact, it’s so much more. SSI is a key enabler of any type of digitalization effort, because we’re able to pass on trustworthy data, without ever having agreed on an interface before. Obviously, this requires our understanding of the data model and the semantics, which is totally Paul’s domain. This is the key requirement that we have to pass on with each credential, but then the whole merit of a data-driven economy can unfold without APIs being specified upfront. I think this is the real game-changer.</p>
<p>So, even though it’s called Self-sovereign Identity — this is the term that has been coined, and I know that many people don’t like it — it’s so much more. It’s an enabler for transporting trusted data across the network world. This is brilliant, and this is the reason why everyone’s going to like it and love it at some point. It’s an inevitable piece of all the digitalization efforts.</p>
<p>Karl: That perspective matches our day-to-day with our enterprise customers. As soon as they understand the concept of a verifiable credential, password-less login, data privacy, data minimization, and all that, they love all those ideas. However, that’s just scratching the surface.</p>
<p>We talk about digital transformation; think about all the analog processes that are still moving around. All the papers are still being pushed for verification and any kind of business process. For example, we had one education customer in a public sector engagement, where they wanted to issue payslips as verifiable credentials, to be interoperable with loans, and in getting real estate and housing for their students and their alumni. I think that digitization is where you find the full depth and the breadth of the value of this technology. The credentials, the password-less login, that’s all great; the market’s seen a lot of that, but there’s real depth in answering the call to digital transformation, that the enterprise has been trying to resolve through several generations of technology. We finally have some very important quantum leaps forward to improving the digital trust experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Paul: There’s another important aspect, as well. We’re talking a lot about the transient objects with verifiable credentials, but I’m really interested in where the source of that data is coming from. That’s another nit that we’re working on; not just in this community, but across a number of communities. Finding out the persistent records in a database — when I say a database, it could be a database that’s held in a personal data store, that’s under your control — but that’s your root of authenticity, if you like. From there, you can build your verifiable credentials and stuff.</p>
<p>It’s a super interesting space, because you can think of it as the control being totally right back with the citizen with all of this. They have access to their data; they can create credentials from that; it’s got an authentic source that’s been certified by certifying authorities. The important thing is that the data throughout all of that can flow from peer-to-peer, being safe and secure using verifiable credentials, semantic containers, good semantics, and all of that stuff. You’re working peer-to-peer, and it’s totally secure. The whole ecosystem will just unfold and be an amazing place for safe transacting.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s fantastic. I love your point, too, Karl, where you’re only scratching the surface with use cases like password-less authentications and certain access protocols. With these types of use cases, you could 10x current processes. But, the stuff that I think excites all of us, is the hundred and thousand x possibilities that are going to grow the entire pie.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to all of you for doing this today; it was a wonderful conversation, and I look forward to part two at some point.</p>

The Economist’s comprehensive overview of the future of&nbsp;banking Photo: Micheile Henderson<p>A <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021-05-08">great collection of articles/special reports from The Economist</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>). PDFs of the entire collection are attached.</p><p>First, on “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/08/a-future-with-fewer-banks">a future with fewer banks</a>,” a reminder that banking and in particular, “money” historically hasn’t been about technology much at&nbsp;all:</p><blockquote>Because technology has disrupted so many industries, its impact on banking may seem like one more example of a stodgy, uncompetitive business made obsolete by slick tech firms. But money and banking aren’t like taxis or newspapers. They make up the interface between the state and the economy. “The deep architecture of the money-credit system, better known as banking, hasn’t changed since the 18th century, when Francis Baring began writing about the lender-of-last-resort,” says Sir Paul Tucker, formerly deputy governor of the Bank of England and now at Harvard. “Which means it has not, so far, depended on technology at all, because Francis Baring was writing about it with a quill&nbsp;pen.”</blockquote><p>But technology is now coming to eat banks’ lunch. The Economist discusses <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/how-fintech-will-eat-into-banks-business">how that’s playing out</a>. Check out this&nbsp;chart:</p><p>Also from the collection:</p>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-bigger-role-for-venture-capital">Comparing venture capital to whale&nbsp;agents</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/when-interest-rates-turn-negative">When interest rates go&nbsp;negative</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/when-central-banks-issue-digital-money">On CBDCs</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/will-the-dollar-stay-dominant">The future of USD dominance</a>  <p>So where does all of this leave us? According to The Economist, it’s “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-brave-new-world-for-banks">a brave new world for banks</a>.” We’ve talked plenty about how digital wallets are disrupting the space. But it’s important to emphasize as well how fundamental banks are to how the global system works. Central banks define monetary policy but ultimately, it’s the banks that execute the plan — holding 90 percent of broad money supply in deposits.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/politics/cryptocurrency-regulation-sec-ripple-labs.html?referringSource=articleShare">the NYTimes pointed out</a>, “the value of all outstanding cryptocurrency has jumped to about $2.4 trillion — or more than the approximately $1.2 trillion of United States currency in circulation worldwide.” On the other side of things, China’s fintech giant Ant “can reach 400 million customers outside of China through its partners,” according to The Economist.</p><p>In other words, this isn’t just about fintech disrupting another industry or the furious rise of crypto — it’s about the rejiggering of the world monetary&nbsp;system.</p><p>These are uncharted waters. Back to <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-brave-new-world-for-banks">The Economist on a brave new&nbsp;world</a>:</p><blockquote>But this revolution brings with it new problems. Because they benefit from network effects, payment platforms will tend to concentrate into just one or two giant intermediaries. As more activity migrates away from banks, existing monetary-policy mechanisms may become obsolete.The risk of losing control over the monetary system has lit a fire underneath usually staid central bankers. Projects to accelerate fast payment systems have cropped up worldwide. So have e”orts to create central-bank digital currencies, a digital form of paper cash to compete with the digital payments of private giants. In China, where payments&nbsp;!rms are most advanced, more than 100,000 people are already using a digital yuan in pilot projects.</blockquote><blockquote>The roll-out of what amounts to a new monetary system thus comes with risks. Many of the issues it raises are as tricky as the financial stability and inclusion problems of old. As people move their money into cbdcs they will pull it out of banks, threatening the system developed to foster loans without overt state interference in credit allocation. The digital involvement of the central bank in everyday transactions would not only increase the risk of such interference but also be a gift to those wishing to snoop on citizens. And the concentration of the economy in digital money, whether it is run by private firms or by a central bank, could provide a new route for malicious actors to destabilise systems through cyberwarfare.</blockquote><p>So the risks of getting it wrong are high. But the risk of inaction could be even&nbsp;higher:</p><blockquote>Central bankers that run reserve currencies can head off the potential nightmare of leaving Facebook or China’s government in charge of global payment systems by issuing digital currencies of their own. If they do it sensibly, digital money could even become a force for good, not just a defence against disaster. “There is a parallel with biological evolution,” said Sir Jon Cunli”e of the Bank of England in March. Evolution is generally slow, but at times of geological or environmental change it can be rapid. A bewildering number of life forms may appear and many do not survive. This is “a helpful lens through which to look at what’s happening now,” Sir Jon suggested. When people look back at this period they will see banking in a period of very rapid change. The hope is that it may emerge in a better&nbsp;state.</blockquote><p>As a reminder, all 7 articles from <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021-05-08">the special report</a> are attached as&nbsp;PDFs.</p><p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/generosity-is-trending-neobanks-are-tapping-into-that">Generosity is trending.

CBDCs make self-sovereign identity more relevant than&nbsp;ever <p>Something anyone who has followed GlobaliD has known for some time — here’s the FT on “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88f47c48-97fe-4df3-854e-0d404a3a5f9a?shareType=nongift">Why CBDCs will likely be ID-based</a>:</p><blockquote>“Central banks are realising CBDCs will have to be intimately linked to identity to deal with illicit finance and bank disintermediation risk.”</blockquote><p>Why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters:</p><blockquote>When money goes ID-based, one also has to consider the broader parameters of the potential data creep. Just how far should that personal file reach? What sort of non-monetary information should or shouldn’t be contained within it? To what degree should account-holders be able to refuse access to their data to third parties? Who might the government entrust to manage and operate these schemes, and how can we hold them to&nbsp;account?</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/04/27/google-promised-its-contact-tracing-app-was-completely-private-but-it-wasnt">Google Promised Its Contact Tracing App Was Completely Private — But It Wasn’t — The&nbsp;Markup</a>  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/28/1022940/slum-dwellers-india-google-plus-code-access-delivery-apps/">Slum dwellers in India get unique digital addresses through&nbsp;Google</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">Peloton’s leaky API let anyone grab riders’ private account data — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-idemia-matt-thompson-mobile-id-identity-on-the-edge-705059/">INTERVIEW: IDEMIA’s Matt Thompson on the Reality of Mobile ID and ‘Identity on the Edge’ — FindBiometrics</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRsvz6pRtZE">Edward Snowden Talks Privacy Coins at Ethereal&nbsp;2021</a>   3.

What magic teaches us about misinformation: <p>A cool piece from /gregkidd. The FT (PDF attached):</p><blockquote>Why do people — and by “people” I mean “you and I” — accept and spread misinformation? The two obvious explanations are both disheartening.</blockquote><blockquote>The first is that we are incapable of telling the difference between truth and lies. In this view, politicians and other opinion-formers are such skilled deceivers that we are helpless, or the issues are so complex that they defy understanding, or we lack basic numeracy and critical-thinking skills.</blockquote><blockquote>The second explanation is that we know the difference and we don’t care. In order to stick close to our political tribe, we reach the conclusions we want to&nbsp;reach.</blockquote><blockquote>There is truth in both these explanations. But is there a third account of how we think about the claims we see in the news and on social media — an account that, ironically, has received far too little attention? That account centres on attention itself: it suggests that we fail to distinguish truth from lies not because we can’t and not because we won’t, but because — as with Robbins’s waistcoat — we are simply not giving the matter our&nbsp;focus.</blockquote><blockquote>What makes the problem worse is our intuitive overconfidence that we will notice what matters, even if we don’t focus closely. If so, the most insidious and underrated problem in our information ecosystem is that we do not give the right kind of attention to the right things at the right time. We are not paying enough attention to what holds our attention.</blockquote><blockquote>The art of stage magic allows us to approach this idea from an unusual angle: Gustav Kuhn’s recent book, Experiencing the Impossible, discusses the psychology of magic tricks. “All magic can be explained through misdirection alone,” writes Kuhn, a psychologist who runs the Magic Lab at Goldsmiths, University of&nbsp;London.</blockquote><p>Check out <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cea69f0-7d44-424e-a121-78a21564ca35">the full article</a>.

 Future Verus miners: take notice. Prepare for the full mainnet release of PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) and find great opportunities to maximize profit with your hardware. Mine up to 22 blockchains with the same hashrate. With Verus’ hardware equalizing hashing algorithm (VerusHash 2.2) you can mine efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even ARM devices. In fact CPUs can mine faster than all but extremely expensive, larger&nbsp;FPGAs.  Efficient Mining <p>VerusHash 2.2 is created to level the playing field for all hardware. The hashing algorithm uses the AES/AVX instruction sets built into most modern CPUs to boost CPU hash&nbsp;power.</p><p>Mine Verus most efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even certain ARM devices. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit#gid=10943314">Compare mining hashrates here.</a></p> Coinbase Rewards <p>1440 blocks are generated each day. On average 720 blocks go to miners, 720 blocks go to stakers (<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951">learn more on staking Verus</a>). For generating — or finding — a block, miners and stakers get compensated. This compensation is called a coinbase reward. There will never be more than 83,540,184 VRSC.</p><p>If you look at the image below, you might think that the possibility of earning VRSC for miners and stakers goes down drastically. We explain next that earnings don’t stop at coinbase&nbsp;rewards.</p>Verus Coin Emission Schedule. From block height 10,080 on, all coinbase rewards of 384 and 192 VRSC were timelocked and then unlocked at random block heights. The last of those rewards were unlocked at block height 1,181,520. Earning from Economic&nbsp;Activity <p>Miners and stakers don’t just earn coinbase rewards (the reward for finding a new block), they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool. The Fee Pool collects fees that are paid by users when they are interacting with the protocol. Protocol fees&nbsp;include:</p>  PBaaS-chain*: creating a blockchain on Verus costs 10,000 VRSC. 5,000 VRSC goes into the Verus Fee Pool, and 5,000 VRSC goes into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain, earned by miners and stakers of that blockchain  (DeFi) Currency and tokens*: creating a currency on the Verus blockchain costs 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID: identity fees for miners and stakers are 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100&nbsp;VRSC  Conversion fees: each time a user converts currencies it costs&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: each transaction is minimally 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Miners and stakers are protecting the blockchain and at the same time servicing the Verus economy. We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Think about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward. Now imagine a whole lot of economic activity: users making conversions through the protocol, registering VerusIDs, creating DeFi currencies and tokens, and the Fee Pool can get quite&nbsp;large.</p><p>*Fees are subject to change before hitting&nbsp;mainnet</p>Verus Fee Pool. Percentage is subject to change before hitting&nbsp;mainnet. Merge-Mine up to 22&nbsp;Chains <p>The example above is only for mining Verus directly. Keep in mind that Verus is a multichain protocol. All PBaaS-chains in the protocol have exactly the same specifications as the Verus mainchain. They too have a Fee Pool that collects fees through VerusID registrations, conversions, DeFi currency and tokens and even in a later stage also PBaaS-chains!</p><p>And you can mine 22 of them! All with the same hashrate as you would when mining only&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>All these chains have the same consensus algorithm, 50% PoW, 50% PoS, so you can also stake an unlimited amount of PBaaS-chains.</p>Merge-mine 22 chains with one&nbsp;device Happy Mining (and Staking)! <p>Everyone in the world can start mining Verus today with our low barrier hashing algorithm.

Obviously, holding or acquiring such a vast amount of KSM is only possible if you’re quite wealthy, as 4000KSM are 1.28 million dollars as of writing&nbsp;this.</p><p>A Nominator is an entity holding vast amounts of KSM, these are most likely entities involved in Polkadot for a long time. The Nominator elects different Validators to Stake his KSM. In short, this role describes someone who does not run his own node. Instead, the entity stakes their KSM most profitably by assigning their stake to a validator. Please understand that staking is risky for the Nominator, if the Validator — for whatever reason — stops running, they both risk getting slashed. The slash would ultimately affect the Nominator's stake.</p><blockquote>This mechanism incentivizes Nominators to choose Validators that charge a minimal commission fee and have a good reputation in running their nodes. Validators in return get incentivized to run their node as stable as possible. In return Validators can use low commission fees to attract Nominators.</blockquote> Controller and&nbsp;Stash <p>As we now know the two most important roles in the consensus process we can talk about the accounts you have to set up to run your Validator. Two account types are of importance at this stage — The Controller and the&nbsp;Stash.</p><p>Controller and Stash Accounts are explained quite easily. While the Stash is the entity holding the majority of your funds, the Controller is the entity having control over the Stash and the actions you take — like starting or stopping your Validator.</p>Stash and Controller [1] Setting up a Secure Validator <p>To set up your Validator you can either choose the <a href="https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama">manual set-up</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup">Secure Validator Setup</a>. As you can already guess from the subtitle we have chosen the second&nbsp;option.</p><p>Within the Secure Validator Setup, you will have two options for setting up the node. The first option is to set up your server and the Polkadot application in one run using Terraform. We decided to use the second option which is to set up your server yourself and then use Ansible to securely set up the Polkadot application.</p><p>For the following setup you will need the following:</p>  At least one Debian-based machine (preferably Ubuntu 18.04 as used in Polkadot’s Documentation) with the following specs (min. 300GB Storage, 2–8GB Memory, 1–2 CPUs) hosted with the Provider of your&nbsp;choice.  <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Ansible</a>(v2.8+) installed on your&nbsp;machine  A minimal of 3KSM depending on the amount you want to stake yourself. 0.3KSM will be needed for requesting an on-chain identity. 1–2 KSM should be held for upcoming transaction fees. The overhead can then be used to stake using your own validator. A higher amount of self stake raises trust in your validator as you project more trust on it yourself.   Preparing Your&nbsp;Node <p>Before deploying Polkadot to your remote machine you will need to prepare an additional user and ssh access for this user. Start with <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/add-new-user-account-with-admin-access-on-linux/">creating a new admin user</a> and then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2">create new ssh keys</a>. Preferably you should also disable the root login as described in the ssh key instructions.</p> Running the Secure Validator Setup <p>If you successfully opened a shell to your remote machine, you can adjust the Ansible script for your needs. First, clone the repository:</p> git clone <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup.git">https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup.git</a> <p>Now start adjusting the ansible/inventory.sample file according to the instructions given in the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">setup guide</a>. Below you can find an already edited example inventory file using placeholder values:</p><p>If you are done adjusting the inventory file to your needs you should be able to execute the playbook via the provided&nbsp;script:</p> chmod +x setup.sh<br>./setup.sh my_inventory.yml <p>The Ansible Playbook will now be executed and deploy the Polkadot service to your remote&nbsp;machine.</p><p>In case everything worked well your node should show up on the telemetry. It will now take some time until the node is in sync with the network. For us, this took nearly 7 days. Once finished you will only need to <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">bond your KSM </a>and <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">set your session keys</a> to enter your validator into the “waiting” list. From there on, it is a game of building trust into your Validator so that enough foreign stake is received to participate in the active validators pool. The more trust you generate in you and your node the more steady your rewards will become in the long term. To achieve more trust in your node you can also have a look at <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-identity">on-chain identities</a>. For about 0.3KSM you can request a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-identity#registrars">Registrar</a> to verify your personal information which Nominators can then use to get more information on who is actually running the&nbsp;node.</p> Monitoring Your Validator <p>As keeping your validator up and running is key to running your node successfully, good monitoring is a must-have. For an initial layer of monitoring, you can use a <a href="https://t.me/Kusama_bot">Telegram Bot</a>. But for the more sophisticated part of the monitoring, most people will use <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. You can set these up following the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-monitor-your-node">instructions given in Polkadot's documentation</a> but beware that some metrics might not show up in the provided Grafana dashboard as not all metrics are delivered which is what happened to us. This is why we enabled the node exporter in the Secure Validator Setup which provides additional data and can be displayed in Grafana with dashboards like&nbsp;<a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11207/reviews">this</a>.</p> Validator Stats and Nomination <p>In the PolkadotJS-UI under <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/query">Validator Stats</a> you can browse Validators and inspect stats like rewards or previous slashes. For example, search for ESgN4sdziBpAubx2pGJ1CapGxetE2E1zUbTQCaRFbxxrW2Y and you will find our Validator. Using the displayed information a Nominator can determine his risk with a Validator. He should now be able to nominate the validator as <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot">described in the documentation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto-economy solutions.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of Blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking">https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/kusama-validator-node-setup-5ddcd5e39f99">Kusama Validator Node Setup</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is delighted to announce that we sent test tokens locally from a KILT testnet to an<a href="https://acala.network/"> Acala</a> testnet using cross-chain message passing (XCMP) functionality. This is a practical example of the cross-chain composability possible within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Composability is the ability to combine various components of a software stack in different ways. The Substrate development framework, on which KILT and the majority of blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem are built, allows full spectrum composability. In other words, a range of modules can be composed, configured, and extended to create an optimised blockchain.</p><p>A huge advantage to being in the Polkadot ecosystem is that the chains in the system will also be composable with each other. This means that chains will not only be able to transfer tokens trustlessly, they will also be able exchange data and call each other’s pallet or smart contract functions.</p><p>For example, PolkaBTC (a wrapped version of Bitcoin) could be minted on Interlay, transferred to Acala, and collateralised for aUSD (Acala’s native token) all in one transaction. This would allow different platforms to build mutually beneficial relationships, benefitting from the strengths of the other and using each other’s functions.</p> From Theory to&nbsp;Practice <p>Recently, we ran a successful test of this function, sending test tokens locally from a KILT testnet to an Acala&nbsp;testnet:</p><p>We achieved this using the<a href="https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki"> Acala xtoken Substrate pallet</a>, an open-source pallet created to allow cross-chain token transfers within the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. The success of our transaction shows that the transfer of transactions across chains in Polkadot has passed the stage of theory and is possible in practice.</p> What does this&nbsp;mean? <p>Acala is an Ethereum-compatible decentralised finance hub and stablecoin. Acala aims to make it fast and easy to use or build financial applications in the Polkadot ecosystem, improving trading efficiency. The platform will offer a suite of financial primitives including a stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets like Bitcoin and liquid staking for DOT. Acala provides an open platform for finance applications to use smart contracts or built-in protocols with out-of-the-box cross-chain capabilities and robust security.</p><p>The ability to move the KILT tokens to Acala would allow us to leverage their services and exchange tokens with other currencies on the Acala chain. For example, KILT could implement aUSD as a payment option, enabling multiple use cases for a stablecoin on KILT such as gaming&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Acala aims to be composable with many teams within the ecosystem, including Moonbeam, Plasm, Interlay, Phala and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BitDotCountry/status/1380313153297285121">Bit.Country</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>We look forward to further collaborations with Acala, and using composability to collaborate with other ground-breaking projects within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>

<p></p>       
<p><br>Self-Sovereign Identity or SSI is the concept of individuals or organizations, i.e. users, having sole ownership of their digital identities, and control over how their personal data is shared and used. This adds a layer of security and flexibility allowing the users to only reveal the necessary data for any given transaction or interaction. Since identity is such a central part of society, UNISOT, through its UNISOT ID service, offers our customers control over their data. Under self-sovereign identity model users who have one or more identifiers (something that enables a subject to be discovered and identified) can present claims relating to those identifiers without having to go through an intermediary. In the following sections we will outline how SSI can change the way you interact with others on the Internet as well as in the real world.</p>
            <a href="https://unisot.com/products/unisot-id/">Go to UNISOT ID Module</a>            ENABLING NEW BUSINESS MODELS 
<p>SSI is often regarded as the missing identity layer for the internet and this hints to the great variety of use cases in which SSI can create value and, thus, its potential to give rise to new SSI-based business models. Generally speaking, SSI can enable the privacy-respecting monetization of personal data, which is in strong contrast to current ways personal data is being monetized (ad-based models). One of SSI’s most promising features is the simplification of digital interactions and transactions.</p>
<p>The opportunities range from seamless identification and authentication (without usernames or passwords), through user friendly and inclusive data management and transmissions (data transmission with a single click as opposed to filling out, scanning, sending, or even physically delivering forms), to enabling the fully digitized and automatable delivery of services which currently require time consuming involvement of citizens (in the form of paper-based applications, personal appointments during office hours).</p>
       INCREASE OF SECURITY AND DATA INTEGRITY 
<p>A major challenge related to paper-based credentials and processes is their vulnerability to security issues such as physical document forgery, identity theft or just plain errors in transcribing due to human errors in data processing. UNISOT ID increases the security and integrity of our users’ data by leveraging blockchain and technological concepts closely associated with SSI (authentication based on the cryptographic keying, material associated with DIDs, cryptographic signatures, R-puzzle knowledge proofs, Verifiable Credentials and Presentations).</p>
<p>By leveraging SSI, all types of data associated with entities and things could be digitized and converted into a secure, tamper-proof, privacy-friendly and re-usable digital format in order to solve various issues that current processes face, which are based on outdated methods.</p>
            ALTERNATIVE TO DATA SILOS 
<p>Current data management systems are built on centralized architectures where data is stored and managed centrally in a system that is usually controlled by a single organization. One of the problems associated with this form of centralized design is that each system is different, often significantly. On a technical level, this means enabling the exchange of data between such systems can be very costly and time-consuming. This data exchange usually requires the development and maintenance of complex interfaces and possibly the harmonization of technical specifications and components. As a result, most of the data belonging to individuals and organizations is stuck in systems which are not able to interoperate and communicate with other systems, hence the term „data silo”.</p>
<p>Making such data reusable for processes, interactions, and transactions that happen outside the respective silo requires cumbersome and expensive workarounds. In contrast to current systems, UNISOT ID has a completely decentralized, open, and extensible architecture which aims to offer an alternative to current data silos by democratizing control over data. With UNISOT ID, every user can decide where data is stored, based on the promise of full data portability, or with whom data is being shared and for what purpose. Instead of data being fixed within the system of a certain organization, the respective organization can simply issue the relevant data to the associated entity which can then re-use the data in interactions with other systems.</p>
              <p>Figure 1. Isolated identity providers (image courtesy of CEF digital)</p>
       INCREASE OF TRANSPARENCY 
<p>SSI can bring greater transparency to the way personal data is currently requested, accessed, and used within the public sector. This change to transparency is because persons are in full control of their data and therefore no one can access or use their data without their consent which is why they must be involved in every transaction. Even if some decide to opt into policies for automating data transmissions they can always opt out.</p>
<p>Through UNISOT ID our users have the ability of minimal and selective data disclosure which means that you can have very detailed information about what data is required and used by the other parties you interact with. For example, if an entity requests a proof of exact age, the individual may conclude that is also the proof of being older than a certain age that is being required. Requests for personal data can include metadata, such as informing about the request’s purpose and the intended use of the respective data. individuals can require that if an entity requests their data, the entity must identify itself by disclosing identity proofs together with trust assuring attributes.</p>
                COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS 
<p>UNISOT is committed to open standards and data protection at the highest level and at the current state of the art in digital data formatting and management. The number of laws that aim to regulate the way data is stored, managed, shared, and controlled is rising globally, particularly since the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016/679) came into force. UNISOT ID solution offers full compliance with GDPR and it appears to offer the best factual implementation to realize the will of regulators in today’s digital data society because it puts individuals in full control of their data and provides the means to support the enforcement of individual rights.</p>
<p>By being compatible with the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), UNISOT ID also offers full legal compliance in accordance with the electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS 910/2014) regulation. This includes the legal equivalence of electronic signatures performed by our UNISOT ID service with handwritten signatures and full KYC solutions for substantial and high levels of assurance.</p>

           EMPOWERMENT OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTROL THEIR DATA 
<p>UNISOT ID empowers individuals and organizations to be in full control of their data and digital identities. This is realized by providing them with the technological infrastructure required to create digital identities independently of a central authority. Next, with this system a person can enrich their digital identities with claims which are basically secure, and re-usable digital equivalents to current, paper-based, issued credentials (passports, driving licenses, healthcare records). Finally, citizens can use the provided tools to manage and utilize such claims (apps, agents). Also, all types of personal and sensitive data as well as the means required to access and utilize them (cryptographic keying material) are stored securely at the user’s discretion in so called „wallets” on their edge devices, such as Smart Cards, Mobile Phone and PC.</p>
            <p>For added security, we add a hardware wallets in the form of a Smart Card which integrates the wallet management and recovery into a card not unlike standard credit cards. We feel it is important to note here that our commitment to privacy and data ownership is complete. Once a user is on boarded onto the UNISOT ID all the data stored in our applications is theirs to keep even if they discontinue using our services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our adherence to international standards and the common European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) ensures that our clients can also transfer their data to a different service provider meaning they are in no way locked into using UNISOT offerings. We believe that our customers will choose to continue using the UNISOT ecosystem not because they are forced to but because it is simply the best option on the market.</p>
       DECREASE IN COSTS 
<p>Given SSI’s ability to facilitate faster and easier delivery of services and interactions, to digitize and streamline processes, to offer an alternative to current data silos, and to enhance security and data integrity, the potential to save significant funds is obvious. To provide an example, Dutch TNO estimates that SSI can save European governments between 10 and 100 billion Euros per year by facilitating the validation of data.</p>

<p>I remember being in Helsinki seeing QR codes everywhere. This was in 2018 I guess, and the tourism association had convinced local merchants and taxis to accept AliPay. They said it would help the rapidly growing Chinese tourism cohort, who were used to using contactless payments all the time.</p>
<p>Did it work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know. I haven’t been back and haven’t looked at the data for Helsinki and AliPay.</p>
<p>But now we are using QR codes all the time – and tapping our phones on various devices. While we used to hold menus and shove our card in a machine,&nbsp;now we’re all about contactless. What broke the pattern?</p>
<p>Apple Pay started some shifts but the pattern was simple – pay for your stuff at the counter. Most didn’t use that same ritual at the table in the restaurant or at other stores, though some did. Most resisted.</p>
<p>Banks and Credit Unions have been trying to force a shift to contactless payments but have encountered resistance – from their customers, their merchants, and even their internal teams. There wasn’t enough push behind it to break the swipe or card-in-machine pattern.&nbsp;Since I advise multiple credit unions, banks, and fintechs this lack of adoption does not surprise me. </p>
<p>People don’t like changes. They stick with what works. Until it doesn’t…</p>
<p>But COVID-19 forced a pattern to break – we no longer wanted to touch anything. So what did we do?&nbsp;We went contactless. We’re tapping all the time. Shooting QR codes for our menus and to find out more about things. Did QR codes and other contactless systems change. No. They have been around a long time in the tech world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We broke the pattern. We opened up an opportunity to try something new – because the old thing no longer worked for us. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re a software developer student looking for impactful internships or a company looking to hire from top campuses, <a href="https://www.techintern.io/">Techintern.io</a> is your go-to&nbsp;place.</p><p>Read on to learn more about how Techintern.io chose Magic for “set it and forget it” passwordless login.</p> A long-term advocate of&nbsp;Magic <p>Techintern.io is a marketplace that matches students with companies in the form of an internship. Their network of club leads at colleges and student organizations finds the best student developers interested in working at startups. These students can then opt into companies in hiring rounds once a month. This streamlines the hiring process and makes it easier to find the right match within a&nbsp;week!</p><p>When the pandemic hit, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsdjklee">Daniel Lee</a>, CTO of Techintern.io, observed that software students were losing their internships. Inspired by the helpful co-op¹ program he participated in at the University of Waterloo, he sought to build Techintern.io to unlock other opportunities for these students.</p><p>Because internships are time-bound, Daniel’s team launched as quickly as possible with a beta. The goal was to validate the need for Techintern.io. As soon as their close network expressed interest, they set out to meet their initial launch. But first, they needed a secure means of authentication.</p><p>Choosing an auth solution was an easy task. Having used the Magic SDK in previous consulting projects (and even recommending it to colleagues), Daniel considers himself a long-term advocate of&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>Thanks to helpful documentation and superb customer support, Daniel’s team went with Magic passwordless auth and was able to keep up Techintern.io’s momentum with a successful public launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/techintern-io">Product&nbsp;Hunt</a>.</p> Adopting Magic <p>As with all good things, Daniel learned about Magic through a connection at his previous consulting firm. Because he was interested in blockchain technology at the time, he was curious to learn more about Magic and how it uses the Ethereum blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography to generate verifiable proofs of identity and authorization.</p><p>Once he read Magic’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">whitepaper</a> and dug a little deeper into the API, he realized how cool and easy it was to integrate with. At the end of the day, he was convinced that Magic would be the alternative of his choice; not just for this consulting project, but also for other projects that came after…including Techintern.io!</p><p>If you’re a company or student looking for an internship match, take a look at <a href="https://www.techintern.io/">Techintern.io</a> and see how they can help&nbsp;you.</p> A “set it and forget it” auth&nbsp;solution <p>Since adopting Magic, Daniel and his team never have to deal with a password reset. Which is great, especially during their short, high signup volume periods when they’re launching the next round of job postings. The seamless user onboarding and logging in process guarantees that users are able to log in&nbsp;easily.</p><blockquote>“The best part about Magic, for Techintern.io, is that we don’t have to think about the authentication part.”</blockquote><p>Now, they save over 50 hours per month because Magic reduces their auth bug incident rate significantly.</p><p>Had Techintern.io built their own auth solution, they would have had to deal with automated emails (that verify user login), implementing a social login (that may be prone to errors), and more. By outsourcing their auth solution to Magic, Techintern.io can focus efforts on their mission: helping students and companies find the perfect internship match.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-magic-auth-saves-techintern-io-over-50-hours-a-month-1b5ffb4e14a8">How Magic auth saves Techintern.io over 50 hours a month</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Thinking of getting into blockchain? 6 things to consider. <p>In 2017, during crypto’s last bull run and after years of pointedly ignoring blockchain hype, I <a href="https://dazuck.medium.com/joining-consensys-decentra-mania-bd37858eb2b2">jumped down the rabbit hole</a>. I began to see crypto networks as the best coordination tool we’ve ever had. I met the most passionate, curious, interesting people I’ve ever worked with. And I loved that the challenges to overcome were organizational, economic, and political as much as technical.</p><p>In the past four years, I’ve collaborated with dozens of teams, helped found <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> (a company) and launch <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>, and worked with several DAOs. The potential, challenges, and excitement in the space are still similar to 2017. But the range of experiments, opportunities, and team types is now incredibly broad.</p> What to consider as you jump down the rabbit&nbsp;hole  1. Join a community, not just a&nbsp;team. <p>One of Plaid’s hiring criteria was “Did they read the docs?” In the crypto space, it’s “Did they join the community?”</p><p>Hop into the discord or slack, get a sense of the developers and users and how they are engaged. Picking a team without understanding the community would be like getting engaged before meeting your partner’s friends or&nbsp;family.</p> 2. Be honest about what you’re in it for, and choose accordingly. <p>The pace of activity in the space is completely overwhelming. Make sure you land in a spot where that will drive your motivation not drain&nbsp;it.</p><p>If you enjoy constant, multi-disciplinary, frenetic learning and excitement, happy hours that veer back to interesting ‘work’ topics, and the feeling of a quasi-cult-like movement — you’ve found your tribe. Look for teams that were building through the last few years’ bear market. Protocol teams, DAOs, and the early DeFi builders. Join one working on something you really care about because you’ll need deep motivation to keep focus and&nbsp;energy.</p><p>If you want more balance or stability, the bull run has given rise to more traditional companies — exchanges (the new banks), infrastructure providers (picks and shovels), and creative studios — that build on this movement but in a more familiar setting. It’s a bit more sustainable and ‘normal.’</p><p>If you are in it for the money, there are plenty of DeFi projects with millions of dollars to spend. Or consider keeping your stable income and investing it in&nbsp;crypto.</p> 3. How do you like to&nbsp;work? <p>While the world has been adjusting to remote work, many crypto teams are native to it and push organizational experiments far beyond&nbsp;that.</p>  Do you want an office with teammates? Select for this, as most are&nbsp;remote  Real-time or asynchronous? Plenty of teams work purely off PRs and tickets, gaining massive flexibility but losing face&nbsp;time.  Radically flat, traditional org structure, or experimental? Do you want the empowerment promised by new org designs or the clarity of clear structures?  <p>Could you work for a protocol?</p><p>Many projects aim to (or already have) pass most power to a DAO or community. See how Yearn Finance <a href="https://gov.yearn.finance/t/how-we-think-about-yearn/7137">describes itself</a>. Does the idea of working with complete freedom and a loose association with other community members excite you and feel like the next era of organizations? Or does it seem like the death of coherence, agility, and coordination at scale? Understand a team’s long-term plan for the company and DAO, and if/when that is in the&nbsp;future.</p> 4. How do you gauge progress? <p>Teams have different DNAs for how much to focus on technical advances, growth and sales, the long-term vision, or product adoption. This gap is wider than normal in the blockchain space because we’re so early — there’s so much green space, less obvious metrics, more delayed feedback, and some self-delusion about what’s working and what’s&nbsp;not.</p><p>Understand if teams are <a href="https://www.notion.so/Hiring-post-1dd60bc54c5d4302913951e8d126f02a">engineering, vision, or product-led</a> and what the upsides and downsides to this are, and think about whether those will match your own instincts. If you are instinctively drawn towards growth but the team holds ideology more dear, you could be very frustrated with the roadmap and strategy.</p> 5. Understand crypto compensation. <p>Startup employees are used to salary, bonus, and equity. In crypto, there are also tokens. They are more liquid, more volatile, often higher upside, and sometimes far less tax-efficient than stock options. Know your situation and what combination of income you care about, and make sure the team you join is keeping the incentives of the founders, team, and investors aligned for the long term. <a href="https://ricburton.substack.com/p/the-liquidity-liability">This article</a> offers a good&nbsp;primer.</p> 6. Principles and values matter more than&nbsp;ever. <p>Culture is what defines behavior in the absence of clear rules, and in projects with smaller teams and bigger communities, the early norms and values carry more burden than ever. Understand both what the team stands for and how they instantiate their values in their operations and their community.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1343366729427079169">As Vitalik said</a>, “Even a billion dollars can’t complete with a project having a soul.” Make sure you believe fully in the culture being created and can see yourself as one of its core carriers.</p> 3Box Labs is&nbsp;hiring <p>At <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a>, we are on a mission to transform the web’s relationship with data.

<p>Imagine if you could identify, analyze, and fix <a href="https://spike.sh/incidents">incidents</a> before customers tell you about&nbsp;them.</p><p>That’s what <a href="https://spike.sh/">Spike.sh</a> is focused on. Spike.sh helps bring clarity and transparency to incidents for faster resolve time. Without writing any code, you can get unlimited alerts via phone, SMS text, email, and Slack for any issues in your software&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Their <a href="https://incidents.sh/">newest product</a> takes this one step further, helping dev teams with a modern “days without incident” timer.</p><p>Leading up to launch, the Spike.sh team decisively steered clear of the pain and security risk associated with password-based authentication. By implementing Magic, they were able to speed up cycles, rapidly iterate on the core product, and cut time to market in&nbsp;half.</p> The high cost of passwords <p>With Incidents Timer, you can keep track of major incidents with a simple to use and beautifully designed experience.</p><p>When considering authentication and onboarding, co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/thepruth">Pruthvi Haral</a> wanted to ensure that product simplicity came through for developers and end-users.</p><p>From experience as a developer and Product Manager, he knows first-hand how complex and time-consuming building standard username and password auth from scratch can&nbsp;be.</p><blockquote>“Auth has never been something I liked to work on. The headaches just never end. Even for the smallest product, you have to deal with the signup form, login form, forgot password form, reset passwords form, email deliverability, design,&nbsp;etc.”</blockquote><p>Prior to Spike.sh, Pruthvi worked full-time on another developer-first product. That experience opened his eyes to the vast range of challenges that come with maintaining passwords. Between plaintext, hashing, and storage, password-based authentication was not worth reinventing the wheel — especially with the core product as the competing priority.</p><p>With these learnings in mind, it became clear that passwordless auth — specifically, email magic links that Slack helped popularize — provided a seamless onboarding flow without sacrificing security or&nbsp;UX.</p> Secure, passwordless login <p>Pruthvi discovered Magic through <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/">OnDeck</a>, finding exactly what his team needed to sidestep passwords. After testing it out locally, the team was immediately impressed with the slick design and smooth user experience.</p><p>Coupled with the “security specialization, dashboard benefits, and startup perks”, it was a no-brainer decision to implement magic links for Incidents Timer.</p><blockquote>“I was pleasantly surprised there was a product that simplified magic links! Magic checks all the boxes — easy to implement, founded by security experts, backed by amazing investors.”</blockquote> 2X faster time to&nbsp;market <p>With help from Magic, Spike.sh cut down time on passwordless authentication considerably — from what would have been several weeks and cycles, into just a matter of days. This win led to an even bigger win: time savings meant the team could launch their newest product into the world, 2X&nbsp;faster.</p><blockquote>“Velocity is vital for lean teams. With Magic, we could dedicate more time and energy towards launching sooner and growing our newest product.”</blockquote><p>What started as a need to solve their own pain points quickly evolved into a way to give back to the community. Incidents Timer is free for software&nbsp;teams.</p><p>This latest release strengthens Spike.sh’s goal to make it simple for developers to manage alerts swiftly and deliver more reliability for customers. Because every dev optimizes for speed. Especially when it comes to incidents.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/spike-sh-went-passwordless-with-magic-and-accelerated-time-to-market-2x-70d9d4e02e">Spike.sh went passwordless with Magic and accelerated time to market 2X</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the first of two blogs on our new White Paper: <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">Achieving Transform At Scale</a>. The first blog focuses on the infrastructure challenge; the next on the need for supporting, enabling institutions.</p><p>It’s now widely understood that the way our society collects and uses personal data generates wide scale invasions of privacy, endemic risks of data breaches and fraudulent access to data, plus eye-watering imbalances of power and reward which, together, have led to a pervasive erosion of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>What’s less widely understood is that all these problems and issues are an inevitable byproduct of how the system itself is organised: its organisation-centric structure — the fact that the only entities really capable of collecting and using personal data at scale are large organisations. No matter how well-meaning new rules, policies and regulations might be, as long as this structure remains, the problems will&nbsp;remain.</p><p>New rules, policies and regulations may help to clear up the mess created by the systemic leaking bucket, but in themselves they can never fix the leak itself. For that we need structural reform.</p> An infrastructure challenge <p>Our society has faced similar challenges many times before. When the industrial revolution hit us, it dawned on people that if this new system was to work effectively, the entire population would need to be able to read and write. We needed an education system.</p><p>The rapid growth of cities created immense sanitation and public health problems: everyone needed running water and sewers. When electricity came along, letting every Tom, Dick and Harry create their own generating stations using different frequencies and distribution methods clogged the system with nightmarishly high costs and complexity. We needed a national&nbsp;grid.</p><p>In each case, it was recognised that for the good of the society, its economy and its citizens we need infrastructure that made things universally available.</p><p>The same goes for personal data. The toxicities created by our current systems can never be addressed, and the full potential of data can never be unleashed, unless every citizen is able to collect and use their own data for their own purposes, just as every citizen was previously empowered to read and write and access water and electricity for their own purposes. Doing so makes the whole system work&nbsp;better.</p> The scale of the challenge <p>To achieve such a change however, we need to get over some mountainous obstacles. At Mydex CIC, we believe we have found such a route through. Our new White Paper <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">Achieving Transform At Scale</a> explains&nbsp;how.</p><p>To make any real headway we first have to overcome some formidable mental roadblocks. The biggest of these is market myopia — the assumption that the only way forward is to ‘create markets for data’. This is nonsense on two counts. First, none of the economic benefits of what Mydex CIC does around personal data come from trading data for money. They come from helping people and service providers strip out the huge amounts of unnecessary waste and cost they both experience when trying to handle data. Taking cost out of how the system works is not the same as creating a ‘market’ where data is traded or&nbsp;sold.</p><p>Closely related to market myopia is accounting myopia: the belief that the best or only way to measure the economic contribution of an enterprise is to see how big its accounting profits are. This, too, is nonsense. The social and economic value of electricity is measured by all the uses we put electricity to, not the profits electricity suppliers happen to make. (Try imagining your life without electricity.)</p><p>Only when we look past market and accounting myopia, to look at all the different ways personal data can be used to improve peoples’ lives (and the economic operations that make this possible), can we see just how big the prize of new ways of collecting and using personal data could&nbsp;be.</p><p>Practically and operationally speaking, the biggest challenge is to create a system where new ways of collecting and using personal data can operate at scale. Here, the Mydex roadmap is simple and straightforward. First, focus efforts on where the resistance is lowest and immediate benefits are highest: what we call ‘clusters’. These are situations where a number of different public and third sector organisations are all helping the same individuals in their own specialist ways, but where to create the best possible ‘joined-up’ outcomes, lots of data needs to be shared. Mydex’s personal data store infrastructure makes it easy, cheap and safe to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, in a world where despite immense amounts of bravado and rhetoric anything truly innovative is instinctively seen as ‘very risky and therefore to be avoided’, seeing is believing. So we are using these clusters to demonstrate proof points. To show, without doubt, that what we are talking about actually&nbsp;works.</p><p>Third, in serving these clusters, we have developed solutions that can be quickly and easily applied time and time again across multiple different situations — so that they can spread. For example, the benefits of being able to use previously checked and certified information to be shared safely and efficiently, or to use improved data sharing to help multiple different service providers coordinate and integrate activities, arise in countless different situations across all industries and many aspects of individuals’ lives.</p><p>So what we have created is something that proves in practice that it’s possible to strip out enormous amounts of friction, effort, risk and cost while opening up new opportunities; that has near universal applicability; and can be easily adopted by multiple different users.</p> Conclusion <p>It’s not enough to identify what’s wrong with how things work today. What’s needed is practical ways forward that deliver real benefits now; that once created can be reapplied and spread so that they operate at scale — thereby changing how the system itself works. It took us over a decade to find a path through the mountain range of obstacles. Our new <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">White Paper</a> maps this pathway in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>But the right sort of infrastructure alone is not enough. For this infrastructure to work and spread as it should, it needs the right institutions to support it: institutions that focus on broader social and community benefit and not just corporate benefit, and that are capable of building trust between multiple different stakeholders. That’s why Mydex has chosen to be a Community Interest Company. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/our-new-white-paper-achieving-transformation-at-scale-f97320f8447e">Our New White Paper: Achieving Transformation At Scale</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

A New Era of&nbsp;Crypto <p>All of these features are currently available on Verus testnet (VerusID is already on mainnet), and the community is in high gear, hardening and preparing the testnet protocols for mainnet release. The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v0.7.3-1">Verus Desktop</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.7.3-1">Verus CLI wallets</a>, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all&nbsp;today.</p><blockquote>Capabilities which to our knowledge are not available on any other decentralized platform&nbsp;today</blockquote><p>As Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for&nbsp;all.</p><p>The Verus testnet, available in the <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v0.7.3-1">Verus Desktop</a> or <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.7.3-1">CLI wallets</a> as VRSCTEST, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are not available on any other decentralized platform&nbsp;today.</p><p>1. Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) with zero-knowledge privacy support (VerusID) — Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.</p><p>The Verus network and all PBaaS chains also support zk-SNARK, zero-knowledge privacy for private transactions and messages. When combined with VerusID, Verus becomes the only blockchain network in the world with zero knowledge privacy with friendly-name IDs.</p><p>2. Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault) — Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.</p><p>3. Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming — Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched&nbsp;it.</p><p>All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>4. Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets — Enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to&nbsp;100%.</p><p>The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.</p><p>5. Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches — Enables the launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.</p><p>Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.</p><p>6. Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge) — Enables you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your currency, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get their pre-conversions (minus network fees) refunded.</p><p>The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as&nbsp;well.</p><p>7. An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale — Allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with seamless, secure sending of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.</p><p>8. Merge mining of up to 22 blockchains simultaneously — Lets you multiply your hashpower by up to 22x by mining multiple chains at the same time, on the same hashpower.</p><p>Verus has no limit on the number of simultaneously running blockchains across its multi-chain network, and rather than requiring more and more hash power and energy to process the scale of transactions that can be supported across all of these chains, Verus makes merge mining up to 22 blockchains easy and automatic by individuals or even&nbsp;pools.</p><p>You can discover and select your favorite projects from across the Verus network using the Verus Desktop, and mine them all, effectively multiplying your hashpower by up to 22x. Start your own project and pay some of your costs by mining other currencies as you mine your own. Each blockchain continues to run on its own independent worldwide network, yet you could make your choices to earn rewards on all or some of the blockchains and participate in their cross-chain operation. Together, Verus automatic merge mining and its 50% proof of stake, 51% hash attack resistant algorithm makes runaway energy costs for crypto mining and transaction processing a thing of the&nbsp;past.</p><p>9. Blockchain fee pools and anti-front running — Addresses MEV and more elegantly solves the EIP1559 problem with a block reward independent economy.</p><p>As DeFi protocols become the new “killer apps” for blockchain, soon to be joined by identity and future NFT models, fees earned by miners and stakers in a block can now often exceed block rewards. This is a natural outcome of blockchains being used for commerce and was a consideration of Satoshi’s as the rewards that would replace block rewards over&nbsp;time.</p><p>When DeFi protocols, VM-based applications, or other functions earning fees are completely separate from the blockchain consensus protocol, as is the case in Ethereum and most other VM-centric systems, miners and stakers often have perverse incentives to reorg the blockchain and capture the blocks with unusually large fees, even after they have been mined by another. The Verus developers consider this a fundamental security flaw in the consensus protocol and are introducing the Verus Fee Pool, which will be operable on all PBaaS chains as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The Verus fee pool is a complete solution to enabling a blockchain economy and works by simply requiring that miners put all fees into the fee pool and then take a fraction of the fee pool as their fee reward. This way, it is always more efficient to continue mining forward, as any large sum of fees will be distributed with exponential decay over the current and future blocks. In addition to the Verus Fee Pool, fees for conversions may be paid in the source currency and are automatically converted to Verus or the native blockchain currency on a PBaaS chain before being exposed to miners as transaction fees, providing an entirely new and complete solution to both the problems of large fee disruptions and integration of DeFi conversions into the consensus security protocol.</p><p>Written by miketout &amp; michaeltoutjr</p> Join the New Era of&nbsp;Crypto <p>Discuss and share ideas on your own blockchain or currency project, or if you need help come to <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">our Discord server</a>.

<p>The final week of April marked the 14th annual OECD Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains — an event that took place virtually this year and brought together speakers and participants from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The week-long virtual forum offered participants a wide variety of sessions with engaging speakers, in over 40 events. With topics ranging from Blockchain in the gold supply chain, to incorporating ESG into responsible sourcing, there was something for everyone and lots to learn from the incredible speakers.</p><p>While there were too many session to attend every one, here are a few key learnings from the&nbsp;forum:</p>  Consumers are demanding more! They want to know where goods come from and expect to see best practices from the companies they purchase from; and if not, they will buy elsewhere. A speaker in one session put it well, saying, “responsible sourcing and ESG is no longer a nice to have, it is necessary.” This is more than a trend — it is becoming a&nbsp;reality.  There needs to be a holistic approach to meeting due diligence standards, and practicing responsible sourcing — everyone has a part to play! This means there needs to be engagement with the mines, customers, companies and local communities that are impacted. Engaging with local communities is important to help understand risk management on the ground and these are the voices that too often have been left out of the conversation. As one speaker said, “we can’t be at odds with local voices, we need more inclusion.”  One major takeaway from the discussions is that responsible sourcing and ESG is a process. We can’t just put programs and standards in place and expect them to work, we need engagement from everyone in the value&nbsp;chain.  Blockchain is an essential tool in the move towards supply chain due diligence and responsible sourcing.  Lastly, and probably most importantly — supply chain due diligence requires buy in from all actors and it requires significant time and effort. We can’t solve ESG problems as individual companies; we need to work together using an industry wide approach to make real change. Many of the speakers highlighted the importance of getting buy-in from suppliers, noting that we need to move from push to pull. We shouldn’t have to force suppliers to get on board. Adapting to changing demands for visibility is good business for everyone.  <p>Overall, the forum provided interesting insights and engaging conversations with industry leaders. While there is still a lot of work to be done, it feels good to hear from so many experienced people making real change in this area. One thing is certain: it is going to take commitment and collaboration from everyone to make global supply chain due diligence a reality and we are committed to being part of that&nbsp;change.</p>

<p>You know those words you see on a car’s side mirror that say ‘objects in the mirror are closer than they appear’? In spite of that warning, it’s always a bit surprising when a car comes zooming past, out of the blue, when you thought it was way back in the distance.</p><p>I had that sort of experience yesterday morning. During my weekly check-in with Alastair from the Holo hosting dev team, he was practically bouncing in his seat. The reason for his excitement, in his words, was that “Holo is ready”. Alastair normally brings a critical, analytical mind to his work. (He ought to; he’s an engineer.) So when I saw him get excited, I knew there was a good reason for it.</p><p>Before you get too excited, though, Holo isn’t going to be in beta tomorrow. He simply meant that it’s finally time to start testing the entire hosting and routing infrastructure.</p><p>There have been some big milestones in the past half year. But <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">the next milestone, hosted Elemental Chat</a>, is the one that brings all the pieces together. It depends on:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain">Holochain</a>,  The <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/envoy">Envoy</a> service and <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/chaperone">Chaperone</a> browser library (I’ll get to them in a bit),  Network plumbing to help hosts reliably punch through home firewalls, including a proxy server,  A registration flow to get hosts onto the network,  The resolver service, a ‘matchmaker’ that connects web users to hosts,  Centralised and decentralised routing infrastructure to securely deliver web users’ requests to their chosen hosts,  An <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-nixpkgs">operating system</a> that brings Holochain and the Envoy together on HoloPorts.  <p>Alastair told me that all these foundations are solid now. The routing infrastructure has been in place for a long time, Holochain’s big bugs (including <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-94-when-signup-goes-wrong/#keeping-bad-actors-out-of-the-network">lockups when a host fails</a> to create an app instance for a web user) have been <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/744">eradicated</a>, the proxy server and gossip protocol are getting some <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/752">performance boosts</a>, and the weird edge cases involving a user <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-94-when-signup-goes-wrong/#preserving-your-agency">closing their browser too soon</a> have been addressed.</p><p>If you’d gotten used to the rapid HoloPort updates over the turn of the new year, like I had, you were probably concerned by the slowdown in the following months. Alastair explained the reason for that too: during our previous release cycles, we involved testers as early as possible. This gave the dev teams a lot of insight into what was and wasn’t working, but it also created a lot of extra work. Our pre-release testers have been absolutely wonderful — they’ve dedicated big chunks of their free time to helping us chase down bugs. But it’s been a lot of work for them, and the communication and coordination have demanded a lot from our small team as well.</p><p>So for this release (and the previous minor release), the Holo and Holochain dev teams have put everything through much more rigorous testing before it even reaches internal QA. Once it passes, we expect to have a lot fewer pre-release cycles before it goes out to all HoloPorts — perhaps none at all. And then the fun begins, as all the HoloPort owners invite the web to try out this peer-to-peer chat app for the first time!</p><blockquote>We also intend to hire a QA and software delivery manager to streamline this whole process in the future. If you have experience juggling QA, community testers, and deployments, <a href="https://holo.host/careers/product-owner-release-coordinator/">this might be you</a>!</blockquote><p>I could tell that Alastair was relaxed about the future of Holo development. With this solid foundation, he said, developing and delivering new features like HoloFuel and the Service Logger app (which tracks resource usage and bills app publishers) is going to get easier and faster.</p> So what are Envoy and Chaperone? <p>Envoy is a service that lives on every HoloPort and connects its Holochain runtime to the centralised Holo routing infrastructure and, ultimately, the web user on the other end. It provisions a hApp instance for a user and asks the user's browser to sign data that Holochain is about to store and publish on their behalf.</p><p>Chaperone, on the other hand, is a library that runs in the user’s browser. It handles registration and sign-up, using cryptographic magic to keep the user's secrets (password and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#public-key-cryptography">private key</a>) from ever leaving the browser. That means they'll never get stolen in a massive database hack, and the HoloPort never has the power to do things the user doesn't want.</p><p>The Holo devs have often found themselves working against the centralised assumptions baked into web browsers and the HTTP protocol. Many of the challenges came from security restrictions that keep you safe in the centralised world, but they don’t make sense in a cryptographically secured P2P world where you’re in control of your keys.</p><p>In the process of meeting these challenges, the Holo devs came up with a final design that I think is more user-friendly. Previously you had to sign in on every new Holo-hosted page you visit, even if you’d been there before or were already signed in on another browser tab. Now your session stays active across browser tabs and even after quitting and restarting your web browser. This is <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-look-at-the-holo-testnet-coming-soon/#holo-hosting-infrastructure-nothing-special-">nothing special</a> for traditional web apps, so it’s great to see it coming to Holo. It means that dApps are finally going to start feeling pretty usable.</p><p>If you like technical details, you might want to read this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-to-break-a-holo-app/#a-look-at-how-a-holo-hosted-happ-can-break">old blog post about Chaperone and Envoy</a>. It was written when the devs were still deep into creating and debugging these components.</p> What’s next? <p>Right now we’re in internal QA testing. We expect to invite the pre-release testers into hosted Elemental Chat soon (perhaps by the time you read this) — first as users, then as hosts. We don’t expect to find any big bugs, but we hope we’ll discover edge cases that we hadn’t hit during development. If no critical edge cases show up, we’ll release hosted Elemental Chat to all hosts and invite the web to try it out.</p><p>Looking forward to seeing you there sometime soon! (If you have an invite code, of course 😉)</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@niuhang?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">hang niu</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/car-mirror?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>As we move towards a world of digital identity, many ways of sharing and verifying Personally Identifiable Information are emerging. Two such modes that we’ll talk about today are Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials.</p> What are Open&nbsp;Badges? <p>At the most basic level, Open Badges are a format for issuing digital badges and are often associated with certifying educational proficiency, skills, and job-related achievements. It is verifiable, portable, and contain relevant information such&nbsp;as,</p>  Date of&nbsp;Issue  Date of&nbsp;Expiry  Name of the&nbsp;Issuer  Name of the Recipient  JSON-LD object that describes the qualification or&nbsp;skill  Digital Signature  Badge Name  Badge Criteria  Badge Description  <p>Here is an example of Open Badges from IMSGlobal.org</p><p>Breaking this down a bit, there are three major parts in Open badges and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Assertions — Representation of a badge that is packaged as a JSON object with a bunch of mandatory and optional properties. In other words, it shares information about a badge belonging to an&nbsp;earner.  Badge — This is the actual accomplishment recognized by the issuer. There can be many skills and accomplishments in the same&nbsp;badge.  Issuer — Gives information about the entity issuing the badge, typically a university, a company, or a learning&nbsp;center.  <p>Open badges are being increasingly adopted by universities and other micro-credential organizations to issue achievements and skill accomplishments for entities. Typically, these badges are sent to the earners and in turn, the earners can hold and collect these badges, and can share them easily with others when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Here’s how a collection of badges looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://iite.unesco.org/highlights/open-badges-new-opportunities-to-recognize-and-validate-achievements-digitally/">UNESCO Institute</a></p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p>Verifiable credentials, or VCs in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. Verifiable Credentials are:</p>  Machine readable and verifiable  Cryptographically tamper-proof  Privacy preserving  <p>You can read about verifiable credentials <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">here</a>.</p><p>Here is how a VC looks&nbsp;like</p><p>Similarities between Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials</p><p>There are many similarities between open badges and verifiable credentials and some of the important ones&nbsp;are:</p>  The fundamental idea of both models is to allow the owners of a credential to store it safely in a digital wallet and share it with any entity of their choice. In other words, it gives holders/earners complete control over their credentials/accomplishments.  Allow the expression of a cryptographically verifiable claim involving issuers, holders, credentials, and verifiers.  Secure and&nbsp;portable  Both allow holders to compile and share their information the way they want. For example, a holder can gather different accomplishment and skill badges, combine these visual badges, and send it to the receiver. Likewise, the holder of a verifiable credential can compile all the required VCs into a verifiable presentation and send it to the verifier.   Differences between Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials <p>On the face of it, both Open badges and verifiable credentials may seem similar, but still, there are many differences between&nbsp;them.</p> Immutability <p>Verifiable credentials use the “proof” property to verify that a credential is immutable while the digital signatures prove the identity of issuers and&nbsp;holders</p><p>Open badges, by themselves, don’t have this immutable property though digital signatures are present to prove the authenticity of the issuer. Blockcerts, a blockchain implementation of Open badges, uses the timestamps of blockchains to achieve this immutability. But some implementations involving HTTP don’t have this property.</p> Applications <p>So far, Open badges have mostly been implemented in the education sector to add credibility to informal education and to endorse specific skills or experience of the holder. It is also used for employment verification to a limited&nbsp;extent.</p><p>VCs, on the other hand, have a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">wide range of applications in real life</a>. Here’s a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">story</a> of how VCs can be used in real-world situations.</p> Standard Implementation <p>The implementation of verifiable credentials has been standardized by w3c.org that advocates the use of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> as the URI. Also, digital signatures help to keep these credentials secure and authentic.</p><p>Open Badges doesn’t have a standard implementation and it is left to different organizations to use a set of optional properties to create them. Though some mandatory properties must be present, there could be variations in the implementation.</p><p>In fact, Open badges have two verification methods,</p>  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#HostedBadge">HostedBadge</a> that uses&nbsp;HTTP  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#SignedBadge">SignedBadge</a> that uses a JSON Web Signature   Visual Representation <p>Often, Open Badges are represented as a badge that contains detailed metadata such as the name, issuer, and description. All this information is baked into the image, so any Open Badge-compatible application can display this information. This visual representation is also what makes it highly portable.</p><p>In VCs, all information is encrypted and protected by digital signatures, so the information is not readily visible to everyone, except those who have the public keys to verify the authenticity of the issuer and the&nbsp;holder.</p> Verifiability <p>Open badges require third-party tools to explicitly verify whether the information contained in it. So, verifying Open badges could entail more resources such as subscription/payment for using the verification tool and dependencies on third-party providers.</p><p>VCs, on the other hand, have verifiability built in through digital signatures, so additional tools are required.</p><p>Here’s a table that sums up these differences.</p><p>In all, VCs are a defined and standardized implementation of digital identity whereas Open Badges is more open-ended where organizations can use HTTP or web signatures to implement them.</p><p>But that could change shortly as there are <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.md">efforts</a> to use the VC specifications to implement Open Badges to make the most of the benefits in both&nbsp;models.</p> When to Use Open Badges and&nbsp;VCs? <p>Open Badges are a good choice for universities and learning centers that don’t offer a degree, but still want to formalize the efforts and accomplishments of students. Since the credentials can be baked into a badge, it can be useful when students have a web portfolio or personal websites through which they want to showcase their accomplishments to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Verifiable credentials, on the other hand, are more suited for issuers with authorities who backup a claim made by a holder. For example, when a user claims that he is over 18 years of age, a date of birth VC issued by the local city/county/state validates this claim. Since these are machine verifiable, it can be used across multiple scenarios.</p><p>To learn more about VCs and how you can use them to build custom SSI-based applications, reach out to <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Affinidi</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-openbadges-vs-verifiable-credentials-d504c054d5db">Compare and Contrast: OpenBadges vs Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, discusses how Self Sovereign Identity solutions will reshape the way we share data on the&nbsp;internet <p>Every time you click onto the internet, you add to your digital identity, creating a virtual memory of who you are, what you look at, and where you spend your browsing time. Have you ever wondered where this identity exists and who has access to it? As it stands, internet users have very little oversight over the personal information they share with different platforms and how this is managed and stored. As the world increasingly moves online to offer key services, users must strive for better protection. In order to do so, it is essential that they are equipped with the right information and&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions can help to facilitate this. Using blockchain to empower users, SSI solutions help users to take back control of their identity online by ensuring security and data management are at the forefront of every exchange.</p><p>Current limitations on data protection across the internet mean that users too often blindly accept cookies and hand over their data to renowned hoarders. Cookies are little text files that websites store on your computer in order to track your activity. Regular cookies are essential for tracking your browser preferences and settings, however, third party cookies pose a more significant threat to your privacy as they track user settings across various websites, making it possible for companies to monitor your browsing activity long after you have left their platforms.</p><p>In its most simple form, this means that companies can show you targeted ads on a platform such as Instagram for products that you may have looked at on a totally different platform weeks before. In its more sinister form, this could mean that companies are able to record, analyze, utilize, and potentially share a virtual map of everything you do on the internet.</p><p>On a macro scale, the unchecked harvesting of data as facilitated by the likes of cookies and other technologies can have significant implications for user privacy. Showcasing this, a massive data breach recently exposed the private emails and numbers of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/04/06/facebook-data-breach-heres-what-to-do-now/?sh=6e91234b5708">533 million users</a>, making it extremely easy for hackers and scammers to target users across the globe. European Commissioner <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/new-eu-laws-will-take-on-dominance-of-big-tech-1.4429055">Margrethe Vestager</a> has gone as far as to accuse tech giants of “monopolistic practices that tilt the market, perpetuating their dominance while reducing consumer choice and squeezing out competition.”</p><p>The unilateral control of virtual marketplaces by large companies, which facilitate the existence of other smaller businesses within their networks, means that they have ultimate control over what information and products are shown to which consumers. The smallest amount of consumer data can be collected and managed across internal different pools, not to mention shared across different platforms. This can then be reused and remodelled for thousands of different applications through human or systematic interference without any user knowledge. With access to myriad amounts of invaluable user data, these companies are able to shape user experiences and hone their marketplaces so that they remain on&nbsp;top.</p><p>While it would be easy to lay the blame at the feet of Big Tech companies, they are not the only ones that track the activity of their customers. Small businesses, educational institutes, and even <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/website-tracking-software">news channels</a> track users in order to learn about browsing times on their websites, what they clicked on, and various other things. This helps them to get insights about the people using their platforms and what their needs are. On the whole this process is beneficial for improving products and services based on user activity. It is when the tracking goes beyond the acceptable confines of data collection, through the likes of third party cookies, that companies’ practises must be reprimanded.</p><p>In no other industry are you unequivocally required to exchange personal information in order to enter a public domain or buy products. Imagine if before purchasing your groceries or even entering a supermarket you were asked to write down your email and hand it to an employee who would then store it within the company’s personal records. This would never be allowed — so why do consumers passively accept the same practices online? The answer is that they are lacking the necessary information and technology to guard themselves against hostile tracking of their private information.</p><p>A recent study by the <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">Pew Research Centre</a> found that 81% of participants said that t<a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">he potential risks they face because of data collection on the internet outweigh the benefits</a>. This clearly suggests that consumers are not comfortable with how companies collect and store their personal information. The argument that consumers are happy to benefit from unchecked targeted advertising and tailored posts seems highly contentious in light of these findings.</p><p>Users clearly want to protect their personal information and place barriers between companies and their data where necessary. The onus therefore is on tech companies to provide them with the right tools and information to do so. Blockchain can play a major role in placing consumers back in the driving seat with data privacy, by allowing them to control the private information on a network which only approved individuals can access. Self-Sovereign Identity solutions should be implemented in order to facilitate control of personal information by consumers.</p><p>To break it down, SSI systems give users a unique identifier that they can use to manage their identity and access online services using only one ID. This provides a means of data authorization and ownership confirmation, giving respective users actual control of a particular asset. The systems use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to assure that services only access the specific data they require to verify identity, thereby ensuring privacy protection and limiting the potential for services to continue tracking users’ activity beyond the realm of what they approve or even see. Different entities can also build strong trust relationships amongst themselves through mutual authentication between entities, meaning that the sharing of information can be facilitated between parties in a way that is agreed beforehand.</p><p>As the world increasingly moves online to offer key services, whether these be economic, healthcare-based, or educational, it is essential that consumers have better oversight of how they are sharing personal information. Technology companies must move to equip users with the tools they need to effectively manage their data. Using blockchain, SSI solutions empower users to control their identity online by ensuring security and data management are at the forefront of any exchange. Going forward this system offers a pathway for a new way of operating on the internet, where users are in control of their data and how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq,&nbsp;Inc.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-solution-to-the-internets-data-hoarding-problem-a93c9f0b158f">The Solution To The Internet’s Data Hoarding Problem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce a new addition to our MATTR VII platform capabilities. As we continue to build out an extensive suite of features to support the exchange of data such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, we have now added secure <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID) messaging capabilities to enable entirely new ways to communicate using our platform.</p><p>The common and well-understood ways to interact with verifiable credentials have typically been mechanisms such as scanning QR codes or sharing deep links. In this release, we have focused on adding an option to these approaches that provides an even greater level of transparency and user control. With this new capability, you will be able to facilitate more intuitive user flows that make issuing, verifying, and communicating around verifiable credentials a seamless and efficient process for users. While utilizing existing frameworks like push notifications, secure DID messaging maintains a high level of privacy-preserving security. It does this by leveraging a decentralized ecosystem that ensures control of the data in a message remains solely with the participants exchanging the information, and no one&nbsp;else.</p><p>Utilizing the JSON Web Message (JWM) specification, this new capability allows for encrypted messages to be sent and received in a way that hides their content from all but the cryptographically authorized recipients of the message. That way, the sender of the message can be confident they are only disclosing their details and message with the intended&nbsp;parties.</p><p>There are two key pieces of information about a recipient that are fundamental to facilitating secure DID-based messaging on the platform. The first of these is the same as any messaging framework, in that an address or endpoint is needed to understand where to send the message. Unlike traditional messaging capabilities that require you to utilize centralized, service provider created, and controlled identifiers such as email and phone numbers, our DID-based messaging solution allows you to facilitate interactions between parties simply by using a Decentralized Identifier and its associated DID Document. The second piece of information you need is the recipient’s public key, which the platform obtains from the resolved DID document. This public key is then used to encrypt a message to the recipient.</p><p>These capabilities ensure&nbsp;that:</p>  a message is delivered to the correct recipient, and  only the intended recipient can view the content and other metadata of the&nbsp;message.  <p>A unique DID is also created by the wallet specifically for each unique interaction with a particular party or organization — further preserving a wallet holder’s privacy and anonymity between the various interactions they may have with issuers and relying parties&nbsp;alike.</p><p>Once the recipient’s DID is known, a message is formatted as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JSON Web Message (JWM)</a>. In this release, we have focused on adding support for 3 main types of messages:</p>  Offering a credential — rather than the user having to scan a QR code, a message can be sent directly to them that will initiate the credential offer flow within their&nbsp;wallet.  Notification about a change in the revocation status of a credential — a mechanism to ensure wallet holders are proactively informed about any status changes for credentials they hold in their wallet, even if they’re not online when the status update&nbsp;occurs.  Starting a credential verification flow (presentation request) — allows a holder to present a credential to a verifier directly, particularly useful in situations where there isn’t a co-location of parties present in the interaction.  <p>To take advantage of this capability as a wallet user, all you need to do is opt into receiving messages by enabling notifications in your wallet. At this point, a private cloud-based inbox will be created to store messages that are sent to your&nbsp;device.</p><p>Messages remain encrypted in the inbox and are only persisted in storage while they are in an unread state. Once the user views the message and its payload is extracted into their wallet, the encrypted message is removed from the inbox and only the payload itself is retained in the user’s&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>To give an example, let’s say you call up your bank and they are required to sight a form of government-issued identification in order to revalidate their anti-money laundering (AML) records. Given the bank already has an established relationship with you from your prior communications, they will likely have your DID stored in their system. Using this information, they push a message containing a presentation request to you. This request is then processed by the wallet on your phone and triggers a push notification to make you aware of the&nbsp;update.</p><p>Upon receiving the push notification containing the message, the wallet app will decrypt and extract the payload. In this instance, it contains a presentation request that asks you to select the credential to share back to the bank as proof of your identity. Once you have shared the credential presentation to match their request, the bank verifies that it satisfies their requirements giving them assurance that they are talking to the correct person and that they have met their audit requirements from an AML perspective. This allows them to continue the call with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Bringing secure messaging into our platform helps facilitate a more intuitive user experience with mobile wallets and helps simplify some of the otherwise complex issuance and verification flows that might otherwise involve scanning multiple QR codes or accessing different embedded&nbsp;links.</p><p>We look forward to continuing our collaboration with the community on the underlying messaging and security standards as well as gathering feedback from our customers and the broader ecosystem around ways to enhance and extend the different types of messages, along with ways to digest them into different kinds of interactions and experiences.</p><p><a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">Sign up</a> on our website today to get access to MATTR VII and check out <a href="http://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/revocation/revocation-overview">MATTR Learn</a> for a detailed walkthrough to start utilizing messaging as part of a verifiable credential flow.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-support-for-secure-did-messaging-befb75a72feb">Adding support for Secure DID Messaging</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 DeBio Network Partners with KILT Protocol to Embed Credentials into Anonymous-First Platform Used By Genetics&nbsp;Labs <p>6 May 2021, Singapore and Berlin — <a href="https://www.debio.network/">DeBio Network</a> and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> today announced a collaboration to incorporate KILT Credentials into Debio’s anonymous-first platform for medical and bioinformatics data. KILT would serve as the underlying accreditation infrastructure, enabling labs and biomedical facilities to embed credentials on medical test results, genome sequences and interlab collaborations.</p><p>DeBio Network, previously known as Degenics, is building a decentralised platform that will provide synergy between medical and bioinformatics organisations while guaranteeing user anonymity and sovereignty throughout the biomedical data pipeline. The platform is powered by blockchain technology, with an added focus on privacy computing RnD to maximise user and data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>“Debio is designed to prevent genetic data misuse, privacy and security violations, and the practice of selling genetic data without consent. We are implementing transformative technologies — Substrate’s blockchain framework, KILT’s identity protocol and IPFS’s decentralised storage — to fulfill this mission,” said Pandu Sastrowardoyo, initiator of DeBio&nbsp;Network.</p><p>After building its prototype on Ethereum, DeBio shifted to Substrate to benefit from its seamless integration with Polkadot, a scalable, interoperable protocol. DeBio aims to launch a Polkadot parachain later this year and intends to partner with multiple Polkadot ecosystem projects including KILT.</p><p>KILT is a blockchain protocol that enables innovative, industry-agnostic business models around identity. KILT intends to provide DeBio with a mechanism for issuing revocable, verifiable credentials that ensure privacy and data security. Specifically:</p>  KILT would be used for issuing credentials to the laboratories performing the&nbsp;analysis  DeBio would base the credentials of the genome analysis (via a link to IPFS stored report) on&nbsp;KILT  KILT would provide DeBio Network with attestations of lab accreditations  DeBio would base the identities of the “genome owners” on KILT including the payment flow between them and the labs. The goal is to ensure anonymity for the genome owners and give them full control over their&nbsp;data.  Delegation trees would enable bigger labs to lend their trust to small labs or university labs, providing them a new business opportunity via the Token Curated Attestor (TCA)&nbsp;model.  <p>“In building an anonymous-first platform, DeBio Network is transforming medical interactions for consumers — truly a Web3 approach, which is essential for driving the digitisation of the healthcare sector,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH. “Incorporating verifiable credentials through KILT provides users the anonymity needed for such personal data, adding a trust layer that gives users control over their health information.”</p><p>Storage requirements are also a critical element for DeBio’s platform, as some genome sequencing files can reach more than a gigabyte in size. DeBio utilises IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system, in order to meet its storage and performance needs. At the leading blockchain conference ETHDenver in February 2021, DeBio / Degenics was named Winner, Best IPFS Use for Identity, and was also a United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Winner for its fully anonymous home DNA testing marketplace.</p><p>About DeBio&nbsp;Network</p><p>DeBio is an anonymous-first, decentralised platform for medical and bioinformatics data. We are building a decentralised platform for your personal medical needs, starting with genetics. Our concept allows synergy between labs of all scales, while guaranteeing user anonymity and sovereignty at every step of the genomic data science workflow — from sample collection, data storage, to report generation.</p><p>About KILT&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>KILT is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing claim-based verifiable, revocable, and anonymous credentials for Web 3.0. It allows users to claim arbitrary attributes about themselves, have them attested by trusted entities, and store the claims as self-sovereign credentials. The protocol offers a simple JavaScript SDK so useful applications can be built without requiring any blockchain development skills. KILT Protocol is developed by BOTLabs GmbH in&nbsp;Berlin.</p><p>Press Contacts:</p><p>Pandu Sastrowardoyo — p@blocksphere.id</p><p>Christine Mohan — christine@kilt.io</p>

 What if the platforms didn’t control your identity information, but you could carry it with you? What if identity could be decentralized? 



<p>At the last DWeb Meetup, we were invited to share our role in the German Government’s 60M Euro SDI (Secure Digital Identities) innovation project to bring “Self-Sovereign Identity” to German and EU citizens.</p>



 Why 



<p>We all need a digital identity we own &amp; control, an identity that keeps all its components secure &amp; private.</p>



<p>Such self-owned digital identity must let us seamlessly navigate the digital world while giving us full control over how &amp; which information we share with whom.</p>



 What 



<p>Jolocom is part of three (<a href="https://www.once-project.de/">ONCE</a>, <a href="http://www.id-ideal.de">ID-Ideal</a> and <a href="http://sdika.de">SDIKA</a>) out of four winning teams in a 60M Euro German innovation competition to build the SDI Projects. Developers can integrate our platform-agnostic SSI technology to reach millions of EU citizens across 40 use cases poised to scale.</p>

 Jolocom’s SmartWallet is available now, for everyone, as a free app for your phone. But why would you want it and what does it do? 



 



<p>Put very simply, it’s not that dissimilar to your physical wallet. It belongs to you. You can put in it whatever you want, including proof of identity. Nobody else can see what’s in it, unless you want them to.</p>



<p>But our SmartWallet is not just a digital storage facility. It’s much more.</p>



<p>Just as with a physical wallet, users of the SmartWallet will gather cards and other information over time. For example, your ID card, health insurance card, driver’s license, season tickets, gym memberships and so on.</p>



<p>And, much like a physical wallet, you will be able to use the contents of your SmartWallet to prove your identity, by showing the cards and information you carry to whoever has requested it. However, using self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology the SmartWallet goes further. It gives you complete control over who sees what, as you curate the sources of your identity.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you need new car insurance and the insurance company wants confirmation that you are who you say you are. Through one quick online transaction, the SmartWallet can share with them your driver’s license, ID card and proof of car ownership. So, there’s no more need for a scan of an ID card, or a signed PDF of paper documents that might not even be accepted digitally and have to be sent in the mail. The whole process of establishing identity is completely sped up.</p>



Our two-parts demo to test SmartWallet: receiving the driving license (<a href="https://avalon.jolocom.com/">Avalon</a>) and then using it to register to car-sharing service(<a href="https://aelondo.jolocom.com/">Aelondo</a>).



<p>As mentioned, as soon as you have any proofs of identity in your SmartWallet, it’s completely down to you how you use them and who you share them with. Again, you curate them according to the requests you get.</p>



<p>As for us, all Jolocom does is provide the wallet. Once you’ve downloaded it, we have no further connection with it. We don’t see what you put in it. We don’t see when you take it out. We don’t see what you do with it. Nothing. Just like a physical wallet, it’s yours alone.</p>



<p>If these are the benefits for individuals, the end users, what about the organizations, public and private, governmental and commercial, that work with our SSI and SmartWallet technology? Other than faster transactions with their customers, employees or clients, what do they get?</p>



<p>Essentially, using SSI technology will allow an organization to improve its processes. It will make them cheaper and more secure, plus improve their ability to preserve privacy. That means GDPR compliance can be handled much more effectively.</p>







<p>The processes built using SSI technology will give those organizations four major checks in any interaction with a user, being:</p>



  Whose identity it is  Whether it’s been changed since it was verified by a third party  Who the verifying third party is.  Whether it’s been revoked.  



<p>Not only that, but the format this data is held in is very portable, so it can be moved from one organization to another easily and without losing the context or technical interoperability. Or to put it another way, SSI technology using the SmartWallet gives organizations a lot more freedom to achieve interoperability with each other. You might compare this to the way standardized shipping containers have revolutionized international logistics. The format we use for SSI will do the same with any imaginable proof you might need.</p>



<p>In addition to all this, once users have set up a SmartWallet, further onboarding processes become speedier and less involved for the users and the organizations they are interacting with. No longer having to go through an exhaustive registration process each time something new is issued or signed up for delivers a considerably improved user experience.</p>



<p>But if this is what Jolocom’s SmartWallet does, what else is there that makes it unique?</p>



<p>Firstly, our wallet is both production-ready and fully supports GDPR compliance. That means it’s ready to be used now, and provides users and organizations with the privacy guarantees that European law demands.</p>



<p>Secondly, the app has been designed expressly with the challenge of uptake in mind. We’ve considered user experience at every step of the way to create an intuitive interface and the best onboarding flow. We want people’s experience of SSI and their SmartWallets to be fun, so we’ve made ours playful and the onboarding process a pleasurable experience rather than a chore.</p>



<p>Finally, and most importantly, at Jolocom our goal and abiding principle is that everyone should be able to use SSI technology. That’s why we’ve made our SmartWallet and other products openly auditable on Github, and as accessible as possible. Unlike many other SSI solutions, you don’t need to be a part of a specific network or grouping to use our products. Because our technology is agnostic to the separate networks, it will allow you to interact and interoperate with all of them, thus improving individuals’ flexibility and freedom.

<p>Data publishers and consumers will be able to verify credentials while preserving privacy</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocolcom">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="http://everest.org">Everest</a> are partnering to add Everest’s global fiat on/off ramps and eKYC with identity creation &amp; credential sharing capabilities to Ocean Protocol and <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>. Everest is a device-free digital transaction protocol enabling digital identity verification for public services through the use of digital identities, electronic wallets, document management, and biometrics.</p><p>As part of the collaboration, Ocean granted funds to Everest to enable these capabilities for their community. Ocean Market users and businesses could benefit from fiat in/out, which necessitates identity verification. Similarly, data consumers want the ability to verify that users’ and business’ data truly belong to the individual or the business from whom they originated.</p><p>To truly monetize one’s data, be it a user or a business, a “real”, deduplicated identity must be associated with a wallet address. Without proof of uniqueness or humanness, a wallet address is as anonymous as a ghost. That said, users and businesses are entitled to their privacy, and thus to pseudonymity, as well as to private credential sharing. (For example, sharing a proof of address without revealing the actual address.) All of these are supported by Everest. With this combination of privacy and transparency, data suppliers and consumers can more easily exchange the value of good, verified&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>Everest’s eKYC solutions and fiat on/off ramps are a welcome addition to the Ocean ecosystem. The essence of Web3 is trust and privacy, and that is exactly what identity verification and private credential sharing are bringing to the table. If a data consumer wants to see a data publisher’s data asset, the consumer will be able to see the publisher’s linked credentials from Everest — all in a privacy-preserving manner, which is fundamental to Ocean’s&nbsp;values.</blockquote><blockquote>– Razvan Olteanu, COO at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>With Everest tools, Ocean users will be able to associate their wallet address with humanness, eKYC status, and convert fiat to crypto and vice versa. As part of a phased approach, Everest will add the ability to process transactions on <a href="https://everchain.eu/">Everchain</a>, its fast and low-cost L2 solution, and other&nbsp;chains.</p><blockquote>The collaboration is accretive to both ecosystems, where Ocean users will get the benefits of the Everest ecosystem (ID tokens staked for various services), and similarly, Everest users will be able to monetize themselves more easily using Ocean Protocol and the OCEAN&nbsp;token.</blockquote><blockquote>– Bob Reid, CEO of&nbsp;Everest</blockquote><p>Find out more about Everest’s Cloud FinTech platform at <a href="http://everest.org">everest.org</a>.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

The inability to prove identity is the single most significant barrier to economic inclusion.

 Bogoshipo强势上线Ardor，探索链游NFT全新玩法 NFT持续出圈 

 WeChat: 近期币安宣布将推出官方NFT平台，这条消息再次引爆NFT市场，毫无疑问，今年是NFT出圈元年，我们看到了他越来越多的可能性，NFT在艺术品上链、被当成具有防伪标志的门票、资产上链、票据服务、游戏等方面均可以创造巨大的价值。 

 NFT即非同质化代币，是一种被称为区块链的数字账本上的数据单位，每个代币可以代表一个独特的数字项目，代币不能互换。设想一下，一个图片，一个gif，一段音乐，或者一个证书。都可以转化为NFT保存、收藏、甚至交易，这在以前是根本没有办法完成的，这便是NFT的魅力所在。

<p>2021 is truly shaping to be a monumental year for MetaMUI Blockchain. The year kicked off with the official mainnet launch of the MetaMUI blockchain. The launch happened on January 3rd, the same date as the anniversary of Bitcoin’s creation. The event was inaugurated by the project’s Founder &amp; CEO, Seokgu “Phantom” Yun in a video recording Titled “Rewriting Satoshi Vision”. This landmark event was crucial in the direction of the MetaMUI project progress in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The next couple of weeks saw the Pre-IEO sale of the MMUI which was an effort to introduce our project and give a chance to more investors participating in MetaMUI community. The community support was amazing as all 3 rounds of the Pre-IEO sale were oversubscribed, and the required resources were promptly secured. And now, we intend to uphold promises made to the community, the first one being the listing of the MMUI on various exchanges.</p><p>In the coming days, we’ll be revealing more information as the build-up continues towards the first official exchange listing of MMUI. It will officially be announced by the exchange the day before listing on the exchange, and we will share the detailed listing schedule. When the listing eventually happens, traders and community members can trade their MMUI and those that missed out on all the rounds of the Pre-IEO sale, will have the opportunity to lay their hands on some&nbsp;MMUI.</p><p>A successful integration will make future integrations with other exchanges more expedient, as our engineers have been through the learning curve. This will greatly scale the future listing on other exchanges around the corners of the&nbsp;world.</p> What is MetaMUI(MMUI)? <p>MetaMUI(MMUI) is a native coin of MetaMUI Blockchain and serves as fuel for its ecosystem. To store and transfer MMUI, we’ve introduced the new MetaMUI Wallet application — which is a Self-Sovereign Identity Wallet designed as a close part of MetaMUI Blockchain.</p><p>The value of MMUI (digital sovereign currency) is controlled and maintained algorithmically by a special AI-based algorithmic engine called ACB (Algorithmic central bank). The MMUI is designed and developed to maintain and increase value over long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>For publishing a digital currency, the central bank node of the target currency is required to deposit assets to MUI central bank node. And these assets are collected and maintained by the MUI treasury. We refer to this as project funds. The project funds are used to buy MMUI from the market and increase its demand. Once the demand is high, the MUI ACB sells the coins at a higher value in the market and increases circulation. The circulation is capped at 1 billion coins to prevent cases of hyperinflation.</p><p>SWN Global&nbsp;team</p><p>— — —&nbsp;—</p><p>More About The&nbsp;Project</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a><br>Join our <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram Community Chat</a><br>Get the latest from our Telegram <a href="https://t.me/SovereignWallet_Official">announcement Channel</a><br>Read the MUI MetaBlockchain <a href="https://sovereignwallet-network.github.io/whitepaper/MUI-MetaBlockchain-White-Paper.pdf">Whitepaper</a><br>Download the MUI MetaWallet on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.metablockchain.metawallet">Android </a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mui-metawallet/id1546698261">IOS</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p><p>Zero Trust is a key paradigm for cybersecurity today, used well beyond the security circles. The goal is building cybersecurity that “never (blindly) trusts”, but “always verifies.” This traditionally meant verifying Who has access to What resource. In the past, the Who typically meant a human with a digital identity being given access to some application within an organization. Once the individual was given access to said application, that individual would be verified via an IAM tool’s authentication capability and then authorized based on policy and permissions while logging the transaction in preparation for an audit. This has been standard practice for many years to handle employees, customers, and partners.</p>

<p>But what happens when a digital identity represents more than a human individual and extends to machines such as IoT like devices, workloads, Robot (Bot) / RPA (Robotic Process Automation), or other types of identity in the future? What happens when access to the What resource is no longer on-premises but could also reside in the cloud, multi-cloud, or a Docker container running in Kubernetes somewhere? How do you keep up with the growing list of compliance laws and regulations like FERPA, GDPR, HIPPA, CCPA, SOX, and many others? At this point, you quickly realize that you are not in Kansas anymore (Wizard of Oz reference).</p>
 IGA sits in the middle of identities and resources 
<p>Fortunately, most modern Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions take care of the ever-growing list of different types of Who and regardless of where the What resides. With identities on one side and resources on the other side, IGA sits in the middle handling the Identity Lifecycles Management and Access Governance to resources. Identity Lifecycles Management addresses the joiner/leaver/mover processes and the ability to provision identities, access entitlements, and other identity-related information in the target systems. Access Governance supports the auditing and ensures compliance, such as the review and disposition of user access requests, certification campaigns, and access remediation when violations are found. Access Governance also handles Segregation of Duty (SoD) controls and role and policy management capabilities.</p>
 The principle of least privilege 
<p>One of the tenets of Zero Trust that fits nicely with IGA is the principle of least privilege by never granting more access than is necessary to get any job or workload done with the benefit of limiting lateral movement across the network. However, this is not easy using a more traditional model, in which managers are expected to know all of the different applications and services, roles, compliance considerations, etc. when an access request is submitted for that manager’s approval or the continual recertification of that access.</p>
 AI and Machine Learning capabilities a key differentiator between IGA vendors today 
<p>This again is where a more modern IGA solution can come to help through the use of identity and access intelligence using analytics and AI/ML capabilities, supporting a risk-based, just-in-time provisioning (and de-provisioning) of access. This is also one of the key differentiators between IGA vendors in the market today. Identity and access intelligence can assist by evaluating Who has access to What, the compliance policies under consideration, and assess the least privilege, identity risk, and scoring, perform access modeling, anomaly detection or detect identity, role, entitlement outliers, for example. These modern IGA solutions can also recommend whether to approve or disapprove access requests and, even in low-risk cases, automatically grant and revoke access.</p>
<p>To better understand the challenges of legacy IGA and how IGA continues to evolve along with business environment changes, KuppingerCole invites you to join its KCLive Event - Modern IGA Capabilities for Identity-Centric Security to hear from the experts and inform yourself on how to make the best decision possible for your organization.</p>

 Earlier this month, Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, took part in a webinar panel debate on Decentralized Identity Solutions, alongside the publication of a <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/genesis/99285/an-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-solutions">research report</a> in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/">The&nbsp;Block</a>. <p>In today’s world, it is becoming increasingly obvious that managing digital identity remains a huge challenge. Every day we hear about data breaches and hacking scandals. A typical internet user manages between 70–80 different usernames and passwords, while there are on average <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameslyne/2013/09/06/30000-web-sites-hacked-a-day-how-do-you-host-yours/?sh=3e17e31b1738">30,000</a> websites hacked every day. On the flip side, according to <a href="https://www.penalreform.org/resource/global-prison-trends-2020/">Global Prison Trends 2020</a>, 1.1 billion people in the world are unable to prove their identity, thus obstructing them from accessing vital healthcare, education, and financial resources.</p><p>The Block Webinar, “The State of Decentralized Identity Solutions”</p><p>In April 2021, Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, spoke at a panel titled “The State of Decentralized Identity Solutions” in association with <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/">The Block</a>, one of the leading research, analysis, and news brands in the digital asset space. Hu Ning was accompanied by experts in the field of digital identity, Daniel Buchner, Senior PM of Decentralized Identity at Microsoft, and Tobias Fox, Co-founder of Serto. The discussion delved into how digital identity applies to everything from financial services to upskilling workforces, and how blockchain infrastructure can be utilized to lay the trust framework for decentralized identity solutions.</p><p>Watch the panel discussion back&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/102427/the-state-of-decentralized-identity-solutions-brought-to-you-by-ontology">here</a>.</p><p>The Block Research Report, “An Introduction To Decentralized Identity Solutions”</p><p>In tandem with the panel discussion, The Block also released a research report titled “An Introduction to Decentralized Identity Solutions”.

<p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> continues to be a central nucleus for thoughtful discussion and development of all things related to digital identity. The most recent workshop, which was held in mid-April, was no exception. Despite the lack of in-person interaction due to the ongoing global pandemic, this IIW was as lively as ever, bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the globe to share experiences, swap perspectives, and engage in healthy&nbsp;debates.</p><p>One common theme this year was the continued development and adoption of BBS+ signatures, a type of multi-message cryptographic digital signature that enables selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. We first <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April 2020, and have been inspired and delighted by the community’s embrace and contribution to this effort across the board. In the year since, progress has been made in a variety of areas, from standards-level support to independent implementations and advanced feature&nbsp;support.</p><p>We thought we’d take a moment to round up some of the significant developments surrounding BBS+ signatures and highlight a few of the top items to pay attention to going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Over the past few months, the linked data proofs <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">reference implementation</a> of BBS+ published a new release that introduces a variety of improvements in efficiency and security, including formal alignment to the W3C CCG <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a> v3 definitions. In addition, support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures was added to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, making it possible to test this functionality in an interoperable way with other vendors participating in an open environment.</p><p>An important element in enabling BBS+ signatures is using what’s known as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09">pairing-friendly curve</a>; for our purposes we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. We have seen some promising signs of adoption for this key pair, with multiple Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods — both <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">did:indy</a> from <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did:ion</a> from <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> — indicating they intend to add or already have support for these keys, allowing BBS+ signatures to be issued across a variety of decentralized networks and ecosystems. This development is possible due to the fact that BBS+ signatures is a ledger-independent approach to selective disclosure, effectively no custom logic or bespoke infrastructure is needed for these digital signatures to be created, used and understood.</p><p>In addition, the Hyperledger Aries project has been hard at work developing interoperable and ledger-agnostic capabilities in open source. The method used to track interop targets within the cohort and ultimately measure conformance against Aries standards is what’s known as an <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries Interop Profile (AIP)</a>. A major upcoming update to AIP will add support for additional DID methods, key types and credential formats, as well as introducing Aries support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures as part of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>. This will allow Aries-driven credential issuance and presentation protocols to work natively with BBS+ credentials, making that functionality broadly available for those in the Aries community and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>There have also been a number of exciting developments when it comes to independent implementations of BBS+ signatures. <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo Solutions</a> has recently implemented JSON-LD BBS+ signatures support into the popular open-source codebase <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-Py). In another independent effort, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/ld-proofs-dotnet">implementation</a> of JSON-LD BBS+ credentials which they have demonstrated to be working in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2">DIDComm v2</a>, a secure messaging protocol based on DIDs. Implementations such as these help to demonstrate that open standards are transparent, can be understood and verified independently, and can be implemented with separate languages and tech stacks. They also set the groundwork for demonstrating real testing-driven interoperability via mechanisms such as the VC HTTP API and AIP 2.0. We are continuously looking to improve the documentation of these specs and standards so that their implications and nuances can be more broadly understood by builders and developers looking to engage with the technology.</p><p>On the cryptographic side of things, progress is also being made in hardening the existing BBS+ specification as well as expanding BBS+ to support more advanced privacy-preserving features. A significant development in this area is the work of cryptographer Michael Lodder who has been actively conducting research on an enhanced credential revocation mechanism using <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">cryptographic accumulators</a> with BBS+. This approach presents a promising alternative to existing solutions that allow authoritative issuers to update the status of issued credentials without compromising the privacy of the credential holder or subject who may be presenting the credential. We see this as another application of BBS+ signatures in the context of verifiable credentials that carries a lot of potential in pushing this technology to an even more robust&nbsp;state.</p><p>There was also initial discussion and tacit agreement to create a new cryptography-focused working group at Decentralized Identity Foundation. As the new WG drafts its charter, the first work item of this group will be the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+ Signatures</a> spec which defines the cryptographic scheme known as BBS+ agnostic of its application in areas such as linked data signatures or verifiable credentials. In the future, this WG will likely evolve to include other crypto-related work items from the community.</p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the momentum and development building around this technology in the community. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of BBS+ signatures, especially as we gear up to tackle the next set of hard problems in this area including privacy-preserving subject authentication and revocation using cryptographic accumulators. If you’re interested we encourage you to get involved, either by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">Linked Data Proofs specification</a>, checking out our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">implementations</a>, or participating in the new WG at DIF, to name but a few of the many ways to engage with this work. We look forward to doing this retrospective at many IIWs to come, documenting the ever-growing community that continues to champion this technology in dynamic and interesting ways.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/iiw32-bbs-and-beyond-1a41634c15b0">IIW32: BBS+ and beyond</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Since launching just three months ago, <a href="https://tryshowtime.com/">Showtime</a> has grown at lightspeed, attracting a vibrant community of over 20,000 art collectors and enthusiasts. I sat down with co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej">Alex Masmejean</a> to understand how Magic helped make it all possible.</p> Tech moves fast. Crypto moves&nbsp;faster. <p>Moving fast without sacrificing user experience is crucial for any startup’s success. Alex told me that’s even more important when working in the world of crypto. “In crypto, the speed of shipping is very, very fast. There was no question — Magic was the only auth product we were going to use at launch,” said&nbsp;Alex.</p><p>Showtime is a new kind of social network, dedicated to showcasing and discovering digital art in the form of NFTs. Its soft, minimalist interface puts artwork front and center — a breath of fresh air compared to the sensory overload of sites like Facebook or Twitter. NFTs can be linked from any number of crypto marketplaces, with artworks ranging from photography to rich, looping 3D renders and everything in between. Pieces vary widely in style, many with organic micro-communities growing around them in the form of comment threads and records of digital ownership.</p><p>Alex set out to build Showtime as a social layer on top of the “otherwise very transactional world” of NFTs. The exponential growth of crypto art and collectibles throughout 2020 made it clear that NFTs were breaking into the mainstream, and a social network seemed like the perfect gateway for people new to the space. All that was left to do was build it, and build it&nbsp;fast.</p><p>When it came to user login, Alex knew that he needed a solution that would provide a simple user experience for both Showtime’s end users and the engineers who had to implement it. That’s where <a href="https://magic.link">Magic</a> came&nbsp;in.</p><a href="https://tryshowtime.com/t/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/22970">Kong 4156</a> by artist Tony Babel via&nbsp;Showtime Auth that works out of the&nbsp;box <p>As a small team getting off the ground with zero funding, Magic made it quick and easy for the founding Showtime team to bootstrap an early prototype and get their product in front of an audience fast. Alex was drawn to Magic’s easy plug-and-play capabilities and ended up sticking with it because he’s confident it enables the best login experience possible for Showtime’s users.</p><blockquote>“To me it was a no-brainer — I had to integrate Magic.”</blockquote><p>Building your own authentication from scratch can take months, not to mention the headaches and liability that come with maintaining security into the future. Showtime was able to fully integrate Magic in just a matter of hours, and they haven’t looked back since. Smirking, Alex told me he “doesn’t even know the pain of having a bad customer experience” thanks to launching with Magic on day&nbsp;one.</p> The art of frictionless login <p>Alex touts Magic as the easiest way for crypto platforms like Showtime to reach a wider audience and ultimately gain mass appeal. No wallets, browser plug-ins, or technical know-how required; visitors just provide an email address and seconds later they’re a Showtime&nbsp;user.</p><blockquote>“It’s the simplest way to onboard people who are new to&nbsp;crypto.”</blockquote><p>As popular artists like <a href="https://tryshowtime.com/shavonnewong">Shavonne Wong</a> and <a href="https://tryshowtime.com/3LAU">3LAU</a> began migrating to Showtime, they brought with them large followings that repeatedly flooded the social network with new users from outside the crypto community. Magic was there to help onboard these new users in a snap, giving them a warm welcome. “It’s so simple even my parents can use it,” Alex&nbsp;joked.</p><p>From creating a rough initial prototype to helping usher NFTs into the mainstream earlier this year, Magic’s been there for Showtime every step of the way. With that reliability and peace of mind, the Showtime team has been able to spend their time on what matters most: building a home for the next generation of digital artists and their&nbsp;fans.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-magic-helps-showtime-build-community-around-crypto-art-dccd01a38927">How Magic helps Showtime build community around crypto art</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  SITA, INDICIO PAVE WAY TO SAFER TRAVEL EXPERIENCE WITH LAUNCH OF ARUBA HEALTH APP

Using blockchain, the app creates a secure travel credential that is accepted by airlines, hotels and hospitality partners without sharing private health information  
  
			   
				
				
				 <p>ORANJESTAD – &nbsp;5 May 2021 – Indicio.tech, together with <a>SITA</a> and the Aruba Health Department, are trialing the Aruba Health App, a pilot that makes it easy for visitors to share a trusted traveler credential – based on their health status – privately and securely on their mobile device. This credential will provide access to participating hospitality sites on the island.</p>
<p>Aruba is focused on rebuilding its tourism industry in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring that the risk of infection from people visiting the island is minimized. The island has been less impacted by the pandemic than many other countries globally and is open to most tourists. To ensure their safety, and those of the island’s residents, all tourists are required to provide a negative PCR test taken 72 hours&nbsp; before flying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Aruba Health App, visitors to the island who have provided the required health tests to the Aruba government will be issued with a unique trusted traveler credential, using blockchain technology. This credential then can be verified by hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues through the unique QR code on a visitor’s mobile device without sharing any private data. The digital credential also enables the Aruba government to restrict visitors from leaving their hotel rooms until they have received a negative PCR test result.</p>
<p>Unlike immunity passports, these verifiable digital credentials are part of a technology known as decentralized identity, an evolutionary leap forward in individual privacy protection and security. It allows users to share only a trusted verification that they have the relevant documentation to complete their transaction, without having to share personal information. This credential can be used across the journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trial is yet another step towards SITA developing a more durable, secure travel credential that could combine all travel documents such as passport, visa and health information into a single credential that puts the traveler’s privacy first. This credential will provide verification that a traveler has the right documentation, making border crossings more automated, with checks done before departure.</p>
<p>Diana Einterz, SITA President for the Americas, said: “Giving travelers the ability to share verifiable health data with relevant stakeholders throughout their journey will help expedite the industry’s recovery. It is vital to ensure we open borders safely and securely, and this trial puts us one step closer to single travel token that will give passengers more control and convenience by allowing them to securely share their credentials with governments, airports and airlines from their mobile device.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent poll from IATA highlighted that 78% of passengers who took part in the survey would only use a travel credential app if they have full control over their data.</p>
<p>Heather Dahl, CEO of Indico, said: “With the decentralized identity ecosystem we’ve built with SITA for Aruba, we’ve created a path to a better future. We can reopen economies and restart travel without people having to give up their privacy. We’re not just solving a pandemic problem, we’re solving a privacy and security problem. That’s because this technology was designed from the outset to respect a person’s right to control their own data and identity. Aruba and SITA have taken a global lead on privacy-first identity technology for travel, and their pioneering efforts are laying the foundation for a fairer world to come.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dangui Oduber, Aruba’s Minister&nbsp;of&nbsp;Tourism, Public Health and Sport: “The Aruba Health App is fundamental in balancing the dual challenges of reopening our island to tourism while managing the risks of COVID-19. By providing a trusted traveler credential, we can be sure that visitors have the right documentation needed to move freely around the island while making the verification of that trusted status easy without having to divulge personal information. That is a revolutionary step forward.” </p>

			 What Are Stock Tokens? 
<p>As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Binance has been aggressively pursuing and exploring a wide range of services for its users. Its latest initiative is to allow users to trade ‘stock tokens’ that represent shares of publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The transactions are settled in stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD). Since 12 April, Binance has released stock tokens for Tesla, Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Apple and Microsoft. This is a milestone in the tokenization field as it opens up the security tokens to the masses. In fact, Binance is not the first company to do this, as FTX and Bittrex, two other cryptocurrency exchanges, started tokenized stocks trading back in late 2020.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that all of these tokenized stocks are mirrors of securities, meaning that the tokens are not shares and only give exposure to the underlying shares. In other words, investors don’t have direct ownership of the shares, and the tokens are not transferable between investors. The digital asset marketplace (Binance, etc.) is the issuer, controlling the tokens for its token holders. It is a delegated system.</p>
 So Why Does It Concern Regulators? 
<p>Binance has also declared that holders of their stock tokens will qualify for economic returns on the underlying securities, including potential dividends, making the tokens securities. As those familiar with legislation on security tokens, tokenization doesn’t change the fact that they have to comply with securities regulation, especially when they are distributed to the public. Digital securities must be issued as permissioned tokens to comply with international regulations.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			<p>Permissioned tokens apply compliance checks during transfers to make sure that only eligible investors can hold the security tokens. And Binance’s stock tokens don’t appear to have been issued as permissioned tokens. They control the stock tokens for their users. No surprise that it didn’t take long for BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, to knock on Binance’s door. On 28 April, BaFin has published <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Verbrauchermitteilung/weitere/2021/meldung_210428_binance_deutschland.html">a note</a> on its website warning Binance that they are selling shares in Germany in the form of stock tokens without offering the necessary prospectuses. This could result in a 5-million-euro fine or a forfeit of 3% of Binance’s 2020 turnover.</p>

		 
	 
          BaFin has grounds to suspect that Binance Germany is selling shares in Germany in the form of 'share tokens' without offering the necessary prospectuses.  BaFinGermany’s financial regulator         
	 
		 
			 Security Token Protocols Are Getting Traction 
<p>It’s essential for securities issuers to choose a resilient infrastructure and the right security token protocol to issue securities on blockchain in order to properly enforce securities regulation. This infrastructure should provide solutions for issuers to natively tokenize shares with compliance rules embedded in the security token smart contracts. There are plenty of open-source protocols in the market that can provide these services, such as the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Protocol</a>, the most adopted one used for tokenizing securities, having issued over&nbsp; €8.5 million assets to date. Here, we compare the differences between delegated security tokens and native security tokens issued via T-REX Protocol in the table below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Issuers also need to keep in mind that they must be authorized by regulators to distribute securities. In Binance’s case, there are certain documents such as prospectuses that need to be provided to investors. And these documents should be easily accessible by investors.</p>
<p>Binance is not a regulated exchange for securities, but they have apparently chosen to distribute securities to their users and to keep their security tokens in custody. It is not hard to see why regulators are looking into them. Unlike unregulated exchanges, broker-dealers, ATS, regulated exchanges, asset managers, and many other players are already allowed to distribute securities to their clients. These entities should launch <a href="https://tokeny.com/whats-the-purpose-of-a-digital-asset-marketplace/">Digital Assets Marketplaces (DAM)</a> and be sure that they only accept native security tokens in order to remain compliant.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 What are the key components of a security token marketplace? 
 
 Select serious securities issuers; 
 Onboard investors and verify their eligibility; 
 Distribute security tokens with documents required by regulators; 
 Issue and allocate permissioned security tokens to investors’ wallet; 
 Authorize transferability in P2P. 
 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			<p>With the right protocol, marketplace operators will be in line with lawmakers, allowing their investors to benefit from fractional and direct ownership, while receiving all the rights that directly associate with that securities.</p>
<p>Overall, we are pleased to see the progress that has been made in the tokenization market, as well as the attention it has recently attracted. Now, the technology is ready, and mass adoption will come as soon as institutions start to move and choose the right infrastructure.</p>

<p>Near Field Communication (NFC) has been around since the early 2000s, but has experienced a real coming of age throughout the last couple of years and especially during the pandemic with broadening application. NFC technology is on the rise as it powers our smartphones and credit cards to be used for contactless payments or doors to unlock by the touch of a smart key. Many more applications are possible, many as of yet unforeseen.</p>
<p>For instance, did you know, that Near Field Communication can also be applied during identity verification?</p>
<p>Smartphones as the key to unlocking the power of NFC</p>
<p>NFC can be applied as a means to read out data for the purpose of identification and authentication. In contrast to Optical Character Recognition (reading out a document using a camera and then identifying what is written on the document), NFC reads out data from identification documents that contain RFID chips with the same personal information coded on them as the physical ID. Many are even supplemented by biometric information like a picture, fingerprints and more (biometric IDs).</p>
<p>Back in the 2000s, the application of NFC was not yet widely spread as distinct machines were necessary for operation – a hurdle for day to day usage. However, nowadays almost every person carries what is needed in their pocket, as modern smartphones typically come equipped with the necessary functionality.</p>
<p>The right counterpart – Electronic Identity Documents</p>
<p>NFC-read out obviously requires the right medium to extract information from. Thankfully, most identification documents come equipped with a chip where all relevant information is saved. Institutions like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have been the drivers of creating standards for such documents to assure that countries do not go their own way, but create an ecosystem of interoperability to accommodate the identity needs in a globalized world. The standard <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/icao-9303/">ICAO 9303</a>&nbsp; has been well established and adopted by more than 188 countries, who model documents like passports accordingly and equip them with chips to turn them into ePassports, ready for touch and go identification via NFC-enabled smartphones and other devices.</p>
<p>Security first – Everything in a nutshell</p>
<p>With such highly sensitive data encoded on the chip, security naturally is a top priority. ePassports and similar documents come with an array of security measures to stop fraudsters and identity thieves in their tracks:</p>
 
 Privacy Protection during data read out: To protect ID owners from attempts of “eavesdropping” on the data transmission (trying to skim data during the read out), security measures like the Basic Access Protocol (BAC) are integrated. 
 Measures for Authentication: RFID Chips are typically signed digitally by the issuing country. Every country has its own country certificate, which can be verified to detect forgery and manipulation. The process is called passive authentication. More advanced measures like active authentication and clone authentication are available to evaluate if a real chip has been duplicated. 
 Protection from identity theft: Many electronic IDs do not just contain personal information but also biometric data like a photo and fingerprints. While fingerprints can not be accessed through any other organization than the authorities, the biometric photo saved on the ID can be compared to a selfie recorded during identification to ensure customers are who they claim to be and avoid identity theft. 
 
 Coming soon! NFC capability for IDnow AutoIdent 
<p>IDnow is strongly committed to the NFC technology as a trailblazer for convenience during customer onboarding processes combined with security features at government-level. Besides <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">IDnow eID</a>, which uses this technology for identifying users based on their German electronic ID and government-issued PIN, we will also add NFC capability to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow AutoIdent</a>&nbsp;to integrate the fraud and identity theft detection capabilities into the AutoIdent process while providing a great user experience through speedy onboarding with a high degree of automation. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>All of us have many unique identifiers/credentials that identify us, such as our email addresses, social media handles, usernames and passwords for different sites, driver’s license ID, passport ID, and so on. In reality, we don’t control any of these identifiers and the way they are&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Often, these identifiers are stored by third-party companies in centralized locations that could be hacked. Also, they are closely tied to the organization storing it, so if the organization bans you or becomes non-existent, so do your identifiers. A good example can be the way Donald Trump was kicked out of Twitter that led him to lose his followers and public identity overnight!</p><p>A new digital identity framework called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) has emerged to overcome these challenges and to give users complete control over how their identifiers are generated, where they are stored, and how they are&nbsp;shared.</p><p>The last few years have seen a stronger push for self-sovereign identity and this has led to the development of standards and building blocks for their implementation. Many companies like <a href="http://affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> have been creating building blocks to enable SSI across different industries.</p><p>A basic building block of SSI is Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These are a type of unique identifiers (URI) that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>These DIDs come with certain properties and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Does not require a centralized registration authority  Many DIDs use the distributed ledger technology or any other decentralized network, though it is not mandatory  It is a permanent identifier because it does not depend on a single third-party or centralized registry for its existence.  Can be cryptographically verified  They connect a DID subject (the entity identified by the DID) with a DID document (a set of data that describes the DID subject) to enable the subject to have trustable interactions.  They are interoperable and portable, provided they conform to the existing standards laid down by&nbsp;W3C  <p>So, this is how a DID looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>Here,</p>  The first part, the “did”, is the URI to identify that the transaction pertains to decentralized identifiers. This URI does not change, regardless of the implementation.  The second part, “example” is the DID method. This value is the protocol that determines where or how you’re going to find the DID. There are about 97 methods available at the time of writing this piece and this is likely to increase. Fundamentally, most of these methods revolve around creation, reading, update, and delete, but the implementation of each of these actions vary across the&nbsp;methods.  The third part, the long alphanumeric value is the DID resolution that can be understood as an algorithm or value that resolves the DID to the DID document. It is similar to the DNS address that we use&nbsp;today.  <p>A key building block of DIDs is the DID&nbsp;method.</p> What are DID&nbsp;Methods? <p>In a nutshell, DID methods are the component that helps a DID to resolve a DID document. It defines how DID documents are created, read, updated, and deleted on a&nbsp;network.</p><p>DID methods are often associated with a verifiable data registry, which is a system that brings together DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods. Some examples of verifiable data registries are trusted databases, decentralized databases, distributed ledger, and government ID databases like DigiLocker. Sometimes, more than one type of registry can be used in the same ecosystem.</p><p>In terms of implementation, a DID method is defined by its specification that precisely defines how DIDs and DID documents are created, updated, deactivated, and resolved.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an&nbsp;example.</p><p>DID: ELEM: jadjfa;j948madnfaupwmfm</p><p>Here,</p>  DID is the&nbsp;schema  ELEM is the verifiable data registry. ELEM represents the implementation of sidetree protocol on the Ethernet&nbsp;network  Jadjfa;j948madnfaupwmfm is the method-specific identifier and is the public key on a distributed ledger.  <p>Let’s now delve deeper into the world of DIDs and their&nbsp;working</p> How do DIDs&nbsp;Work? <p>Just like any other URI, DIDs are a unique identifier that associates a DID subject with a DID document.</p><p>Here, the DID subject can be an individual, entity, thing, etc, while the DID document is a JSON-LD object that contains a set of data that describes the DID subject including the cryptographic signatures, verification methods, or just about anything that will enable the DID subject to have trustable interactions with other entities on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>In essence, the DID contains a unique identifier that is used to lookup a DID document that relates to a DID subject. It is stored on one or more decentralized storage systems such as IPFS or&nbsp;STORJ.</p><p>Here, the DID resolves the DID document that in turn, describes the DID subject. To close the loop, the DID subject controls the DID and determines how and with whom it can be shared. In this sense, the DID subject is the DID controller in our example, but it merits to note that the DID controller and the DID subject don’t have to be the same entity at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>The key difference is that the DID controller has the right to change the DID document and this right is granted through the use of cryptographic keys. Due to this aspect, there can be more than one DID controller for the same DID document.</p><p>So, the workflow begins when a DID subject decides to create a DID for sharing with others. This connects to a DID document that could&nbsp;contain,</p>  The DID&nbsp;itself  A timestamp of when it was&nbsp;created  Metadata related to its delegation and authorization  Cryptographic proof of its validity including the public keys that is used to authenticate the DID&nbsp;subject  A possible list of services where the DID can be&nbsp;used  A JSON-LD signature to verify the integrity of the DID&nbsp;document  <p>Note that the DID document doesn’t contain personal information about the subject as these come through verifiable credentials. You can visualize DID as the base layer of the decentralized infrastructure and the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> containing the PII of a subject as the next higher&nbsp;layer.</p><p>Now, let’s go back to our DID to break it down a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>Yet, there are many differences between DIDs and&nbsp;DNS.</p><p>Now that we have a better understanding, here’s how a DID document could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Here, the DID document contains the cryptographic information needed to authenticate the DID controller.</p><p>There are a few key elements&nbsp;here.</p>  Context — Denotes that this is a JSON-LD&nbsp;document  Id — Points to the DID in a DID&nbsp;document  Authentication — An optional property and represents one or more verification methods  Service — This is also optional and describes the means of communication with a DID&nbsp;subject  <p>We hope this gives you an idea of what <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#section/Introduction/What-is-a-Decentralized-Identifier(DID)">DIDs</a> are and why you need them for relevant implementations.

  <p>The client credentials grant is used when two servers need to communicate with each other outside the context of a user. This is a very common scenario—and yet, it’s often overlooked by tutorials and documentation online. In contrast, the authorization code grant type is more common, for when an application needs to authenticate a user and retrieve an authorization token, typically a JWT, that represents the user’s identity within the application and defines the resources the user can access, and the actions the user can perform.</p>

<p>The OAuth 2.0 docs describe the client credentials grant in this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Client Credentials grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of a user. This is typically used by clients to access resources about themselves rather than to access a user’s resources.</p>

   <a>Learn More About Spring Boot and Spring Security</a> 
 

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about how to allow services to securely interoperate even when there is not an authenticated user, using the client credentials grant.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this grant type is more straightforward than the other user-focused grant types. It is often used for processes such as CRON jobs, scheduled tasks, and other types of heavy background data processing.</p>

<p>You will create a simple resource server that will be secured using Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. After that, you will create a Spring Boot-based command-line client that uses Spring’s <code>RestTemplate</code> to make authenticated requests to the secure server. You will see how to authenticate the client with Okta using the client credentials grant and how to exchange the client credentials for a JSON Web Token (JWT), which will be used in the requests to the secure server.</p>

<p><code>RestTemplate</code> is deprecated, and while still widely used, should probably not be used for new code. Instead, the WebFlux-based class, <code>WebClient</code> should be used. In the next part of the tutorial, you will implement the same OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant using Spring <code>WebClient</code>.</p>

 What Is the Client Credentials Grant Flow? 

<p>The goal of the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant is to allow two automated services to interact securely. It does this primarily by replacing the old scheme, HTTP Basic, with a token-based authentication scheme that greatly reduces the number of requests that expose sensitive access credentials.</p>

<p>The primary problem with HTTP Basic is that it sends the username and password with every request. This means that each and every request between each and every service is a major potential security risk. Did the headers get leaked in a log file? Did somebody forget to force HTTPS? One mistake and credentials are compromised. Further, because usernames and passwords often don’t have expiration dates, and because many people will (sadly) reuse these credentials across services, such a leak can expose a hole the size of a barn in a system’s security barrier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OAuth 2.0, in contrast, mitigates this risk by having the client (the service initiating the request) request an access token from an authorization server. This access token is then used in the request to the other service for authentication and authorization. The primary benefit here is that the service credentials are only exposed when a new token must be requested or refreshed.</p>

<p>Further, this request is performed in a far more controlled manner, since it happens between the client and the authorization server.With HTTP Basic, in essence, every server has to act as an authorization server, with the increased security risk this poses. (Ideally a single authorization server can be hardened far more effectively than an entire network of services.)</p>

<p>The same is true when the service that receives the request validates the token. It makes a request to the authorization server, sending only the token, not exposing the username and password of the client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another major benefit is that the tokens should expire and can be scoped. Passwords only expire when they are changed. Tokens have an expiration built into them. Further, the scope of the token and the authenticated identity of the token holder can be used to restrict the actions that the token holder is allowed to perform.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   Java 11: This project uses Java 12. OpenJDK 12 will work just as well. Instructions are found on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. OpenJDK can also be installed using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another excellent option for installing and managing Java versions. 
   HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you’ll use to test the WebFlux server. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>. 
   Okta CLI: The Okta CLI is a simple way to use Okta as an OAuth 2. 0 and Open ID Connect provider. You can sign up for a free Okta developer account, log in to an existing account, and create OIDC applications. You’ll use it in this tutorial to configure Okta as your OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider. 
 

 Intro to Spring Security 5 Core Classes 

<p>Spring Security 5 changed how a lot of the OAuth flow is handled. The client credentials grant was no exception—the old method used Spring’s <code>RestTemplate</code> and <code>OAuth2RestTemplate</code>. While you can still use <code>RestTemplate</code>, <code>OAuth2RestTemplate</code> is gone and does not work with Spring Security 5. The preferred method in Spring Security 5 is to use the <code>WebClient</code>, which is part of the <code>WebFlux</code> package.</p>

<p>I’m going to take a moment to introduce some of the main OAuth Spring Security classes. If you already feel comfortable with OAuth 2.0 and Spring Security 5, or just want to see the code, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.</p>

<p>In the examples below, you’ll see that to configure client credentials need to configure Spring by overriding some of these classes through Bean definitions. If you want to get a more detailed look at these classes, take a look at <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.4.5/reference/html5/#oauth2Client-core-interface-class">the Spring docs on the subject</a>.</p>

<p>ClientRegistration: represents a client registered with OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC). It holds all of the basic information about the client, such as client id, client secret, grant type, and the various URIs. Client registrations are typically loaded automatically from an <code>application.properties</code> file. Spring auto-configuration looks for properties with the schema <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.[registrationId]</code> and creates a <code>ClientRegistration</code> instance within a <code>ClientRegistrationRepository.</code> As you will see, in the command line runner version of this, we have to re-create some of this logic manually because it is not being auto-configured for us outside of the scope of a web service environment.</p>

<p>ClientRegistrationRepository: this is a container class that holds <code>ClientRegistrations</code>.</p>

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClient: Represents an authorized client. This is a composed class that contains a client registration but adds authentication information. Take a look at the code excerpt below. You’ll see that the <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClient</code> adds three properties composed on top of the client registration: a principal name, an access token, and a refresh token.</p>

   <code>public class OAuth2AuthorizedClient implements Serializable {
    ...
    private final ClientRegistration clientRegistration;
    private final String principalName;
    private final OAuth2AccessToken accessToken;
    private final OAuth2RefreshToken refreshToken;
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository: is a container class that holds and persists authorized clients between requests. The default implementation, <code>InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code>, simply stores the clients in memory.</p>

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClientManager: is the manager class that contains the logic to handle the authorization flow. Most importantly, it authorizes and re-authorizes OAuth 2.0 clients using an <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider</code>. It also delegates persistence of the authorized clients and calls success or failure handlers when client authorization succeeds or fails.</p>

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider: represents an OAuth 2.0 provider and handles the actual request logic for different grant types and OAuth 2.0 providers. They can be auto-configured based on property values (<code>spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.[provider name]</code>). In the case of this tutorial, you will be using Okta as your provider, so you’ll see properties with the prefix <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.</code> that are auto-configuring an associated <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider</code>.</p>

<p>Now for the code!</p>

 Build a Secure OAuth 2.0 Resource Server with Spring Security 

<p>In this section, you’re going to make a simple resource server for the clients to call. To bootstrap the project, you’re going to use <a href="http://start.spring.io/">the Spring Initializr</a>. It’s a great way to create a preconfigured Spring Boot project. Here you’re going to access it via the REST API, but it also has a pretty slick web interface.</p>

<p>Make a root project directory for the three different applications:</p>
 
   the resource server, 
   the <code>RestTemplate</code> client, and 
   the <code>WebClient</code> client. 
 

<p>Open a BASH shell and navigate to the base project directory. Run the command below to retrieve the pre-configured starter project for the server using the Spring Initializr REST API.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.4.5 \
  -d artifactId=secure-server \
  -d dependencies=oauth2-resource-server,web,security,okta \
  -d language=java \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d baseDir=secure-server \
| tar -xzvf - &amp;&amp; cd secure-server
</code>   

<p>This defines four dependencies:</p>
 
   Spring Boot OAuth 2.0 resource server 
   Spring Boot web starter 
   Spring security 
   The Okta Spring Boot starter 
 

<p>The Okta Spring Boot starter is a project that simplifies OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration with Spring Boot and Okta. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the Okta Spring Boot Starter on GitHub</a> for more information.</p>

<p>From within the <code>secure-server</code> project, open the <code>DemoApplication</code> class file and replace it with the following contents.</p>

<p><code>java/com/example/secureserver/DemoApplication.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.secureserver;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableGlobalMethodSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import com.okta.spring.boot.oauth.Okta;

import java.security.Principal;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
    public static class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        protected void configure(final HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http.authorizeRequests()
                    .anyRequest().authenticated()
                    .and()
                    .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        }
    }

    @RestController
    public class RequestCotroller {
        @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_mod_custom')")
        @GetMapping("/")
        public String getMessage(Principal principal) {
            return "Welcome, " + principal.getName();
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This class does a few important things. In the <code>SecurityConfig</code> inner class, it configures Spring Boot as an OAuth 2.0 resource server using JWTs and requires that all requests are authenticated. It also enables using the <code>@PreAuthorize</code> annotation by including the <code>@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)</code> annotation.</p>

<p>The second inner class, <code>RequestController</code>, defines a REST endpoint at the context root and secures this endpoint using the <code>@PreAuthorize</code> annotation. The security requires that the authorized JWT has the custom scope “mod_custom.”</p>

<p>Notice that to specify a required scope using the <code>PreAuthorize</code> annotation, you use a Spring Expression Language snippet (SpEL): <code>hasAuthority('SCOPE_mod_custom')</code>. Spring automatically prepends “SCOPE_” in front of the required scope name, such that the actual required scope is “mod_custom” not “SCOPE_mod_custom.”</p>

<p>The application code is in place. However, you still need to configure the Spring Boot application to use Okta as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider. You also need to create an OIDC application on Okta.</p>

 Create an OIDC Application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create service</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OAuth 2.0 Service App in your Okta Org. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/overview/">Create a Service App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Copy the values from the generated <code>.okta.env</code> file into <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>. It should look like the following (with your own values for the issuer, client ID, and client secret) when you’re finished.</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-secret=292yu98y2983e28ue928u39e82ue982ue982
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oa7km6o1AEDdbuUq4x7
</code>   

<p>Add a line to the <code>applications.properties</code> file. This changes the server port to 8081.</p>

   <code>server.port=8081
</code>   

 Test Your Secure Server 

<p>You now have a fully functioning server application. You can run it with the following command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Once that finishes starting, you can run a request using HTTPie.</p>

   <code>http :8081/secure
</code>   

<p>However, the server requires a valid JSON Web Token (JWT).</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401 
...

401 Unauthorized

</code>   

 Add a Custom Scope to Your Authorization Server 

<p>Because we are using the custom scope <code>mod_custom</code> in the <code>@Preauthorize</code> annotation, you need to add this custom scope to your Okta authorization server. Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console. You may need to click the Admin button to get to your dashboard.</p>

<p>Go to Security &gt; API. Select the Default authorization server by clicking on default in the table.</p>

<p>Select the Scopes tab. Click Add Scope.</p>

<p>Give the scope the following Name: <code>mod_custom</code>.</p>

<p>Give the scope whatever Display Name and Description you would like, or leave it blank. Click Create to continue.</p>

 Create a RestTemplate Command-Line Application 

<p>Next, you will create a command-line application that makes an authorized request to the secure server using <code>RestTemplate</code>. Use the Spring Initializr to download a bootstrapped application with the following command, run from the root directory for the project as a whole.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.4.5 \
  -d artifactId=client \
  -d dependencies=oauth2-client,web \
  -d language=java \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d baseDir=client-resttemplate \
| tar -xzvf - &amp;&amp; cd client-resttemplate
</code>   

<p>Open this project in your IDE and a new class to hold the OAuth configuration.</p>

        return authorizedClientManager;
    }

}
</code>   

<p>In the context of a servlet, much of what this file does would be accomplished automatically by Spring auto-configuration. However, since this is a command-line utility and no servlet is going to be created, you have to recreate some of the OAuth configuration. This is what the file above accomplishes.</p>

<p>The <code>oktaClientRegistration()</code> method loads the properties for the client and provider from the <code>application.properties</code> file and creates an Okta client registration using those properties.</p>

<p>The other methods create an <code>InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code> that contains this client registration and creates an <code>InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code>, both of which are injected into a <code>AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager</code>. This is the high-level controller class that orchestrates the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant request. A lot is going on in this, and we won’t unpack it all here. I will point out that <code>AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager</code> is a class specifically designed to be used outside of the context of a HttpServletRequest.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.4.5/reference/html5/#oauth2Client-authorized-manager-provider">the Spring Docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DefaultOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager is designed to be used within the context of a HttpServletRequest. When operating outside of a HttpServletRequest context, use AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, update the <code>DemoApplication</code> file.</p>

</code>   

<p>This file is the standard Spring Boot application file that starts the framework. It uses an inner class that extends <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code> to configure Spring Boot for OAuth 2.0 client. The bulk of the code is in the <code>run()</code> method, which is what is defined by the <code>CommandLineRunner</code> interface and is what is executed once Spring Boot is fully loaded.</p>

<p>The <code>run()</code> method does two main things:</p>
 
   It uses the client ID and client secret to retrieve a JWT 
   It uses that JWT to make an authorized HTTP request using <code>RestTemplate</code> 
 

<p><code>OAuth2AuthorizeRequest</code> and <code>AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager</code> are the classes used to configure the request for authentication with Okta’s servers and to make the actual request.</p>

<p>Before you can test the code, add some properties to the <code>application.properties</code> file. You need to fill in three values below:</p>

 
   the client ID for your OIDC application 
   the client secret for your OIDC application 
   your own Okta URI in the <code>token-uri</code> 
 

<p>All of these values can be taken from the <code>application.properties</code> file for the secure server project above.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>
   <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id={yourClientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.scope=mod_custom
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.token-uri=/oauth2/default/v1/token
spring.main.web-application-type=none
</code>   
<p>The last property, <code>spring.main.web-application-type=none</code>, tells Spring Boot not to launch any kind of web service. Since this is a command-line app, there’s no reason to launch the default Tomcat container.</p>

<p>With that all in place, you can now try it out. Make sure your server is running (<code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>) and then run the client in a separate shell.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>If all went well, the client will show you some output that looks like the following (I’ve omitted most of the token, but you’ll see it as a bit block of characters in your console).</p>

<p>One thing I want to point out is that this client is going to request a new token on every request. This is less than ideal because the token request sequence is the most vulnerable from a security perspective. A way around this would be to persist the token between requests. You could persist the token yourself and handle the refresh logic within the <code>run()</code> method, or you could implement an <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code> that persists the token instead of using the default in-memory implementation.</p>

 Create a WebClient-Based Application 

<p>In this section, you’re going to implement a command-line client using the newer, currently recommended WebClient API. WebClient is part of Spring’s WebFlux package. This is Spring’s reactive, non-blocking API, which you can read more about in <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html">their documentation</a>. If you’re reading this and you don’t already have some idea of what non-blocking, asynchronous, or reactive coding is about, please tell me what rock you’ve been hiding under because it’s probably nice and quiet and peaceful.</p>

<p>It’s important to realize when using WebFlux within the Java servlet framework that you are mixing two different threading paradigms. Spring does a good job of handling this gracefully, but there are places (as you’ll see below) where you need to be aware of WebClient’s non-blocking nature and deliberately block it to wait for a response.</p>

<p>In this client, you will use two different methods to run tasks. First, you will use the <code>CommandLineRunner</code> interface, just as you did above. This will demonstrate using <code>WebClient</code> in a blocking context. Second, you will use <code>WebClient</code> to make requests using the <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation. This annotation allows for a variety of scheduling options, including CRON-style scheduling. It also allows the use of <code>WebClient</code> in all its non-blocking glory.</p>

<p>Here is the command to download the starter for the WebClient-based client from the Spring Initializr. The only difference between this bootstrapped project, and the previous one, is the addition of a new dependency. The dependency <code>webflux</code> is necessary to add support for the <code>WebClient</code> class.</p>

<p>Run this command from a Bash shell from the project root directory.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.4.5 \
  -d artifactId=client \
  -d dependencies=oauth2-client,web,webflux \
  -d language=java \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d baseDir=client-webclient \

<p>Like the corresponding file in the previous client, this file loads the Okta client registration and packages it in an in-memory client registration repository (<code>InMemoryReactiveClientRegistrationRepository</code>). This repository is specifically a reactive repository suitable for use with the <code>WebClient</code> class. This is used to build a reactive authorized client manager, which is packaged in an OAuth 2.0 filter that handles the client credentials grant exchange. Here the <code>WebClient</code> is packaged as a bean with the filter in place, and every request that uses this bean will have this filter. In the previous example, the client credentials exchange was performed explicitly in the command line runner method.</p>

<p>Update the <code>DemoApplication</code> class to match the following.</p>

   <code>package com.example.client;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class DemoApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CommandLineRunner.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Autowired
    private WebClient webClient;

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000)
    public void scheduledRequest() {
        webClient.get()
                .uri("http://localhost:8081")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class)
                .map(string
                        -&gt; "Schedule request response: " + string)
                .subscribe(logger::info);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        String body = webClient.get()
                .uri("http://localhost:8081")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class)
                .block();
        logger.info(body);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This class uses two different methods to trigger requests, both of which use the <code>WebClient</code> bean defined in the previous class. The <code>scheduledRequest()</code> method uses the <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation to trigger a request every five seconds. This annotation allows <code>WebClient</code> to be used in a non-blocking manner.</p>

<p>The <code>run()</code> method, by contrast, uses <code>WebClient</code> in a blocking manner. Notice the <code>block()</code> method in the chain of commands, and notice that it is returning a String value that is logged instead of using the more reactive methodology to log results: <code>subscribe(logger::info)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s it for this client. You can tell by the relative simplicity of this implementation over the <code>RestTemplate</code> implementation that Spring is moving in this direction. <code>RestTemplate</code>, while still widely used, is now deprecated.</p>

<p>Before you run it, copy the values from the <code>application.properties</code> file from the previous project to this project.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>
   <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id={yourClientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.scope=mod_custom
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.token-uri=https://{yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default/v1/token
spring.main.web-application-type=none
</code>   

<p>You can start the WebClient-based client using the following command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>You should see output like this:</p>
   <code>2021-04-08 19:22:09.658  INFO 346556 --- [           main] com.example.client.DemoApplication       : Started DemoApplication in 0.613 seconds (JVM running for 0.782)

<p>In this tutorial, you saw two different ways to implement the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow. You created a simple server application. You created a client using RestTemplate, a deprecated but still widely used Spring technology. Finally, you created a client using the newer, asynchronous <code>WebClient</code>, built on Spring’s WebFlux package.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example in our <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-client-credentials-example">okta-spring-boot-client-credentials-example</a> repository.</p>

 The Virality of Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>Mathieu: I wanted to start with a quote, Riley, from the movie Inception: from Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Cobb. I’ve seen this quote in an article that you’ve written before, and the quote goes like this: “What is the most resilient parasite? Is it bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it’s almost impossible to eradicate.”</p>
<p>You had used this quote to refer to Self-sovereign Identity, or when you started thinking about ‘digital trust’ for the first time some years ago. Would you mind giving a background of how this has taken over your brain, and your life, and effectively, the mission behind Trinsic today?</p>
<p>Riley: Yes, that’s an awesome quote — I’m glad that you brought that back up. The first time I was exposed to Self-sovereign Identity and this concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifiers">decentralized identity</a> was when I interviewed for a job at the Sovrin Foundation when it was looking to hire its first employee. My interview was with somebody named Steve Fulling, as well as Phil Windley. Phil Windley is the founder of the Internet Identity Workshop, and he was the chair of the board of Sovrin. He’s quite a ‘guru,’ and he was very good at conveying the vision and what we were trying to accomplish. I went in for a regular job interview, and it went well, but after I left the interview, I looked everywhere around me, and all I could see were digital credentials or the lack thereof. It was as if, once I saw the way the world could operate. I’ve never been able to go about life normally again. Even small daily things; one time, UPS was shipping me a package, and I wanted to pick it up at the distribution center, but I couldn’t prove that it was actually me who bought the package. Or another example: I used to work in the solar industry, collecting people’s electricity data so that we could build them a solar panel estimate. Things like that: everyday activities that you don’t normally hear about, such as KYC (Know Your Customer), or health credentials, or the prime SSI use cases.</p>
<p>The reason I love that quote is that <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">digital credentials</a> and verifiable data can not only impact the use cases that everybody tends to think about when they think about SSI, but they could permeate our whole lives and streamline everything we do. I think that was evidenced throughout my time in this space. It seems as if people who get into Self-sovereign Identity, can’t get out. Even people that I worked with at the Sovrin Foundation; while we were there, we never ever had any attrition of employees, even though the Sovrin Foundation was a hard place to be because of funding challenges. Ultimately, those funding challenges resulted in people losing their jobs at one point, but even throughout all that, nobody ever left. We’ve seen the same thing at <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">Trinsic</a>: nobody’s ever left, unless they’re an intern, or someone moving on to their next project.</p>
<p>Mathieu, maybe you could speak to this, but I remember when Northern Block came into this space. You weren’t focused solely on Self-sovereign Identity, but it seems like you’ve leaned into this subject. I think that’s characteristic of what I’ve seen over and over and over; once this concept infects your brain, you really can’t help but go all in. I think that’s a characteristic of really promising movements: Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. In my opinion, it’s inevitable that the world is going to go in this direction.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes, it’s a similar mindset. The feelings that you had towards SSI or digital trust, or <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip/">Trust over IP</a>, however, we call it; I had a similar feeling some years before when I got into crypto, and blockchain, and decentralized technology as a whole. Having worked on many software projects that utilize some type of decentralized or distributed computing technology, the property of verifiability that comes with these verifiable credentials is something that, for me at least, was missing in the decentralized stack that we were playing with. It was cool that we were building distributed or decentralized protocols; we touched it all for you-name-the-use-case. But, it was missing the core property of verifiability. Many people were trying to use technologies like distributed ledgers or blockchains to solve every problem in the world. Still, when it came down to lack of trust in transactions, caused by issues with the verifiability of data, it was as if a light went off there.</p>
<p>As you started working at the Sovrin Foundation, I’m assuming you got more and more excited about that. What are the types of things that you did at the Sovrin Foundation in the early days?</p>
 Early Days with the Sovrin Foundation 
<p>Riley: Yes, definitely; Sovrin was a very cool place to be. First of all, from a personal development standpoint; as the first employee, there was a lot to do, and I wore a lot of hats when I first joined. I think the other cool thing about it was that, at the time, it was very early; I don’t even remember whether the Decentralized Identity Foundation was established yet; it may have been. The Trust over IP Foundation was definitely not established, and so Sovrin was the most established place to go. If you were interested in this space, it was the destination.</p>
<p>My first major undertaking at the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> was to establish the Sovrin Steward program, which is the program that the Sovrin Foundation runs to get organizations to operate nodes on the Sovrin network. Part of the governance of Sovrin is that the nodes are permissioned, but the read-and-write access was thought to be, ideally and eventually, totally public. Although the consensus protocol on the blockchain was done in a permissioned fashion, everything else would be public. Part of establishing the governance over the permissioning of the nodes that operated consensus on the network, was essentially establishing a standardized process through open governance. This would allow new stewards to join the network, add a node, and participate in consensus. That whole initial process was my first major project.</p>
<p>The first step in that process is usually to have a call with somebody who works at the Sovrin Foundation, or somebody on the committee would call the steward qualification committee. Originally, all of that was done by me. Eventually, it became much more decentralized, with different volunteers from around the world who are doing that, and it’s still being done today. But initially, it was all me. Following on to what I was saying about Sovrin being the first destination for organizations who wanted to get involved with decentralized identity, I had so many calls. My whole day would be filled with conversations with people who were interested in applying this new technology to some business problem that they had. Because of that, I got to hear, from the very beginning, about all sorts of business problems, and all sorts of industries to which people were trying to <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">apply Self-sovereign Identity</a>. Essentially, I was able to absorb all those learnings, in a way that I think was unique. I don’t know if I would have been able to have that opportunity anywhere else in the world at that time.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We can see this happening over and over again, where you see areas that foster technology startups, like Silicon Valley. They all leverage each other. In these really condensed environments, with people working in the same direction, you seem to see an ecosystem take shape. Different companies and different people can leverage each other’s skillsets for something specific.</p>
<p>Many of our companies today have a more global footprint, and we’re able to work with people throughout the world. Still, it’s quite crazy to look at Utah (where Trinsic is based) and to review the Sovrin Foundation coming out of Utah, all the SSI companies coming up there, all the Fintech companies coming out of there; it’s absolutely crazy. It feels as if there’s entrepreneurship in the mountain water that everyone’s drinking down there.</p>
<p>Riley: Yes, that’s absolutely true. I think that part of that is that, as I mentioned, once people see it, they can’t unsee it; people stay in the Self-sovereign Identity space, even if they leave their roles. If you look at all the people who were laid off from the Sovrin Foundation, I’m trying to think on the spot here, if anyone did something like leaving the space entirely: Nathan George went to Kiva. Ken Ebert and others based here in Utah started Indicio.Tech, along with <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">Heather Dahl</a>, who’s based out of DC. Evernym has a presence here in Utah, and people who’ve left Evernym have gone on to start things or integrate SSI into their own applications. Mike Lotter started a company called TrustFrame that’s based here in Utah. Of course, I came from that ecosystem and started Trinsic. So, I’m telling you that people can’t leave once they see this — it’s such an opportunity with such an open ocean. It makes sense that a lot of the initial ecosystem was built here, and that ecosystem continues to grow, and it’s very cool to see.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I agree; I honestly can’t imagine doing anything else once you’ve experienced this, and you understand how verifiable credentials could really work. I think it’s interesting because there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzTihhlSBF4">so many opportunities to use verifiable credentials</a> to turn paper-based processes into better processes, and also, to turn digitized processes into digitally valuable processes, as well.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to say that I’m digitizing a paper document, but being able to actually have verifiability and authenticity behind it, and being able to leverage the data further on, in whatever customer journey or whatever you’re trying to do, is very exciting. So, yes, I’d have to echo your comments earlier in the discussion. Once you get lost in the topic: in your day-to-day activity, you’re looking at things, and you’re thinking, “Oh my god, there are so many opportunities to use this stuff to create a better world for ourselves.”</p>
 What is the Business Value of SSI? 
<p>Riley: Yes. You spoke to a lot of business value that can be unlocked through decentralized identity; I’m sure we’ll get more into that because that’s something that I’ve been obsessed with for the last four years. Before we leave the topic, and to add to your comment there; I think one of the main reasons that people stay in the space is not only for the big business opportunity. It’s also the fact that I truly believe (and I think that most everyone else in this space truly believes) that Self-sovereign Identity is going to create a better world for people. It’s going to make basic services, that people need but they can’t currently access, accessible, and it’s going to change the power balance in the world to favour people, more than it currently is.</p>
<p>I can’t see the future, but I do know that giving individual people more privacy, and more control and transparency into the way their data is used and managed are a big part of why people stay in this space. We can have all sorts of philosophical <a href="https://anchor.fm/ssi-orbit-podcast">discussions about Self-sovereign Identity</a>. I know that for me, I would not be nearly as passionate about Self-sovereign Identity, if it was just about automating business processes, and making paper-based workflows more efficient. Although, those are very good objectives: that’s where a lot of the money is to be made today.</p>
<p>I think that in the long run, what we’re really trying to do, is we’re trying to create a digital economy that works for people and for the world. We’re trying to create trust over the internet protocol&nbsp; — Trust over IP. We’re trying to create digital tools and digital ways for people to establish trust and get access to the things that they need and the things that they’re entitled to. I certainly wouldn’t be nearly as passionate and work nearly as hard for this movement, and I don’t think nearly as many people would stay in the space if it were only about the business value of what SSI can unlock.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I’ve gotten emails from you at six in the morning Eastern time, and I know you’re a couple of hours behind. So, I definitely know that you’re grinding away at this stuff because you truly believe in it. It’s quite similar to the vision that many people have — generally those in Web 3.0 or who are focused on decentralized technology. They have a vision for a digital economy with greater balance, more transparency, more traceability, and more value for people who are actually injecting value into the system.</p>
<p>To close on the Sovrin topic: I think Sovrin is amazing. I spend a fair amount of time in the Trust over IP Foundation, more particularly today in the utility foundry working group. It’s incredible how much of a step forward Sovrin has made for everyone, because everyone trying to set up a public utility today is looking to Sovrin as a model: Sovrin is effectively shaping how the space is growing today.</p>
<p>You left Sovrin to found a startup called Street Cred at that time; would you mind talking through the early days, and the transition out of there? Was this your first startup? </p>
 SSI Toolkits for Developers 
<p>Riley: It was my first real startup. I’ve always been entrepreneurial since I was a little kid, and in fact, I started a business when I was 14. At that time, I manufactured aftermarket freestyle Razor scooter components and sold them to e-commerce stores and physical locations in the USA, and also in Australia because that’s a big sport down there. I did that throughout high school, which paid for college, so that was fun. This is my first tech startup. I would say it’s my ‘real’ startup, in the sense that it’s a startup whose goal is not to sustain my own living, but it’s a startup whose aim is to make a meaningful impact on the world, and create an organization that is significant and enduring. I’m happy to talk about the transition there. For me, Mathieu, and this might sound dumb or cliché or whatever, but it really didn’t feel like a transition; it felt as if I was doing the same thing. While I was at Sovrin, I was totally obsessed with the idea of building <a href="https://anchor.fm/ssi-orbit-podcast/episodes/3---Simplifying-SSI-for-Organizations-and-Removing-Roadblocks-for-Broad-SSI-Adoption-with-Heather-Dahl-ergjji">adoption of Self-sovereign Identity</a>. I could see the future; as I said, I was walking around, and I would walk into a restaurant, and I would walk into my university (because I was a student at the time). Everywhere I went, I saw what the world could be, and I couldn’t handle living in this world, when I knew it could be so much better, but not doing anything about it.</p>
<p>While I was at Sovrin, I was the staff lead over governance, for example. Drummond Reed from Evernym deserves so much credit for all of the work he’s done on governance over the years, as well as at Sovrin. He was an employee of Evernym, and I was the Sovrin staff employee who was working right alongside him and others on governance. The whole point there was, “How do we make SSI more adoptable?” I did a lot of work on the Sovrin Tokenomics — that was my other big project at Sovrin; Token was a big conversation at the time, and I was effectively the lead of the Tokenomics work at Sovrin. That work was focused on, “How do we potentially use a cryptocurrency to facilitate, or a utility token to facilitate adoption of verifiable credentials?” And, “How can we provide incentive mechanisms to drive that adoption?” This went all the way to starting the SSI incubator, which was an idea that I had from the beginning. The SSI incubator idea revolved around helping startups who were going to move fast, and build use cases for different industries, get funding and support that they needed to deploy this stuff.</p>
<p>Everything I was doing at Sovrin was about trying to crack the code of adoption. The other piece is the business of SSI working group, which I started and led for some time. Some good work was done there, as well, and so all of my work at Sovrin was around getting adoption. The story of how Trinsic got started (or, at the time, it was StreetCred) was that it was another continuation of what I was already doing. I was talking to people, and saying, “Why aren’t you going to production with your SSI solutions? What’s holding you back, and what do we need to do, to make it so that nothing’s holding you back?” I heard over, and over, and over, that the tools were not there, that there were no products that could do what needed to be done; the technology wasn’t mature enough, the technology wasn’t quite there, the technology was too hard to use, or hard to integrate into existing applications. For a long time, my answer was, “Okay, well, the private sector or whatever, the marketplace will solve that problem. That’s not Sovrin’s role.” That’s true, and so I really eventually thought, “Okay, I’ve done all my stuff I need to do here at the Sovrin Foundation, and now I need to try to make it easy for people.”</p>
<p>I needed to work on this other piece, which involves productizing SSI in a way, specifically, that developers could easily integrate into their applications; whether they be existing applications that are serving existing markets, or building new verticals and new use cases on top of Self-sovereign Identity, for whatever business problem that they’re solving. So, I got together with Tomislav Markowski, who wrote the first Aries framework for mobile, and then also Michael Boyd, who wrote the first Indy agent in Python, along with the rest of the working group at the time. These were two of the founding engineers, or code producers, in the Hyperledger Aries project. I said, “Guys, let’s get together, and let’s make something that makes it really easy for developers to integrate SSI into any application. Let’s try to make it as simple as Stripe made payments, or as simple as Twilio made communications, or as simple as name-your-API-based, developer-focused company made whatever thing easier. That’s what we did.</p>
<p>When I transitioned into doing StreetCred, it felt more like it was my next step in making SSI easier to adopt. Last Monday, we announced Trinsic Ecosystems, which is our new product. It’s a productized way to build trust ecosystems. This is the same next step in that same journey to make SSI adoptable and easy to use, and to successfully get digital wallets in the hands of people that have credentials, who are using them for useful purposes. That’s the summary.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. I was going to hop forward, because, in the meantime, you guys have been the go-to for developer tools; that’s how we met each other. We had developers looking at the stuff, and the contributions were coming from your team. You pushed the bar forward there, and made it easy for a lot of people to <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-for-organizations/">start implementing Self-sovereign Identity</a>. Now, we’ve developed these tools for developers to do basic functions, such as making connections, and exchange credentials, and do verifications, and so forth. That’s the space that we are looking at, as a company. There needs to be a provider, or someone that’s going to create an ecosystem; create the rules, and create the governance. We could talk about community-driven initiatives, such as when you mentioned Tokenomics before; there’s a discussion there to be had.</p>
<p>If we take a step back, and we look at how to enable organizations or companies to successfully offer the benefits of Self-sovereign Identity to their customers, and to their employees: how do you reap the benefits from less friction, more privacy? The list goes on and on; you need to have someone kick-starting the ecosystem. Was that the same realization for you guys? And, what did you feel was necessary to make this easy for an ecosystem provider to really get going?</p>
 Focusing on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Ecosystems 
<p>Riley: Yes, we had that same journey as well. However, I think that for us, it was more around the fact that we have this developer platform, and we have this API product that’s being used by hundreds of organizations. At its core, it was an exercise of looking at the current state of our product and its growth, and the different segments. Some people are using verifiable credentials for authentication, others are using them for sharing and building these ecosystems, others are using credentials in a contained and closed ecosystem, and still others are open ecosystems. There are various different use cases for credentials, of course. Looking at our own data that we’d collected and thinking, “Where are credentials getting adoption?” That’s been the number one thing since day one, and it still is.</p>
<p>It’s going to be the main priority all the way until we’ve got a network effect established for verifiable credentials that is so strong, that nothing’s ever going to topple it. That’s going to be the thing that we’re constantly thinking about: adoption. Looking at the data that we had, credentials are getting adoption most — it’s the best use case today. The best way to get credentials into the world with real adoption has been in these ecosystems; it’s when people come to our platform, pick up the product, and use it to build an ecosystem — that’s where the best adoption has been. So, I would say that the Trinsic Ecosystems product was about talking to our customers who’d already created ecosystems, building things for them that help to solve their problems and help make it easier for them to build ecosystems, and then trying to generalize that. If we say, “Okay. These five companies need a trust registry,” for example: at a&nbsp; high level, it’s a list of issuers who are authorized to issue certain types of credentials. If these five customers need this, is this something that can be generalized to more use cases? Something I think that we’ve been very intentional about at Trinsic, is talking to the people who are actually implementing and deploying this stuff in production. Basically, Trinsic Ecosystems is our way of productizing all of those things that everybody needs if they want to <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">deploy a credential ecosystem</a>. At least, the general pieces that people need, so that they can configure an ecosystem and then deploy it out to their network that they’re trying to affect.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I love the vision. There are a lot of similarities for me, coming from a crypto/blockchain space, where people were trying to reinvent the world in so many different ways. That’s a separate conversation. Ecosystems exist today all over the place. I think that many people, when they approach something new with a new technology, they’re trying to create this new way of doing something, when things aren’t necessarily done that way. That’s not the easiest way to get people bought into doing something new.</p>
<p>If I have a business case for credentials —there are a hundred of them —it could be to reduce costs, or reduce fraud, or lower my compliance costs, or reduce friction. Whatever it is, you need an easy way for an organization or an entity that’s already trying to make their ecosystem a <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">credentials-based ecosystem</a>, to really get it going and get its existing governance, rule sets, and relationships into this new model. I think what you guys are doing there is good, and it makes it a lot easier for people to start using the stuff without throwing out what they’ve already done.</p>
<p>Riley: I think that, as you said, there are already ecosystems out there. Taking a step back again to the meta-topic of adoption; the other thing to keep in mind is that I’ve never talked to anybody in my life who has questioned the value of SSI, if we assume that there is widespread adoption already. The question is always, “How do you get to that point? How do you bootstrap the network effect?” It’s not always a great user experience to ask your customer to download a wallet, but if they already have a wallet, and already have credentials in it, then it’s an awesome user experience for them to streamline the access process through SSI. That’s just one example out of many that I could give.</p>
<p>I think that the ecosystem approach is a very pragmatic way for organizations to do something using verifiable credentials, that is uniquely valuable today. It’s something that they can do today, that’ll add value in a way that nothing else on Planet Earth can match. Of course, there are some caveats or dependencies there, perhaps, if you want to argue it. However, I think that what verifiable credentials are fundamentally good at, is portable data and verifiable data. When you have an ecosystem, verifiable credentials can be very costly and cumbersome, and not scalable when it comes to sharing data in these ecosystems. So, I think it’s an excellent way to give organizations something that they can do today, that will add value, reduce costs, and increase revenues and whatever else they want to accomplish. At the same time, they’re also keeping the door open for that eventual future, where verifiable credentials will be ubiquitous and where we will get to the more decentralized interactions that we all hope to see in the future.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Do you have concerns with the term ‘Self-sovereign Identity’ when talking to a prospect? When people are so used to doing something today, maybe self-sovereign sounds too out there, or people may have mixed feelings about it. The term Self-sovereign Identity addresses the ‘self-sovereign’ aspect, but the identity aspect is maybe not necessarily everything that it encompasses, as well. I know you have written a very good blog post, called: “SSI has an identity problem.”</p>
<p>Did you front-load Self-sovereign Identity in conversations? How do you look at that? </p>
<p>Riley: No, I don’t front-load it.; it depends on who I’m talking to. You always want to gauge your audience, so when I’m talking to you, Mathieu, I use the term Self-sovereign Identity or SSI. I’m assuming many of the listeners here are familiar with the concept, because of your other podcasts and things like that, but you’ve got to gauge your audience. One of the things that I talked about, either in that blog post or in another one I did about SSI adoption and the current state of adoption, is: “don’t talk past your prospect or your buyer or your whatever.”</p>
<p>Make sure you’re using language that’s shared. One of the challenges with any new technology is there’s no shared vocabulary. Having a shared vocabulary is the easiest way to communicate something; since we both know what a newspaper is, I can simply say the word “newspaper,” and there’s a great deal of context that we both have of shared knowledge. We can use that one word, instead of describing what it is in a bunch of words and sentences. I could try to do that here, but I’m not going to take the time to do that. I think you can see the point with SSI, right? When you already have all the context, I can say that acronym and you get a bunch of knowledge. Whereas, if you don’t already have that context, you’ve got to use a bunch of words to try to fill in that context. One thing that Timothy Ruff and I have talked about for years; we’ve been looking for a way to convey all of that context in as simple a way as possible, and, if possible, in only a few words, or one sentence. We’ve gotten close in various ways, but we haven’t gotten all the way there.</p>
<p>So, generally speaking, when talking to a prospect, it is all about the use case and the business value, and it is not at all about the way to get there or the implementation path. For example, if somebody wants to do COVID test results, and all they want is the ability to know that the COVID test was actually done by a legitimate lab. Necessarily, they want to know that; that’s their business problem. I think the way to do that successfully is if we discuss it in terms of the business problem and with the context and words that they’re familiar with.</p>
<p>As you said, I wrote a blog about all of the different names that people have tried to use for SSI over the years. There’s a new proposal, that’s not in that blog post. Maybe I’ll make an edit or update to that blog post about the term ‘authentic data,’ which I like, but again every name has its own trade-offs. I would say, generally, do I have problems with the term SSI? Yes. Do I think SSI is the most widely used, and is still the best term to convey all of that context? Yes. However, do I use it frequently with people who are unfamiliar, or with potential prospects? No.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s all about solving a business problem today for organizations. KYC is a good example. For regulatory reasons, you need to collect and verify certain information about a prospective customer before offering them financial services or whatever. My feeling is that the world of technology solution providers that are selling into these companies today, is very one-transactional.</p>
<p>Of course, in the financial world, every time you’re making a payment or conducting a transaction, there’s monitoring, there’s stuff that goes on for various policies such as anti-money laundering. However, much of the business value that people seem to be looking to get out of credentials, is that level of verifiability. I’m curious as to how you look at this, too. Is it more interesting to be talking about user-centricity, and consent-driven decisions, and privacy and better security?</p>
<p>Again, it depends on who you’re talking to. If you’re talking to someone that understands Self-sovereign Identity, then then you could talk broader than that. But, talking about these core values or aspects of Self-sovereign Identity might make it easier to get in the door, get credentials used within their respective ecosystem, and then slowly start talking about more exploration. In other words, “Now that we’ve done this thing; by the way, there’s a lot more upside that can be achieved through the reusability and portability of these things.”</p>
<p>Is my thought process similar to how you engage with prospects?</p>
<p>Riley: Yes. The other thing that I’ll say is: what you and I, Mathieu, are selling (for lack of a better term) is SSI. We’re selling decentralized identity; we’re selling the ability for companies to implement this stuff. But, what all of our customers are selling, is some specific use case or business problem. So, I think that the things I say in a conversation with a prospect will be different than the things that I think our customer will say.</p>
<p>Let’s take ‘Farmer Connect,’ for example: Farmer Connect has built a very awesome traceability solution, where you can scan a QR code on your coffee beans, and it resolves all the way back through the supply chain to an individual farmer who has a Self-sovereign Identity. That farmer can choose what data or information from all their verifiable credentials they want to share with the end consumer of the coffee beans that they grew. Then, the consumer can sort of ‘tip’ the farmer that grew the coffee beans, and it’s a very cool use case that implements SSI. Farmer Connect is not selling SSI to their ecosystem, right? They’re selling transparency, and they’re selling sustainability, and they’re selling a specific thing.</p>
<p>Whereas, somebody like Trinsic: we don’t build specific products, we work with companies who are building specific vertically-focused products. We try to be the best in the world at building those tools and the low-level stuff. So, the conversation that I might have with the prospect would be different than how I would advise a customer of ours, or an implementer of <a href="https://northernblock.io/">SSI solutions</a> directly.</p>
<p>I would think that Farmer Connect is going to talk about farmers sharing their data, in a way that’s privacy-respecting and that those farmers can use, to get access to credit and other things. They’re going to talk about the farmers; they’re not necessarily going to talk about Self-sovereign Identity. Or, at least, I wouldn’t typically advise them to do so.</p>
<p>Whereas when I have a conversation with someone, it is going to be about the tools, and the technology, and the approach. As an example, Amazon AWS is going to be talking about the cloud and the benefits of moving to the cloud; Pinterest is going to be talking about pictures, and Uber is going to be talking about rides, but they’re both built on AWS. For the end consumer, for the sake of the use case, I don’t think you need to talk about the technology that’s powering it. It totally depends on what you’re using the technology for, and it’s better to be talking about the business problem instead.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Fair enough. You wrote another great piece: “<a href="https://trinsic.id/4-keys-to-ssi-adoption/">Four Keys for SSI Adoption</a>,” and one of the findings was simply, “Don’t sell the tech.” I think you alluded to that again here, in selling the value of SSI instead. I think that your fourth key for SSI adoption, was that chicken-and-egg problem. Has your thinking advanced since you’ve written this? And, perhaps you can also talk about the survey you did, and how you approach this thing? I think it’s pretty cool that you went out there, and came up with these findings.</p>
<p>Riley: For the survey that I did, I was thinking that there are so many companies out there who are deploying SSI-based solutions. Almost all of them are using some vendor to help them, so the survey revolved around reaching out to other vendors, like us, and asking whether those vendors have any insight on their customers and their customers’ adoption. It turns out, they do; so it was more about collaborating with other vendors. There are still conversations around confidentiality there, and so that’s why all of the raw data is not shared, but at a high level, I did share what I felt like I could. I talked to all the SSI vendors that you’ve likely heard of, and got every one of them, with maybe an exception or two, depending on who you want to count in that arena as a vendor. I would say it’s perhaps not exhaustive, but it was many of the more prominent players and talking to them: “Where are your customers at? Have they gone to production? What’s essentially the scale of that deployment? What’s the approach?</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to that last component that you’re talking about, around the chicken and egg problem. Of course, if a bank is willing to accept a driver’s license and you already have a digital driver’s license on your device, and you can simply tap an NFC (Near Field Communications) reader as you walk into the bank — you can imagine really great user experiences once this stuff is widespread. But until that point, there’s a challenge with identifying where the specific value is, that verifiable credentials can add. My answer there was that there are really two ways to get around that: one is to take an ecosystem-type approach, which I think we’ve seen some successes in doing; and the other is to take a single-sided approach. That refers to the two- or three-sided marketplace that is SSI at scale. If we take one side of that, it would involve working with the Issuer, and trying to solve a problem for the Issuer. Or, to work with the Verifier, and try to solve a problem with the Verifier. In other words, you are starting with only one side of the Trust Triangle.</p>
<p>I asked approximately 30-odd people in this survey I did, and this was an hour-long interview with each of these people: I dug deep into the background behind the answers. Fifty percent of them said that an ecosystem-type approach was the right way to go, and fifty percent said a single-sided approach was the right way to go. So, really, the answer is that nobody knows what the right way is. Maybe the answer is that there is no right way; it’s whatever works for a given use case. But somehow, in order to reach the level of value that we all see in SSI, we have to get some kind of network of verifiable credential Issuers, Verifiers, and Holders to exist. Once those networks can cross-pollinate, and you can get a network of networks, or a network of ecosystems is maybe is another way to think about it: that’s when the value is really tremendous. That’s when the promises, that we all want to see happen, will be unlocked.</p>
<p>In order to get there, you’ve got to start somewhere, right? You’ve got to start with some immediate use case that can add value. The fax machine took nearly 100 years to achieve a widespread network effect. When the fax machine started out, its first initial use cases were point-to-point selling within US Military applications, because it’s very secure. So, sending confidential documentation from point-to-point within the military, that was the first use case for the fax machine. That’s a single-sided use case — it’s selling a new technology to one party, and having them implement it internally or for their own processes. Beyond that, it eventually became a way for other companies to get data from the US military and from the US postal service. That’s where the network effect was built from; it started on a single-sided adoption with one party, and then other people started building on top of that network or that initial node, and building other nodes relative to the first one, thereby creating a network effect.</p>
<p>The question I ask in that blog is, “What’s the best way to make that happen within SSI?” Is it to go after a single party, such as the Issuer or Verifier, or is it to try to tackle a whole ecosystem, and get both sides of the market there from the start? An example of that, would be something like COVID credentials, where the lab issues the credential, and some employer, or airline, or venue, verifies the credential. In those cases, there are effectively two sides; two separate parties that are interacting. I can’t speak to what’s best. What I can say, is that in our worldview, or with the people that we work with, the ecosystems have been the deployments that have seen strong initial adoption. That doesn’t mean that the other approach won’t work also; I think those models are not mutually exclusive. We created the Trinsic Ecosystems product to lean into that insight that we had on ecosystems, and to make it easier for people to bring Issuers and Verifiers and Holders into a single trust ecosystem, without a lot of custom development work and implementation. Faxes are unfortunately still used today for stuff — every time I see that, I can’t get over it. But, well, it goes to show how powerful a network effect can be. Think about the fact that faxing is still so prominent; we may not use it in our everyday life quite as much, but when you look at global volumes, it’s still a very prominent communication vehicle around the world for secure document sharing. The fact that that is true is a testament to how powerful a network effect can be. If we can create a network effect with something that empowers individuals, and gives them more privacy and autonomy and things like that, then that’s something I absolutely want to be a part of.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Riley, thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Riley: Thanks for having me; this has been an awesome conversation.</p>

 HoloSign, Anyone? <p>Recently, DocuSign CEO Daniel Springer <a href="https://qz.com/1942479/docusign-ceo-says-blockchain-is-too-expensive-for-wide-adoption/amp/">said it would never work to create a blockchain version of DocuSign</a> because it would be extremely expensive and inefficient, even though the management of electronic signatures and agreements would seem to be just the kind of use case blockchain promises to address.</p><p>He’s totally right. Storing all those PDFs on a blockchain would be ridiculously expensive, because everyone running a blockchain node would need to store a complete record of every document that’s ever been signed. Yikes.</p><p>But a decentralized version of DocuSign would be easy to create and simple to run on Holochain. We even thought about building it ourselves just to show how easily it can be done… but then we thought a better idea would be to put it out there to our developer community, since there’s a real opportunity here. If you’ve been wanting a tech business idea for a proven concept with a large addressable market and multiple advantages over the competition, now you have one.</p><p>Or maybe DocuSign, HelloSign, or DocHub want to get in on the action? You guys already have the UI and the integrations with other web services, so you’d just be building new data infrastructure, which Holochain makes completely secure and easy to do.</p><p>Imagine how elegant this would be:</p><p>PDFs are stored not on a centralized cloud server, but hosted by users themselves on their own source chains – locally stored, immutable hash chains containing all the documents they’ve ever signed as well as logs of all the actions they’ve ever taken related to those documents (created, edited, signed, sent to so-and-so, etc.). Users will value owning their own data and having control over their identity and keys – features which are not only native to Holochain’s infrastructure but also guaranteed by Holochain’s <a href="https://github.com/holochain/cryptographic-autonomy-license">Cryptographic Autonomy License</a>.</p><p>Users have the choice to install or not install a desktop app – and, later, a mobile app. (Holochain mobile support is in the future plans.)</p>  If they install the app, they’re self-hosting their data as well as shards of the distributed hash table (DHT) that serves to balance storage across the nodes of the network. The more that your user base chooses to install and run the app, the more they become a part of your hosting infrastructure, which drives down costs. So it will be good to make the app handy and friendly: easy access to all your documents at your fingertips, whether online or offline.  If they don’t install the app, they sign and access documents through their web browser, the same way that most people use DocuSign and similar products today. Their documents could be hosted on the Holo hosting network, which is a peer-hosting network for serving Holochain apps and data to users not running Holochain apps locally. Web-based users would still be able to download PDFs, just as they can from DocuSign and similar today.  <p>Documents are signed using digital signatures associated with user-owned private cryptographic keys (in addition to hand-drawn or script-font signatures), which ensures in a fully traceable way that document signatures are legitimate. The integrity of all data and operations is ensured by Holochain’s peer-validation protocols.</p><p>The DHT could ensure that a solid number of encrypted backups exist at all times (maybe 25 or 50) without being endlessly duplicated like in blockchain. This way, no single entity is holding the only copies of the data. (PS – there is probably no need to store documents as PDFs on the DHT; rich text would work just as well and be much lighter.) Alternatively, documents could be stored only on user source chains for an ultra-high degree of privacy not possible in centralized or blockchain scenarios.</p><p>Holochain is free to use. Unlike in blockchain, individual nodes are not subject to a heavy computation load, and there is no need to store all the data in each node, so there are no gas costs.</p><p>The hosting of documents may also be a cost savings relative to centralized web hosting, depending on the market price of hosting on the Holo Hosting Network.</p><p>The bottom line: a Holochain version of DocuSign would be easy to build, would empower users more than existing products, and would be far more feasible than a blockchain version… plus might be less expensive to run even than a centralized version. Electronic agreement management is a good example of a use case that blockchain is ill-equipped to solve, and a great example of a use case that Holochain is perfectly equipped to solve.</p><p>If you do take up this challenge, let us know so that we can let the world know what you are up to!<br></p>

We’re on track towards a world where everything that can be, will be tokenized.




 




Tokenization could play a critical part in enabling more equitable value creation for people, organisations and things. Providing the means to issue and store value, trace provenance, and most importantly achieve consensus to instantly trust. <br><br>However, in order for this tokenized world to emerge, we first need the infrastructure for people and their digital twins to participate. This will include a trusted digital identity and the means to be verified, present credentials and transact.




 




With the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">Non-fungible Tokens</a> (NFT) and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">crypto markets</a> at an all time high, this world of tomorrow is very much becoming part of our everyday. In March 2021, John Glen, treasury minister said the UK would focus on <a>regulating stablecoins</a> as a first priority given the possible threat to competition.




 




In April 2021, the U.K. Treasury and Bank of England announced the launch of a joint taskforce to explore the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/uk-to-explore-issuing-its-own-digital-currency-amid-bitcoin-boom.html">potential for a central bank digital currency</a>. This is in line with other central banks developing strategies whilst China is charging forward, having already carried out a number of tests with its digital yuan.




 




Then to Australia, where <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au">eftpos</a> recently announced joining the Hedera Governing Council after successfully conducting tests to determine the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37360/australias-eftpos-to-set-up-hedera-hashgraph-node-for-micropayments">feasibility of a digital Australian dollar stablecoin for micropayments</a>. eftpos has been Australia’s go-to payment system since 1984, processing over 2 billion debit card transactions in 2020 worth an average of more than $300 million each day. The stablecoin project was led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roballennodl/">Robert Allen</a>, eftpos’ entrepreneur in residence, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecZbyn8AxU">shares more about this exciting project with Zenobia Godschalk</a>, SVP of Corporate Communications for <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a>.




 




Since 2012, <a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> has been pioneering the access, protection and value exchange of personal data and identity. Over the past year, Meeco has been working towards making much of this new world possible with the development of a multi-purpose wallet to enable decentralised identity, verifiable credentials, micropayments and tokens.




 




<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, our CEO &amp; Founder, will be a <a href="https://www.zyen.com/events/all-events/everything-will-be-tokenized-future-identity/">guest speaker at this FS Club webinar</a> and will feature some of the use-cases,  practical steps and challenges along the way to developing these technologies. Topics will include decentralised identity, tokenomics, micropayments, governance, recovery, treasury, progressive disclosure and consent.




 




Also speaking is <a href="https://www.zyen.com/about/our-team/professor-michael-mainelli/">Professor Michael Mainelli</a>, Executive Chairman of <a href="https://www.zyen.com/">Z/Yen Group</a> and The <a href="https://fsclub.zyen.com/">Financial Services Club</a>. Michael holds many prestigious positions in academia and is an award winning author of four books and dozens of papers. Michael has worked in the public sector on privatizations and strategy; in the private sector in a variety of industries (banking, insurance, manufacturing, media, retail, utilities, television, distribution, IT) on problems ranging from strategy through information systems, quality, human resources, environmental systems and R&amp;D; and in the voluntary sector on a number of assignments to improve performance.




 




You can join the free webinar on Wednesday, 12 May 2021 from 11:00 – 11:45 BST.

Its video arm, YouTube, brought in a whopping $6 billion in revenue last quarter, more than Snapchat, Linkedin and Pinterest combined.  <a href="https://www.axios.com/snap-beats-earnings-user-growth-b27e7b43-c281-4be8-83b7-ee89f2ff60e6.html">Snapchat</a> beat Wall Street expectations on subscriber growth, earnings and revenue, while also reporting that usage of its AR products hit an all-time&nbsp;high.  <p>The pandemic showed us just how much we rely on our technology more than ever before, breaking through established norms out of sheer necessity. On the one hand, that’s exciting. Technology is enabling and empowering. In the past year, we’ve seen it unleash profound untapped potential in ourselves, in our society, and in our industry.</p><p>On the other hand, our reliance on technology can sometimes feel like a toxic relationship. Just as we’ve become more enabled and empowered by technology, that technology is, more than ever, controlled by a handful of increasingly powerful firms. Gone are the days when we viewed Silicon Valley with rose-tinted glasses. It’s become clear that power gained by Big Tech often comes at the expense of individuals, smaller companies, and society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Which is where we find ourselves today.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-tech-giants-just-keep-growing-11619841644?mod=djem10point">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The quintet set records for sales and profits. Revenue at Apple, the world’s most highly valued company, jumped 54% to the highest level it’s ever hit for the first three months of the year. Amazon logged its fourth straight record quarterly profit — a stretch when its total earnings exceeded those of the previous three years combined.</blockquote><blockquote>“Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren’t slowing down. They’re accelerating,” said Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, whose revenue rose 19% in the latest&nbsp;quarter.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-earnings-apple-facebook-microsoft-amazon-4f0c98fd-28ab-497a-91f8-bdc61fb6c3de.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Tech giants show no sign of slowing&nbsp;down</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-tech-giants-just-keep-growing-11619841644?mod=djem10point">Five Tech Giants Just Keep&nbsp;Growing</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html">YouTube is a media juggernaut that could soon equal Netflix in&nbsp;revenue</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-29/tech-giants-risk-squeezing-out-banks-french-watchdog-warns">Tech Giants Risk Squeezing Out Banks, French Watchdog&nbsp;Warns</a>   2. Crypto’s compelling alternative narrative <p>I don’t think it’s any coincidence that we’ve seen the rise of crypto and blockchain in parallel to the consolidation of power at the top — first in the wake of the greatest financial calamity since the Great Depression, fueled by the rise of too-big-to-fail megabanks, and now building steam during this era of Big&nbsp;Tech.</p><p>Sure, the price swings are exhilarating. The get-rich-quick schemes are seductive. But crypto’s most compelling quality is that it offers an alternative story — that of decentralization. In other words, everything that Big Tech is not. It’s a story of individual empowerment, about not having to rely on a big corporation or a too-big-too-fail bank or government that’s got too much on its&nbsp;plate.</p><p>That’s the story at least. The reality will always be a bit more nuanced. But that story? There’s a ton of energy behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so here’s the NYTimes announcing, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/technology/cryptocurrency-mainstream.html">We’re All Crypto People&nbsp;Now</a>:</p><blockquote>The result? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/business/dogecoin-price.html">Dogecoin</a>, a joke currency based on a meme about a Shiba Inu, is a hot topic on CNBC. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/how-did-coinbase-stock-do.html">Coinbase</a>, a crypto exchange, is now a publicly listed company worth $58 billion.

The following items can be bought and sold as NFTs: an album by Kings of Leon, some pictures of Rob Gronkowski playing football, digital horses for breeding and racing, virtual sneakers, a recording of farts, a tattoo on Croatian tennis player Oleksandra Oliynykova’s arm, that meme of a photobombing seal, the world’s most colorful color, the scientist George Church’s genome, U.S. Patent №10,025,797, the word “porn,” and somehow, a house. And Lindsay Lohan keeps tweeting about&nbsp;Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s all part of our wild new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/technology/crypto-art-NFTs-trading-cards-investment-manias.html">YOLO FOMO LOL economy</a>, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/style/gamestop-wallstreetbets-reddit.html">stonks only go up</a>, memes count as financial advice and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/business/stimulus-check-stock-market.html">stimmies</a> buy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/04/automobiles/armani-gucci-hemi-the-engine-as-a-status-symbol.html">Hemis</a>.

Chart of the&nbsp;week  4. The state of self-sovereign identity <p>One of the stories borne out of crypto’s emergence was the idea that we could leverage blockchain in order to give individuals control of their digital identity (and their data) versus say, having Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook call all the&nbsp;shots.</p><p>Christopher Allen is an Executive Director and Principal Architect of Blockchain Commons a “not-for-profit” social benefit corporation committed to open infrastructure. Five years ago, he wrote, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/path-self-sovereign-identity">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p><p>Here he is, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">five years&nbsp;on</a>:</p><blockquote>It was five years ago today that I wrote The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity for CoinDesk, my foundational article discussing the history of digital identity and laying out principles for creating a new sort of identity, based on individual control and human rights. It was written to address a problem that was growing year by year: Facebook was increasingly controlling our access to the online world, and Google was increasingly correlating all of the information about us. Meanwhile, the refugee crisis in Europe was highlighting the problem that 1.1 billion people in the world were living without digital identity at all, denying them crucial access to financial, political and social&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>There are now any number of companies advancing these ideas: Self-sovereign identity is becoming a large industry. There are so many that the best way to talk about them is simply through an overview of the largest communities. A variety of companies are closely aligning to the W3C specs, including members of the W3C-CCG (Credential Community Group) such as Digital Bazaar, which has persistently supported the work of Rebooting the Web of Trust; the Decentralized Identity Foundation is also working on creating a decentralized identity ecosystem, with leadership from Microsoft and Consensys; and the Linux Foundation is working on Hyperledger Indy with companies such as International Business Machines and Evernym. It’s not just a large ecosystem, but a healthy one, with a number of different voices each suggesting different ways forward and with many new voices emerging.</blockquote><p>It’s also fair to say that GlobaliD has come a long way in the past 5&nbsp;years.</p> 5. Where are the Big Tech regulators? <p>In China. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-financial-regulators-summon-big-tech-firms-11619698257?mod=djem10point">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>China’s central bank and other financial regulators have ordered 13 internet companies that operate online financial services to fix problems in their business practices, in the latest indication of how Beijing is tightening its control over the growing fintech&nbsp;sector.</blockquote><blockquote>The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said on its website that the regulators on Thursday jointly conducted interviews with internet firms including Tencent, ByteDance, Didi Chuxing, Meituan and JD.com, as part of the government’s effort to strengthen its supervision of online financial services. The regulators pointed out widespread problems in the sector such as the lack of corporate governance, unfair competition and violation of consumer rights, according to the statement.</blockquote><blockquote>The statement comes as China’s government is stepping up its effort to rein in the country’s most powerful tech companies. Earlier this week, China’s market regulator launched an antitrust investigation into food delivery app Meituan. The regulator earlier this month slapped an anti-monopoly fine of nearly $2.8 billion on e-commerce giant&nbsp;Alibaba.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-financial-regulators-summon-big-tech-firms-11619698257?mod=djem10point">China Warns Large Tech Firms as Industry Faces Rising Oversight</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearings-congress-abafd409-fa63-4e37-9209-77f24125b231.html">What four years of high-profile Big Tech hearings have really accomplished</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/internet-industry-privacy-measures-apple-google-cb7b0117-9966-4fce-8d04-30e7b77eeeff.html">Internet industry braces for new privacy&nbsp;rules</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/algorithms-congress-transparency-hearing-9893ea60-d4d0-43b9-a5f7-e267257c8968.html">Congress drags algorithms out of the&nbsp;shadows</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/world-tech-regulation-8d96502a-1400-4439-9ca8-c73ee4594a3b.html">The world regulates Big Tech while U.S.&nbsp;dithers</a>   6. Sometimes you have to litigate to&nbsp;innovate <p>That’s something GlobaliD co-founder and CEO <a href="https://global.id/">/gregkidd</a> likes to say. It’s an unfortunate truth — particularly in the case of Big Tech where the balance of power is shifted so far in one direction.</p><p>Epic Games clearly got the memo. The trial begins&nbsp;today.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/business/dealbook/asian-american-foundation.html">Andrew Ross&nbsp;Sorkin</a>:</p><blockquote>Today, Apple and Epic Games meet in court for a trial that could have implications for the future of the App Store and the antitrust fight against Big Tech. DealBook spoke with Jack Nicas, a technology reporter for The Times, about what’s at&nbsp;stake.</blockquote><p>(The stakes are high.) Jack&nbsp;Nicas:</p><blockquote>If you’re a company that sells any digital goods or services, whether a game, music or a dating platform, you likely pay a large share of your revenues to Apple. If Epic wins here, that could eventually put an end to Apple’s commissions, or at least cause Apple to loosen its control over the App Store. So it really would upend the economics of the app industry. And beyond that, an Epic win would boost the push for antitrust charges against some of the biggest tech companies, including Apple.</blockquote><blockquote>Now on the other side, if Apple wins, it’s really only going to bolster its already strong position.</blockquote><p>There’s also going to be a lot of tangentially interesting stuff — like this little tidbit about iMessage. <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-7c7d6033-036b-4f32-8dbb-d9b712341cf1.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Epic, meanwhile, cites a bunch of internal emails where Apple, among other things, decided not to do iMessage for Android because it could make it easier for people to switch off the iPhone. (My thought bubble: Even without the emails, we know that’s what Apple decided because if they hadn’t, we’d all have iMessage on Android by&nbsp;now.)</blockquote><p>Also:</p><blockquote>One of Epic’s economic experts <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows">estimates that Apple’s profit margins on the App Store are more than 77%</a>. Apple disputes this&nbsp;figure.</blockquote><p>The very existence of this case says a lot about where we are in time right now. A developer taking on Apple would have been unthinkable even a year or two&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Meanwhile in Europe. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/93b91f">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Two years after Spotify lodged a complaint against Apple’s App Store commissions and rules, Europe’s top antitrust regulator has found the U.S. company has been in breach of the continent’s competition laws.</blockquote><blockquote>The European Commission announced on Friday that Apple abused its market position around the rules of the app store. The Commission’s top competition enforcer Margarethe Vestager said Apple charged “high commission fees on rivals” like Spotify and also “forbids them to inform (users of) alternative subscription options.”</blockquote><blockquote>It is a preliminary finding — and Apple will get a chance to respond to the charges — but the news will be music to the ears of Spotify and the company’s other rivals who have been publicly campaigning against the company’s app store rules for several&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/eu-apple-antitrust-spotify-5e7ae972-81dd-4438-94d6-40d401683b6e.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">EU charges Apple with antitrust violations stemming from Spotify&nbsp;case</a>   7. The life of a chill content&nbsp;creator <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-holds-a-meme-summit-cameo-opens-its-wallet">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Rick McGuire, 36, is behind two of my favorite Instagram accounts: @subwaycreatures (2.2 million followers) and @whatisnewyork (791k followers). These share funny and bizarre sightings across New York City. McGuire is also on TikTok, Twitter and&nbsp;YouTube.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s basically people watching to the max,” McGuire&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>How he got started: In 2011, McGuire commuted into New York City from New Jersey and would send photos and videos of weird sightings to family and friends. He created a website, then as Instagram started growing in 2013, he moved his content to the&nbsp;app.</blockquote><blockquote>How he makes money: A full-time operation of one, he sells merchandise, makes money from sponsored content deals with Netflix, Kayak and Coors Light, and inked a licensing deal for the videos he posts. Pre-pandemic, record labels and musicians paid him to promote pop-up concerts inside the New York City subway. McGuire is also working on a coffee table book of notes people find in New York apartment lobbies and writing a TV pilot called “What Is New York.” He generates about $100,000 in annual&nbsp;revenue.</blockquote> 8.

        <p>We are very proud to be included in this conversation with the Sudanese government!</p>
<p>“Sudan’s Governmental officials believe that Blockchain will be impactful for the country. These statements were made during the Blockchain for Government initiative visit to Sudan led by Bitcoin Association, the Swiss-based non profit organization. The visit was at the invitation and under the patronage of the Ministry of telecom and Digital transformation in Sudan.”</p>
<p>“The visit centred around Sudan’s first-ever Blockchain Summit &amp; Workshop, a two-day event held April 8-9 and led by the BSV blockchain ecosystem. The conference and surrounding meetings explored how blockchain technology can advance digital transformation as the country rebuilds and re-emerges after 30 years of isolation from much of the world.”</p>

  <p></p>
<p>One of the most striking things about Urbit is the ideological diversity between communities. The Community Spotlight blog series will focus on various Urbit communities via interviews with founding members.</p>
<p>For the first week of the Community Spotlight series, I (~tirwyd-sarmes) will be speaking with Josh Reagan (~taglux-nidsep). Josh is the founder of The Portico, an Urbit community of Eastern Orthodox Christians.</p>
<p>The Portico is a very active group with conversations taking place over multiple channels. There are channels for posting Orthodox iconography, discussing the broader Christian culture war, and just talking about Orthodoxy in general. Of particular interest is Josh’s “Euthyphro” blog series which investigates the relationship between logic and the Orthodox faith. This is a topic that Josh is well qualified to talk about: he has a PhD in Philosophy from Rice University. His dissertation on the epistemology of logic and truth-preservation was titled "Knowing Your Limits: Logic for Limited Beings”. Josh is also the co-author of a forthcoming textbook on formal logic.</p>
<p>To read Josh’s blog is to be inducted into two esoteric traditions: theory of logic and Orthodox theology. With titles like “St. Gregory the Theologian and the Liar Paradox” and “The Existence of Abstract Objects”, Josh does not pull punches.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our conversation focused on the idiosyncratic and niche community that The Portico is home to. There, you won’t find cussing or much talk about “life partners”, but you will find cutting critiques of liberalism and the best way to raise Orthodox children.</p>
<p>As other users have pointed out, Urbit is pre-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a>. In fact, there’s some hope that the very nature of Urbit, how it tries to protect the sovereignty of niche communities via decentralization, might foil the Eternal September phenomenon. If Josh’s community persists, it will be a testament to both Josh and the decentralized Urbit network. As of now The Portico is a refreshing, perhaps jarring (as Josh might say), reminder of what the internet looked like back in the early days—a place for those who are different.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take a look. Find The Portico at ~topnup-firber/the-portico.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Do you see any connection between Rod Dreher’s The Benedict Option and your community on Urbit? Dreher sees a need for American Christians to create self-sustaining communities outside of the mainstream to protect the Christian religion and culture.</p>
<p>It’s tough to say with certainty—I’ve never read The Benedict Option.</p>
<p>A few years ago, while he was writing the book, I was a regular reader of Dreher’s blog. From his descriptions there, I was never clear about what exactly he was proposing. Much of his “clarification” came by way of metaphor: don’t “run for the hills”, but stop “shoring up the American imperium”. I didn’t read his book because I didn’t have much confidence that he would be especially precise or insightful.</p>
<p><a href="https://handleshaus.wordpress.com/2020/10/06/review-of-rod-drehers-live-not-by-lies/">There is an interesting review I’d recommend</a>, however, of his later book, Live Not By Lies. I believe it accurately characterizes the scale of the threat Christians will soon face in this country.</p>
<p>My upbringing was conservative Christian and self-consciously counter-cultural. I've inherited that understanding of what it means to be a Christian in an increasingly secular world. It comes naturally to me, so I find it obvious that Christians should form self-sustaining communities. But the details matter. What do such communities look like? How do we secure the freedom to pursue such communities? How do we sustain them, when myriad external forces seek to undermine them? How do we solve the long-term problem of the declining cultural importance of Christianity (which surely erodes the plausibility of our religion to many, even to some of those with sympathies toward it)?</p>
<p>I don’t claim to know the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>One kind of answer is that we should redouble our efforts to support and maintain a religiously and morally neutral liberal political order, which leaves room for subcultures to live and self-regulate as they wish. I disagree. Those who support a kind of “neutral” liberalism view it as an attempt to go “meta” and rise above various parochial metaphysical, moral, and religious disputes. I view this as a cop-out, a refusal to grapple with the most important questions.</p>
<p>Does the liberal have metaphysically-rooted moral reasons for going “meta”? If so, then he’s just another sectarian and he should be honest about it. The only difference is that his team has had the whip hand for the last several generations. On the other hand, if the liberal claims no underlying metaphysical justification then his project can succeed only to the extent that he can arrange and adjudicate unprincipled (and therefore ad hoc) agreements between otherwise hostile moral communities. But how stable can such an arrangement really be?</p>
<p>Orthodox Christians have theologically rich, metaphysical foundations for their social and moral teachings. With these we can form healthy, thriving, and growing communities. We can do so even under actively hostile political orders. If the early Church could make it under the Romans, so can we today. But it’s going to be difficult and sound judgment is necessary. Unfortunately, we lack strong leadership and that leaves us vulnerable. If we stay uncoordinated we dissipate our energies needlessly. If we latch onto the wrong leaders we can be led astray.</p>
<p>The challenges are immense. There is no technological solution. Even so, I’m an Urbit early-adopter for a reason. Over the years I’ve come into contact with a number of Orthodox and Ortho-curious Urbit followers. Why not try to bring them together in an Urbit group?</p>
<p>As far as I know, no one in the group is clergy. We’re all just a bunch of laymen with no authority to do much of anything. But I’d like to think we can still contribute in some way. I have an academic background in analytic philosophy so my inclination is to emphasize theory, but we have room for a bit of everything. Someone in the group wrote a script to take the texts of various Church Fathers and convert them to audio using AWS Polly. Those turned out pretty well!</p>
<p>At times I entertain ambitions to do a bit more, but for now perhaps it’s better to keep expectations in check. If nothing else, we can read and discuss the Scriptures and Church Fathers together, and try to understand better how to apply and live out their teachings. As we continue to grow the community and develop a consistent internal dynamic perhaps opportunities will arise that aren’t yet on the horizon. One thing I can say is that I’m committed to keeping the group active and growing.</p>
<p>I’d like to talk about your blog on The Portico. It combines two of your main interests: logic and theology. In broad strokes, do you think theology and logic are compatible? What is the relevance of this intersection to both of these disciplines?</p>
<p>I feel obligated to answer this question in two ways.</p>
<p>(1) If by “logic” you mean “first-order predicate calculus”, then I think there’s no special conflict between logic and theology. There are certain puzzles about their relationship, but similar puzzles exist between logic and other disciplines. Theology isn't especially endangered.</p>
<p>For example, in the 1930s, Alfred Tarski proved his famous Undefinability Theorem. Crudely put, it says that a plausible truth predicate cannot consistently be contained in any formal system with axioms strong enough to model arithmetic. Superficially it seems like our options are (a) get rid of the concept of truth, (b) get rid of arithmetic, or (c) throw away parts of logic until all inconsistency disappears.</p>
<p>None of these options is appealing. Tarski came up with a solution that mostly satisfies many logicians: reduce the concept of truth to “truth in a language” and forbid any language from containing its own truth predicate. If you want to talk about truth in a language L-1, you have to do it from a “metalanguage”, L-2.</p>
<p>Is Tarski’s definition of truth in a language the definitive solution for preserving truth, math, and logic? Perhaps not many philosophers think so, and there’s a massive literature in which logicians have attempted to improve on or extend his results.</p>
<p>Sometimes people seem to think formal logic is an infallible gift from heaven that must always be right. Kant said in the Critique of Pure Reason that formal logic is essentially a completed field. In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-Royal_Logic">the logic of his day</a> was an early-modern Cartesian variation of a medieval scholastic synthesis of ancient Stoic and Aristotelian logics. Roughly 100 years after Kant’s first critique was published, C. S. Peirce and Gottlob Frege independently discovered first-order mathematical logic as we know it today, inaugurating the greatest advance of logic since Aristotle. Kant was wrong.</p>
<p>Mathematical logic is a convenient, generally reliable, man-made tool that, when used carelessly in certain untamed domains, can lead one astray. Probably most people reading this are familiar with such puzzles as the Liar paradox. When one understands that logic is not a completed science, and perhaps never will be, there is less reason to worry about whether it can be used to nuke entire disciplines, like theology.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, see the blog post in my Urbit group: “St. Gregory the Theologian and the Liar Paradox”.</p>
<p>(2) There is perhaps a deeper challenge than the one I’ve just sketched. The Stoics used the term “logic” to encompass what we might today call “epistemology”. If the word “logic” is meant in some such broad and normative sense, then we may restate the challenge as one about rationality and theology. Is it irrational to pursue theology in our modern age?</p>
<p>As an undergraduate under the influence of Kierkegaard, I was attracted to a romantic, vaguely irrationalist notion of faith. Dawkins-mania was at its peak and I was disgusted by the pop-rationality (or was it empiricism?) of his annoying followers. Their view seemed to be that rationality just means “following the evidence”. The raw evidence is foundational, and theories are built atop by generalizing from the evidence. The ghost of logical positivism is with us even now.</p>
<p>I was dimly aware that Quine and others had made it difficult to sustain epistemic foundationalism. However, being unable to supply a more clear and cogent notion of rationality, I became skeptical of the idea altogether. But I went too far.</p>
<p>Instead, the proper response is to develop a superior account of rationality. Readers can probably guess where I went looking!</p>
<p>The word “logic” comes from the Greek “λόγος”. This is also the word used to describe Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John: “In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God.” This connection is not merely etymological.</p>
<p>For many ancients, the term “λόγος” meant something like “divine principle”. You might think of it as akin to a law of nature, but with stronger theological connotations. Christians appropriated this term and made it rather more exalted: the Logos is begotten of the Father, and yet somehow one with Him.</p>
<p>We are told that all things come into being through the Logos (John 1:3), giving Him an intimate relationship to the whole of creation. He gives structure and order to all created things, and in His divinity He understands them as so structured and ordered. He is also sinless, perfectly holy, and good. In Christ we have a perfect unity of the knowledge of all truth and righteousness.</p>
<p>Man was created in the image of God, which means that we bear a likeness to Christ. And we are commanded to realize that likeness with ever greater fidelity (Romans 8:29). The Church calls the pursuit of this likeness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosis_(Eastern_Christian_theology)">“theosis”</a>.</p>
<p>Thus we have the explanation of all normativity, according to Orthodox Christianity. In moral matters we must take on the holiness of Christ. In epistemic matters we aspire to the wisdom and knowledge of Christ, which includes an understanding of the whole created order. Socially we (the community of believers, i.e. the Church) are called to be in ever greater communion with God, cooperating with His work just as the Son cooperates with the Father.</p>
<p>Sadly we are conceived in sin and ignorant; hence the need for redemption by Christ.</p>
<p>Accordingly, my understanding of what it means to be rational is just to be Christ-like. The only perfect exemplar of reason, so construed, is Christ Himself. Any deviation from Him is irrational. What could be more logical than to be conformed to the Logos? But we cannot attain rationality without redemption. Hence we cannot become rational without first being saved from sin.</p>
<p>Doubtlessly many will find all of this too much to take, just too implausible. What about the development of mathematics, or the advances of the sciences? These are canonically ennobling, intellectual achievements. Jesus wasn’t a mathematician or a scientist! Nowhere in the Scriptures is He recorded as having applied Bayes’ theorem.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly my construal of rationality de-emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge by labeling it as merely one of several normative ends. To seek knowledge without seeking holiness is to be understood as dangerously unbalanced. To try to attain holiness and knowledge without communion with God is arrogant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need not exaggerate matters. St. Paul affirms the need for specialization of labor within the Church (1 Cor. 12). There is room for some to specialize in intellectual endeavors, so long as they act in a cooperative setting in which the other virtues are pursued as well. (Nor should anyone neglect the development of such virtues in himself.) Mathematicians and physicists are more than welcome in the Church.</p>
<p>According to this (all too briefly put) theory of rationality, there can be no conflict between ‘logic’ and theology. Theology is compatible with rationality because the account of rationality in question derives from a theological tradition. Naturally I’ve only given a sketch; much more could be said. But even if some readers are put off by the theory presented here, I hope it’s at least clear that there are conflicting notions of rationality. Anyone who wants to be rational confronts the task of figuring out which theory of rationality is correct.</p>
<p>In terms of community moderation, The Portico follows norms that are quite different than other online communities, often times quite drastically. For instance, living with women that you are not married to, is not something that should be talked about lightly. Can you talk about the importance of norms and how they relate to a healthy community?</p>
<p>Orthodox Christians are not commanded to “get along” with the rest of the world (John 15:18-25). We’re different, and our norms of interaction should likewise differ from those of outsiders. There is no one, monolithic “Orthodox culture”, but there are standards governing which local expressions of culture are legitimate and which are sinful. We should live in a way that enables and promotes holiness and discourages sin.</p>
<p>We have rules that may seem unusual from the outside. I don’t permit profanity, lewd jokes, or irreverent comments about God. In your question you mention a living arrangement that is prevalent in the world. Another rule I have is that we shouldn’t talk causally about sinful practices or lifestyles as if they are unremarkable parts of ordinary life. If Orthodox Christianity is true then such things aren’t minor peccadilloes. They’re spiritually destructive. The marriage-bond sanctifies activities that would otherwise be sinful.</p>
<p>If someone wants to analyze what is destructive about men and women living together before marriage, we’re open to that. But if you want to be affirmed in your sin, we’re not the place for you. Anyone of any religious creed is welcome to show up—but as a guest in an Orthodox Christian community. Hosts should be courteous to guests, but my first priority is not to make you feel good about your choices. We’re here to encourage each other, learn, and grow spiritually as Orthodox Christians. Naturally that means a little gate-keeping may sometimes be necessary if someone ever comes along who doesn’t share those goals. Being different is difficult and takes work.</p>
<p>In a way the cultural contrast is meant to be jarring. It can force you to confront moral and cultural presuppositions that you didn’t even know you had. When you become aware of the wider choices of culture available to you, you become free to look with a critical eye on the culture you’ve hitherto taken for granted. I think anyone could see how that might be liberating, even before considering the particulars of the cultures in question. Of course, as an Orthodox Christian, I think we have a good case to make about the particulars of our subculture.</p>
<p>I’ve never had to kick or ban anyone from the group. The group is relatively small (~180 people at the moment) so that probably helps. The vast majority of conversations are relaxed and friendly. Occasionally there are intense debates about one issue or another but I enjoy it, as long as it doesn’t become bitter or the primary mode of discourse. But everything ought to be done in a spirit of truth-seeking, not of one-upmanship.</p>
<p>The fact that The Portico can exist side-by-side with atheist communities on Urbit is pretty striking. On Urbit, a user is able to create niche communities and governance structures and yet still participate in a larger network. In other words, Urbit is trying to thread the needle between sameness and difference through federation at multiple levels. It seems to me that modern culture has become homogeneous due to an inability to maintain, or distinguish between, different communities. People who have nothing in common are forced to engage as if they were roommates, while those who are similar have trouble creating their own home. In other words, what is the role of community formation in the modern world and how does it connect to your critique of liberalism? Does Urbit have anything to say about this?</p>
<p>As I said in an earlier response, I see the liberal project as more or less an attempt to sidestep (not solve) difficult metaphysical and religious disputes between various distinct moral communities. Liberals have tried several methods of governance to achieve their ends. We can divide such attempts into two broad categories: centralized and decentralized.</p>
<p>Social media companies in the US confront similar governance challenges, so we can analyze them in similar terms.</p>
<p>A social network like Facebook takes a centralized approach. Zuckerberg spoke early and often of his desire to connect people and “bring the world closer together”. There was a sense that if people from various communities could get to know each other a little better, we would see how much we have in common and make progress toward some kind of universal cosmopolitan consensus.</p>
<p>But that didn’t happen. With centralized social media you’re practically guaranteed to interact with people whose moral and metaphysical commitments are sharply at odds with your own. As a result, you face a persistent, nagging risk of conflict. Without warning, a friendly disagreement can explode into an all-out flame war. Most choose one of two basic approaches for dealing with this threat:</p>
<p>(1) You live a compartmentalized life. You keep your moral and metaphysical commitments to yourself and cultivate a culturally homogenized persona for your social media activities. No one disagrees with you because there’s nothing to disagree with.</p>
<p>(2) You can enlist to fight in the culture war and display your regimental colors with pride. And because you take your smartphone everywhere you’re always on the front line.</p>
<p>These aren’t the only options, of course. With some combination of charisma, patience, and grace you can be relatively open about your beliefs without getting into too much trouble. But even if you have the talent to pull it off, it takes time and energy. Many of us aren’t willing to go to all that trouble. Social media is supposed to serve us, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Urbit is decentralized which, in my opinion, means that it isn’t really a network in the way that Facebook is. I see Urbit as more of a network platform. The users create the networks, or migrate them in from elsewhere. We’re all using Landscape and running our VMs on Nock, so obviously there can be interaction between different communities. But anyone who doesn’t want that cross-community interaction doesn’t have to have it.</p>
<p>I’ve followed Urbit’s progress since 2016, so I’m plugged into groups with other Urbit people I’ve come to know over the years. Other than that, however, I don’t know much about who’s out there. It’s not like The Portico is in one neighborhood and the atheists are in the next neighborhood over. There’s a real sense in which we’re not even on the same network—different Urbit communities share a common protocol, but a protocol isn’t a network.</p>
<p>Some people may want to see a little of everything. If atheists want to join our group they’re welcome to do so! We’ll be friendly. I don’t seek out their groups, though.</p>
<p>One virtue of decentralized social media is that it offers a totally different set of trade-offs with respect to how you share and act on your beliefs. What if you could talk earnestly about philosophy and religion without having to worry about alienating many of your friends and family? I guess that’s somewhat possible on Facebook—do they still have “groups”?—but Urbit was designed for it.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I don’t think decentralization is a panacea. Even if Urbit takes off, it will likely face problems that are difficult to anticipate now. My hope is simply that Urbit’s trade-offs are healthier than the ones we’ve had before.</p>

<p>One day at a time. That was Sam Magtanong’s mantra when COVID-19 hit, threatening not only the long-dreamed-of expansion of the <a href="https://www.mostracoffee.com/">San Diego microroastery</a> he built with his wife and two friends, but of the business itself.</p>
<p>“My vision was, if I could stay open for the next day, and if I can pay my staff one more day, and if I can serve one more cup of coffee, there’s a blessing there,” he says. “We just looked at it that way, and we kept just trying to stay open another day.”</p>
<p>For many entrepreneurs, accessing the capital they need to build their businesses can be challenging even in flush times. When Sam and Beverly Magtanong and their partners Jelynn Malone and Mike Arquines opened their first Mostra Coffee location in 2018, they struggled with cash flow and turned to <a href="https://www.lendio.com/">Lendio</a> and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Finicity</a> for a loan.</p>
<p>To help small businesses get the credit they need to grow and thrive, Lendio harnesses Finicity’s open banking platform, which lets people more easily share their banking data with other banks, lenders and fintech companies. It gives lenders a more holistic view of a person or business’s finances to help them determine their creditworthiness.</p>
<p>“Eliminating financial hurdles and introducing small business owners to capital opportunities they may not know exist can extend the spirit of entrepreneurship to more people,” says Denada Ramnishta, senior vice president of Lender &amp; Partner Strategy at Lendio.</p>
<p>The pandemic hit when Mostra Coffee was getting ready to open a second coffee shop. Lendio helped Mostra Coffee obtain a U.S. Paycheck Protection loan to keep the business running, hire back staff they had laid off at the start of the pandemic, and finish work on their second location. “I went from feeling a sense of desperation to feeling a sense of relief,” Magtanong says.</p>
<p>With the newest round of PPP loans, Lendio has started working with Finicity’s open banking platform to authenticate bank statements to reduce the risk of fraud in the process. Lendio and Finicity will be bringing their joint capabilities to small businesses in the U.K. and other markets in the coming months through a new strategic agreement.

<p><a href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">Engineers Australia</a>&nbsp;recently invited our co-CEO and CTO,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, to give&nbsp;the&nbsp;prestigious Annual&nbsp;InformaticsLecture.&nbsp;He spoke&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and the tech driving it this&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>, particularly around identity and anonymous profiles online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;lecture&nbsp;follows Paul’s recent panel discussion on the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">rise of privacy tech</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Privacy Day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Engineers Australia, Paul covered&nbsp;three big questions:&nbsp;</p>



  WHY&nbsp;we created&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  HOW&nbsp;we&nbsp;can solve&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/12/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;crisis</a>&nbsp;  



  WHAT we’ve&nbsp;built.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



 Why we created Anonyome Labs&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Paul reinforced that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers are fed up</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>, and that the popular adage&nbsp;is&nbsp;indeed&nbsp;true:&nbsp;If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.&nbsp;Big Tech and data brokers (and even everyday brands we know and love) are scooping up our&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>&nbsp;like candy and using it&nbsp;to generate&nbsp;massive profit.&nbsp;Big data analytics technology is being used to commercialize knowledge of user behavior and influence&nbsp;thatbehavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul told the audience that we started Anonyome Labs&nbsp;because we believe the pendulum has swing too far; that people have lost control of their personal information. Even way back in 2014 when we started the company, we could see privacy was going to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue&nbsp;for&nbsp;years</a>&nbsp;to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&nbsp;is no doubt&nbsp;that&nbsp;consumers are growing louder in their calls for change to data privacy.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">Recent research</a> reveals:&nbsp;</p>



  High profile, significant, and regular <a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a> have spooked consumers. &nbsp;  Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a> for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data. &nbsp;  Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can.&nbsp;  Levels of consumer trust for brands is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>. &nbsp;  Consumers will <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a> brands or <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay purchases</a> where they perceive a risk to their personal data.&nbsp;  The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers.&nbsp;  



<p>We’ve seen some&nbsp;positive news&nbsp;in the data privacy space, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>, and we’ve seen somenegative news too: think&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/the-whatsapp-facebook-signal-issue-explained-and-why-mysudo-is-the-best-solution/">WhatsApp</a>.&nbsp;So&nbsp;the bottom line is, we need to affect real change.&nbsp;</p>



 How we can solve the global data privacy crisis&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Privacy is a complex issue, but&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;want and&nbsp;need to regain control of their personal data.&nbsp;We believe the&nbsp;solution lies&nbsp;in empowering users to protect their personal information&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">digital identities</a>&nbsp;and the related&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/why-we-need-decentralized-identity/">decentralized</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">self-sovereign</a>&nbsp;identities—the future of privacy and identity management on the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&nbsp;know that when&nbsp;we&nbsp;use our personal identity,&nbsp;our data is tracked, collected, correlated, and sold&nbsp;and&nbsp;oftentimes&nbsp;reveals&nbsp;highly sensitive personal information&nbsp;about&nbsp;us, like medical history, financial situation or criminal record. Companies can easily&nbsp;end up with&nbsp;a full set of our&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;and use it to influence our buying and other behaviors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when&nbsp;we&nbsp;use&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital identity,&nbsp;we&nbsp;can separate from&nbsp;our personal identity&nbsp;and, even better,&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalize</a>&nbsp;all&nbsp;our&nbsp;different digital identities in a powerfully protective strategy.&nbsp;(Compartmentalization of&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data is so important,&nbsp;it’s worth reading&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">popular article</a>&nbsp;on the topic.)&nbsp;</p>



 What we’ve built&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Labs&nbsp;has built an innovative&nbsp;digital identity concept&nbsp;called the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>.&nbsp;A Sudo&nbsp;is a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>A Sudo isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a real, alternative identity&nbsp;that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s Sudo profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the Sudo profile and manage it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudos&nbsp;are&nbsp;the centrepiece of our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;complete business toolkit for rapidly producing branded cybersecurity solutions, and our exemplar consumer privacy app,&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In MySudo,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;can create up to nine&nbsp;Sudos and each one&nbsp;can have its own set of attributes and associated capabilities: &nbsp;</p>



  name&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;  address&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email address</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/mysudo-virtual-cards-are-here-making-the-safest-way-to-live-online-now-even-safer/">virtual cards</a> for secure shopping&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private&nbsp;browser</a>&nbsp;(all your bookmarks and any cookies that sites set are compartmentalized to the browsing Sudo)&nbsp;  notification settings for phone, email and message&nbsp;  contacts and more…&nbsp;

<p>The user&nbsp;gives&nbsp;each of&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudos one or more identity attributes that are different from&nbsp;their&nbsp;legal identity.&nbsp;They&nbsp;can make&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudo identity a little different (e.g. by having a different phone number) or very different (e.g. by having a different name, email address, phone number, virtual cards, contacts, etc.).&nbsp;The user&nbsp;labels&nbsp;each Sudo&nbsp;and&nbsp;can even assign a different notification sound to each, to alert&nbsp;them&nbsp;to the context of the incoming contact (is it my kid’s&nbsp;soccer coach or&nbsp;my&nbsp;bank is calling or messaging, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users&nbsp;structure&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudos to achieve the degrees of privacy, safety, organization and convenience&nbsp;they&nbsp;need. For example,&nbsp;they&nbsp;might regard&nbsp;their <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hospitals-idUSKCN0HJ21I20140924">medical information</a> as more sensitive than&nbsp;their&nbsp;financial information, and&nbsp;theirfinancial information as more sensitive than who&nbsp;they&nbsp;know.&nbsp;The user&nbsp;decides&nbsp;what suits&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;might want one of&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudos to retain some of the benefits of ‘privacy invasive’ searching and tracking online. Health information is a great example. When researching a health condition,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;may want some level of tracking in order to preserve&nbsp;their&nbsp;search history, mark favorites, set bookmarks, be offered search results relevant to&nbsp;their&nbsp;previous searching, receive discount coupons for remedies, be offered new research material, or even be referred to doctors or hospitals specializing in&nbsp;their&nbsp;condition. By using a Sudo,&nbsp;they&nbsp;can still have all these benefits, but they’re not correlated to&nbsp;the user’s&nbsp;personal&nbsp;identity.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Sudos allow&nbsp;a user&nbsp;to do many things:&nbsp;</p>



  Call people and businesses&nbsp;  Send and receive texts&nbsp;  Have private communications with family and friends&nbsp;  Browse&nbsp;online&nbsp;and decide whether&nbsp;they&nbsp;want to be tracked&nbsp;  Protect&nbsp;themself&nbsp;when shopping online&nbsp;  Assign separate Sudos for different purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be as anonymous as&nbsp;they&nbsp;feel is appropriate for the situation.&nbsp;  



<p>The integration of all these&nbsp;activities, like autofill&nbsp;for&nbsp;virtual card information, is also really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When enterprises access Sudo Platform&nbsp;to rapidly produce branded cybersecurity solutions,&nbsp;they can&nbsp;use&nbsp;the Sudo as part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">menu of high value privacy tools</a>&nbsp;delivered as easy-to-use APIs and SDKs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul shared with Engineers Australia that in developing the Sudo, we wanted to do something that hasn’t been done before.&nbsp;And that’s what the global fight for privacy will&nbsp;demand&nbsp;from us and others in this space, as well as any company that engages&nbsp;with user data: out of the box thinking and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>.</p>

That means big benefits to founders, stakeholders, and investors.</p><p>Find out how the team at Fairmint is championing a stakeholder capitalism, with passwordless authentication powered by&nbsp;Magic.</p> Better, passwordless UX <p>Aligning people to the success of a company is one of the toughest challenges for organizations of all shapes and sizes. The Fairmint model is uniquely built around community alignment, putting equity in the hands of a company’s employees, customers, partners, and&nbsp;fans.</p><p>Say you’re a founder. Using Fairmint, anyone in your community gets the opportunity to invest in your company at any single time, directly from your website with an “Invest now” button. Likewise, Fairmint lets you easily reward your key stakeholders by giving them a stake in your company’s future financial success.</p><p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/thibauld">Thibauld Favre</a>, CEO of Fairmint, started to tackle authentication and onboarding, he was extremely mindful about user experience. In effort to streamline onboarding, the team decided to transition from traditional password-based login to passwordless. The shift was a game-changer.</p><p>With the rapid rise in NFTs and cryptocurrencies, Fairmint intentionally wanted to appeal to mainstream users newer to the crypto ecosystem. Crypto wallets like MetaMask are too complex for broader audiences, requiring multiple steps and upfront explanation.</p><p>Emailed magic links, however, offer the perfect bridge between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. Users can simply log in through a passwordless flow they’re already familiar&nbsp;with.</p><blockquote>“Magic is by far the smoothest UX in Web&nbsp;3.0.”</blockquote><p>Beyond major improvements in speed, design, and ease of use, Thibauld counts “easy implementation” for developers and “super proactive, responsive customer support” as other compelling reasons why he and his team are happy customers who have advocated for Magic since the beginning.</p> Non-custodial as non-negotiable <p>Another significant factor for Fairmint was staying non-custodial.</p><p>Why? The non-custodial nature of DeFi wallets ensures users can safely store their own funds without having to rely on third-party institutions to hold their assets. For Fairmint, it’s a hard requirement to align with the standard for trust amongst crypto communities.</p><blockquote>“We were confident with Magic because it’s non-custodial.”</blockquote> Support for Fairmint’s mission <p>For a mission-driven company like Fairmint, it was critical to integrate a decentralized auth solution and remain non-custodial, without compromising a great user experience. Magic not only solves auth for developers, but the team is also more empowered to achieve their&nbsp;mission.</p><blockquote>“We can only do what we do because we’re non-custodial. Magic helps tremendously with that. It’s a key part of our value, enabling customers to host the Fairmint experience on their website, without the need to become regulated.”</blockquote><p>What’s next? Scaling and growing alongside Magic. From the latest features to proactive support for modern blockchains, Fairmint is thrilled to build on the partnership with Magic and stay laser-focused on helping the world move towards an ownership economy.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/fairmint-uses-magic-to-offer-the-smoothest-user-experience-in-web-3-0-a778a4f9a997">Fairmint uses Magic to offer the smoothest user experience in Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://minisocial.com/">Minisocial</a> is a user-generated content (UGC) platform for brands that want to showcase their product in the wild, drive acquisition, or build community.</p><p>Using Magic, Minisocial removed critical friction for customers and creators. In addition, offloading authentication opened up more opportunities to grow the business. And when it came time for a massive account migration, going passwordless helped the team proactively support customers and notably cut down the time spent on overhead.</p> From zero to&nbsp;one <p>Producing fully-licensed UGC assets with top-notch creators is a common challenge for brands. Inspired by this need and his experience working in the agency world, <a href="https://twitter.com/awesleyrogers">Austin Rogers</a> co-founded Minisocial. The primary goal: connect brands with micro influencers on demand and at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Since 2019, Minisocial has grown to launch campaigns for global brands including Doordash, SANZO, and more. From bespoke posts to native advertising and product features, Minisocial offers a wide range of content capabilities that deliver amplification, engagement, and performance.</p> Frictionless onboarding — no passwords required <p>Starting a business from the ground up is often seen as a masterclass in prioritization. With the majority of his focus on highest-priority initiatives, Austin considered authentication an afterthought. It was <a href="https://bean.la/">Bean</a>, the design and development agency steering the web platform, that strongly recommended Magic.</p><p>For the developers at Bean, implementing Magic was “plug and play.” During a weekly All Hands meeting, the agency demoed the magic link signup flow live — already built. From that immediate impression, Austin saw adopting passwordless auth as a no-brainer that naturally aligned with their company principles and business objectives.</p><blockquote>“The more we can get out of users’ way during signup, the better. That’s a big part of the design ethos for us. Magic fit really well into that. When users want to login, they enter the one piece of data you need, and then you’re done. It’s super&nbsp;cool.”</blockquote><p>As a dual-sided marketplace, Minisocial’s goal was to optimize for conversion across customers and creators. They were clearly focused on minimizing the number of unnecessary actions users have to take before gaining value and accessing the platform.</p><blockquote>“Every time we introduce any friction, we’re turning away money. On the brand side, that means turning away work. On the creator side, the risk is losing someone along the way because they’re frustrated with onboarding.</blockquote> Migration from months to&nbsp;minutes <p>Beyond an intuitive integration and seamless signup flow, going passwordless offered another key benefit: massive time&nbsp;savings.</p><p>When the team needed to migrate a year’s worth of existing user data to the new platform, Magic provided a means for Minisocial to offer best-in-class customer support. With the ability to set up secure, email-based accounts on the backend, there was no need to ask brands and creators to re-establish their credentials. As soon as the platform was generally available, customers could simply enter in their email and proceed as if they had created the profiles themselves.</p><p>Handling customer support in addition to executing the migration could have taken months. Fortunately, with Magic it was taken care of in just an afternoon.</p><blockquote>“Magic solves problems that I didn’t even know I had. It’s been game-changing in terms of letting our team focus on what’s going to move the needle for&nbsp;us.”</blockquote> An all-in-one solution <p>Thanks to Magic, Minisocial was able to streamline user onboarding, ship faster, and migrate effortlessly.</p><p>Overall, by implementing a single solution that abstracts away the complexity of passwordless authentication, Minisocial gained back meaningful time to invest in the company’s growth.</p><blockquote>“Magic saves us time the same way Stripe does for us. If I had unlimited funds and unlimited time, I’m sure we could make a credit card processing tool that is custom-built for Minisocial. Stripe does payment processing infinitely better than a homegrown solution because they’ve invested a tremendous amount of time, money, and talent. I view Magic the exact same way. This is a powerful plug and play tool that’s going to think years ahead. And it works right out of the&nbsp;box.”</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-minisocial-saved-valuable-time-resources-and-migration-headaches-16165ddf0187">How Minisocial saved valuable time, resources, and migration headaches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are often used interchangeably because they uniquely identify entities in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>But in reality, they are vastly different and we’ll see how they stack against each other across different aspects.</p><p>First off, let’s take a brief look at what each&nbsp;is.</p> What are Non-Fungible Tokens&nbsp;(NFTs)? <p>Non-fungible tokens are a type of token that is unique and not interchangeable. For example, if you own a $100 currency note, you can exchange it for another $100 note, and there’s no difference at all in terms of its value or appearance. Such tokens/items are called fungible.</p><p>On the other hand, let’s say you have an original Van Gogh painting called “The Starry Night”. You can’t exchange it for another painting, even by Van Gogh, as there will be a difference in both value and appearance. In this sense, this token represents a unique object, and replacing the value of this token with anything else changes the value of the token itself. Such items are called non-fungible.</p><p>When you extend it to the blockchain, an NFT is a cryptographic token that’s stored on the blockchain network and cannot be replicated. This token is used to identify the authenticity of an object and prove that a particular entity owns it. In our above example, if John says he owns “The Starry Night”, the NFT is proof that this painting is indeed the original Starry Night by Van Gogh and it is owned by&nbsp;John.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p>Verifiable credentials, on the other hand, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically to prove an entity’s identity. You can learn more about VCs&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">here</a>.</p> Similarities between an NFT and a&nbsp;VC <p>VCs and NFTs have many things in common, and this is often why they are confused.</p> Leverages the Digital&nbsp;World <p>A common thread that connects both NFTs and VCs is that they leverage the potential benefits of the digital world to give users more security, flexibility, and freedom to monetize.</p><p>NFTs, in particular, give owners new revenue streams and ways to monetize. For example, a music band can create an exclusive single and sell it as an NFT, so the new owner has the rights to all royalties arising from&nbsp;it.</p><p>VCs also leverage the digital infrastructure to eliminate the frauds that arise in the physical world by converting all important credentials into an easy-to-share digital format. A startup company, for example, can take the responsibility of converting the physical identities into secure digital ones, and in turn, charge a fee to the owner of the credential for this&nbsp;service</p> Unique Identification <p>Both NFTs and VCs are used to uniquely identify something that belongs to an entity. NFTs are often implemented to represent a unique piece of art or a collectible that belongs to an entity. It proves that a particular item is authentic as claimed and belongs only to an entity. For example, an NFT can be used to prove that Lisa is the owner of a collectible Pokemon&nbsp;card.</p><p>VCs are also used to prove that a claim made by an entity is true. This claim can be credentials such as PII, university degree, and more. In this case, a gaming club can issue a VC to Lisa to claim that she is the head of their pokemon meetup&nbsp;club.</p><p>In fact, here is a list that compiles some of the possible <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use cases</a> and the credentials that can be verified by&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>In this sense, both NFTs and VCs prove that something belongs to an entity and this could be anything from a PII to a piece of&nbsp;art.</p> Immutable <p>The implementation of both NFTs and VCs ensures that the records are immutable, and hence, this adds another layer of security to these tokens and credentials.</p><p>Thus, these are some of the similarities between NFTs and&nbsp;VCs</p> Differences Between an NFT and a&nbsp;VC <p>Moving on, let’s look at some of the differences.</p> Implementation <p>A key difference is that VCs use public key infrastructure and digital signatures to prove a claim. There are three entities in a VC — the issuer (the entity that issues a credential), the holder (the entity that owns the credential), and the verifier (the entity that verifies the credential).</p><p>For example, an issuer issues a driver’s license verifiable credential that belongs to a holder. Both the issuer and the holder digitally sign the VC using their respective public keys, and these signatures are verified by the verifier to authenticate that the driver’s license belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>NFTs, on the other hand, are based on blockchain and are time-stamped, and this makes it easy to verify the digital ownership of the token. Any change in ownership is known to all the parties in the&nbsp;network.</p> Transferability <p>Another difference is the ability to transfer the credential that it represents. To elaborate, VCs represent the credential of an entity that will always be owned by the holder. Though the holder can decide where and how it can be shared, the ownership of a VC never changes&nbsp;hands.</p><p>NFTs, on the other hand, are transferable. For example, let’s say an NFT that represents a rare album by Michael Jackson was owned by Sony and was sold to Ashley. So, the NFT has changed hands and Ashley is the new owner of&nbsp;it.</p> Blockchain Implementation <p>Furthermore, NFTs are implemented only on a blockchain whereas VCs can be implemented on blockchain or any other Distributed Ledger Transaction (DLT) network. There are even some implementations like IRMA that stay away from DLTs altogether.</p><p>In fact, one of the disadvantages of NFTs is that it is tied to a platform as this is where the link between an NFT and its owner is established. If that platform becomes non-existent in the future, information about the NFT’s creator could be lost&nbsp;forever.</p><p>But VCs have no such dependency since they are not platform-specific.</p> Scarcity/Availability <p>The value of an NFT depends on the scarcity or availability of the digital asset it represents coupled with its fair value, so the fewer the NFTs, the greater will be its&nbsp;value.</p><p>But in the case of a VC, the scarcity or availability does not determine its value because it represents the identity of an entity and this identity never&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The VCs’ financial value depends on how it is used in a marketplace and its financial mechanics would be very different from an NFT. Eg: a VC shared can be paid for by a verifier (small amount) and part of it can go back to the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Indivisibility <p>An NFT is indivisible because the digital asset it represents has no value when divided. Imagine, can you break a sculpture into two and sell it to two different people? Makes no sense, right? While more than one entity can own an NFT, the NFT itself cannot be&nbsp;divided.</p><p>In the case of VCs, they can be divided while sharing. For example, let’s say a VC contains the date of birth and the driver’s license number of an individual. The holder can choose to share just the driver’s license number with one verifier and the date of birth alone with another. In this sense, VCs are divisible.</p><p>Here’s a summary of the differences between NFTs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>In all, NFTs verify the ownership of an object while VCs uniquely identify an entity. However, NFT’s ability to prove authorship and identity is limited to the network in which it is implemented and VCs could be used to extend its usability beyond the&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">Here is an example</a> of how VCs are implemented in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> to learn more about VCs, their implementations in the world of Self-Sovereign Identity, the APIs you can use for building them, and&nbsp;more.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) vs Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

As the distributed enterprise, the use of personal devices and the expectation of remote access to resources have become the norm, the workplace is no longer confined to a physical location. This is dramatically changing the world of work for both the enterprise and employees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Business applications like <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/integrations/slack.html">Slack</a>, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/integrations/zoom.html">Zoom</a> and <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/integrations/salesforce.html">Salesforce</a> are enabling greater workforce mobility, making it easier than ever for your employees to be productive from anywhere—whether they’re <a>working from home</a>, on the road or from an Airbnb rental. At the same time, though, this newfound freedom presents unique challenges when it comes to keeping those same employees safe and ensuring data and resources remain secure.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Metadians,</p><p>Times are changing. More and more people are turning to Bitcoin and other virtual assets as an alternative solution to the current financial system. Besides, the fact that the market’s interest is centered on the institutional sector is very suggestive: it means that the real value of blockchain technology itself is spreading rapidly into our lives, moving away from the “simple” investment point of view. This also keeps the door open for blockchain technology to be used in new ways as a new market creation opportunity.</p>Metadium’s mainnet key achievements<p>With faith in the technology and overcoming various challenges, Metadium has been making steady progress in the past years. Since the launch of the mainnet in 2019, Metadium has grown into one of the representative blockchain projects in South Korea. It has created one million wallets and manages 300,000–500,000 daily transactions, which positions it in the 14th place of the world’s mainnet ranking. (You can find the details&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-turns-2-d1f20d6001de">here</a>).</p><p>In this post, we would like to share Metadium’s short-term roadmap and mid-long term goals. Furthermore, we will share a letter from our CEO to the community, where he explains the direction of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Please note that the following is a roadmap that shows the big picture and, since reacting to a rapidly changing environment is essential, some details might&nbsp;change.</p> Letter from&nbsp;Justin <p>Dear community,</p><p>Metadium launched its service as a special purpose public chain with the intention of spreading DID. By ‘special purpose’ I mean that the services implemented on the chain must have sufficient competitiveness compared to the centralized method (you can find the details&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-is-here-a6ccae631b2e">here</a>).</p><p>DApps related to DeFi and NFT, which have been hot issues these days, have shown the ideal utilization of public chains. Meanwhile, the scalability issue and the resulting volatility in gas prices are the future tasks to deal with. Another problem that comes with the nature of open sources is the scam projects which are easily reproduced. Because of these concerns, the scope &amp; definition of governance and the mainnet management team’s responsibility must be considered once&nbsp;again.</p><p>In Vitalik’s recent blog “<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy</a>”, he expresses his concerns for the development of a healthy ecosystem and emphasizes, once again, that active support from the community is more important than anything else. This is a common mission, not only for Ethereum, but for all public&nbsp;chains.</p><p>I think of Metadium as an amusement park that is visited by a lot of people due to its fun rides: developers make fun and safe rides (dApps) and people (users) actively participate in them. Now, let me explain further how this amusement park called Metadium is being made and how it will further&nbsp;develop.</p>Metadium amusement park: admission ticket (DID) + fun rides&nbsp;(dApps) 1. Making tickets: Infrastructure for commercialization of&nbsp;DID <p>Metadium is a project focused on DID (Decentralized Identifier), looking to implement the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. With this vision, Metadium blockchain has been used to develop services like MYKEEPiN, B PASS and THEPOL. The fact that recently many mainnets have implemented the DID layer into their basic infrastructure can be seen as a recognition of the necessity of DID, the admission ticket for an amusement park. Admission tickets (DID) allows you to identify yourself to access multiple rides (services) while protecting your personal information.</p> 2. Making fun rides: activation of Metadium&nbsp;dApps   Enhancing THEPOL: NFT model in&nbsp;Q2  Metadium-based NFT platform: METApie  Metadium Defi ecosystem creation (Swap, Bridge, Stable&nbsp;Coin)  <p>Metadium has been creating dApps that the general public can use and enjoy. The development and tools used for these dApps will serve as a reference for developers to create even better apps in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Metadium blockchain was used to develop THEPOL: Coinplug’s poll and survey service. THEPOL has implemented an NFT-based badge structure and it’s now growing its own ecosystem.</p><p>Reinforcing our role in the NFT world, Metadium blockchain will be used to develop a new platform that will support NFT issuance and P2P transactions: METApie. This marketplace will be operated by Coinplug and will be linked to MYKEEPiN for identification and authentication.</p><p>DeFi has demonstrated the importance of smart contracts. That’s why we’ll release a Metadium DeFi ecosystem including swap, bridge and stable coins. What will differentiate us from other DeFi projects is our DID technology, which has proved along the years its stability and reliability.</p> 3. Park enhancement: upgrading Metadium&nbsp;Mainnet   Metadium Explorer  Application of Berlin and London hard&nbsp;fork  Selection of 21 BP nodes among MYKEEPiN Alliance member companies, global partners, and the community pool  User protection with “Metadium Certificate System”  <p>As a mainnet project, management and upgrades of the mainnet are an important part of the roadmap. Metadium, based on the SPoA consensus algorithm, similar to EIP-225 (PoA), is a blockchain that restricts decentralization and enhances scalability. Based on this, we set up a short-term plan for technology advancement such as security and optimization according to the actual operation rather than to a relatively scalable technology trend such as L2 or sharding.</p><p>(Among L2 technologies, ZKP-related contents are being considered for application to DID scalability).</p><p>Metadium Explorer is scheduled for the first half of 2021. We are planning to complete the selection of Block Producers for 21 nodes within this year. We will enhance the decentralization and transparency of the Metadium network with the combination of Coinplug-led MYKEEPiN Alliance member companies, Metadium Global Partners, and a pool that allows general individuals participation.</p><p>Through advancement of the governance function, we will actively apply the Metadium Certificate System and provide guidelines for user protection. The application of this system is considered to be the minimum requirement of the Mainnet foundation.</p><p>Last year, Metadium conducted a hard fork (Istanbul) to review the EIPs added in Ethereum and adding the corresponding functions, if necessary, to Metadium. Following this, we are planning to conduct the same procedure once the Berlin hard fork is completed and its stability is verified (end of May). The key of the Berlin Hard Fork is that its four EIPs can reduce the cost of certain types of network transactions. After this, if the London fork succeeds in July, and once its stability is verified, we are planning to apply it on the Metadium blockchain at the end of September.</p><p>Moving forward, Metadium will continue working hard to develop our technology and expand our DID ecosystem. In conclusion, and referring to the previous analogy of the amusement park, we will provide more, bigger and safer rides to be enjoyed by everyone.</p><p>Thank you for your&nbsp;support.</p><p>Justin Park</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-2021-roadmap-and-a-letter-from-justin-d854e336e2ee">Metadium 2021 Roadmap and a Letter from Justin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We completed 85% of the Ontology EVM-integrated design, which will be fully compatible with Ethereum contract ecology after completion.  We also completed 75% of the latest Layer 2 technology, which explores the integration of Ethereum Layer 2 on the Ontology&nbsp;MainNet.  <p>Product Development</p>  This month we released ONTO v3.8.2, adding and optimizing the features for Ethereum private transaction and high-speed transaction.  We officially integrated the webpage plug-in version of ONTO cross-chain wallet with Wing&nbsp;Finance.  ONTO is included as a default wallet option in the popular dApp HyperJump on the Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain.  ONTO held community activities with DeFi ecosystem partners OpenOcean, Multiplier, DeFiner, MDEX, and&nbsp;ApeSwap.  <p>dApps</p>  As of April 24th 2021, there were 115 dApps launched in total on&nbsp;MainNet.  There were a total of 6,559,346 dApp transactions completed on&nbsp;MainNet.  We recorded 85,133 dApp-related transactions in the past&nbsp;month.  <p>Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty</p>  It was another big month for community growth and we welcomed 3,868 new members across Ontology’s global ecosystem. As always, we welcome anyone who is interested in Ontology to join&nbsp;us!

Launching its new DeFi product “Any Pool”, this provides opportunities to a much wider audience and allows for the contractualization and lending of almost anything.  Over the past month, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, has been busy doing interviews. He was featured in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/12/investing/bitcoin-prices-coinbase/index.html">CNN Business</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-goes-for-direct-testing-of-crypto-narratives-today-9912.htm">CryptoNews</a>, amongst others, sharing his thoughts on the prospect of cryptocurrency and some of Ontology’s recent updates on decentralized digital identity.  Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, took part in a panel discussion titled “The State of Decentralized Identity Solutions”. The panel, organized by The Block, featured spokespeople from Microsoft and Serto. Ning Hu spoke about the current status of decentralized identity framework and ecosystem development and solutions.  This month, Ontology published an updated version of its DID and Data <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1383962018730835970">ecosystem landscape</a>. The latest version covers ecosystem partners from industries including public chains, supply chain, entertainment, and automotive. We are welcoming suggestions from the community on relevant projects we should consider adding to our ecosystem.    In some global news this week, the Chinese and English version of the “<a href="https://www.cabin.vc/">Digital Securities Industry Development Report 2020</a>” was published. The report was co-authored by leaders in the space including Cabin VC, Binance China Blockchain Research Institute, Gibraltar Stock Exchange Group (GSX Group), Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange (HKBitEX), and&nbsp;UPRETS.

<p>Apache Struts probably means little to most people outside the software realm. CVE-2017-5638 even less so. But for credit company Equifax, these terms are likely reminiscent of what the people living in Troy must have felt when a giant wooden horse appeared at the gates of their city-state.

<p>That might be a funny question to ask right now. If you’ve been reading the Dev Pulse for the last couple years, you probably already know what Holochain is.</p><p>But for those of you who are new to Holochain, or who want to share it with your friends, we’ve just publicly released a video, <a href="https://youtu.be/EUfyHNGvnDo">What Is Holochain?</a>. It’s based on a talk I gave at this year’s <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM conference</a>, and it gives a quick overview of what Holochain is all about at a level that’ll help devs understand whether it’s a good fit for them.</p><p>We’re busy building a new holochain.org website and this video will be featured there. It is fairly technical, but we hope it will build understanding for some folks even if it doesn’t quite get there for everyone. All sorts of people are interested in Holochain — builders, crypto fans, change agents, and business people. And that’s great. But it’s challenging to speak to them all at once! That’s why we’re trying to create materials that focus on specific audiences.</p><p>We’re releasing this one first because, ultimately, Holochain is a developer’s toolkit, and developers are the foundation of <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/no-hype-holos-global-adoption-strategy-f845cf563bdf">our adoption strategy</a>. If developers get it, they’ll get excited about it. That means more hApps in the world, which means more hAppy users whose power over their online lives just got a bit stronger.</p><p>(Keen eyes will notice that this video has been around for a while. It was actually an unlisted video in my personal YouTube account, but people seemed to love it so much — even non-devs — that we decided it’s good enough to put on the website for now. Expect shorter, more accessible explainer videos in the coming months.)</p> What’s happening in developer land? <p>I know I haven’t shared a lot of updates on Holochain and Holo development lately. That’s partly been because of more important content, and partly because it’s mostly been a continuation of the same work I reported last time. Here’s what’s fresh:</p>  The new proxy server is finished, support has been integrated into Holochain, and we’ve moved it into QA testing on HoloPorts.  Gossip is getting some performance tuning to reduce load on the proxy server and make data propagate through the network more quickly.  The core dev team are changing various components:  Updated versions of low-level libraries (1.x releases of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio">tokio</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmer">wasmer</a>)  Replacing the LMDB database engine with SQLite  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/">DeepKey has been ported to Holochain RSM!</a> Its complex data integrity rules have prompted productive discussions about validation, particularly the developer usability of validation callbacks.  Holochain finally runs on the HoloPort Nano! We’ve been able to compile it for a while, but it crashed on hApp startup. The Holo team did some experiments with wasmer 1.x and a different WASM-to-bytecode compiler, and they’re now demoing Elemental Chat on a Nano test unit. Once Holochain has officially upgraded to wasmer 1.x we’ll have regular OS builds for the Nano, and we’ll begin testing it along with the two larger HoloPorts. (If the hardware is ready before the software, we’ll ship the hardware first and the auto-updater will take care of the software when it’s ready.)  If you’re using the admin API, there are <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/pull/66">breaking changes coming to the app installation calls</a>.  <p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@birdiemcfly?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Benoit Beaumatin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rabbit-hole?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>While 2020 was mostly focused on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, another catastrophe accelerated at an unprecedented rate — the climate crisis. From biodiversity loss and plastic pollution to deforestation and food insecurity, the events of last year only exacerbated <a href="https://earth.org/the-biggest-environmental-problems-of-our-lifetime/">the ever growing environmental issues</a> that we face. It is easy to push issues to the side when you can’t see the immediate impacts, but the climate crisis is showing itself now more than ever, often in the form of devastating environmental events. Just this past February, the <a href="https://earth.org/climate-change-is-driving-a-deep-freeze-into-texas/">freezing temperatures in Texas</a> served as a sobering example of how climate change and global warming are currently impacting us and will continue to increase the <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/extreme-weather-and-climate-change/">intensity and frequency of extreme weather&nbsp;events</a>.</p><p>Individual behavioural change is an important way to reduce our impact on the planet, but <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90290795/focusing-on-how-individuals-can-stop-climate-change-is-very-convenient-for-corporations">those who will have the greatest impact are industry and large corporations</a>. A <a href="https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240">report</a> from CDP found that “100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988” and that just “25 corporations and state-owned entities were responsible for more than half of global industrial emissions in that same&nbsp;period.”</p><blockquote>“100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since&nbsp;1988”</blockquote><p>If we want to have any chance of fighting climate change, large corporations and industry leaders need to clean up their act and create a sustainable path forward. One way to do this is through better understanding their supply chain processes and ensuring their practices do not have negative impacts on the planet. Supply chain transparency and traceability will not only allow companies to better understand their processes and work to make them more sustainable, but it will also allow them to share what they are doing with their customers, without <a href="https://medium.com/disruptive-design/what-is-greenwashing-how-to-spot-it-and-stop-it-c44f3d130d5">greenwashing</a>.</p><p>At Peer Ledger, we support companies on their journey toward greater supply chain transparency. Our <a href="https://peerledger.com/supply-chain">MIMOSI Connect </a>platform is an invaluable tool to help companies map and monitor their supply chains to ensure they are working in line with their values and brand promises. We believe that with responsible action and greater supply chain traceability, companies will step up to the plate to create a brighter and more sustainable future for everyone.</p> References   Earth.org (September, 2020), The Biggest Environmental Problems Of 2020.

 Shiv Malik, CEO of Pool Foundation, on Data Unions and the value they bring to the Data&nbsp;Economy <p>In the twelfth episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we had a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/shivmalik?s=20">Shiv Malik</a>, CEO at Pool Foundation and former Head of Growth for Streamr where he evangelized about a new decentralized data economy. During this discussion, he tells us how Data Unions work, its real-life use cases, and legislative regulations supporting the Data Union model. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>Note: The episode was recorded on April 9, 2021 — when Shiv was working with&nbsp;Streamr.</p> What are Data Unions, and how do they&nbsp;work? <p>As individuals, we all produce information in the form of data, and only a few people are harvesting and profiting from it. There is no way for ordinary people who are producing the value to retain any of that value themselves. Hence, a Data Union is a way of pooling data between various parties and monetizing it as a collective.</p><p>However, you still need an organization in the middle because this model involves reaching out to data buyers. You need to pick up a phone and speak to people — and machines can’t do that yet. Lots of people have fleshed this out academically but no one’s really done it practically. When you try and do it in practice, there are some really big stumbling blocks.</p><p>A <a href="https://streamr.network/discover/data-unions">Data Union</a> framework provides a way to bundle a user’s real-time data together with others’ and distribute a share of the revenue when someone pays to access it. On its own, a person’s data does not hold much value, but when combined in a data union, it can aggregate into an attractive product for buyers to extract insights. This is <a href="https://medium.com/streamrblog/community-products-crowdselling-big-data-iot-blockchain-streamr-fbaa794c7bc9">crowdselling</a>, and has the potential to generate unique data sets by incentivizing individuals to trade previously unavailable data.</p> Data Unions as a revenue source to&nbsp;IoTs <p>Our smartphones are powerful devices that are collecting information through internal sensors. All you have to do is create an app that collects a specific data set — and then you can imagine there’s a monetary incentive for people to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Why do we only have one map application (Google) or maybe two — and they’re owned by the same company? The reason for this is because they have a monopoly on our location and we create that monopoly by sharing our data freely — or rather we don’t have a choice. “I would like other options — but viable ones. If you take the raw data sets away from them (devices), anyone can build applications on top of the raw datasets. That’s the world we want to live in,” says&nbsp;Shiv.</p> The problems with data sets and structures <p>Expanding on the inherent issues with the data collected from mobile devices via sensors, Shiv comments, “From the data buyers’ perspective, this is terrible data too. Why do you want to collect data under the table spying on your users that you’ve buried the consent on page 70 of a contract that no one’s read? You get data just as a byproduct now of our digital lives when actually you really wanted to be the product. That is the problem Data Unions solve — if you want to create good data products, get people to create the data who actually want to be part of this and are happy to do it. It creates better data products — more rich, stable, interesting, and sustainable.”</p><p>Another problem is that data brokers go bust all the time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica</a> is the most famous. Recently, there was Jumpshot, a subsidiary of the antivirus giant Avast, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdkq7/avast-antivirus-sells-user-browsing-data-investigation">which went under last year</a>, Vice reports. The company had $30M USD in revenue, projected to reach $70M USD with 400 employees. Vice mentioned, “An antivirus program used by hundreds of millions of people around the world is selling highly sensitive web browsing data to many of the world’s biggest companies, a joint investigation by Motherboard and PCMag has found. Our report relies on leaked user data, contracts, and other company documents that show the sale of this data is both highly sensitive and is in many cases supposed to remain confidential between the company selling the data and the clients purchasing it.”</p> Which parts of the world are more receptive to Data&nbsp;Unions? <p>In theory, every government should be pro Data Unions because they provide two benefits. One, it’s clearly giving a monetary value to ordinary people and returning it to ordinary people — as opposed to companies that are usually outside of their own country. If you’re in any way a democratic or populist government — that sounds nice. Second, it also opens up innovation, and it’s actually good for business.</p><p>You can also see rights to data portability already starting to take off in Europe. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/risk/deloitte-uk-risk-gdpr-six-months-on.pdf">According to a report by Deloitte</a>:</p>  76% of respondents are aware of the right to data portability.  9% revealed to have already submitted portability requests.  23% haven’t heard of the&nbsp;right.  24% stated that they have no intention to use&nbsp;it.  <p>Interestingly, 81% of respondents from EU countries are aware of the right to data portability.</p>  The Netherlands and France lead the way in terms of awareness, both at&nbsp;83%.  <p>Only 68% of respondents in non‑EU countries were showing awareness of this particular right.</p>  Australia and Canada recorded the lowest awareness; 60% and 62% respectively. This could be attributed to it being the only new data right that consumers have, and therefore less practiced before&nbsp;now.  <p>“Where Europe leads, I think other countries will follow, especially with respect to GDPR. We are getting good noises from the US, and I believe the UK will try and catch up because of political reasons. India, too, has a natural resonance to this kind of model because of grassroots cooperativism. It’s built into the country’s economic history in the last 100 years and it’s also a democratic country. I don’t know where China will go with&nbsp;them.”</p> Can Data Unions be acquired? Can we choose to whom we sell our&nbsp;data? <p>At the moment, we don’t have a technological way of signaling the member preferences of a Data Union. But it’s not that difficult to build that in, according to Shiv. In an ideal situation, people could say at the beginning: these are the kinds of organizations I’m interested in selling to. You could also trust a data cooperative that you believe in to make these decisions for you. A recent EU scheme is based on this fiduciary model. It says if you are a data cooperative, you have to have a legal duty of care to your members. In November last year, the European Commission released the draft of the <a href="https://medium.com/streamrblog/upcoming-european-data-governance-act-to-challenge-big-techs-dominance-over-personal-data-8a3b52d0e83d">Data Governance Act</a> which sets out a licensing and regulatory framework for data unions — or data intermediaries as they call them — which will give this nascent sector a huge boost in terms of funding, trust, stability, and assurance and advertising a direction of travel to the world. They have also announced that €2bn in funding will be made available for those seeking out to build enabling software and Data Union projects.</p><p>We are not there yet, but at some point, you will say “I only want to sell data to charities and university researchers.” This will put you in a different bucket of data, and only those buckets will be able to be bought by certain types of&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>Shiv says that if one day Google decides to buy Data Unions, that is a problem. “Obviously, that haunts a lot of people but certainly haunted me. I would love to see that you can’t force Data Union operators who come along as entrepreneurs to be cooperatives. But I would like a federation of cooperatives. If that doesn’t work, then with the fiduciary aspect of that legal duty of care — it will probably make it really difficult for Google to purchase data&nbsp;sets.”</p><p>He adds, “The token model also helps because the whole point of tokens really is that you can disassociate equity and ownership of an underlying capital asset from utility and value. And if you can do that, you can turn revenues to people and then not have to sell out your equity to anyone that also helps with the cooperative stuff. But it is difficult. All of this stuff is stuff that we need to think about. And I know why that keeps me up at&nbsp;night.”</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast: <p>2:10–5:25: Shiv’s journey from investigative data journalism to Data Privacy and Data Unions evangelist</p><p>5:25–10:59: What are Data Unions and how do they work?

				 <p>Ce phénomène induit par conséquent une croissance considérable des risques de piratage. Selon une étude menée par OWASP, l’une des failles de sécurité les plus importantes aujourd’hui (classée en deuxième position) est la mauvaise sécurisation des accès administrateurs et utilisateurs.</p>
<p>En parallèle et grâce à PT Security, on sait aujourd’hui que les hackers peuvent prendre le contrôle de 9 sites sur 10 analysés en passant pas les accès utilisateurs, et peut-être que le vôtre en fait partie.</p>
<p>L’objectif de ce Webinar est tout d’abord de vous faire prendre conscience des risques encourus à cause de quelques maladresses, et de vous montrer comment sécuriser simplement votre accès administrateurs afin de garder une longueur-d’avance sur les cyber-attaquants.</p>

 Runtime Upgrades — An Experience Report <p>Runtime upgrades are an essential feature of Substrate; perhaps even the most important feature. But at the same time, they are a feature that is easy to avoid using if your project hasn’t launched the main network or a persistent test network yet, as it is tempting to simply reset the network and start with block #0 after each update or release. However, it is essential to gain experience with runtime upgrades. After all, it’s the only way to introduce features to a live and persistent Substrate-based blockchain!</p><p>At KILT, we published a new release a few weeks ago and at the same time we did the first runtime upgrade of our test network (Mashnet). In this article we want to share our experience and solutions to problems we encountered during our runtime&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>The first thing we noticed was that it’s easier to do multiple smaller runtime upgrades than one big one, as a) it is easier to debug if only small parts of code change, and, b) Substrate removes some storage migrations after a while. Therefore it’s sometimes easier to update multiple times with smaller version increments rather than jumping to the newest version with one upgrade. Each of those smaller updates had their own challenges, which we will address individually here.</p> 1. Introducing the Session&nbsp;Pallet <p>The first upgrade we did was adding the session pallet to our runtime. We started, like most projects do, from the Substrate node template. In the template the authorities for Aura and GRANDPA are hardcoded into the genesis block and cannot be changed. Also the session keys for Aura/GRANDPA are not associated with blockchain accounts, which e.g. can hold tokens. The session pallet makes it possible to associate an author with a block. Each author can set their session keys that should be used for the next sessions. This is the very foundation of Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) because it connects the validator node to a blockchain account, which is necessary to pay out rewards. It also manages who is in the validator set for a specific&nbsp;session.</p><p>Adding a pallet is straightforward. Simply add it to the construct_runtime macro. At least, that’s what we thought! But the session pallet requires a genesis configuration. Since we add the pallet later, this configuration will never get executed! The session pallet won’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>To fix this, we had to execute the genesis config during the runtime upgrade, which is, again, easier said than done. The storage of the session pallet is private and can only be accessed from within the session pallet. There is no way around this but to fork the session pallet. We decided for a quick and dirty copy &amp; paste solution. We simply copied the session pallet into our project and made the storage public. Afterwards we could just copy the genesis configuration code and execute it <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/blob/23f3a363962b111796f6bda2051f4f508ecccee7/runtime/src/lib.rs#L422-L526">during the runtime upgrade</a>. Later, we removed our local copy of the pallet and replaced it with the official version. We just needed to make sure that both versions use the same pallet&nbsp;index.</p><p>DISCLAIMER: Don’t look too closely at the code! We used the current authorities to collect the session keys, which is not recommended. In a main network the runtime upgrade would probably introduce new session keys. The main problem with our approach is that the account and session keys have the same seed, which is also not recommended.</p> 2. Updating Substrate <p>Our next struggle was with updating the Substrate dependencies. First we wanted to have a list of what exactly changed between the Substrate version we were using and the version that we wanted to update to. Since we were not on a released version like 2.0.0 but a specific commit, it wasn’t that easy to get a list of changes. Especially because we were mostly interested in how the storage changed. In the end, we found you only need to execute upgrade logic if the storage&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Ultimately, we found a <a href="https://github.com/apopiak/substrate-migrations">list of storage migrations</a> done in Substrate which helped us a&nbsp;lot.</p><p>After we updated the Substrate dependencies we noticed that this was actually the easiest migration, since Substrate executed the migration automatically. But be aware that migrations might get removed after a while. If you do a too big jump with your Substrate version you might not be as&nbsp;lucky.</p> 3. Removing&nbsp;Pallets <p>Sometimes you need to remove a pallet. This sounds like an easy task and it’s tempting to just remove the module from the construct_runtime! macro. But there are several traps to fall into! First of all the order and index of modules in construct_runtime! are important. If you remove a pallet, all the following pallets will have a different index. So it’s a good idea to give all your pallets a fixed index. The second trap you could walk in to is to forget to clean up the storage that the pallet used. Removing all the storage of a pallet can be done in multiple ways. We did it using <a href="https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v3.0.0/frame_support/storage/unhashed/fn.kill_prefix.html">kill_prefix</a>(two_x128(b”Module_prefix”).</p> Troubleshooting and Miscellaneous <p>You might stumble across multiple different problems while writing your runtime migrations. Here are two things we would have liked to remember before we tested our runtime migrations.</p> Polkadot JS&nbsp;Types <p>Remember that the custom types in the Polkadot apps are most likely outdated after you executed your runtime upgrades. Also make sure to not only adjust for your own updated types, but also for those changed by Substrate.</p> Update All of the&nbsp;Node <p>After our runtime upgrades went through we had problems submitting transactions to our node. At first we thought that we had made a mistake during the update, but after we started the node with the new executable those issues were fixed. The problem was that we not only needed to update the Runtime-WASM, but we also needed to update the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/architecture">rest of the&nbsp;client</a>.</p>

<p>BTCNewz: A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange on GPS Pay lets users convert Ardor and Ignis tokens without going through a centralized platform. The app also features a decentralized NFT market, which lets users buy and sell virtual land on the Triffic Map. The Triffic Map is an augmented reality game where players hold virtual titles to real world land. The map of the world has been divided into hexagons of 62,500 sqm, equivalent to a square with a 250m side. Players can lease or buy these plots of virtual land and receive revenue from Beacons located in that territory. Ownership of the territory is denoted by a special NFT issued on the Ardor-based GPS Token blockchain, a full child of the Ardor chain.</p>

			<p>In the previous article, we have defined<a href="https://tokeny.com/whats-the-purpose-of-a-digital-asset-marketplace/"> the purpose and the stakeholders in the ecosystem of a digital asset marketplace (DAM)</a>. Now, we will look at the three main services that DAM Operators can implement and offer to investors and issuers in the primary market.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 1. Digital Distribution and Placement 
<p>The main value proposition of the marketplace is to bring Investors to the Issuer. Through the use of a digital platform, the Issuer is able to facilitate this and can deliver these investment opportunities to its user base.</p>
<p>Once the Issuer’s offering is created, the project is displayed to the relevant users in the marketplace. The digital platform must help Investors to discover the offering, assess the opportunity, and invest if they are eligible and interested. The Issuer receives subscription requests and it’s their responsibility to approve or reject them. In order to make it manageable, the DAM must propose a complete administration panel where the Issuer can easily view potential Investors and approve or reject them based on their validity.</p>
<p>The marketplace Operator may also be able to provide some management services and act as an agent for the Issuers. They will therefore verify the applicants of the offering to review their appropriateness in connection with the financial product. The payment of these orders need to be verified as well: even if payments are automatically reconciled, a paying agent must review them and potentially change exchange rates, proceed adjustments, refunds and capital calls. Finally, the Operator can propose direct support to Investors if appointed by the Issuer to do so. The marketplace should therefore provide communication tools between the Issuers and its potential Investors.</p>

			 2. Onboarding of Investors 
<p>Issuers must collect a set of information and documentation from their investors in order to comply with legal obligations. At any point of time, they are supposed to know who their investors are and ensure that only eligible Investors hold their securities. Numerous regulations about the identification of Investor KYC and AML must be applied.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, the onboarding of investors is very manual and several intermediaries need to share personal information of the Investors as none of them works on the same IT system. Collaboration is complicated, especially with sensitive information. Online platforms can digitize this onboarding process. We saw the power of digital onboarding with the rise of Neobanks: They were able to get thousands of new clients by verifying their identities and creating accounts directly from smartphones. The rise of efficient digital KYC services aided this onboarding method. Today, onboarding solutions exist and can help Issuers or digital platforms scale their user base rapidly and drastically reduce their costs.</p>
<p>In order to deal with private securities, a DAM must verify the identity of its users, and propose to its Issuers that they can rely on these verifications. The DAM can provide the online onboarding interface, with its branding, managing different workflows depending on the type of Investors (individuals, corporate), their status (accredited, qualified, retail, etc.), and their jurisdiction. In this onboarding process, Investors fill in their information and upload their supporting documents to the platform. After this, verifications are performed to generate a risk score allowing the Issuer to decide if an Investor is a suitable owner for its securities.</p>

			 3. Issuance and Allocation of The Security Tokens 
<p>In order to fully access the private markets infrastructure, the securities must be represented on the blockchain network chosen by the Issuer and/or the marketplace. This representation is performed by the deployment of several smart contracts and the generation of tokens (digital keys issued on the blockchain thanks to the smart contracts).</p>
<p>As it could be complex for Issuers to issue digital securities, and because the purpose of a marketplace is to provide the IT and regulatory framework to its users, the marketplace must provide the needed tools and services to create the security tokens.</p>
<p>More precisely, the marketplace must use, or impose to its users, a reliable and proven security token protocol. The DAM proposes fully-managed services or self-services to Issuers in order to deploy the needed smart contracts and allocate security tokens to investors.</p>

		 
	 
    Security token issuance tools for issuers            
	 
		 
			 Issuers must receive the following: 

		 
	 
      Token smart contracts  <p>These are the smart contracts that represent the Issuer’s securities.</p>
           Permission functions to appoint Agents  <p>This allows the Issuer to assign a role to the agent so they can carry out administrative operations.</p>
           Token functions  <p>This enables the Issuer to control the supply, transferability of tokens and the other required specifications.</p>
           Batch functions  <p>Gas fees can add up if functions are processed on an Investor by Investor basis, batch functions reduce these fees.</p>
           Compliance smart contracts  <p>These smart contracts enable the Issuer to enforce the rules of the offering.</p>
           On-chain whitelist of investors  <p>Issuers can validate transfers and identities on-chain, creating an immutable register of token holders.</p>
           Complete allocation to the initial list of investors  <p>Enables Issuers to digitize an existing cap table, or to allocate tokens to new Investors.</p>
           Access to its cap table  <p>Digitally manage cap tables and benefit from automatic updates.</p>

Moons are the undeveloped wild outback of Urbit, with a story waiting to be told
that promises to be as enormous in scale as the cloud personal computing story
told by planets, and possibly even more so.</p>
<p>Throughout this piece, we use "Earth" and "Mars" in the Urbit sense. "Earth"
refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">current computing
paradigm</a>. "Mars" refers to the
perfected computing paradigm that Urbit aspires to be, but also to the current
and future state of Urbit.</p>
<p>Today we will review the prehistory of moons on Earth, give a snapshot of how
moons are being utilized on Urbit in 2021, cover existing issues with consumer
IoT and how Urbit resolves them, and speculate what the lunar locus of the Urbit
ID address space may become in the future. To keep the futurist scope limited,
we primarily speculate on the usage of moons in (industrial) internet of things
settings, especially with respect to agriculture, and how they may manifest as
the workhorse collection unit of decentralized data markets.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, moons differ from all other
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ships</a> in that they are not independent identities
with total sovereignty over their data and keys. Instead, their cryptographic
keys are issued and controlled by their parent identity. The relationship
between the keys of a parent ship and its moons are analogous to the
relationship between primary keys and subkeys in a system like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>. The parent may revoke
or change its child moons' keys at any time. A typical relationship between a
planet and a moon may be like one of a human and their smartphone. If you lose
your phone, you don't want someone to pretend they are you, operating one of
your moons, on the network. The planet can revoke the keys, and the moon stored
on the phone becomes inert, no longer able to communicate with the network.
While planets and stars also depend on their sponsor to assist with peer
discovery and software updates, these relationships rely on mutual agreement,
since either party may choose to discontinue the relationship and establish a
new one elsewhere. Moons possess no such freedom.</p>
 Lunar prehistory 
<p></p>
<p>It may come as a surprise to you that you are already very familiar with moon
identities—they've just never been explained as such because the context in
which that terminology makes sense didn't exist before Urbit. Moons, in fact, are not
a new concept at all. Virtually your entire experience of the internet in the
modern era is the experience of someone who possesses some number of moons
subordinate to planets who mostly refuse to talk to one another. The feeling you
get of constantly moving between silos, juggling accounts, not controlling your
own data, etc., is a direct result of the fact that, on Earth, you only possess
moons. No planets.</p>
<p>We're speaking, of course, of the client-server relationship. From the Urbit
perspective, the Facebooks, Twitters, and Googles of the world are planets, and
accounts held with these services may be thought of as moons subordinate to
those planets. Your account with these megacorps is only yours for as long as
they please. If you happen to step on a digital landmine, such as a virus that
causes Google's servers to believe you are a bot, you are suddenly banned from
their service, often with no recourse. All your data, your connections, your
network—vanished. We are all Mark Zuckerberg's moons, and they're armed to the
teeth with surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>There are two classes of internet users: those with servers who hold all the
power, and clients who use those servers in the way prescribed by the owners.
Running a server is theoretically accessible to anyone, but practically
difficult: server maintenance is a technical endeavor that requires specialized
knowledge and substantial time investment. Other barriers exist beyond just the
technical: for instance, if you wish to set up your own email server, you will
probably be blocked by large providers because unknown email servers are almost
always spam. The root cause of this circumstance is that the email protocol
lacks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil resistance</a>. Urbit has
Sybil resistance built in, eliminating certain kinds of incentives for
gatekeeping such as this.</p>
<p>We seek to level the playing field by giving everyone a server. We accomplish
this by making the process of running your own server (planet) as easy as
running your personal computer today. We aren't quite there yet, but we've made
leaps and bounds over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Of course, this analogy isn't perfect—Urbit moons are servers themselves, but as
they may only act in accordance with the wishes of its parent, they are
effectively as locked in degrees of freedom as a client is to a server. The
moon's keys may be revoked at any time by the parent. To distinguish these
prehistoric moons from Urbit moons, we will refer to them later as "primitive
moons".</p>
<p>Urbit contends that moons are not the appropriate digital exocortex for a
responsible adult. They are for devices, experiments, or your children. We hope
that the dominant server-client relationship, which is the primary weapon of the
surveillance-industrial complex, will meet its end in the near future.</p>
 Moons in the early Martian era 
<p></p>
<p>In 2021, moons are mostly unused on Urbit. There's a smattering of minor use
cases which we'll describe here, but they represent only a tiny fraction of
their ultimate potential.</p>
<p>Tlon recently launched a survey bot called <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/eliza/">Eliza</a>, which was
initially a comet. We frequently got questions on whether Eliza was actually
Tlon's bot, because it could just as easily be a malicious actor posing as Tlon.
We soon plan to relaunch Eliza as a moon of <code>~zod</code>, which is the most
recognizable official galaxy of Tlon. This is to establish that the bot is
indeed official; only someone with access to <code>~zod</code> is capable of creating a
moon of <code>~zod</code>, and so a moon of <code>~zod</code> automatically carries with it a
cryptographic guarantee that you are communicating with an official digital
representative of Tlon. On Earth something like this would need to be
accomplished with certificate chains but, on Mars, this sort of authentication
is baked into the very fabric of the network, rather than as an additional layer
on top. This is a very good representative case of how moons naturally inherit
the reputation of their parent, even in the absence of any formal reputation
systems on Urbit.</p>
<p>We see folks using moons as backup identities in case they can't or don't want
to access their primary planet for one reason or another. Again, since anyone
may verify the parent of a moon, the moon inherits the reputation of its parent.
These backups could be vanity identities—for instance, every <code>~sampel-palnet</code>
has underneath it a moon named <code>~master-sampel-palnet</code><a>1</a>.</p>
<p>Some use moons to host group(s). Hosting a group inevitably means that that ship
will process more network traffic, and a heavily trafficked group may impact a
ship's performance. Thus one may wish to offload group hosting duties to a moon
to maintain a more performant planet.</p>
<p>As we currently lack a real system for 3rd party software distribution (though
see this recent <a href="https://youtu.be/XwICC6Its1E">developer call</a> on a solution in
progress), one stopgap has been to download software by syncing a foreign
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/desk/">desk</a> to your ship. This is risky, as buggy software
may make break your ship and make it difficult to get running properly again.
For this reason, testing new software on the livenet is frequently performed on
moons, so as not to risk the parent ship if something were to go wrong.</p>
 Internet of Things 
<p></p>
<p>Now we start to look towards the future by examining the problems faced by IoT
in the present and speculating on how Urbit might solve them.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things is much maligned by technologists as a privacy, security,
and maintenance nightmare. These products usually depend on phoning home to
perform their service, which is inevitably a funnel by which personal data is
harvested, an attack surface for hackers to gain access to your home network,
and a single point of failure which may render the device useless, all in one!
One need look no further than the recent <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/">Ubiquiti
breach</a>
to see all of these failure modes happening on a massive scale, and this is par
for the course. This sort of dynamic is completely antithetical to the Urbit
philosophy, so any involvement of Urbit with IoT will reject many fundamental
assumptions on how IoT operates today.</p>
<p>However, it's important to understand why the current IoT model works like this
at all. We posit that it ultimately stems from the fact that today's IoT
products are primitive moons for which you do not operate the parent planet.
Almost every IoT device operates in the Software as a Service (SaaS) paradigm
because most people don't have personal servers that could do all the processing
work actually necessary for an IoT device to operate. This is not the only
reason for this—it's also just more profitable to collect consumer data.
However, it's the SaaS aspects which make the whole thing such a catastrophic
mess.</p>
<p>Imagine a different world: if the server that your device reports to is your
own, there is no loss of control over personal data. If the device only
communicates on the local network, it will prevent remote hackers and disruption
if you internet fails. And if the manufacturer goes out of business, the device
will still work-it is not dependent on the manufacturer's servers.</p>
<p>The wants and needs of the individual are at odds with the wants and needs of
the megacorp, and that mismatch manifests as the antifeatures that plague IoT.
By eliminating the SaaS aspect, Urbit solves many of the largest outstanding
issues with IoT in a single blow. Digital personal AI assistants have long been
an anticipated science fiction prediction and their full realization is on the
horizon. But in their current manifestation, many privacy- and
security-conscious people would never consider using them at all, since they are
inevitably presented as SaaS that requires intimate knowledge of your devices
and their stored data. Recommendation engines such as the one used by YouTube
offer helpful guidance towards content you'll find appealing, but they're also
designed to keep you hooked to the service. These kinds of programs can be
useful, but they're dystopian when they come saddled with anti-consumer
subroutines. Since your Urbit belongs to you, it can never act against your own
interests without your consent. In our lunar vision, your digital personal AI
assistant will live on one of your moons, rather than on megacorp's cloud.</p>
<p>For web-exposed devices, Urbit offers the same security guarantees that it
offers for your personal computer: everything is end-to-end encrypted by
default, and signed with keys that one can easily verify as belonging to the
node sending the message.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a> has outlined the case for a
system like Urbit ID for IoT use
<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/12/232883-self-authenticating-identifiers/fulltext">here</a>.
In brief, that the Urbit ID system allows one to match public keys with devices,
bestowing devices with self-authenticating identities. This allows one to trust
the communications received from the device to whatever degree the private key
is held secure. IP addresses, GPS coordinates, MAC addresses, etc., are not
sufficient to generate high levels of trust—they're all temporary, easily
spoofed, or both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might imagine applying this to the Internet of Things (IOT) in which the
IOT device self-generates a public- and private-key pair and registers the
public key. For example, with a hub or controller so the hub can confirm it
has reached the right IOT device. By the same token, configuration of the IOT
device into an ensemble could include incorporation of the public key of the
controller into a list of valid devices that can command or obtain data from
the now-configured IOT device. Both ends can verify they are talking to the
originally configured devices, assuming no device has lost its private key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the hub or controller referred to would be your planet.</p>
<p>Urbit has many other features that make it well-suited for IoT, above and beyond
eliminating the SaaS model and providing self-authenticating identities. Many of
these additional advantages derive from the fact that Urbit is a <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/overview/#solid-state-interpreter">solid state
interpreter</a> and that
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ames/">Ames</a> is a network of solid-state interpreters
equipped with cryptographic identity. We explore this in the next section.</p>
 Future lunar cosmotechnics 
<p></p>
<p>We now polish off the old crystal ball and imagine future uses of Martian lunar
technology. Particularly, how the tech may develop over time once it becomes
widely exposed to the evolution-inducing forces of industry and culture. This
section is pure speculation, and I only aim to offer a small glimpse of a
potential future, rather than an exhaustive one. This picture will necessarily
be biased by my personal proclivities and expertise, or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Any discussion on the future of moons is incomplete without mentioning the
possibility of <a href="https://urbit.org/faq/#more-planets">lunar emancipation</a> in
order to increase the number of planets. This fascinating topic sees regular
discussion in the Urbit Community group, but is outside the scope of this
article.</p>
<p>In order to respect the reader's time, I'm narrowing our scope to a particular
topic: the agriculture industry. I'm also assuming a future with specialized and
increasingly small hardware to run Urbit. Right now, a 4 GB Raspberry Pi is the
standard for "small Urbit". If someday there are CPUs specifically designed for
running <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/nock/">Nock</a>, one could imagine going much smaller.
Ultimately, I'm going to assume that there will someday be <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/iot/#ssi">solid-state
interpreter</a> microcontrollers - so the inclusion of Urbit on a device may
require nothing more than a couple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology">surface-mount
devices</a> on a larger
chip.</p>
<p>Urbit is intended first and foremost as a personal computer. When I unravel its
potential usage in industry, I adopt the forecast of a drastic increase in the
manufacturing capacity for individuals and small groups. Agriculture is a great
microcosm of this long-standing trend; less human input is needed to produce the
same amount of food, whether it be crops or livestock. The modern era is
distinguished by the fact that small numbers of people can manage enormous farms
which produce food for vast populations. Thus, computation on modern automated
farms may be thought of as existing at the intersection of both personal and
industrial scale, and show how computerized and mechanized workflows add to the
amazing productivity of modern farms and demonstrate that individual-sized
inputs are able to create industrial-sized outputs. I predict that the set of
trades for which this dynamic holds will only increase over time.</p>
<p>Agricultural automation has been a primary engine for the growth of
civilization, but it has been hampered by the downsides of IoT elaborated in the
previous section. One bellwether of this dynamic is the right to repair one's
own equipment. <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2020/03/its-payback-time-right-to-repair-movement-targets-john-deere/">John
Deere</a>
has long been at the center of this controversy. Farmers have lost the ability
to repair their own equipment due to vendor locks and a dependency on remote
servers. Furthermore, any suite of sensor products designed to gather important
data such as genomics, hydrology, soil health, weather, etc., inevitably only
cooperate with other products by the same vendor. It's the same story all over
again—you are a client of a megacorp server. Or in Urbit terms, you have a bunch
of primitive moons belonging to different planets held by megacorps, and no
planet to call your own.</p>
<p>Again, Urbit resolves these issues in the same fashion as above. One might argue
that using Urbit is another form of vendor lock-in—but this is evaluating Urbit
at the incorrect level. Since Urbit is an open source operating system, its
functionality may be extended and modified arbitrarily by any party. Some
computational infrastructure is necessary— that fact can never be escaped. But
you can escape from closed source software that does not permit you to modify,
to open source software that allows you to tinker at will. Thus we do not
consider open source software to be a form of lock-in, or at least, it's a much
milder form of lock-in compared to something like Apple's walled garden.</p>
<p>So let us focus on the additional meritorious aspects of Urbit (or more
generally, solid state interpreter networks) that make it not merely a band-aid
to the broken IoT system but a permanent and sound replacement.</p>
 Solid state interpreter networks 
<p></p>
<p>Urbit is the world's first solid-state interpreter (SSI). This concept is
summarized in the <a href="https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf">white paper</a> as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine it as a chip. Plug this chip into power and network; packets go in and
out, sometimes changing its state. The chip never loses data and has no
concept of a reboot; every packet is an ACID transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly, an SSI is an interpreter which is also a database. In more depth, an
SSI combines three properties: uniform persistence, source independent packet
networking, and high-level determinism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not wish to segue into a lengthy examination of what this really means—
that's what the white paper is for—but we will attempt to explain why these
properties are of great benefit in an industrial IoT context such as
agriculture. We'd also like to predict that Urbit will not be the only SSI.
Other sorts of SSI's specialized to various tasks may one day roam the planet,
and these may be better suited for particular IoT tasks than
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Arvo</a>. However, this article will be couched in terms
of SSIs communicating with an <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ames/">Ames</a>-like networking
protocol and Urbit ID-style cryptographic identity, rather than Urbit in
particular.</p>
<p>For a SSI, losing power is less of a catastrophic event than it is for ordinary
computers with volatile memory. Knowing that you can never lose any state is a
powerful guarantee on the integrity of your data. Loss of power will always mean
loss of any data potentially collected while power is down, regardless of the
device you use, but with a SSI you at least have assurance that you will never
lose data that was collected before it could be transferred from the cache to
the disk. Of course, this is actually the sort of guarantee that <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/overview/#acid-database">ACID
transactions</a> have—it is
just that this set of guarantees emerges naturally as a consequence when you
have a SSI. Put another way, every SSI is a database; having every device be a
database is a major boon in situations where enormous quantities of data are
being collected across a distributed network. The standard today is that data is
only collected at hubs, and any data that doesn't reach a hub is irretrievably
lost.</p>
<p>SSIs are also deterministic at a high level. While all computers are
deterministic at the CPU level, interruptions to power can result in an
undefined semantic state and result in the random erasure of half of its brain.
This determinism is what begets ease of maintainability of Urbit—problems
generally only need to be solved once by experts and the solution propagates to
the rest of the network via <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA updates</a>. We
addressed this maintenance issue previously—we only remark now that this
property is derived from being a SSI, rather than something particular only to
Arvo or Urbit. When one has hundreds or thousands of devices to manage, the
guarantees on ease of maintenance provided by determinism are extraordinarily
convenient.</p>
<p>Packet routing on SSI networks is source-independent, and in the context of an
Ames-like networking protocol, are always delivered exactly once and in a
precise order due to the fact that nodes on an Ames network are in a permanent
session. Source-independent means that the identity that originated a packet
does not need to be the one to deliver it—packets are facts, and the truth of
a fact does not depend on who you heard it from. This means that it is possible,
for instance, to send instructions to a moon before it even exists and be
guaranteed that that moon will receive them and perform the tasks given, even if
the device that originally sent the packets no longer exists. As long as
somebody has kept the packets on hand, they will eventually be delivered. So,
one could imagine transmitting directions to a crop harvesting robot into which
a moon will be installed before the robot has even been purchased, know that
once it is delivered it will automatically begin its task, and know that those
tasks will be completed in the correct order, without any accidental repeats.
Taken to the limit, one can imagine preplanning the automated tasks for an
entire farm before a single device is purchased, with powerful guarantees on the
integrity of those instructions no matter how much time elapses between sending
and receiving.</p>
 P2P data markets 
<p></p>
<p>As was mentioned above, today's IoT devices ferry all sorts of your personal
data to megacorp, where they package it and sell it to the highest bidder.
Though personal data in aggregate is quite valuable, the value of a single
individual's data is quite low. On the other hand, industrial scale data such as
that collected on digitized farms could be quite valuable. Here we briefly
examine how Urbit can be utilized to populate and facilitate a market for data.</p>
<p>All data collected by your moons may be digitally signed by that moon,
certifying the exact origin of that data. This is one advantage of having
cryptographic identity baked into the core of the operating system and
networking protocol. One could imagine collecting large amounts of such data and
packaging it for exchange with other local and regional farmers. This can, of
course, already be done in principle with current systems. But current systems
do not automatically come equipped with the sort of provenance, immutability,
and reputation that comes for free when you make use of SSI networks.
Manipulated or faked data becomes easier to spot, and you'll know who it came
from, so supplying such data puts one's reputation at stake.</p>
<p>One major issue facing conjoining data gathered from disparate sources is simply
how to do it. Data arriving in random order, from different software versions,
running different hardware, is all very difficult to bundle into a good
dataset - and indeed wrangling this sort of task forms a large part of the data
scientist profession. As devices in SSI networks utilizing an Ames-like protocol
are engaged in permanent sessions, leading to properties such as exactly-once
delivery and well-ordered message sequences, issues about the order in which
data arrives are dramatically simplified. I do not wish to get mathematical
here, but I personally have confidence that the emerging discipline of
<a href="http://math.mit.edu/%7Edspivak/informatics/">categorical informatics</a>, as well as
the relevance of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5505">low-dimensional topology to data
fusion</a>, resolves many of these issues. I
promise to explain this in more detail in the future. For now, it suffices to
say that SSI networks seem well-positioned to utilize these techniques.</p>
<p>Cryptographic techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">(composable) zero-knowledge
proofs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">secure multi-party
computation</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature">ring signatures</a>, and even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a>
offer a variety of ways in which data may be shared in an IoT context with
mathematical guarantees on what sort of privacy is maintained. This is perhaps
less relevant in the context of agricultural IoT, where personal private data is
largely absent, but we mention them here to invite further speculation from the
reader about the possibilities of IoT and SSI networks.</p>
<p>We end our discussion with an adaptation of a scenario borrowed from my brief
time working on <a href="http://ceptr.org/">Ceptr</a> that begins to show how a lunar
IoT-connected world evokes properties of a hypothetical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain">"global nervous
system"</a>. This example is
purposefully mundane to illustrate how deficient our Earth systems are, and
while it is possible to accomplish in theory, it is impractical on a wide scale
due to the numerous problems with IoT. Imagine that you suffer headaches from
low atmospheric pressure. You'd like to know when a low-pressure front is an
hour away from you so that you can pre-emptively take aspirin to prevent the
headache. Your personal digital assistant, running on Urbit, can then
periodically query the moons of sensors in your region for weather data to
predict whether or not you will soon be passing through a low pressure front.
This could be a free service or paid for automatically with cryptocurrency
microtransactions. On Mars, this task will be trivial, and is merely a stone's
throw away from a vast and undiscovered universe of other possibilities unlocked
by SSI networks.</p>

<p>Of course, all moon names have four words, not three. What the fourth word
needs to be for only three words to display is a matter of Urbit lore that
is more fun to discover yourself than have it told to you, so we won't spoil
it here.</p>

<p>Faster and less complex integrations</p><p>Since Dock’s mainnet launch last year and the completion of the token migration last month, Dock is now full steam ahead in growing adoption of the network. As part of this business outreach, we have developed relationships with a number of organizations and have started working on trials and proof of concepts with some of these entities. These collaborative efforts demonstrate how they can integrate with Dock and provide an insight into whether their Dock-based solution can meet their objectives, prior to producing a full commercial product.</p><p>While our open-source SDK provides access to the widest range of Dock’s features, and is supported by <a href="https://docs.dock.io/build/sdk">documentation</a> and developer <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorials.html">tutorials</a>, it can be challenging to understand and implement without prior blockchain knowledge. While some of the teams we work with are comfortable developing with blockchain, others are quite unfamiliar with some of the technical concepts behind it, but still require access to its many benefits. In Dock’s case, partners are looking to access blockchain solutions for the creation of decentralized identities and the issuance and management of verifiable credentials.</p><p>Flattening the curve</p><p>These development teams can of course spend time learning new concepts, but learning curves can be a barrier to adoption whereas fast and less complex integrations are certainly preferred by organizations. For these reasons, Dock is going to be making some of the network’s features available via an API, which is in effect a HTTP wrapper of our <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk">SDK</a>. The API will initially be available in JavaScript and developers will be able to generate their own API keys via our <a href="https://www.dock.io/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock_to_release_verifiable_credentials_api">website</a>. Furthermore, the API removes the requirement for Dock tokens to process network transactions, and payment for API usage will be made in fiat. The API will be made available in the next few weeks for trials and tiered price plans will be available at a later date once further refinements and improvements have been made. </p><p>If you’re interested in our API or working with our team on a trial, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.dock.io/contact?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock_to_release_verifiable_credentials_api">get in touch.</a></p>

This moonshot thinking requires a&nbsp;groundbreaking approach and a radically different way of dealing with data in the future – a way that establishes trust, allowing people and organisations to share data effortlessly whilst staying in control.




 




It is therefore important that policymakers and decision-makers include the right governance framework in the final version of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act">Data Governance Act</a> (DGA), the pending regulation that will set the ground rules for how we can build a strong and equitable digital economy.

 The moonshot 




Hosted by moderator Rikka Kampi of MyData Global, this webinar is an ideal chance to learn more about the role the DGA can play in the balance of power over data, the evolution of the digital economy, data sovereignty, data spaces and digital soft infrastructures. It is also your opportunity to engage in the discussion and participate in some moonshot thinking.

<p>If you thought using multi-factor authentication (MFA) would solve your password problems, it probably didn’t. In fact, most support calls are still caused by access management issues.</p>
      
<p>So what are some of the helpdesk headaches caused by password-based MFA?</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Complex Password Chaos 
      
<p>Businesses have been mandating stronger access policies, such as the enforcement of 14-character complex passwords.</p>
      
<p>For the end-user, these are an inconvenience.</p>
      
<p>For the helpdesk, complex password policies can be a nightmare.</p>
      
<p>Employees write them down, reuse them, share them, and forget them – but guess who really feels the pain? Your helpdesk and support staff. When forced to update their password, almost half of employees reuse the same password with a slight change.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 <a href="https://www.hypr.com/hypr-password-study-findings/">2019 Password Usage Study</a> 
      
<p>The rollout of complex password policies has increased strain on IT departments while causing a mess for end users.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Multiple Multi-Factor Apps = MFA Fatigue 
      
<p>Your employees have many ways to log in these days. Passwords, hardware tokens, smartphone apps, Windows Hello, SMS, Touch ID, Face ID… the list goes on. The authentication landscape has become much more complex and businesses are finding it difficult to maintain a consistent user experience.</p>
      
<p>In addition to juggling multiple passwords, employees are often forced to use different MFA apps.</p>
      
 Fragmented Identity Experiences &amp; MFA Fatigue 
      
<p>Users often complain about their login experience: the pitfalls of complex password management, a sense of reduced productivity from too many requirements, and what some call “MFA fatigue.” The inconvenience burdens users and creates operational headaches for the helpdesk and IT staff.</p>
      
<p>The need to administer multiple MFA flows requires additional training and resources. Even troubleshooting becomes more complicated. Is a user really locked out? Are they just not using the right app? </p>
      
<p>The lack of a unified approach to user login can lead to gaps in MFA adoption, fragmented user experiences, and ultimately a steady growth in helpdesk call volume.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 The Glaring Cost of Password Resets 
      
<p>Yes, the somewhat benign password reset flow is the #1 cause of support headaches. </p>
      
<p>Ask your helpdesk team what the most common request from employees is and you will hear the same answer time and again: password resets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/hypr-password-study-findings/">2019 Study on Password Usage</a> found that 57% of respondents required a password reset in their work life within the last 90 days. According to Gartner, between 20% to 50% of all helpdesk calls are for password resets.</p>
      
<p>Password resets may seem like an easy problem to solve, but the volume of requests makes them a surprisingly time-consuming—and expensive—task. Forrester Research states that the average helpdesk labor cost for a single password reset is about $70.</p>
      
<p>The process for resetting a password is by no means a quick fix. First, employees must contact the helpdesk, which then generates a support ticket. Next, they reset the password, notify the employee, and finally close the ticket.</p>
      
<p>The combination of forgotten complex passwords, MFA apps and account lockouts are a waste of admin resources – for both frustrated employees and the overwhelmed helpdesk staff who valiantly assist them.</p>
      
<p>So, what can be done to address this pain point and lighten the burden for everyone?</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 The ROI of Password-less MFA 
      
<p>If the biggest issue is forgotten passwords, why not eliminate them? No passwords means no more password resets. We’ve made it easy for you to uncover the glaring cost of password resets. Find out how in our Passwordless ROI Calculator. </p>

					  <a></a>Section 1: Pre-Launch – Intro by John Jordan, Executive Director of the Trust Over IP Foundation (April 16, 2020) <p>Darrell:&nbsp; They certainly can, and we’re starting to see that right now. John and I are both pushing forward to make sure of the interoperability; that my credit union app will work with a generic wallet, that also works with the health application. We’re helping to define these requirements. The Government of BC is a founding member of a new foundation called the Trust Over IP Foundation. We’re starting to set those standards, so that we don’t have to reinvent how to ask for credentials.</p><p>A digital wallet is really great if you can put everything in it, but if you can’t ask to see something in it, it doesn’t help me. It’s just a database. You need to have an electronic way of saying, “Could I please see that prepaid visa card?”</p><p>John, perhaps you could speak a little bit about the Trust Over IP Foundation, because that’s really what that’s all about so that we don’t all have to reinvent the wheel. We can show the patterns: here’s how you get a driver’s license, here’s how you show a corporate registration, and so on. Do you want to talk about Trust Over IP, John?</p> <a></a> Trust over IP <p>John: Sure. I also wanted to provide an example, so I’m going to share my screen here.</p><p>I want to give a coming real-world example. We’re working with the Law Society in British Columbia and the BC Court Service. The challenge there, is that, as a result of a Supreme Court ruling a year ago, bail review hearings must be held every 30 days, no matter what. They were taking too long, and it was violating the constitutional rights of folks who are being held without bail. It’s going to create extra demand on the court systems, and it requires the lawyer who is representing the defendant to have access to the audio recordings that the government holds in their systems, to do the research they need. So, they need to get access to that online if they currently don’t have it, and the government only wants to provide a lawyer with that information.</p><p>How do I prove I’m a lawyer, online? Even if I have strong digital identity systems and I know your name, it doesn’t mean you’re a lawyer. Who’s the authority on who’s a lawyer? It’s the Law Society. They have a mechanism called the Practicing Certificate in Law, which they issue to a lawyer in good standing. What if we could give the Law Society the ability to issue these things digitally? That’s what we’re working with them for.</p>  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:11:00  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:12:21        <p>Province of BC: John Jordan</p><p>They will add us this print driver to go to their member portal.</p><p>A member can log-in and request the credential, and hold it in a wallet. For me, I’m going to show right now that I have a verified person credential, but this could be my Law Society credential. In order to gain access to the new site, I simply go to the new site and say access site — I’m going to use a credential to get in.</p>  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:12:26  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:12:47        <p>Province of BC: John Jordan</p><p>I’m going to scan that code, which is requesting my lawyership-ness. Here it is, I present it, and I’m in. That’s the kind of experience we’re looking for, right?</p><p>There was no integration between the Law Society and the BC court service. That’s certainly a technical option, but what happens when the next service wants to provide access to lawyers? The Land Registry, the BC services registry, the registry in Alberta; getting access to a BC lawyer. Is every service that needs to prove a lawyer going to call up the BC Law Society and integrate with it? Not very practical. If we give the lawyers something that they can carry with them and provide evidence, and it is trusted at a technical and governance level, we’re in good shape. That’s a little preview into that.</p><p>Here’s another share. We’re not going to go into this in detail, but here’s the logo for the Trust Over IP Foundation. The job of the Trust Over IP Foundation is to facilitate the global adoption of this model.</p>  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:13:50  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:14:15        <p>Province of BC: John Jordan</p><p>We need a way for businesses to understand what’s being offered, that there’s a clear and certain pattern that’s being followed, and a way to evaluate technical and governance solutions that are being offered to them. That’s what this stack is about.</p><p>In technology, we like to organize things so that we have the ability to evaluate things, such as the components of an overall system. That’s what this diagram is getting at. It’s a bit technical, not a nice graphic design version, but it provides the ability for somebody to evaluate the different aspects of an overall solution. What’s really important here that I’m very pleased about as we bring this to the market, is that it puts governance at an equal footing to technology. That is where we’ve fallen down with respect to the Internet. We’ve relinquished control of things, because we didn’t pay attention to the fact that whoever owns the account service, actually owns the relationship. That’s a governance failure not a technical fall down.</p><p>With each of these layers illustrated, there’s an opportunity to deploy a technical solution. There’s an opportunity to govern that solution, there’s an opportunity to define what interoperability means, and in the end, enable fast ecosystems of applications and services that can interoperate. That’s the vision. We have a number of organizations that are founding this, including the government of British Columbia, MasterCard, Kiva, Large Social Enterprise Service, IBM, Evernym (which is one of the startups in this space. In addition, we have Esatus, which is a German company specializing in information security and working closely with the government and banks there. We have dozens of other organizations that were actively engaged in discussions to launch this organization on the 5th of May. I should also say that it is a Linux foundation organization, which is really important to us. They provide world class governance for open community building.</p><p>Mathieu: That’s awesome. Thanks, John.&nbsp; If people want more information on this, how could they find out? or find you?</p> &nbsp;  
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Section 2: Northern Block, Founding Member of the Trust over IP Foundation (May 5, 2020) 		 
				 
				 
				 
					 <p>Today, Northern Block and 28 other founding member organizations launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2020/05/cross-industry-coalition-advances-digital-trust-standards/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a new project hosted by the Linux Foundation to enable the trustworthy exchange and verification of data between any two parties on the Internet.</p><p>The ToIP Foundation’s mission is to provide a robust, common standard that gives people and businesses the confidence that data is coming from a trusted source, allowing them to connect, interact, and innovate at a speed and scale not possible today.</p><p>The ToIP Foundation&nbsp;is being developed with global, pan-industry support from leading organizations with sector-specific expertise. Key contributors include Accenture, Cloudocracy, Continuum Loop, CULedger, esatus AG, IBM Security, IdRamp, Kiva.org, Lumedic, Mastercard, MITRE, and the Province of British Columbia. The Linux Foundation was chosen to host the Trust over IP Foundation due to its legacy of fostering open-source collaboration and innovation for some of the largest projects in the world.</p> What Challenge Does It Answer? <p>Businesses today are struggling to protect and manage digital assets and data, especially in an increasingly complex enterprise environment that includes the Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and much more. This is compounding the already low consumer confidence in the use of personal data and is slowing innovation on opportunities like digital identity and the adoption of new services that can support our daily, hyper-connected lives.</p><p>Without a global standard for how to ensure digital trust between any two peers — just like the Internet’s TCP/IP standards ensures a network connection between any two peers — these trends are bound to continue. The ToIP Foundation will use the new W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standards to leverage interoperable digital wallets and credentials to address these challenges and enable consumers, businesses and governments to better manage risk, improve digital trust and protect all forms of identity online.</p> Which Privacy Acts Does the ToIP Stack Comply With? <p>The ToIP stack has incorporated Privacy by Design from the ground up. This means that it can be used to implement solutions compliant with all major global data protection regulations, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It can also be used to meet strict privacy and security protection regulations such as the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p> What Does the ToIP Stack Look Like? <p>The “Trust over IP Stack” combines technical interoperability with policy interoperability to create a complete digital trust architecture:</p><p>For an overview of verifiable credentials, an important part of the stack,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjbN9ulHXIU">see our explainer video on it</a>.</p><p>Trust over IP defines an Internet-scale solution for creating and maintaining trusted relationships between any two peers on the Internet: people, organizations and connected things.</p><p>The unique “dual stack” design — combining the ToIP Governance Stack for human trust and the ToIP Technology Stack for technical trust — is a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust because it combines both cryptographic trust at the machine layer and human trust at the business, legal, and social layers.</p><p>This enables the ToIP stack to address key problems experienced by every enterprise engaged in digital communications and commerce today: password fatigue, form fatigue, customer onboarding, KYC, secure messaging, data portability, business process automation, privacy management, supply chain provenance, GDPR compliance — almost everything a Chief Security Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer are looking for.</p> Has COVID Accelerated the Need for a ToIP Stack? <p>COVID-19 has become a clarion call for the need for digital credentials for many different use cases: doctors’ and nurses’ passports, immunity certificates, essential worker credentials, deep cleaning credentials. For these digital credentials to be interoperable both at a technical level and a policy level is a crystal clear example of why we need the ToIP stack.</p><p>In response to multiple calls to action within the identity community, Northern Block joined the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID Credentials Initiative</a>&nbsp;(CCI), a global movement to deploy&nbsp;Verifiable Credential&nbsp;(VC) solutions aimed at mitigating the further spread of COVID, while enabling global societies to return to&nbsp;normal&nbsp;in a controlled, measurable, and most importantly,&nbsp;privacy-preserving way.</p><p>This crisis is a perfect example of why digital trust infrastructure is needed to establish confidence at both ends of the interaction. Each party needs to be confident that the party at the other end is who they say they are in order to trust the business they will transact. If people don’t trust it, they won’t use it. That’s the measure by which new technologies succeed or fail.</p>    <p>It was a straightforward decision for Northern Block to join the ToIP Foundation as a contributor.</p><blockquote><p>Northern Block is committed to empowering the mass adoption of digital verifiable credentials, which we believe won’t be possible without robust and common standards. The launch of the ToIP Foundation is the beginning of a new chapter for any organization who has been working diligently to enhance trust in life’s experiences. We look forward to supporting increasing participation in trusted ecosystems and burgeoning innovation in consumer experiences through digital trust,”&nbsp;said Mathieu Glaude, CEO at Northern Block.</p></blockquote>    <p>You can find more information at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trustoverip.org/">www.trustoverip.org</a>&nbsp;or by following the Trust over IP Foundation on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/trustoverip">@trustoverip</a>.</p><p>Section 2 Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblockca.medium.com/northern-block-founding-member-of-the-trust-over-ip-foundation-69c82e5c2984">https://northernblockca.medium.com/northern-block-founding-member-of-the-trust-over-ip-foundation-69c82e5c2984</a></p>

<p>Public beta brings Algorithms and Compute Jobs to Ocean&nbsp;Market</p><p>Ocean is proud to release the integration of Compute-to-Data into <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.</p><p>This enables buying &amp; selling of private data, while preserving privacy.</p><p>Compute-to-Data resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It does so by providing a means to exchange data while preserving privacy by allowing the data to stay on-premise with data publishers, yet allows data consumers to run compute jobs on data — all through the Ocean Market interface.</p><p>Therefore:</p>  Data owners can monetize data while preserving privacy &amp;&nbsp;control;  Yet data buyers can create value from it with analytics jobs, AI modeling, and&nbsp;more.  <p>Data publishers approve algorithms to run on their data and then the Compute-to-Data environment orchestrates remote computation and execution on data while preserving the privacy of the data. The blockchain-based smart contracts ensure that every data publisher / AI practitioner can verify proper execution of their algorithm.</p><p>Users can benefit from this technology in a number of&nbsp;ways.</p>  Data owners can monetize their data while maintaining privacy and&nbsp;control.  Data consumers can access private data without liability of directly seeing private&nbsp;data.  AI practitioners &amp; data scientists can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models to improve research and business outcomes.  AI practitioners can also publish their own algorithms,allowing them to earn passive income every time their algorithm is downloaded or run as part of a Compute Job. They can even retain privacy of the algorithms themselves.  Businesses and entrepreneurs can quickly launch their own data marketplace for their vertical, and leverage Compute-to-Data to preserve their sellers’ privacy and support more compute &amp; AI&nbsp;flows.  <blockquote>This release makes Ocean Compute-to-Data available to be more widely used via Ocean Market, building on backend support and private enterprise frontend work that goes back almost a year. The learnings from these initial deployments all fed back into this release. We’re very excited to take another big step towards realizing our vision of data as a new asset&nbsp;class.</blockquote><blockquote>– Alex Coseru, VP of Engineering at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>This launch is a major milestone in our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2021-6875bc1f804f">2021 Product Roadmap</a>. It greatly enhances privacy protection and breadth of applicability in Ocean Market and other Ocean-powered marketplaces..</p><blockquote>We’re excited to give our first Compute-to-Data implementation in Ocean Market into the hands of our community. We invite you to try out, to explore, to stress-test, and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/new/choose">to give us feedback</a>, because the beauty of open-source is that our code and work process is public for all to see and utilize. And with key Compute-to-Data user flows now directly integrated into Ocean Market, developers can use the code as a boilerplate for their own flows or integrations.</blockquote><blockquote>– Matthias Kretschmann, Designer &amp; Developer on Ocean&nbsp;Market</blockquote> Data Sets &amp; Algorithms <p>With Compute-to-Data, data sets are not allowed to leave the premises of the data holder, and with that we’re introducing a new asset type: algorithms.</p>Visual distinction between a public algorithm and a compute data&nbsp;set.<p>Algorithms are small (or complex) scripts that are allowed to run on data sets under certain conditions within an isolated and secure environment. They can be either public or private, and just like data sets, they can have a pool or a fixed price to determine their price whenever they are used. An algorithm set to public can be downloaded for its set price, while an algorithm set to private is only available as part of a compute job without any way to download&nbsp;it.</p><p>For each data set, publishers can select the specific algorithms they permit on their data set, or simply allow all published algorithms. The implementation in Ocean Market is private by default: upon publishing a compute data set, no algorithms are allowed to run on it. This is to prevent data escape by a rogue algorithm being written in a way to extract all data from a data set. This is why the most public option of allowing all published algorithms should be handled with care&nbsp;too.</p> Check it&nbsp;out <p>Everything is live in <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> right now, in all supported networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon/Matic, Rinkeby, and&nbsp;Ropsten.</p>A compute data set with allowed algorithm on Polygon/Matic: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:76E031A63e4dAB370Ae25b1A93A997e79e084f6f">market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:76E031A63e4dAB370Ae25b1A93A997e79e084f6f</a><p>We suggest checking out the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">Ocean Market connected to Polygon/Matic</a> where you can already find some compute data sets and algorithms, and you will enjoy fast and cheap transactions.

<p>IHold: Ardor with its multi chain approach to the blockchain whereby a unique parent - child chain structure is built. The security of the entire network lies in the parent Ardor chain. Ardor is a product by Jelurida, the company that is also responsible for NXT, the first POS blockchain. NXT is so old that it was even mentioned in Ethereum’s first whitepaper as a project that conducted a very successful ICO and thus this is one of the reasons that Ethereum chose the ICO model in the first place. Jelurida has been known for quite some time as a pioneer in the crypto space.</p>

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) continues to be a top priority for many organisations throughout the world. It is one of the most important&nbsp;solutions&nbsp;to help organisations reduce the risk from cyberattacks that target their privileged accounts&nbsp;and help move passwords into the background reducing cyber fatigue. A compromised privileged account enables an attacker to move around the network undetected, download malicious payloads, stage compromised servers and cause significant financial losses to their victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost all users are now privileged users. With 80% of breaches involving the compromise of IT and business user credentials you must create a plan to reduce the risks posed by “overprivileged access” users, applications, and services.&nbsp; When users are over-privileged it only takes attackers a few easy steps to become a full domain administrator.&nbsp; We must make it more difficult that force attackers to take more risks increasing the chance of detecting them early before serious damage is done.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>One question for all organizations is how to get started. Where is the best place to begin for managing and protecting privileged access? It’s vital that you have have a solid strategy.

<p>Blockchain technologies flourished at the beginning of 2021 with the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/cryptocurrency-market-cap-tops-2-trillion-for-the-first-time.html">price of Bitcoin</a> reaching new heights and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/artists-jump-into-nfts-seeing-a-digital-bonanza-11617634274">NFTs bursting into the world spotlight</a>. And, while <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-high-gas-fee-crisis-won-t-be-solved-by-eip-1559-coin-metrics-report">Ethereum gas fees</a> continued to constrict the flow of business, new blockchains gained momentum. Civic made bold moves in Q1 by responding to these new market conditions through integration with the Solana blockchain and further developing our identity verification business offering.</p>



<p>Key milestones</p>



<p>In March, we <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210311005236/en/Civic-Announces-Integration-With-Solana-Blockchain">announced our integration</a> with the Solana blockchain, which has been unlocking new opportunities for Civic. We’re proud that Civic — <a href="https://www.identity.com/embedding-identity-into-the-blockchain-with-solana/">and our nonprofit partner, Identity.com</a> — are paving a better, more sustainable path by leveraging Solana’s blazing speed and low fees that scale as the ecosystem grows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move was prompted by soaring Ethereum transaction fees, which have blocked the mainstream adoption of DeFi and squeezed companies that depend on a functional blockchain ecosystem since last summer. With a second layer solution requiring months of development, chain-agnostic Civic has shifted resources to providing an identity gateway for the next generation of blockchain-powered products.</p>



<p>Now, with identity as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure, a safer, more sustainable financial ecosystem may develop. And, with our unique expertise in identity-based key management and recovery, Civic will help make financial tools more accessible to mainstream consumers.</p>



<p>We believe that identity will be a necessity for businesses in Solana’s ecosystem in order to comply with global regulations in the near future if DeFi is to truly scale for mainstream consumer adoption. Our new products will offer more privacy and a more secure experience for DeFi products and other application layer technologies.</p>



<p>Buzz about Civic</p>



<p>Our Solana integration announcement took center stage in the first quarter. Identity Review shared a <a href="https://identityreview.com/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain-for-defi-wallet/">thorough write-up</a>, noting that “Through this new collaboration between Solana and Civic, the fintech industry will take a step toward making financial tools more secure and more accessible to mainstream consumers.”</p>



<p>We also gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf4NbhxhfkU">company update</a> outlining the announcement and how we are interpreting the future with emerging technology. In the update, which was open to the Civic community, we had the opportunity to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/ama-vinny-lingham-solana-ceo-anatoly-yakovenko/">talk about the integration</a> with Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko. Most importantly, we talked about why now is the right time to devote resources to integrate with Solana: because markets don’t wait for engineering timelines. This is in reference to the time it will take to build Layer 2 on the Ethereum blockchain. Businesses within the ecosystem need to keep moving their momentum forward.</p>



<p>Earlier, before BTC spiked and NFTs took center stage, we took a broad view of the new year in conversation with Cointelegraph, weighing in on topics such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-bitcoin-prove-itself-to-be-a-reliable-store-of-value-in-2020-experts-answer">store of value</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-cbdcs-affect-the-crypto-space-in-2020-and-what-s-next-in-2021-experts-answer">central bank digital currencies</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-lies-ahead-for-crypto-and-blockchain-in-2021-experts-answer">what to watch</a>. We also shared commentary in podcasts for <a href="https://goldsilverbitcoin.com/29-vinny-lingham/">Gold Silver Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.blockhashpodcast.com/podcast/vinny-lingham-ceo-of-civic">Blockhash</a>.</p>



<p>On the horizon</p>



<p>With new market conditions, the opportunities for identity verification abound. You can expect to hear more news about our Solana integration in the coming months, starting with a consumer-friendly gateway to DeFi on Solana via a wallet experience that enhances the vision started with their mobile app on Ethereum. With the emergence of NFTs, Civic has been actively exploring opportunities to harmonize and secure user experiences.</p>



<p>2021 has already proven to be a disruptive year. We are looking forward to continuing to build on the new opportunities that our directional change has already brought to our doorstep.</p>

  2020 pushed the notion of trust to the forefront of all our lives. It made customer trust in brands acutely important to the bottom line amidst a severe economic recession. It also forced many organisations to overcome long-standing reservations about trusting their employees to work from home and placing their faith in digital channels to serve customers.

<p>We’re&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/03/01/five-reforms-the-ftc-can-undertake-now-to-strengthen-the-agency/">recent article</a>&nbsp;published on the Brookings Institution site by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-rich-51b313a7/">Jessica Rich</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinguished Fellow,Institute for Technology Law and Policy, Georgetown University Law Center. Rich&nbsp;spent 26 years with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal&nbsp;Trade&nbsp;Commission</a>&nbsp;(FTC)&nbsp;up until 2017&nbsp;and has&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/03/01/five-reforms-the-ftc-can-undertake-now-to-strengthen-the-agency/">five reforms the FTC can undertake now to strengthen the agency</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is particularly interesting to us because the FTC is the agency charged with protecting consumer privacy in the US. But, Rich says&nbsp;the 108-year old institution faces significant challenges across the board, which&nbsp;include the agency “badly&nbsp;need[ing]&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/01/14/after-20-years-of-debate-its-time-for-congress-to-finally-pass-a-baseline-privacy-law/">stronger federal law</a> to protect the privacy of the American public.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>We, like many, believe a US national privacy law is&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">now more likely than ever</a> before, but we’re not there yet.&nbsp;So while the FTC, and the rest of us, wait for&nbsp;that, here&nbsp;are three things&nbsp;Rich believes the FTC could do right now&nbsp;in relation to&nbsp;consumer&nbsp;data protection&nbsp;and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



 Establish a new bureau of data protection&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Rich cites&nbsp;the worsening&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global data privacy crisis</a>&nbsp;with its flourishing&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">data surveillance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>, frequent significant&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;and widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">data abuse</a>, and&nbsp;growing&nbsp;issues of anti-trust&nbsp;as reasons for&nbsp;the FTC to create a&nbsp;new bureau&nbsp;of data protection.&nbsp;She envisions&nbsp;the new bureau&nbsp;staffed with people from both the existing FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) and Bureau of Competition (BC), and unified in&nbsp;a&nbsp;focus on data protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich says, “The new bureau would be responsible for privacy and security enforcement and related policy initiatives. It also would handle issues at the intersection of competition and privacy, such as mergers involving large amounts of consumer data, or practices like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/google-chrome-to-end-support-for-third-party-cookies-within-two-years.html">blocking “third party” cookies</a> that appear to place privacy and competition in conflict. Significantly, the new bureau would not just protect “privacy,” but would also address broader data protection concerns, including anticompetitive data practices and the use of data for fraud, racial profiling, and discrimination. While increased legal authority and resources (including more technologists) will be needed to fully realize the potential of the new bureau, there are good reasons to create this bureau now.”&nbsp;</p>



 Issue a commission policy statement on consumer harm&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Rich would like to see clarity around what&nbsp;constitutes consumer harm for purposes of FTC law enforcement and policy.&nbsp;She points to the FTC’s “most definitive discussion of the issue”, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1980/12/ftc-policy-statement-unfairness">Unfairness Policy Statement</a>, written in 1980, and argues it no longer serves the modern Internet and the data-driven digital age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The FTC’s unfairness statement has proved to be surprisingly durable, but its discussion of consumer harm is woefully outdated. Notably, it focuses mostly on economic harm and doesn’t discuss the many other forms of injury enabled by modern technology, particularly in the area of privacy and data security&nbsp;…&nbsp;A new policy statement on consumer harm would update old thinking, educate the public, and lay the foundation for stronger FTC enforcement and policy efforts,” Rich says.&nbsp;</p>



 Convene a public workshop on privacy “third rails”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We agree with Rich when she says, “Without a strong federal privacy law, the FTC will continue to be hampered in its efforts to protect the privacy of American consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She&nbsp;refers to&nbsp;the FTC’s repeated assertions that “the laws it now enforces contain many gaps in protection and does not allow the FTC to seek civil penalties for violations in most instances.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich says Congress has debated whether to pass&nbsp;a&nbsp;national privacy law for two decades “but keeps getting stuck on the same issues—in particular, whether the federal law should preempt state privacy laws and whether to authorize private rights of action. Many stakeholders view these issues in “yes” or “no”&nbsp;terms, and&nbsp;have not sufficiently explored potential middle grounds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich points to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/bridging-the-gaps-a-path-forward-to-federal-privacy-legislation/">earlier article</a>&nbsp;on the Brookings Institution site which&nbsp;discusses a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bridging-the-gaps_a-path-forward-to-federal-privacy-legislation.pdf">June 2020 report</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;exploresthese “middle grounds” — to “unfreeze the privacy debate” between Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich proposes the FTC host a public workshop to find potential solutions to issues of&nbsp;preemption and private rights of action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minor rambling about Credentialing a professional and why that business problem isn’t as simple and exciting as you think.</p>
<p>I am a Professional Engineer, which in Canada, is a regulated profession. That means I am formally credentialed. The tech that I am issues comprises of a rubber stamp and an ink pad. Yup – very high tech…</p>
<p>Is it sufficient? Likely.</p>
<p>The stamp and ink aren’t the important part – the act of stamping something and then signing it is the important part. That’s what legally binds me to my work (disclosure: I don’t do work that legally requires my P.Eng. stamp as software isn’t regulated, yet.) Can it be faked? Easily on a technical basis, but much harder in reality – what work have you created that is being faked and how do you pose as me on a project for long enough that your client believes you’re me?</p>
<p>How often have I used my stamp. Literally never for work. I used it to capture the photo for this article though.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, some credentials become much more valuable because they are used all of the time.</p>
<p>Consider a doctor prescribing medication.</p>
<p>How often does that happen?</p>
<p>How much incentive is there to fake a prescription? Quite a bit though doctor-shopping may be an easier path where the doctors are well known (smaller cities and towns).</p>
<p>What are the consequences of such fakes? There are quite severe ones and controls are put in place to attempt to manage (e.g. opioid prescribing) when the problem gets big enough.</p>
<p>So here’s something to think about as you work to credential the world – is that credential you’re talking about used a lot? Is it critical to solve a problem? Are there existing ways to get the job done that aren’t broken (enough).</p>

<p>Yesterday, in a notice provided to Civic by the the United States District Court – Southern District of New York, the class action lawsuit brought against Civc, which began in April of 2020, was dismissed.</p>



<p>The dismissal of this case signals the end of a lengthy and hard fought process for Civic. During the past year plus the company remained confident that we would prevail, not just on behalf of Civic, but in support of the crypto ecosystem overall. Nonetheless, sometimes being on the right side of an argument is not enough (and we were right), so it is with a certain sense of vindication that we tick this one in the win column for Civic and for crypto.</p>



<p>We would like to offer our heartfelt and sincere thanks to our loyal Civic community, our counsel, and to the crypto community at large for your support. The innovative interconnected web of projects that call crypto home are an incredible group, and we count ourselves lucky to be among them. Onward and upward! Our work has just begun!</p>

<p>Spring is all about new beginnings,&nbsp;and&nbsp;this&nbsp;month&nbsp;we’ve found a new home at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataguard.co.uk/">DataGuard</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;a leading privacy and infosec SaaS company, based in Munich, Berlin and London with over 1,500 customers in over 30 countries.&nbsp;On Wednesday 21, April we started the move&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;team. An exciting new chapter to work as one team to protect the people behind the data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital was founded in 2014, we’ve developed a leading Consent &amp; Preference Management platform that gives over 30 million consumers more control over their data.&nbsp;This is now part of the&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;Suite, and will soon be fully integrated to their Privacy as a service platform.&nbsp;</p>

 Time for a refresh&nbsp; 

<p>As we move over to&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;things may change&nbsp;a little&nbsp;– here’s a few things you&nbsp;should&nbsp;know:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our brand name:&nbsp;We’re in the process of moving&nbsp;everything over to&nbsp;Dataguard.co.uk&nbsp;,&nbsp;we will no longer&nbsp;have a&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;online presence.&nbsp;All our&nbsp;digital&nbsp;channels will be rebranded to&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;and our product will be&nbsp;known as&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;Consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our people:&nbsp;The lovely people at&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;will simply change hats – we’ve now&nbsp;become the new Guards and&nbsp;Guardettes, focused on driving our shared mission to protect the people behind the data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our products and prices:&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;Consent features&nbsp;and price will stay the same for the time being. With more investment we will be able to develop new features quickly. In addition,&nbsp;DataGuard’s&nbsp;Privacy as a service solution is a perfect complement to our consent and preference platform, as it helps&nbsp;you&nbsp;navigate the first steps&nbsp;in the data privacy journey – organising&nbsp;all&nbsp;your&nbsp;processes to ensure you’re compliant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our communications:&nbsp;The team&nbsp;remains&nbsp;incredibly passionate about data privacy and will continue to share news, blogs and our opinions on everything relevant in the industry. If you signed up to our newsletter, we&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;keep you updated – the only difference is it will come from a&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;email address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This&nbsp;is an incredible time for&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital.&nbsp;Together as one team, we now have the end-to-end data privacy journey covered for any organisation looking to enhance their data protection and privacy processes to gain&nbsp;a&nbsp;competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you would like to take a look at&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;Consent and understand how it can help your business increase marketing engagement&nbsp;join our webinar&nbsp;on</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dataguard.co.uk/webinar/dataguard-consent">Join the Webinar</a>:&nbsp;DataGuard Consent: Best-in-Class Consent and Preference Management in Action on May 25th&nbsp;at&nbsp;10:00h EST /&nbsp;15:00h&nbsp;GMT / 16:00h CET&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>TechTimes: One fun app is encouraging users to get back out into the outdoors and to start interacting with local businesses.&nbsp;<a href="https://triffic.app/en/gameplay-basics">Triffic&nbsp;</a>is as its name suggests a terrific game for those who are looking to combine their daily walk, or shop with a gaming format. Walk, run, cycle, drive or crawl; no matter how you do it, the more you move, the more Triffic miles you collect.&nbsp; You can be incentivized and rewarded for moving about and collect your rewards in cryptocurrency. Find treasures on your outdoor explorations and use the wealth you accrue from the app to buy your own plots in the Triffic map. Then earn money from your own plots of land.</p>

  <p>There is no single right way to do cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) services. Not only is every organization at a different place in their journey, but each will prioritize cloud benefits differently. Therefore, no matter where you are on your cloud journey, modular and integrated solutions can strengthen your identity security, help you achieve governance and a Zero Trust model, and get compliant.</p>
<p>The cloud comes with great opportunities as well as significant dangers. When including it in your IGA strategy (of which it should be a critical element), keep identity security at the center. IGA programs are difficult under the best of circumstances, but now with most organizations operating in a hybrid environment of on-premises and cloud resources, it can be extremely difficult to govern without the right approach to identity security. There is a perception that you have to give up something – functionality or security usually – to make the jump to cloud-based environments.</p>
 No need to sacrifice functionality and flexibility for security 
<p>However, that does not have to be the case. You can have both security, and the increased functionality and flexibility that the cloud provides. There is no need to sacrifice.</p>
<p>It is rare that an organization will implement a complete IGA program at once. It is expensive and can require a lot of end-user adjustment. Often, the IGA rollout is prioritized, starting with the most pressing identity challenge. Regardless of where you start your IGA journey, you need an approach that not only addresses your current priorities but also is flexible enough to scale and transform to tomorrow’s needs. Ideally, the first phase of your IGA program should be seamlessly compatible with subsequent phases as you implement additional IGA programs.</p>
<p>This seamless integration with all systems within your IGA solution as well as cloud- and SaaS-based applications and services, will enable your organization to reap the benefits of a unified identity security platform. You can centralize management, accelerate and automate provisioning/de-provisioning tasks, grant just-in-time access, simplify certification efforts, get compliant and ultimately strengthen identity security. Oh, and pass audits more easily.</p>
<p>Engage with One Identity at KuppingerCole’s KCLive Event on May 11 to learn how our cloud-first solutions enable business needs, not IT capabilities, drive how organizations implement their identity governance and administration (IGA) strategy.</p>
<p>We are proud to be a platinum sponsor of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/05/iga-for-identity-centric-security" title="KCLive, Modern IGA Capabilities for Identity-Centric Security">KCLive, Modern IGA Capabilities for Identity-Centric Security</a> and will be a featured keynote presenter.</p>

<p>Spruce is excited to announce the upcoming launch of Tezos Profiles (TZP) in early&nbsp;May.</p><p>TZP is a web application that helps users regain control of their digital identity for use across platforms. It allows users to create portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over their public social media and by self-attesting information. These verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate identity&nbsp;fraud.</p> Loss of Trust, Loss of Connection <p>With the accelerated growth of NFT adoption, creator impersonation and copyminting have unfortunately become widespread, with many buyers unsure if an <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/fake-or-appropriation-banksy-style-nfts-sell-for-usd900-000-but-who-is-behind-the-spin-offs">NFT is being sold by its true creator</a>. Not only have buyers lost millions of dollars purchasing fraudulent assets, but it has led to growing trust problems between users and NFT platforms. With no existing way to authenticate artists at scale, platforms are continually feeling pressure to authenticate artists on an individual basis, all while the fraud continues.</p> A Better&nbsp;Approach <p>Instead of a creator’s identity being recreated and fragmented across various platforms, why not allow the creator to attest to their own identity and credentials?</p><p>TZP solves this problem with a web application where a user can anchor their Tezos address to their public online identity based on social media profiles and self-attested information. Platforms can then globally resolve this user-managed information to establish a creator’s profile. Since each platform draws from the same source (the creator), their identity remains whole and consistent to audiences.</p> How it&nbsp;Works <p>TZP will initially support two distinct workflows that result in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> with more to come: basic profile information provided by the end user, and a Twitter profile verification.</p><p>The basic profile information workflow prompts users to input an alias, a description, a website, and an avatar URL, and sign off on that information using their Tezos wallet of choice. This enables services to pull basic information about a user without requiring any account creation or data duplication.</p><p>The Twitter verification workflow requires the user to tweet an identity proof message such as “I am @sprucesystems, verifying my Tezos address is tz1…” with a valid signature. The application runs a service that will confirm the validity of the tweet and upon success issue a verifiable credential signed by <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web:tzprofiles.com</a> (also known as a “claim”).</p><p>The steps to creating a basic profile will be the following:</p>  A user connects their Tezos&nbsp;wallet.  The user completes the Twitter verification and self-attested information workflows to receive claims in browser localStorage.  The user then signs a storage operation with their Tezos wallet to upload their claims to Kepler, Kepler returns a public URL per&nbsp;claim.  After that, the user deploys a smart contract they control containing the URLs and content hashes of the&nbsp;claims.  (Optional) The user can update the smart contract contents and sign additional storage operations to update or delete their claims. Additionally, users can further control the active contents of the contract using their Tezos account, and even set the URL in the smart contract to files on their own web&nbsp;host.   The Difference: Kepler, Key Controlled Off-Chain Storage <p>Where are the W3C Verifiable Credentials stored? We initially considered plain IPFS, but wanted to maximize user&nbsp;control.</p><p>Therefore, tzProfiles credentials will be stored in a storage service at kepler.tzprofiles.com. The service can produce a public URL that anyone can fetch per file, and allows users to create, update, and delete data using their Tezos wallet to sign requests. While bare IPFS instances may allow replication to unknown parties, Kepler adds permissioning around IPFS to restrict replication so users can delete their data and reasonably retract their information if they wish. In the future, users will have the ability to run their own Kepler instance to mirror just their content sets (known as orbits) to their own servers if they&nbsp;wish.</p><p>We have <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/blob/main/PRD.md">open-sourced the MVP of Kepler</a> powering tzProfiles as Apache 2.0 on our GitHub, with an official release and announcement forthcoming. From the product roadmap, Kepler will support pluggable storage backends (e.g., S3, RocksDB, Couchbase) and authentication modules (DID-based, ssh keys, OpenLogin, other crypto wallets).</p><p>Developers can use the tzProfiles SDK (to be shipped on launch) to allow their users to fetch and independently check verifications for any Tezos address. These verifications can be displayed within user pages and further styled for a seamless experience. People will be able to manage verifications outside of tzprofiles.com, such as by setting and confirming their public exposure directly in their wallets or checking additional verifications per address in block explorers.</p> Future Plans and Use&nbsp;Cases <p>We plan to extend support in TZP to include credentials from additional public social profiles such as Instagram to give creators the ability to continue to associate their core public information. Not only does this user-centric identity model rebuild trust between creators and their followers, but it also means that identity verification doesn’t become platform-dependent. This allows creators to directly manage their own identity, and as a result, directly manage their audience and relationships.</p><p>The problem of establishing trust between parties is not unique to artists. In the payments and financial services industries, this is often required. The same technology powering creators’ TZP can also enable Tezos addresses to satisfy enterprise use cases. We intend to support verifications for corporate and enterprise stakeholders, such as proof of DNS record control, external audit reports, and corporate filings containing identity&nbsp;proofs.</p><p>In the future, we imagine a system featuring multiple independent parties verifying credentials — not just tzprofiles.com, and eventually decentralizing the set of supported verifications to avoid singular&nbsp;control.</p><p>If you would like to discuss how to integrate or use Tezos Profiles, please send us a message at hello@spruceid.com, and we will respond within 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

 GiD Report#157 — ”Tipping is taking over the internet” <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis.

It’s the Lina Khan&nbsp;show <p>Does the person make the times or do the times make the person? One thing’s for sure, Lina Khan is a woman of the&nbsp;times.</p><p>When we first started covering Khan in this newsletter last year, we were focused mostly on her ideas. Now at 32, having transitioned from academia to government, it’s about Lina Khan, FTC Commissioner.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/business/lina-khan-ftc.html">the&nbsp;NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>At the Senate Commerce committee hearing, Ms. Khan, 32, said she was “seeing whole range of potential risks. One that comes up across board is that the ability to dominate one market gives companies, in some instances, the ability to expand into adjacent markets.”</blockquote><blockquote>She also focused on the online advertising market and how the consumer data mining that fuels it poses potential harms for consumers. The business model, she said, incentivizes more and more data collection.</blockquote><blockquote>“In some cases, companies may think it’s worth the cost of doing business to risk violating privacy laws,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Ms. Khan is part of a progressive wing of the Democratic Party that has pushed for antitrust legal reform and the breakup of companies like Facebook and Google. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">In a 2017 Yale Law Journal article titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox</a>,” she questioned the bias of antitrust experts toward consumer prices as the key metric for antitrust violation. Even though Amazon offers consumers lower prices in many cases, she argued the company could harm competition by squeezing out small-business rivals who rely on its marketplace.</blockquote><p>You can <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?511008-1/nasa-administrator-ftc-commissioner-confirmation-hearing&amp;live">check out her opening statement here</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a>).</p><p>See also:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine </a>— <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/?utm_social-type=owned&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_brand=wired">Biden Is Assembling a Big Tech Antitrust All-Star&nbsp;Team</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/business/lina-khan-ftc.html">Lina Khan, a progressive trustbuster, displays get-tough approach to tech in confirmation hearing.</a>  <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazons-antitrust-adversary-lina-khans-senate-hearing-reveals-big-techs-future/">Amazon’s antitrust adversary: What Lina Khan’s Senate hearing reveals about Big Tech’s&nbsp;future</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/lina-khans-timely-tech-skepticism-makes-for-a-refreshingly-friendly-ftc-confirmation-hearing/">Lina Khan’s timely tech skepticism makes for a refreshingly friendly FTC confirmation hearing — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/lina-khan-tech-antitrust-icon-84829d38-33d9-4a45-81fe-8600c6aa6bf0.html">The ascent of Lina Khan, tech antitrust icon</a>  <p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/states-court-tech-money-bash-companies-2bf6023c-b193-4514-8fc5-57c6ddbaf6e9.html">States court tech money even as they bash companies</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/senate-targets-apples-tight-app-store-reins-19bee492-bf13-4112-b3de-b0baeeb81b8f.html">Senate targets Apple’s tight App Store&nbsp;reins</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-facebook-ban-decision-oversight-board-2dc609ce-4fd0-49b5-9cd9-9a1d808ca225.html">World leaders brace for historic Trump Facebook ban&nbsp;decision</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/apple-confirms-it-will-allow-parler-to-return-to-app-store/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Apple confirms it will allow Parler to return to App Store — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="http://markonovak">/markonovak</a> — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/04/20/apple-forces-competitors-to-play-by-its-rules-with-a-new-operating-system/">Apple Forces Competitors To Play By Its Rules With A New Operating System</a>   2. Still, don’t get your hopes up just&nbsp;yet <p>Lina’s got her work cut out for her, and with the media building her up the way they are, she’ll be under a lot of pressure to deliver the goods — historically, a challenging proposition.</p><p>It’s also a job that just got a little&nbsp;tougher.</p><p>Here’s Axios:</p><blockquote>Critics of Big Tech who hoped the Federal Trade Commission would aggressively police the sector face a new hurdle after a Thursday Supreme Court ruling checked the FTC’s power to penalize companies, as Margaret Harding McGill&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The ruling weakens the FTC’s ability to crack down on companies for a range of consumer harms, including some privacy and data security violations, just as a new administration and its Democratic appointees are gearing up more active enforcement aimed at tech companies.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: The FTC has relied on its power to force companies to return ill-gotten gains to obtain $11.2 billion in refunds to consumers in the past five years, the agency said Thursday.</blockquote><blockquote>But in a case involving a payday loan company, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Congress never gave the FTC the power to obtain court-ordered monetary relief in that&nbsp;way.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cuts-federal-trade-commission-powers-to-recover-ill-gotten-gains-11619102862">WSJ: Supreme Court Cuts Federal Trade Commission Powers to Recover Ill-Gotten Gains</a>   3. Also confirmed by the Senate: SEC Chief Gary&nbsp;Gensler <p>With all the controversy around Gamestock, SPACs, and, of course, crypto, Gensler’s also got his work cut out for&nbsp;him.</p><p>But perhaps the most important piece of business will be the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple over the sales of&nbsp;XRP.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/class-action/cryptocurrencys-future-in-the-u-s-is-threatened-by-sec-action-against-ripple">Bloomberg Law</a>:</p><blockquote>The SEC’s lawsuit seeks billions in penalties from Ripple Labs Inc. and its executives. But the agency does not allege that any of its investors were defrauded.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead, the agency complains about Ripple’s alleged failure to register XRP as a “security,” characterizing its sales of the cryptocurrency as “investment contracts” covered by federal securities laws. The unprecedented move stretches the SEC’s reach too far and seriously threatens the developing cryptocurrency ecosystem — and America’s vital leadership place within&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Though misguided, the SEC attack on Ripple presents a promising opportunity for the Biden administration. Under new leadership, the SEC could course-correct back to its mission to protect investors, while fostering fair and efficient markets, rather than interfering with currencies outside its jurisdiction.</blockquote><blockquote>Gensler has a solid understanding of blockchain technology, and he could usher in fresh start on cryptocurrency by dismissing the case against Ripple. Rather than fight the cryptocurrency industry, Gensler should collaborate with them, and work toward the shared goal to safeguard the future of crypto, and America’s place within&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/sec-presses-ahead-with-ripple-lawsuit-with-gensler-at-the-helm">SEC Presses Ahead With Ripple Lawsuit With Gensler at the&nbsp;Helm</a>   4. “Tipping is taking over the internet” Photo: Sam Dan&nbsp;Truong<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-64f858d6-6543-4365-9d94-681dd44fc802.html">Axios&nbsp;Login</a>:</p>  Twitter is working on adding a “Tip Jar” feature within <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">@TwitterSpaces</a> and on users’ main profiles, software engineer Jane Manchun Wong discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385375100841586689?s=20">this week</a>. This is in addition to its new “<a href="https://www.axios.com/twitter-subscription-products-revenue-366893aa-4638-4dab-b4d4-8f506106934f.html">Super Follows</a>” feature, which allows users to charge followers for special&nbsp;content.  Clubhouse launched a payments feature at the <a href="https://www.axios.com/clubhouse-teams-up-with-stripe-for-payments-feature-3f236267-3483-4d33-ade4-fda9b7a1df59.html">start of the month</a> to help audio creators generate revenue from the platform.  Facebook said in March it would expand its “<a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-creators-subscription-content-e4a56a73-d726-4a09-b4ff-4cbf442fe9d4.html">Stars” virtual currency</a>, which lets fans reward video and game creators directly for their&nbsp;content.  Instagram late last year launched “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">Badges</a>,” a virtual gift that users can buy during livestreams to show their support for the creator in real&nbsp;time.  YouTube has been experimenting for years with various tipping features, including “<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9632365">applause</a>” and “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/01/youtube-announces-super-chat-its-own-tip-jar.html">Super&nbsp;Chats</a>.”  Twitch and Caffeine have long used tip-like features to drive engagement between gamers and their&nbsp;fans.  OnlyFans has exploded in popularity over the past year, in large part because its direct payment features opened an income stream for many of its creators.  SoundCloud is planning to introduce a direct payments between fans and artists through its platform, per <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9522066/soundcloud-payout-system-fans-artists-direct-payments/">Billboard</a>.  Spotify in August <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52393960">rolled</a> out a new feature that allows fans to pay musicians directly.   5. Mark Zuckerberg on the future of&nbsp;audio <p>Here’s The Information:</p><blockquote>Mark Zuckerberg has revealed plans for Facebook’s expansion into audio, as the company vies to compete with breakaway social app Clubhouse.</blockquote><blockquote>Speaking with journalist Casey Newton on Discord Monday, Zuckerberg said Facebook was working on a new project named “Soundbites,” which will allow users to create and consume short-form audio clips across a range of topics. The clips will be organized algorithmically in Facebook’s News Feed, based on a person’s interests.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook also has plans for a new podcast project. According to Zuckerberg, there are 170 million users on the platform who are connected to a podcast page, but there isn’t currently a format for users to listen to podcasts on the app — something Facebook plans to&nbsp;develop.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The social media company’s acceleration into audio coincides with the surging popularity of Clubhouse, which was valued at $4 billion in a recent funding&nbsp;round.</blockquote><blockquote>“The high-level picture is we think audio is of course going to be a first-class medium, and that there are all these products to be built across this whole spectrum,” Zuckerberg said.</blockquote> 6.

 Atomic Wallet activates atomic swap functionality for SHR token, allowing holders to swap SHR tokens instantly with over 60 other major cryptocurrencies! 



<p>We are delighted to announce <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/">Atomic Wallet</a> has activated the Atomic Swap functionality for ShareRing’s SHR token.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We tend to make our platform accessible, secure, convenient and up-to-date for everyone, and we’re delighted to let ShareRing’s users enjoy more features of Atomic with making SHR available for instant and anonymous exchange in the wallet.”</p>– Konstantin Gladych<br>Founder and CEO, Atomic Wallet</blockquote>



<p>SHR was <a href="https://sharering.network/sharerings-shr-token-integrates-with-atomic-wallet/">first integrated</a> with Atomic Wallet in August 2020, which allowed users to store SHR tokens in their secure, decentralized wallet along with over 500+ popular crypto assets. Due to technical reasons, however, at this time the Atomic Swap function was not yet enabled. Since then, ShareRing has progressed with numerous planned upgrades to our token, including the smart contract and increased global accessibility.<br><br>Now the atomic swap functionality has been enabled, SHR holders can instantly swap SHR for 60+ other top crypto assets anonymously and even get <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/membership">cash back</a> for it!</p>







<blockquote><p>“Activating Atomic Swaps for SHR is another great milestone toward the private, accessible, decentralized future we wish to build. <br><br>Together with Atomic Wallet, our community has more options than ever to safeguard their funds and securely access ShareToken and we’re looking forward to seeing what more we can do in the future as we both grow.”</p><p></p>-Tim Bos<br>Co-Founder and CEO, ShareRing</blockquote>

			<p>In its latest report, “Now Tech: Digital Signature And Trust Services, Q1 2021”, Forrester identifies InfoCert as a Large Provider in the sphere of Digital Trust Platforms, recognizing the status of the Italian company as a leading name in the Digital Signature sector.</p>
<p>On 25 March this year, the independent industry analysis company Forrester Research published a report entitled “Now Tech: Digital Signature And Trust Services, Q1 2021”, in which InfoCert is classified as a “Large Provider” of Digital Signature solutions; the purpose of the report is to assist professionals and enterprises in assessing the various solutions offered by different providers in the Digital Signature and Trust Services sector. The Forrester report divides the Digital Signature and Trust Services market into four different segments, placing InfoCert among players in the “Digital Trust Service Platform” category, i.e. those who meet the requirements of European regulations in matters of electronic identification and trust services, offering a range of proven solutions for clients needing to observe particularly high standards of security.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The report is notably useful in that it allows readers to distinguish between providers on the basis of their specific capabilities and the levels of services they offer. The “Digital Trust Service Platform” segment — in which InfoCert is named as a main player — offers the maximum level of Trust obtainable from a digital transformation services platform. This important mention confirms that InfoCert is able to ensure clients will benefit from the highest standards of compliance and governance, covering a variety of needs ranging from the simplest to the most complex.</p>
<p>The report goes on to analyze three further segments, namely: Digital Transformation Platforms, e-Signature Specialists and PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Specialists.</p>
<p>Headed by Senior Analyst Enza Iannopollo, the writers of the report highlight the fact that clients must be able to access services adaptable to their needs, and accordingly, should be in a position to select the provider most likely to meet the necessary criteria of functionality and compliance through all steps of the process in question.</p>
<p>GoSign, the highly versatile InfoCert signature solution, has by now become a benchmark for the market. Given the facility of signing on any device, using different types of signature and customizing the solution with vertical processes, businesses are able to speed up approval and signature procedures between their own offices and those of clients and suppliers.</p>
<p>Commenting on the report, InfoCert CEO Danilo Cattaneo says: “to be mentioned by Forrester among the world’s “Large players” in the Digital Trust Platform sector is testament to the extraordinary efforts made by InfoCert over recent years in the Digital Trust field. Our mission is to support our clients with end-to-end solutions that give them safe and secure digital transformation, with a level of Trust and Governance scalable to suit their business needs. And with the recent acquisition of 3 new specialist CyberSecurity companies by the Tinexta group, we will be able to expand our offering still further.<br>Our aim is always to keep pace with developments in technology and in the regulatory scenario, which are constantly bringing changes to our market. And our attitude to improvement is undoubtedly a defining feature that has enabled us to establish a go-to reputation with many businesses and professionals who have been relying on our services for years.”</p>

<p>I prossimi 26 e 27 aprile 2021 avrà luogo in formato full digital l’ottava edizione dell’ormai consueto evento dedicato al mondo delle assicurazioni a cura di di IKN Italy, saranno circa 70 i panelist che si alterneranno sul palco virtuale, 20 sessioni tematiche in circa 20 ore totali di live streaming che avranno come tema centrale: “Open, Smart e Data Centric Insurance”, InfoCert anche quest’anno conferma la sua sponsorship ed il suo interesse ad un settore, quello assicurativo, in costante evoluzione.</p>



<p>Italy Insurance Forum è ormai da anni il più autorevole hub del comparto assicurativo nazionale e internazionale, pone la sua attenzione sui temi più caldi di un settore dinamico e in costante crescita, come dimostrato dall’Osservatorio Fintech &amp; Insurtech della School of Management del Politecnico di Milano: anche nel 2020 il numero delle startup fintech e insurtech è aumentato, in particolare in Europa con un +158% di finanziamenti nell’ultimo biennio e oltre 768 startup finanziate sopra 1 milione di euro. L’ultima radiografia del settore (nel 2019 si contavano 326 startup Fintech e Insurtech in Italia, con 654 milioni di euro di fondi raccolti) mostra un panorama che si prevede raddoppierà nel 2021.</p>



<p>Main Topic 2021</p>



  Post Covid-19: vision e nuovo ecosistema assicurativo nazionale ed internazionale  Ruolo “sociale” delle compagnie assicurative a supporto del rilancio dell’economia: nuove necessità di lavoratori ed imprese, nuove forme di risparmio  Nuovi modelli&nbsp; assicurativi internazionali e del mercato italiano e nuovi player entranti  Evoluzione dei prodotti assicurativi con elevato valore socio-ambientale: cosa è cambiato nella percezione della “sostenibilità” e impatti a livello di opportunità per il settore  Evoluzione del prodotto vita e salute  Casi di eccellenza nella sfida del servizio  Sviluppi tecnologici e infrastruttarali: Iot e 5G, automazione dei processi – dai sinistri alla compliance alla gestione documentale – advanced analytics, cloud, AI per antifrode, per gestione cliente  Distribuzione 4.0: a che punto è la digitalizzazione delle reti agenziali  Evoluzione nei pagamenti e sistemi di digital identity

 7 learnings from our regulatory innovation work on the&nbsp;ground  Introducing the DM&nbsp;Notes <blockquote>This is the first in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #1 is a preview of our international portfolio of experiments around governance and regulatory innovation as well as some of the learnings that are coming out of&nbsp;it.</blockquote>Screenshot from the last DM Download on regulatory innovation Why regulatory innovation? <p>We find ourselves at the forefront of some of the greatest challenges humanity has faced. The multiple crises of our time (climate break- down; rising inequality; declining trust; runaway technology; populism and nationalism in politics) are in many ways entangled in our here and now. And the trajectories of these risks are being intensified rather than limited or mitigated by our existing governance models.</p><p>We therefore need to find new paradigms for exploring issues, discovering solution pathways, and making decisions, together. This requires governance innovation, which in turn necessitates regulatory updates. To keep up with the pace of change we urgently need to transition towards a collaborative (meaning public, private and fundamentally civic) and agile model of designing, delivering and updating the&nbsp;rules:</p> the game is (constantly) changing, <br>the rules need to keep changing as&nbsp;well. <p>Yet the prevailing logic of regulatory innovation is too often driven by corporate demands. This tends to reduce it from a fundamental and<br>inclusive discussion about public value(s) to a narrow concept of ‘unburdening’ business and unleashing the disruptive power of unicorn companies — rather than responding to more diverse sources of demand for&nbsp;change.</p><p>After putting together <a href="https://regulation.network/">The Network of Governance &amp; Regulatory Experimentation</a> and organizing two meet-ups in Amsterdam (2018) and Toronto (2019) on these questions, we at Dark Matter Labs produced a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ztVV0V2D81Cb1KEvaRYGubgVri_pXRtL/view?usp=sharing">Provocation Playbook</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/legislation-guidelines/community-federal-regulators.html">Community of Federal Regulators</a> in Canada, the <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/">McConnell Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/">MaRS</a>, and called for the implementation of a network of regulatory experimentation (RegX, for short) labs in Canada though <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/report/legitimacities/">Legitimacities</a>, among other activities detailed in the diagram&nbsp;below.</p><p>We are now developing parts of the answers with partners in various places around the world, including Madrid, Amsterdam, Seoul and Montreal.</p> Quick overview  Madrid — Mission-Oriented Regulatory Sandbox Workshop Process Design on Miro by Fernando Monge Cortazar — DML<p>In Madrid, there is high level political support for the idea of a regulatory sandbox as an innovation instrument in the economic motor of Spain. The City Council has recently released its Roadmap Towards Climate Neutrality in 2050. This roadmap includes measures relating to existing and new building, use of energy, changes to mobility and leveraging nature based solutions to achieve the mission set up by the City. There is a recognition that key regulations need to be revised, inter alia, to take account of including (but not limited to) the need to be more agile in an age of rapid climate breakdown.</p><p>The key lever of change addressed here is the facilitation of regulatory innovation processes focused on the decarbonization of the City of Madrid, particularly through ‘sandboxes’ — controlled experimentation spaces (delimited in time and space) that allow the testing of and learning from regulatory innovation, in a collaborative way, across by, for example, public administration, private developers, civic entities, union groups, and professional associations. In particular, this experiment seeks to, among others: establish a permanent capacity in the Madrid City Council to act as a key enabler of mission-driven regulatory change, with a holistic view of regulation, analyze and identify the regulatory barriers and gaps that hinder sustainable approaches (such as circular economy and renewable energy) in urban projects, and experiment with next generation carbon- neutral innovations in urban projects, both in new development and the existing city as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.madrid.es/portal/site/munimadrid">City of Madrid</a>, <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">Climate KIC</a>, <a href="http://www.itd.upm.es/">ITD at Madrid Polytechnic University</a>, <a href="https://www.arup.com/">Arup</a>, and Democratic Society.</p> Amsterdam — Activating law and regulation for a circular&nbsp;city Visual by Romy Snijders — DML<p>Amsterdam aims to be a fully circular city by 2050. During the development of the Amsterdam circular strategy 2020–2025, it was concluded that projects and measures were often of a facilitating and stimulating nature and that the full spectrum of policy instruments had not yet been used. An important reason that the public law instruments are not yet being used optimally is that there is currently insufficient knowledge about the possibilities that Amsterdam as a local government has or would like to have. We are therefore focusing on the development of a digital dynamic tool, that “unlocks” the difficult to understand and static legislative system, connects laws, law areas, and law techniques to the circular aims/principles and makes an unruly world accessible in a new&nbsp;way.</p><p>In the regulatory domain there are a lot of “islands”, while everything is connected to everything. This should also be represented in the legislative system. Often within law &amp; regulation areas are so specialized that there is not really an overview. If you want to change the system, for example transition towards a circular economy, you have to change multiple parts of the system, find the levers. Innovation in just one specific part of the system will most likely not change the entire system. But how to visualise or get an overview of this system? We found that only through a combination of bottom up and top down system mapping did we get any closer to a categorisation of the regulatory domain and an overview. This we only achieved by using a multidisciplinary approach and co-creation with the city. Creating this overview has already opened up lots of space for innovation and opportunities. We are continuously working on building the tools to navigate complexity and enabling innovation and transition.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/">City of Amsterdam</a> and <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">Climate-KIC</a></p> Seoul — Sandbox Innovation for Civic Experimentation Visual by Hyojeong and Juhee — DML<p>In November 2018, Dark Matter Labs prototyped a hypothetical experiment called<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/creating-new-possibilities-to-make-human-e-cities-governance-in-the-digital-age-3bb648727967?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------"> “Street trading licence design”</a> during<a href="https://medium.com/unusual-suspects-festival-seoul"> the Unusual Suspects Festival SEOUL</a>. Participants received: 1) a series of hypothetical scenarios and 2) an overview of technological trends on the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, enabling them to create a set of speculative regulatory futures.</p><p>Last year, Dark Matter Labs had opportunities to design and create civic programmes for the Seoul Metropolitan Government for one of the innovation districts in northern part of Seoul, we communicated ‘Regulatory Innovation’ (tools &amp; possibilities) for complex urban challenges which are one of the pillars that accelerates urban reformations used in designing, and governing city space. However, the proposal was not welcomed and accepted.</p><p>In 2020, DML worked with Daegu Metropolitan City and launched ‘Sandbox Innovation’ for Civic Experimentation’ as an approach to creating equitable urban futures in the digital economy. While we were working with citizens and tech companies around 5 different urban challenges such as air pollution and illegal dumping of domestic waste, we tried to expand a vertical horizon of the solution space: not only services/products, but also regulatory regimes.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.ttp.org/">Daegu Technopark</a>, <a href="https://www.kaia.re.kr/portal/main.do">Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement</a>, <a href="http://www.daegu.go.kr/english/index.do">Daegu Metropolitan City</a></p> Montréal — Towards a new generation of place-based regulatory sandboxing Visual by Emile Forest — DML<p>LICER (Laboratoire d’innovation civique pour l’expérimentation / Civic and Regulatory Innovation Laboratory) is part of the collaborative governance component of Montreal’s winning bid for Canada’s Smart Cities Challenge, which aims to support innovation and citizen involvement in sustainable mobility and food security projects.</p><p>LICER is part of a series of strategies aimed at supporting municipal administrations and partner organizations in the research and implementation of governance methods adapted to the precepts of smart cities, such as the creation of bodies promoting citizen participation in decision-making, shared governance, the implementation and management of physical and technological commons, and the inclusion of social acceptability objectives in the technologies developed.</p><p>For the past year, we have worked with multiple community projects to identify regulatory challenges, prioritize common innovation themes as well as city departments to be involved in the future. Currently, we are working on a system mapping of local regulations around two local initiatives, as well as the governance system and legislation that influence them, and we are designing a series of new services, including one aimed at providing regulatory clarity and advice for innovators, as well as the prototype of a new generation of a regulatory sandbox that would be place-based and work across different sectors.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.mis.quebec/">MIS Maison de l’innovation sociale</a>, <a href="https://www.enap.ca/enap/fr/accueil.aspx">ENAP (École Nationale d’administration Publique)</a>, <a href="https://laburbain.montreal.ca/">LIUM (City of Montreal)</a></p> The 7 main takeaways so&nbsp;far   Start small, but keep the end in mind. There is space for experimentation with other “regulatory tools” such as tender documents, standards, procedures, that may be easier to change and yet have a great impact. Starting by these, rather than harder to change municipal ordinances or national laws, may be a good way to test the hypothesis, build support with partners and have a proof of concept to convince others. However, in order to fall into a piecemeal approach, it’s always better to keep the end goal of the mission explicit throughout the&nbsp;process.  Words matter. Although the sandbox idea can resonate with many people (particularly top political leadership), in our experiences sometimes the legal department might offer resistance to the idea (either for a fear that it might be perceived as a trojan horse for deregulation or too ambitious). Sometimes, we had to tone down the “regulatory” aspect to focus on identifying barriers and coming up with creative ideas to overcome them (regulatory or otherwise)  Work together. The approach of starting with multi-partner workshops to identify barriers, build trust and a shared of understanding of why regulatory experimentation is important worked very well so far. However, even if having all the right people around the table from the beginning might prove to be a challenge, it often saves time later&nbsp;on.  Trust takes time. Establishing regulatory experimentation at a more institutional level in City Hall will take time, because it requires high doses of trust that can only be built with patience and careful interactions. While we have slowly built the trust with many key partners, many more remain in order for the initiatives to become have the level of commitment to be truly transformational (i.e. Legal Departments, etc,). Personal connections and finding champions within the organization remains essential.  Moving towards sharing risks. Regulatory experimentation can help establish a government culture that values controlled risk-taking and collective learning. However, this can be easier said than done. Involving a multitude of stakeholders allows for the sharing of potential risks, as well as ensuring a collaborative process that combines various perspectives and considerations. But risks can remain very hard to share, and some actors will be more reluctant than others given their level of risks ownership, and we should approach it accordingly.  Push and Pull: As explained in <a href="https://regulation.network/legitimacities1Q">Legitimacities 1.Q</a>, regulatory innovation needs to be a combination of both pulling and pushing; Specific regulatory innovations based on mission led initiatives from community initiatives and process innovations that challenge how regulation is designed, monitored and adjusted. In other words: responding to change from a full range of change agents, but also inviting and supporting regulators to lead the reinvention of existing infrastructures for public benefit. This is a delicate dance that requires balance. As it disrupts traditional institutions and regulatory regimes, this transition also offers unprecedented opportunities for radical openness and inclusiveness, eliminating information and communication asymmetries, and dramatically lowering costs and raising the efficacy of regulation in a complex&nbsp;world.  Legitimacy is key. Whether it is through openness, participation, accountability, fairness or effectiveness, legitimacy remains at the center. When it comes to socio-ecological regulatory missions, priorities and participants must be be carefully chosen and grounded. Otherwise, not only the public, but the participants themselves might question their legitimacy. In one city we worked with, for instance, many wondered why the housing crisis wasn’t the priority since everything else connects to&nbsp;it.

<p>Have you been&nbsp;hacked?</p><p>Well, if you’ve been using online services, your likely answer will be a yes or you don’t know! If you’ve answered a “no”, you’re probably the lucky few remaining intact on&nbsp;earth!</p><p>The reality is your data could have been stolen many times because hackers are getting smarter and have access to more sophisticated tools by the day. The recent breach at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/hacker-publishes-alleged-records-of-20-million-bigbasket-users/">BigBasket</a> is yet another example of the huge security threat that’s looming over our heads every day! And of course, the many breaches at Facebook, Target, Twitter, Zoom, etc. is sure to leave even the most optimistic person&nbsp;worried.</p><p>So, why is this happening? Are these companies not investing enough in their security?</p><p>Could be. But the bigger problem is that the existing technologies are not conducive enough to provide the required levels of security. Breaking this down a bit, there are two aspects to the&nbsp;problem.</p>  Central repository — All information is stored in a central repository, so all that a hacker has to do is hack a central system and steal 20+ million records like the bigbasket hack.  Lack of control — The owner of a credential has no control over where it is stored and how it is&nbsp;shared.  <p>Though there are many advantages with central repositories such as a place to store information and maybe convenience of use, there are also many disadvantages to&nbsp;it.</p><p>A potential alternative can be self-sovereign identity that’s stored in a decentralized environment and protected by public key cryptography.</p> What is Self-Sovereign Identity? <p>Self-sovereign identity or SSI in short is a digital framework where an entity owns its identity and controls the way it’s shared in a decentralized setup.</p><p>Let’s break this down a bit. In the offline world, you carry a card (driver’s license, passport, Adhar card, SSN, etc) for identification and you can choose whom to show your card to. SSI is its equivalent in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Further, you always can lose your card or it can get stolen from your wallet in the physical world. But with SSI, the underlying cryptography makes it difficult to access your personally identifiable information by any unauthorized entity.</p><p>All these make SSI a secure and an easy way to identify yourself&nbsp;online.</p> How does SSI protect your Information? <p>So, how does SSI protect your information, and what’s this cryptography all&nbsp;about?</p><p>Every piece of PII could be a credential that is issued by an entity and owned by another entity. For example, a digital passport is issued by the government of a country (Issuer) and it is owned by the person whose name is on the passport (Holder).</p><p>Now, this holder can decide to show it to an airline to book a ticket. Here, the airline company has the responsibility to check if the passport is issued by the concerned authority, belongs to the holder, and is valid at the time of travel. In this sense, the airline is the Verifier.</p><p>In the SSI world, your passport details could be issued to a holder in the form of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) that is stored safely and is shared by the holder when needed to a verifier. This VC is encrypted to prevent the wrong people from accessing it. In fact, this is the key aspect that ensures your credentials are safe at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>Here is a sample VC that’s digitally signed by the issuer and the&nbsp;holder</p><p>The cryptography used is called the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that comprises a pair of public and private keys where the holder keeps the private keys, but shares the public&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Let’s see how it&nbsp;works.</p>  Firstly, the issuer and the holder agree and create a unique set of private-public key pairs. The issuer generates a VC, digitally signs using its private key, and encrypts the data using the holder’s public&nbsp;key.  This VC is sent to the holder who can decrypt it using its private&nbsp;key.  Next, the holder can choose to save the VC in a custodial wallet like the one offered by <a href="http://affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> or another decentralized wallet.  When needed, the holder compiles a set of VCs like date of birth, government ID, etc into a verifiable presentation that is digitally signed with the holder’s private key and encrypted using the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.  The verifier can decrypt using its private key and validates the digital signature of both the issuer and the holder using their respective public keys to ensure the authenticity of the issuer and the holder. Once verified, the holder gets access to the services offered by the verifier.  <p>From the above workflow, quite a few things stand&nbsp;out.</p>  The transactions happen through a secure peer-to-peer channel and no central authorities are involved. So, the chances for hackers to attack a central authority are non-existent.  Cryptography ensures that your information is tamper-proof and cannot be&nbsp;hacked  These credentials are private and completely under the owner’s&nbsp;control.  No personal data is stored on any&nbsp;server  Highly interoperable as the same VC can be shared with&nbsp;anyone.  <p>So, can SSI safeguard your information from hackers and could the likelihood of bigbasket hack been reduced? Possible given that the information of all users are not in a centralized database, users have complete control over their information and how it is shared, and the underlying public-private key infrastructure secures the credentials.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

 Compare and Contrast — Federated Identity vs Self-sovereign Identity <p>This is a comparison series of articles where we will compare the different methodologies, frameworks, standards, and more in the world of digital identity and its implementation.</p><p>As always, we start with the basics and in this article, we will talk about the differences between federated digital identity and self-sovereign identity and when you should choose one over&nbsp;another.</p><p>At the most basic level, identity is a unique characteristic, value, or document that has a one-to-one relationship with only one entity. For individuals, identity is biometric information, a unique number such as a driver’s license number, etc. However, the key aspect is that this information must be owned solely by the individual.</p><p>This discussion brings up a pertinent question. What are the forms of identity that an individual can&nbsp;have?</p><p>In this context, we can say physical and digital identities.</p> What is a Physical Identity? <p>A physical identity is typically a card that is issued by a relevant authority such as the government, university, employer, store, etc, as the case may be. This card contains a unique value or a code that helps a verifier identify a particular entity. In the case of individuals, this card will most likely have a photo as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Markus Winkler</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/id-documents?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">&nbsp;Unsplash</a></p> What is a Digital Identity? <p>A digital identity, as the name suggests, is a form of identity where there are no physical cards, photos, or objects. Rather, these are pieces of information online that can be traced to an entity. It can include photos you have uploaded, username/password combinations, your details stored in a third-party database, and just about anything else that can uniquely identify you. It can be a single piece of data or a combination of digital identity credentials.</p> Evolution of Physical to Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Physical identities were a good starting point of identification, but they came with many shortcomings.</p>  Obtaining a physical ID is not easy, especially when stringent and bureaucratic processes are involved. This gets worse if the ID is lost and a new one has to be obtained.  There’s always a possibility for theft or loss, both of which can have serious ramifications  The information is not private, Anyone who accesses the physical card can know your name, unique ID, address, date of birth, and other personally identifiable information  It could be hard to identify an entity if the central repository or database that contains an entity’s information is destroyed due to natural/man-made calamities.  <p>These shortcomings led to the emergence of digital identities.</p><p>The earliest form of digital identity was a siloed model where every organization had a unique username/password for every user. This led to an explosion of usernames and passwords that became hard to remember. Also, maintaining these unique usernames and passwords became cumbersome for both individuals and organizations, and it also led to security issues such as thefts and breaches.</p> Federated Identity <p>The next step was a federated form of identity where third parties issued digital identity credentials using which users could log into other websites or services. Typically, these were your Google and Facebook logins. In the process, these third parties that issued federated identities became the middlemen.</p><p>So, what are the disadvantages of this form of digital identity?</p>  Third parties need a financial incentive to store your data and provide a federated login, so the data owner became a potential target for advertising. In all, the privacy of the owner was compromised.  There were many security issues because all the data was stored across central servers, so a hack or breach greatly increased the chances for a PII of an entity to fall into the wrong&nbsp;hands.  The verification depends on the availability of the service. For example, if Facebook is down, you can’t use its federated login.  You have no control over how your data is stored or&nbsp;shared.  <p>As you can see, the existing physical and digital identities are not foolproof and&nbsp;safe.</p><p>The good news is that digital identity is moving to its next stage of evolution where the existing drawbacks are being addressed. The emergence of technologies such as the Distributed Ledger Technology and cryptography has led to the emergence of a new form of digital identity called the self-sovereign identity.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) — A New Form of Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Self-sovereign identity is a form of digital identity where an entity owns and controls its information completely, including who can see what personal information and how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>At the most basic level, SSI eliminates third parties in a transaction. So, it is just you and the organization/individual (peer) with whom you want to share your&nbsp;data.</p><p>In SSI, the credentials of an individual such as the date of birth and other PII are stored in a digital wallet. This is similar to a physical wallet, except that the credentials are stored in a digital format. Also, these credentials have the digital signature of the issuer to prove their authenticity.</p><p>So, each of these digital credentials describes</p>  Who issued it? Could be a government organization, university, employer, a startup company,&nbsp;etc.  Who is the subject of each credential? Could be an individual, group, or organization  Validity. Establishes if the credential is still valid or whether it was revoked or has&nbsp;expired.  <p>Above everything, the holder of a credential can decide, what, how, and with whom it has to be shared. For example, if an individual (John) has digital credentials of his date of birth, employment, degree, and driver’s license, he can choose to selectively disclose just his date of birth with an organization that wants to know if he is more than 21 years old to make him eligible to buy alcohol. Similarly, John can choose to share just his past employment details with a prospective employer without revealing any other information.</p><p>All these give the entity complete control over the credentials and how it is shared. Further, it is highly secure, thanks to the underlying private-public key cryptography. The digital signatures present in the credential make it authentic while the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) makes it tamper-proof.</p><p>Another advantage of VCs is that they are highly interoperable. Extending the above example, John can send his date of birth as a part of a verifiable presentation for a loan application. This is because the data model of the VC doesn’t&nbsp;change.</p> Federated Identity vs SSI: A Quick&nbsp;Glance <p>The above comparison leads us to the next question. Which is&nbsp;better?</p><p>In reality, there’s no straight answer to this question because it depends on the situation. For example, federated identity may be the easiest way for an organization to give its employees a single click access to third-party applications like Slack and Salesforce.</p><p>However, in transactions that involve the sharing of PII with third-party entities, SSI is a better&nbsp;option.</p><p>Affinidi provides the building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

 Through the partnerships, users of Tapmydata will be able to reclaim and stake with their data in DeFi&nbsp;markets. <p>We are excited to announce our latest partnership with Tapmydata, a decentralized data protocol enabling people to own their digital identity and earn crypto, while allowing companies to rebuild trust. Tapmydata are able to achieve this through using Privacy by Design and blockchain technology to keep the score. With this partnership, Shyft Network will be able to integrate Tapmydata’s innovation of allowing users to utilize their data to stake in the DeFi&nbsp;market.</p> The partnership <p>The issues surrounding online data and its uses have increased especially due to social media and the growth of the internet. The importance of data and identity verification on different platforms allows users to own their data as well as have power over its use. Many companies have been benefiting from data acquired without the users knowledge or consent. Additionally, little parameters have been put up to identify owners of data, meaning that the validity of certain data or user information is a challenge.</p><p>This partnership therefore will allow Shyft Network and Tapmydata to offer users more security for their data, while allowing them to earn by consenting to its usage. The mantra for Tapmydata allows for the inclusion of all users into Web3’s digital economy even if they have no money to invest, through their data. Shyft Network’s attestation framework will help users grant, manage and revoke consent in a secure manner, as well as enable data to be validated by trusted third parties and become more valuable and usable by data aggregators and consumers. In addition, Shyft Network will offer users an opportunity to stake and earn rewards by simply using their&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“We set out with a simple mission, to help people take back control of their data. With the first release of our app we broke new ground in the personal data space and finally, after sending more data access requests than any other company on the planet, it feels like the industry is ready for us. This partnership is a key element in delivering our vision of a Universal Data Income for all of our users. Enabling third party verification is critical in order to deliver this” — Irfon Watkins, Chairman of Tapmydata</blockquote><blockquote>“As Shyft Network enters a new phase of development, bringing strongly aligned partnerships that have a natural fit to our mission and objectives is more important than ever. Shyft Network was built to address real needs and problems. For us, it’s important to keep a user-centric privacy-focused approach to build better standards for personal data management. With Tapmydata, we see a perfect opportunity to create synergies and empower users to own their data, to gain control over it and to contextualize it through trusted third parties, and, ultimately, to be able to benefit from it.” — <a href="mailto:juan@shyft.network">Juan Aja Aguinaco</a>, Co-Founder of Shyft Network&nbsp;Inc.</blockquote> The importance of this partnership for Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is committed to partnering with platforms that have tangible solutions for their users. The importance of such partnerships open the platform up to more users and use cases, as well as presenting more ways that we can serve the community. It is our hope that this new partnership will allow Shyft Network to make more steps towards strengthening interoperability and decentralization, as well as embedding trust and validation into&nbsp;data.</p> Why us this important for Tapmydata <p>We know we are aiming to tackle a huge problem and realize we cannot do it alone. There has to be a shift in worldwide awareness that data has value and it is being monetized without our consent. By partnering with a project that has the same mission, Tapmydata knows we can make a change and are thankful to Shyft Network for embarking on this journey with&nbsp;us.</p> About Tapmydata <p>Tapmydata’s solution helps users to reclaim their digital footprint, giving them the right to decide who they can share the data with and on what terms. Through the platform, people have control of their data and can make decisions on whether to share it or capitalize on the market and earn rewards from their data. The data broking sector trades information without transparency, hence owners of this data have no choice or control over&nbsp;it.</p><p>More details about this partnership will also be on Tapmydata’s <a href="https://tapmydata.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tapmydata">Twitter</a>. You can join the conversation on their <a href="https://t.me/tapmydataofficial">Telegram</a> to get involved.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shift Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p>For any further details and developments about this partnership, information will be aptly available on our <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://shyft.network/">website</a>.</p> More INFO <blockquote>Website: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network/</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram Group: <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram ANN: <a href="https://t.me/ShyftAnnouncements">https://t.me/ShyftAnnouncements</a></blockquote><blockquote>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a></blockquote><blockquote>Medium: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/</a></blockquote><blockquote>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6</a></blockquote>

Our Torus Wallet users can now enjoy seamless Face/TouchID authentication that OpenLogin brings, coupled with the advanced security features powered by the <a href="https://docs.tor.us/key-infrastructure/overview">Torus Key Infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Users would still be able to access their old wallets, as well as their newly created OpenLogin wallets within the same account. However, when interacting with dapps, users would need a few additional steps to ensure that they are using their intended wallet to interact with the dapps that they are accessing.</p> What Has Changed: Fast&nbsp;Login <p>With the OpenLogin upgrade, previous tKey wallets will be migrated to OpenLogin wallets. Old tKey shares/factors stored on devices will be upgraded to now be secured behind the device’s native biometric token with OpenLogin. Users can make the upgrade by following the steps shown within the guide&nbsp;modal.</p>Migrate tKey Wallets to OpenLogin with the modal&nbsp;guides<p>If the user has biometric scanners installed on their device, they would be able to register their device factor with their biometric authentication, which would give them access to Fast&nbsp;Login.</p><p>Once Fast Login has been set up, subsequent logins into Torus Wallet would just require a Touch/FaceID scan from the user to gain access to their&nbsp;wallets.</p> Setting Your Default&nbsp;Wallet <p>With OpenLogin, users now have access to both their OpenLogin wallet as well as their basic Torus Wallet tied to their method of authentication (Google, Facebook, Discord, Passwordless etc.). They have a choice of selecting which wallet they intend to use to interact with&nbsp;dapps.</p>Setting your Default Wallet within <a href="https://app.tor.us/">https://app.tor.us/</a><p>To select the wallet that you wish to interact with&nbsp;dapps:</p>  Log in to your Torus Wallet at <a href="https://app.tor.us/">https://app.tor.us/</a>  Go to the Settings&nbsp;Tab  Select your Default Wallet from the Account Management Section  <p>The selected Default wallet would be the wallet that would be used to interact with dapps when logging in to the same account, from here onwards, you would be able to log into dapps with your Torus Wallet through OpenLogin or your preferred mode of authentication.</p> Using an Older Version of Torus&nbsp;Wallet <p>For users who have difficulty logging into their OpenLogin accounts, and wish to access an older version of the Torus Wallet to access their old Torus accounts, they can log in at <a href="https://app.tor.us/v1.9.19/">https://app.tor.us/v1.9.19/</a>.</p> How Keys are Secured: Torus Key Infrastructure <p>The underlying technology securing the user’s keys remains unchanged and is still powered by the Torus Key Infrastructure.</p><p>TKI is a model of threshold key management that solves the trilemma without sacrificing user experience while retaining end-user autonomy and security. The model implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing#:~:text=Shamir's%20Secret%20Sharing%20is%20an,number%20of%20parts%20is%20required.">Shamir Secret Shares (SSS)</a> scheme using the user’s device, private input, and wallet service provider. The user’s private key is split into multiple factors, and these split factors are used to reconstruct the original encrypted secret&nbsp;key.</p><p>Like 2FA systems, as long as the user has access to 2 out of 3 of their factors, they will be able to retrieve their private key and gain access to the&nbsp;wallet.</p>The user’s private key is split into multiple&nbsp;factors<p>1. User Device Factor: Implementation is device and system-specific. With OpenLogin, the factor is secured via biometrics within the device’s secure&nbsp;enclave.</p>Further decentralizing the social login, this corresponding “share” is split into sub-shares<p>2.

			  Joachim Lebrun is Head of Innovation at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Joachim Lebrun, I am 29 years old and living in Belgium, at the Luxembourgish border. I started my career in industrial chemistry after my engineering studies and worked in that sector for 3 years. As I have always been interested in a lot of different sectors, I started to study computer sciences in parallel with my job in chemistry. I discovered the blockchain at that moment and quickly fell in love with the idea of decentralisation and autonomous applications running on the blockchain. I started to work in this for a few ICOs during the ICO boom of 2017 and left my job in chemistry to work full time on blockchain projects and I never stopped since then.</p>
<p>At a personal level, I am addicted to good food. Before COVID-19, I was always looking for new restaurants to discover in Luxembourg. Now it’s more about cooking good stuff at my place 👨‍🍳. I also really like sports, I used to do fitness and boxing before the lockdowns, but I discovered a passion for mountain bikes during this weird times as Luxembourg is a perfect place for that.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I met Luc, the CEO of Tokeny, at the LHoFT in Luxembourg at the end of 2018, just before Tokeny’s first birthday. We decided to work together as we are both passionate about blockchain technology. When I look back to what we have accomplished since then I have to say that I am quite proud of the result 🙂.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I honestly really like working at Tokeny, the company has grown a lot since I landed here in 2018 but everyday we have new challenges and the team is very skilled. I also like the fact that I can work on a lot of different subjects, from coding to business related tasks. This is something that really reflects the startup spirit, and it prevents me from getting bored!</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I am passionate about innovations and new technologies, from spacecrafts to 3d printers, to blockchain, etc. I am really amazed by what humans can achieve when they put their intelligence at work on meaningful subjects. I think we need more people like Elon Musk in this world, and I am convinced that intelligence and technology can solve all the problems that humanity is facing at the moment.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream would be to live long enough to see us (humanity) become a multi planet civilization.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Tough question, there are a lot of things that would need to change in the world unfortunately, but if I have to choose one, I would say that the best thing that could happen to the world would be to see all nations cooperate, first to solve global problems such as global warming, poverty, etc. but also to solve technological challenges such as space colonization. But it’s probably quite utopian to believe in such a cooperation.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>On April 21, 2021, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-approach-artificial-intelligence" title="European Commission proposed a legal framework">European Commission proposed a legal framework</a> for Artificial Intelligence that covers all AI systems that impact natural persons within the European Union, regardless of whether they are operated from within or outside the EU.</p>
 Main goals 
<p>There are a few stated goals that create the foundation for this proposed regulation. First is that AI systems must be safe and must respect the fundamental rights and values of the European Union. This must be true not only for the outcomes of AI systems, but for the entire value chain of AI development.</p>
<p>The commission also recognized that the absence of regulation had a hindering effect on the development of, the investment in, and the implementation of AI. The lack of clear guidance was a risk factor for all stakeholders, including users who would not benefit from the safety requirements, investors who may not be able to recoup their investment if the unregulated space were at some point in the future hit with more restrictive requirements, and of course AI system developers and implementing customers who would face the fines and penalties if found to be non-compliant. Issuing a regulation before massive widespread adoption of AI systems hits the EU market reduces the risk and uncertainty of AI investment.</p>
<p>Then comes the substance of the issue: providing concrete guidance for governing and enforcing safety and protection of fundamental rights as it relates to AI systems. Being the first regulation of its kind, it sets a global example of how to approach the varied designs, applications, and potential risk of AI systems. This proposed regulation takes a risk-based approach, sorting AI systems into different risk categories, and applying more stringent requirements on higher risk systems.</p>
<p>Lastly, the European Market should remain harmonized, and many disparate regulations from each member state could cause major disruption to the development and use of systems across borders. The EU Commission moved relatively quickly to get ahead of and avoid such a muddled regulatory environment.</p>
 What to expect 
<p>There are a few important aspects to know about this regulation. The proposed regulation will follow a risk-based approach, as we surmised in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/new-developments-in-european-ai-regulation" title="blog post">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>AI applications will be categorized as creating unacceptable risk, high risk, low risk, and minimal risk. An AI system that causes unacceptable risk by violating the fundamental rights of EU citizens will be prohibited. These prohibitions are called out specifically, including:</p>
 
 Manipulation with the intent to affect human behavior that would result in physical or psychological harm, including subliminal techniques 
 Exploitation of vulnerable people groups 
 Social scoring systems by public authorities 
 Remote ‘real-time’ biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement 
 
<p>High-risk AI systems are permitted to be on the market, given that they follow stringent requirements to mitigate the extent to which they create risk to the health, safety, or fundamental rights of individuals.</p>
<p>Systems with low or minimal risk have fewer requirements imposed on them, but notably do need establish transparency. This will be in the form of communication to end users that information has been generated or altered in an automated way. Systems that interact with humans, used to detect emotion or come to other conclusions based on biometric data, or to generate or manipulate content (‘deep fakes’) must account for the possibility that a user will be manipulated by the outcome. A disclosure that automated means were used for in such situations will need to be communicated.</p>
<p>Lower risk systems are encouraged to voluntarily adhere to the mandatory requirements of higher risk systems, with provisions for environmental sustainability, accessibility, diversity of development teams, and multi-stakeholder approaches.</p>
<p>Governing bodies will be established at the EU level and at the member state level.</p>
 What to consider at this point 
<p>The regulation is still only a proposal, and it must cycle through the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament before it is formally adopted. After that point, the regulation will have one and a half years before it comes into full force.</p>
<p>Debates over on the high-level approach to AI governance and minute details will likely arise. The enforcement of this regulation should be not only applied to AI systems but also to member states. Member states should show adequate effort in enforcing this upcoming regulation.</p>
<p>The regulation itself walks a fine line between prohibition and innovation empowerment, with limited success. The legal architecture supports the restrictive aspects, with only voluntary participation in visionary measures, such as committing to generating public value or environmental sustainability. Facilitating both restrictive safety precautions and enabling bold digital advancement for society is a tall order, but could be better articulated and provided for.</p>
<p>It is expected that AI vendors or customers will contest the risk categorization of AI systems, arguing that their systems are in lower risk categories as it will impact the additional regulatory hurdles that they need to overcome. To give an example, evaluating the financial credibility of individuals – as Schufa does in Germany – is by definition a high-risk AI application. Organizations running such high-risk applications must self-assess to find out whether their doing is ethically compliant. This may be the result of strong interest groups, leaving the draft with an unbalanced outcome.</p>
<p>At a detailed level, there may be concern that deep fakes are only subject to minimal transparency obligations, like disclosure that the audio/visual content was altered. Indication to which degree the content was altered is not required. Since deep fakes pose a high risk for social manipulation as well as algorithmic manipulation, the infiltration of deep fakes into training data can undermine the trustability of all algorithms if left with such a minimal and difficult to enforce requirement.</p>
<p>The public debate on the most appropriate way to regulate and govern AI will continue, but the hope that a comprehensive regulation that aims to protect the rights and safety of individuals in a multi-stakeholder manner is a significant step forward.</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/go-elasticsearch-example">GitHub</a></p>

 Prerequisites to Writing an Elasticsearch Application in Go 

<p>First things first, if you haven’t already got Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>A Go workspace is required. This is a directory in which all Go libraries live. It is usually <code>~/go</code>, but can be any directory as long as the environment variable <code>GOPATH</code> points to it.</p>

<p>Next, create a directory where all our future code will live.</p>

   <code>mkdir go-elasticsearch-example
cd go-elasticsearch-example
</code>   

<p>Then, make the directory a Go module and install the Go Elasticsearch library.</p>

   <code>go mod init go-elasticsearch-example
go get github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8
</code>   

<p>A file called <code>go.mod</code> should have been created containing the dependency that you installed with <code>go get</code>.</p>

<p>After this, we need to install Elasticsearch. A convenient way of doing this is to use a Docker image containing an already configured Elasticsearch. If you haven’t already got Docker on your machine <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Install Docker Engine</a>.</p>

<p>We then need to pull an Elasticsearch Docker image. This will take some time to download.</p>

   <code>docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.5.2
</code>   

<p>Now we need to create a Docker volume so that Elasticsearch data doesn’t get lost when a container exits:</p>

   <code>docker volume create elasticsearch
</code>   

<p>The Docker command line to run an Elasticsearch container is quite long, so we will create a script called <code>run-elastic.sh</code> to run the Docker command for us:</p>

   <code>#! /bin/bash

docker rm -f elasticsearch
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -e discovery.type=single-node \
    -v elasticsearch:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data \
    docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.5.2
docker ps
</code>   

<p>The script needs to be made executable and then run.</p>

   <code>chmod +x run-elastic.sh
./run-elastic.sh
</code>   

<p>Finally, verify that Elasticsearch is running:</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:9200
</code>   

<p>You should see a JSON object containing details of the server.</p>

 How to Find and Understand How to Handle Data in Go 

<p>We need a fairly large set of data to load into Elasticsearch. This web site <a href="http://stapi.io">STAPI, a Star Trek API</a> contains huge amounts of data from the Star Trek universe. We will use the spacecraft data as our dataset for this application. It is always a good idea to know what the data looks like. Enter the URL http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/spacecraft/search?pageNumber=0&amp;pageSize=100&amp;pretty into a web browser. You should see a JSON object containing page information and a list of spacecraft information. There are over 1200 spacecraft in total.
PS: Bookmark this link or keep the page open for future reference.</p>

 A brief introduction to data types in Go 

<p>If you’re new to Go, this section covers topics that will be helpful to understand before you move forward. If you’re already familiar with Go, you can skip ahead to the next section.</p>

<p>The STAPI site and the results of Elasticsearch searches are sent to clients as JSON objects. The Go APIs receive JSON objects like maps and lists. Map and list values can be of type <code>nil</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>list</code>, and <code>map</code>. Go is a compiled language and it is also strongly typed. Map keys are always strings. The values of any map or list can be a mixture of types, so the values of a map or list can’t be given an explicit type in the code.</p>

<p>Go allows maps and lists to have values of any type by declaring the type as an interface:</p>

   <code>var vessels []interface{}
var craft map[string]interface{}
</code>   

<p>This leads to another issue. It is impossible for the compiler to determine what the actual type of the value is. This can only be determined at runtime, making it important to know what the data structure is. If you know the type, you can use a type assertion that tells the compiler what the actual type is. In our example, <code>vessels</code> is a list of maps and <code>craft</code> is a map containing a number of attributes including a name which is a string.</p>

<p>The type assertions become:</p>

   <code>craft0, err := vessels[0].(map[string]interface{})
name, err := craft["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>If the type assertion agrees with the actual type the <code>err</code> will be <code>nil</code>. You can omit the <code>err</code> return value, but if the type assertion fails then an exception will be thrown. Multiple type assertions can be used in the same expression:</p>

   <code>name := vessels[0].(map[string]interface[])["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>Finally, if you don’t know the actual type of an interface value, then you can use <code>reflect</code> to find it out:</p>

   <code>print(reflect.TypeOf(vessels[0]))
</code>   

 How to Access Elasticsearch from Go 

<p>First of all, we will write a simple Go program that connects to Elasticsearch and prints out server information. Create a file called <code>simple.go</code> containing:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    es, err := elasticsearch.NewDefaultClient()
    if err != nil {
   	 log.Fatalf("Error creating the client: %s", err)
    }
    log.Println(elasticsearch.Version)

    res, err := es.Info()
    if err != nil {
   	 log.Fatalf("Error getting response: %s", err)
    }
    defer res.Body.Close()
    log.Println(res)
}
</code>   

<p>The program should be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Now run the program.</p>

   <code>go run simple.go
</code>   

<p>You should see the server information displayed in JSON format.</p>

 How to Build a Console Menu in Go 

<p>We are going to build a user interface in the form of a simple console-based menu-driven application. Create a file called <code>Elastic.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func Exit() {
	fmt.Println("Goodbye!")
	os.Exit(0)
}

func ReadText(reader *bufio.Scanner, prompt string) string {
	fmt.Print(prompt + ": ")
	reader.Scan()
	return reader.Text()
}

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for {
        fmt.Println("0) Exit")
        option := ReadText(reader, "Enter option")
        if option == "0" {
			Exit()
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Invalid option")
		}
	}
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s see what this code does. The function <code>Exit()</code> prints out a message and terminates the program.</p>

<p>The function <code>ReadText</code> is a helper function that encapsulates the three lines of Go code required to print out a prompt and read a line of text from the keyboard.</p>

<p>The main function first creates a scanner object which reads from standard input. It then enters an infinite loop as we don’t know how many times the loop needs to execute. The menu options are printed out and then an option string is read from the keyboard. Finally, either the <code>Exit()</code> function is called or an error message is displayed.</p>

<p>Now, run the program and try entering a few options.</p>

   <code>go run Elastic.go
</code>   

<p>You should only see one option: “0) Exit”</p>

<p>Exit from the program by pressing “0” and hitting the “Enter” key.</p>

 How to Read Data from STAPI and Store it in Elasticsearch from Go 

<p>We are going to add a menu item to load the data from STAPI and store it in Elastic search.</p>

<p>First of all, we need to make some changes to <code>Elastic.go</code>. We need an import statement and create an instance of the Elasticsearch client.</p>

   <code>import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8"
)

var es, _ = elasticsearch.NewDefaultClient()
</code>   

<p>Next, add another menu item to load the data:</p>

   <code>func main() {
    reader := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
    for {
        fmt.Println("0) Exit")
        fmt.Println("1) Load spacecraft")
        fmt.Println("2) Get spacecraft")
        option := ReadText(reader, "Enter option")
        if option == "0" {
            Exit()
        } else if option == "1" {
            LoadData()
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Invalid option")
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The code isn’t ready to run yet. We still need to write the <code>LoadData()</code> function. For that function, we are going to read all of the spacecraft data from the STAPI site. The site only allows up to 100 entries to be read at once, so the data is spread over 13 pages. This means that we need to read each page in turn. Create a file called <code>LoadData.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"strconv"
	"strings"

	"github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/esapi"
)

func LoadData() {
	var spacecrafts []map[string]interface{}
	pageNumber := 0
	for {
		response, _ := http.Get("http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/spacecraft/search?pageSize=100&amp;pageNumber=" + strconv.Itoa(pageNumber))
		body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
		defer response.Body.Close()
		var result map[string]interface{}
		json.Unmarshal(body, &amp;result)

		page := result["page"].(map[string]interface{})
		totalPages := int(page["totalPages"].(float64))

		crafts := result["spacecrafts"].([]interface{})

		for _, craftInterface := range crafts {
			craft := craftInterface.(map[string]interface{})
			spacecrafts = append(spacecrafts, craft)
		}

		pageNumber++
		if pageNumber &gt;= totalPages {
			break
		}
	}

	for _, data := range spacecrafts {
		uid, _ := data["uid"].(string)
		jsonString, _ := json.Marshal(data)
		request := esapi.IndexRequest{Index: "stsc", DocumentID: uid, Body: strings.NewReader(string(jsonString))}
		request.Do(context.Background(), es)
	}
	print(len(spacecrafts), " spacecraft read\n")
}
</code>   

<p>So, what does this code do?</p>

<p>First of all, it creates a variable named <code>spacecrafts</code> containing an empty list of maps. Map entries have string keys and the values can be of any type. It also declares a page number that starts from zero.</p>

<p>Next, we have an infinite loop to fetch the pages of data. We will terminate the loop when the last page has been read.</p>

<p>Then, the Go <code>http</code> API to fetches a page of data from STAPI, specifying the page number to fetch. The response body is then read, and the body is closed to free up resources. The response body is a JSON object which is unmarshaled into a Go map called <code>result</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>result</code> map has two entries, a map called <code>page</code>, and a list of spacecraft information called <code>spacecrafts</code>. The page map contains information about the current page. We are only interested in the total number of pages so we extract that information into a variable named <code>totalPages</code>. Next, the code iterates over the spacecraft list and uses type assertion to type each entry as a map. The entry is then appended to the list of spacecraft maps.</p>

<p>It then increments the page number and if it is the last page terminates the infinite loop using <code>break</code>.</p>

<p>We now have a list containing all of the spacecraft, each entry being a map containing data about the spacecraft.</p>

<p>Now it is time to store the data in Elasticsearch. Data is inserted in Elasticsearch by creating a map of type <code>esapi.IndexRequest()</code>. Data items in Elasticsearch are called documents and Elasticsearch stores documents in a collection called an index. Each document needs to be given a unique identifier within the index so we use the spacecraft <code>uid</code> as the unique index. For the body of the document we marshal the data for the spacecraft into JSON and use that. The actual insert operation is performed by calling the <code>Do()</code> function, passing it a Go context and the Elastic search client.</p>

<p>Now, run the program and select the menu item to load the data. As the code is now in two files, both need to be specified to run the program.</p>

   <code>go run Elastic.go LoadData.go
</code>   

<p>You can now verify that there is some data in the <code>stsc</code> index by pointing a web browser at (http://localhost:9200/stsc/_search)[http://localhost:9200/stsc/_search]. Some, but not all of the data should be displayed.</p>

 How to Get a Document out of Elasticsearch from Go 

<p>Loading documents into Elasticsearch was quite complex due to the data conversions that were required. Getting and searching for documents is much simpler.</p>

<p>The changes that we’ll be making require some new imports, so let’s start by updating our import statement:</p>

   <code>import (
    "bufio"
    "bytes"
    "context"
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/esapi"
    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8"
)
</code>   

<p>Elasticsearch returns documents in the form of a JSON object containing metadata and the document content. This is not very readable. We will add a function called <code>Print()</code> to <code>Elastic.go</code> which prints out some of the spacecraft information in a more readable form.</p>

   <code>func Print(spacecraft map[string]interface{}) {
	name := spacecraft["name"]
	status := ""
	if spacecraft["status"] != nil {

		status = "- " + spacecraft["status"].(string)
	}
	registry := ""
	if spacecraft["registry"] != nil {

		registry = "- " + spacecraft["registry"].(string)
	}
	class := ""
	if spacecraft["spacecraftClass"] != nil {

		class = "- " + spacecraft["spacecraftClass"].(map[string]interface{})["name"].(string)
	}
	fmt.Println(name, registry, class, status)
}
</code>   

<p>The function takes account of the fact that some of the fields can be <code>nil</code> and that type assertions are required.</p>

<p>Documents can be requested by specifying the index and the document identifier. Let’s add another menu item to <code>Elastic.go</code> to get a spacecraft. The menu calls a function called <code>Get()</code> passing it to the reader. Next, add the function:</p>

   <code>func Get(reader *bufio.Scanner) {
	id := ReadText(reader, "Enter spacecraft ID")
	request := esapi.GetRequest{Index: "stsc", DocumentID: id}
	response, _ := request.Do(context.Background(), es)
	var results map[string]interface{}
	json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(&amp;results)
	Print(results["_source"].(map[string]interface{}))
}
</code>   

<p>The document is returned in a JSON object which is decoded into a map. The actual document is in the map entry <code>_source</code>.</p>

 How to Search for Documents in Go 

<p>Elasticsearch supports a number of different types of searches. Each search has a query type and a list of key, value pairs of fields to match. The result is a list of hits, each given a value indicating how good the match was. A match search looks for work matches. The search values should always be in lowercase. A name match for <code>uss</code> would match all spacecraft with the word <code>uss</code> in the name in any case including <code>USS</code>. A prefix search matches any word which starts with the specified string.</p>

<p>Now, we will add searches to <code>Elastic.go</code>. First of all, let’s update the <code>main()</code> function to add searches to the menu.</p>

   <code>func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for {
		fmt.Println("0) Exit")
		fmt.Println("1) Load spacecraft")
		fmt.Println("2) Get spacecraft")
		fmt.Println("3) Search spacecraft by key and value")
		fmt.Println("4) Search spacecraft by key and prefix")
		option := ReadText(reader, "Enter option")
		if option == "0" {
			Exit()
		} else if option == "1" {
			LoadData()
		} else if option == "2" {
			Get(reader)
		} else if option == "3" {
			Search(reader, "match")
		} else if option == "4" {
			Search(reader, "prefix")
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Invalid option")
		}
	}
}
</code>   

<p>Note that the new <code>Search()</code> function takes the search type as a parameter.</p>

<p>Next, add the search function.</p>

   <code>func Search(reader *bufio.Scanner, querytype string) {
	key := ReadText(reader, "Enter key")
	value := ReadText(reader, "Enter value")
	var buffer bytes.Buffer
	query := map[string]interface{}{
		"query": map[string]interface{}{
			querytype: map[string]interface{}{
				key: value,
			},
		},
	}
	json.NewEncoder(&amp;buffer).Encode(query)
	response, _ := es.Search(es.Search.WithIndex("stsc"), es.Search.WithBody(&amp;buffer))
	var result map[string]interface{}
	json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(&amp;result)
	for _, hit := range result["hits"].(map[string]interface{})["hits"].([]interface{}) {
		craft := hit.(map[string]interface{})["_source"].(map[string]interface{})
		Print(craft)
	}
}
</code>   

<p>After obtaining the key and value from the user, the function constructs a data structure from the query type, the key, and the value. This then gets encoded as a JSON object. The <code>es.Search()</code> function is called with the index name and the query as a body. This returns a list of hits. These are iterated over and the source object is printed.</p>

<p>Run the program and try some match and prefix searches. For example:</p>

<p>For option 3 (“Search spacecraft by key and value”) try:
Enter key: <code>name</code>
Enter value: <code>enterprise</code></p>

<p>For option 4 (“Search by spacecraft key and prefix”) try:
Enter key: <code>registry</code>
Enter value: <code>ncc</code></p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>Enter key: <code>name</code>
Enter value: <code>iks</code></p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Elasticsearch can store many types of data in documents. Each document resides in a collection called an index. Each document also has an identifier that is unique in the index. Elasticsearch has a comprehensive REST API.</p>

<p>Go has a library that is an API on top of the Elasticsearch REST API. It makes inserting, getting, and searching for documents very easy for a Go developer. The only real complexity is handling maps and lists with different value data types. Once the Go interfaces and type assertions are understood, the complexity is resolved.</p>

 Introduction &amp; Web Evolution 
<p>Mathieu: Stepan, thank you for joining me today.</p>
<p>Stepan: Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I’ve been very much looking forward to this conversation! The times we’ve spoken before have been quite interesting; we both come from the crypto space, and we’ve moved to the SSI space. We share similar visions for the decentralized future and the decentralized tech stack. So, I’ve been very much looking forward to this conversation on the podcast today, and maybe we could geek out a little bit or push ourselves more into the future.</p>
<p>I think these are fun conversations to have! At the same time, I’m hoping we could also focus on topics around go-to-market and near-term things that we think are interesting with SSI to keep pushing the adoption forward.</p>
<p>Where I want to start is, we hear a lot about web 3.0. It’s this space, or the umbrella, that we fall into: how do you look at the evolution of Web 1.0 through 2.0 to 3.0? My thinking is that we are still in Web 2.0. We’ve come to realize that in the Web 2.0 version, it resulted in significant centralization and censorship and other restrictions. Is Web 3 taking back the ethos of Web 1? How do you look at that?</p>
<p>Stepan: First of all, thanks a lot for inviting me. I’ve listened to some of the previous episodes. I really enjoyed the podcast, and some of the guests are just great. In my opinion, Web 3 is only one of the terms; it might not be the one that we eventually settle on. Previously, there were a few things that were called Web 3, and none of them actually became Web 3: That includes the Ethereum library and the Javascript library, which are given this name today. Some people call this the metaverse; there’s the decentralized web, different names. But it’s the same thing, I think; it’s not a replacement; it’s all an evolution.</p>
<p>Web 1.0 was an amazing invention. If you look at the initial Arpanet, to what then became the worldwide web, it took a lot of great minds and a lot of time to develop. Then, Web 2 was the best way to scale it, because you cannot go from a few thousand people online to 3.5 billion and at the same time, make sure that it’s all privacy-preserving, and decentralized, and fully compliant with all the ethical and technical requirements. I believe that Web 3 is the next layer up the spiral. For me, it’s more about fixing; it’s all about taking what works well and then fixing the things that were created through this natural evolution. I think the reason Web 2 exists as it is today, it’s not some deliberate decision — it’s more about economic trends.</p>
<p>Companies that were created in the 90s or later: Facebook, Twitter, Google: they had to find a business model. Especially in the early 90s, there was no way to make payments online. That naturally led to advertisement-based business models. Therefore, if you’re doing advertising, it’s all about collecting data. Basically, companies compete in terms of who has better targeting and more audience. So, they need to lock people in, and they need to collect as much data as possible to provide better service to their advertisers. Generally, I think most of the users are fine with this. Google is not forcing anyone to use their service, or Facebook is not blocking you from not using it, if you don’t want to share any data or if you don’t want the data to be collected. The good thing about Facebook, is it provides an ability to communicate with your friends and the whole world. That is a positive thing, and it should be definitely should exist in Web 3 and in different services.</p>
<p>You can do the same and actually provide the companies who build this an ability to make money and the ability to have a business model. But, with the new technology, it can be done more correctly by taking into account user preferences and the different risks that exist. As we’re speaking, a few days ago, Facebook was hacked, or I don’t know exactly what happened. Somehow, they lost personal data on 500 million users, which is definitely not a good sign. In the SSI world, this couldn’t happen. There are a lot of economic, ethical, and regulatory trends, which force internet companies to start thinking about decentralization in order to provide the same or better level of customer experience, while giving users more autonomy or sovereignty.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. Many of the companies that spun up and built business models on top of Web 2.0 are amazing. You alluded to that with Facebook; you can connect to literally anyone in the world, and that’s phenomenal. With Amazon’s services, it’s ridiculous to think that you could order anything you want for so cheap, and the next day it’s on your doorstep — it’s magic, right?</p>
<p>Many of these companies are built on advertising models: you had explained that there were no payment options, so the model became a data mining model, and selling that for advertising. For these companies that today have business models built on top of all these Web 2.0 methods; what’s the transition for them to Web 3.0? And perhaps we could talk a bit more about the business models of Web 3.0?</p>
<p>I think we see that Twitter is a good example of this. I believe that Twitter realizes where the world is going. It’s quite clear that their CEO is a big advocate of decentralization: is it replacing the plumbing? From your point of view, how does a company think about transitioning and building new protocols to take them from Web 2 to Web 3? </p>
<p>Stepan: The common trend is that great companies such as Amazon, or Twitter, or Apple, or Google, they do think about their customers first. For example, if we think about who might be one of the largest competitors for some of the <a href="https://northernblock.io/">SSI products</a>, I think Apple comes to mind. That’s not because it’s decentralized; Apple has not released any blockchain-based product, or anything by product. However, at some point a few years ago, they realized that being privacy-conscious, and advertising that, is important for the users. Now, they mention it at any convenient moment. For most of Apple’s products, you always have these privacy settings; they always highlight it, they always show how they care, and they can do it because their business model does not depend on advertising at all. They have the app store, and they have hardware. There is probably some value for Apple to get more insights into their customer behaviour, but it’s not their core business model.</p>
<p>In terms of transitioning, I think there are maybe two different schools of thought. One is that there will be a new decentralized Facebook, decentralized Youtube, decentralized Twitter, and they will replace the existing companies. In some verticals, that is definitely the case. However, most IT companies are not like Blockbuster when faced with Netflix; they’re not discarding this technology. I think that some people at Google or Twitter; at those larger corporations, they do understand decentralized technology quite well. They understand blockchain; I don’t know what they’re thinking, but maybe they feel it’s too early. Facebook tried to launch their Libra currency, but if you’re large, you are faced with this regulatory pushback.</p>
<p>It’s not as easy to launch decentralized products, but it is still important from a product standpoint. As Jack Dorsey has mentioned, there are a lot of scandals and discussions around, “Should social media be blocking or banning some of their users? Is it ethical? Should they comply with government regulation.?” In some countries, governments are actually forcing social media to ban people who simply don’t like the political situation. In other situations, it’s the companies themselves who are deciding that something is inappropriate, even if it’s not purely illegal. I think that the reasons are that it’s not that those companies are taking too much initiative; it’s because there’s no good framework. Government, or most of the governments, cannot provide feedback because governments don’t understand the internet as well as those companies.</p>
<p>Decentralized technology can be a solution, because it creates a flexible system where all opinions can be present. So, for example, for social media, you can have a layer with decentralized identifiers and people posting their tweets as verifiable credentials. Then, you can have multiple UI’s that are connected to the same underlying protocol. The protocol with the data is decentralized, and it’s completely permission-less, but then you can build a kid-friendly Twitter on top of that, that filters out any content that is not good for kids. So, that is kind of self-regulating, and I think this is very similar to how the internet looked in the beginning. I think initially; the transition would happen in those areas where this is a real problem for the customers. You don’t want to risk your business just to try something. On the other hand, there are many experiments, and the whole crypto space, which is simply one big experiment. I think for me, it’s still the fact that bitcoin works, and every ten minutes, you get a new block; it’s still a miracle.</p>
 Privacy, Anonymity and Pseudonymity 
<p>Mathieu: I’m with you on that one. There’s a lot to unpack in what you said there. The Apple privacy positioning is quite evident, and is a very good indicator. I’ve always thought that the biggest feature of the 2020s is going to be privacy, and Apple is really driving that forward in their marketing. They’re also making things happen in the product, where they’re trying to be transparent, and they’re trying to give control to people that are using their products. Apple posted billboards across big cities about it; I remember a massive one in Toronto, where we are.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting: In the crypto space, there are a lot of projects where they’re taking an approach that the existing world is wrong, and we’re going to rebuild. But, on the other side people think that that’s perhaps not the best way to adoption either; when there are already network effects, there are already so many benefits and so much value that these companies are providing today. They have the distribution, they have the scale, and they have the client base. So, if privacy is inherently important to them, and <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-for-organizations/">moving towards a more decentralized model</a> is important to them, then I think that there are steps that they could take.</p>
<p>The Twitter one is interesting to me. I think this whole cancel culture, as you described; it’s political, at the end of the day. You could think one way or another about the President of the United States being removed from social media platforms; you could think one way or another about an app like Parler being removed, where the server’s not running it anymore. But, it comes down to this: if you want to move that forward, and you want to look into some of these issues such as the cancel culture and all these things that are happening, there’s something interesting about pseudonymous identities online. I’m interested in what your thoughts are on pseudonymous identities; SSI enables that to some extent. SSI, or having <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">trusted digital credentials</a>, enables you to conduct business transactions or to access products and services according to their rules, or their terms and their conditions. You could prove that, but your identity as Stepan or as Mathieu — we don’t necessarily need to have attributes such as our names that we’re given. Our legal names are attributes that are potentially outdated for Web 3.0. There’s a lot of risk associated with that, and the fact that our online lives are attributed to our names or these attributes. So, when you see a hack like the Facebook hack happen, it’s not great. Similarly, when your browsing and chat histories get exposed, it’s going to cause a lot of issues for people. Is that something you think about; of being able to use credentials where you’re still able to be compliant; conduct business transactions, and follow terms and conditions, while being pseudonymous?</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes, and I want to unpack this a little. I do agree that the decentralized web is not happening just because it’s decentralized; it has to solve some problems, and has to bring some value. From a very high level, I think there are two clusters of reasons why these technologies are getting traction. The first one, we could call it ‘boring SSI,’ but in reality, it’s not boring. In fact, it delivers very clear economic benefits. The first bucket of why decentralized technologies are getting adoption, is because they’re really solving some pricing problem today. For example, you have paper-based credentials, or documents, or attestations, and then you replace those with digital ones. They’re decentralized; they can also be exchanged in a peer-to-peer manner. That means that a lot of companies don’t have to be integrated into a single database, so it’s cheaper to maintain. Those are purely economic benefits.</p>
<p>Basically, what happens is that moving a trusted data exchange system onto verifiable credentials or SSI rails reduces the transaction costs, and those transaction costs are present in any economic activity. So, blockchain does the same if you want perhaps to reduce legal costs; you can use a smart contract because it’s automatically enforced. Or, you can use a blockchain to reduce supply and chain management costs, or in verifiable credentials — this is clear. Most of the applications of verifiable credentials today are focused on this transaction cost reduction, and that can be huge. It can be tens of times reduction, because you not only make it cheaper, but you also make it less prone to fraud. It’s possible to fake paper certificates or paper documents; it’s much harder with digital signatures. You reduce the single point of failure, because there’s no database. You increase privacy, and you get mathematical compliance. If you build <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">an SSI system</a>, it’s already GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) compliant from Day One, because there’s no centralized company that is storing everything. It comes down to ‘Issuers and Holders,’ and they have the right to do it. I think the same can be said about every layer of the decentralized stack. This works for decentralized storage, verifiable credentials, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and so on.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the second bucket, which is more future-looking. It’s still not about the idea that we will have a new world that’s better; it has to be about creating a new paradigm of trust or a new paradigm of interaction. Before the internet, it was not possible to have anonymous communication at all. With the internet, we now have anonymous communication; we have all the problems associated with that, because we have scum, we have fraud, or we have people pretending to be other people, or we have people getting angry, and other problems. Then, we can apply decentralized technology to that. So, we can have pseudonyms on the internet that are not revealing your real-world identity, yet you can still prove something about yourself.</p>
<p>For example, I recently was reading about Gitcoin Grants in Vitalik Buterin’s blog, and he wrote about the recent Gitcoin program they have. Gitcoin is a system where companies come together, and they have a fund that is used to fund some ‘public goods.’ Those are educational programs, or open-source development that benefits the whole industry. The problem that they started having, is that because everything is anonymized, people use their DIDs from their cryptocurrency wallets to identify themselves. Now, they’re seeing SAML attacks, such as one person pretending to be multiple users. SSI can solve this problem, because you can have a completely anonymous DID, but yet you can have several verifiable credentials attached to it that prove your personhood, or prove that you have a social media account, or a phone number, or that you met someone in person, all without revealing your name. In reality, this can go even further; you can have the whole professional identity. So, you can be an anonymous developer, someone like Satoshi, and yet you can prove that here’s your cryptocurrency wallet, and you have money, or you received money from someone. You can prove that you contributed to this code base; you can prove that you have this skill or competency, or that you participated in some public work. So, now you can be anonymous, and this is going to be as efficient as a not-anonymous approach.</p>
<p>To sum it up: the first bucket is about finding economic inefficiencies or customer problems in the world today; in government, in the public sector, in enterprises, or in different economic interactions. For example, for SSI, it’s usually establishing trust: How do I trust that this parking ticket is valid, or is issued by the right person? Or, how do I know that this diploma, issued in another country, can be accepted here in my country? So, we can use SSI in all those problems, because those things can be solved today. It takes time: I need to call the university, I need to get an apostille, I need to spend a lot of money. In fact, I recently went through the problem of notarizing my diploma. I have a diploma from the United States, and I had to present it to German authorities. It cost me 500 euros in total, for shipment and authorization and all different costs. With SSI, this can be done — maybe it should cost one dollar.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the second part, which is thinking about a new paradigm of trust, a new paradigm of social interaction, that can be enabled through decentralized technologies. Now we can have decentralized money, which is uncensorable. We can have decentralized storage, which, at a minimum, is not controlled by Amazon. It can still be based on the Amazon infrastructure, but it’s encrypted and it’s distributed. That means that I can have my data in a decentralized, accessible way. I can have my personal identity, which is anonymous. If I want, I can generate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero-knowledge proof</a>, or not disclose some of the parameters or some of the attributes, and I can even have the programmatic governance through decentralized autonomous organizations.</p>
<p>I can have a complete business built in this new paradigm, but from a go-to-market standpoint, realistically, I think it’s still mostly the first part that presents real current market problems. That is huge, because, if we take world GDP and we calculate what percentage of it represents the transaction costs associated with establishing trust; that is, in my opinion, trillions of dollars. So, there’s a lot of work to do there. We have this new market which is completely ‘blue ocean,’ and even hard to predict how deep it can be.</p>
 Supply Chain &amp; Crypto-economics 
<p>Mathieu: I agree; the new paradigm activity is super interesting, and these are topics that I always felt haven’t been figured out yet. Obviously, it’s stuff that, when you build and do more experiments, you start seeing what is newly possible. A nice comparison to that, is that with the rise of the internet, people were trying to send faxes over the internet. You don’t want to redo things the same way; you could do something completely different. I agree with that.</p>
<p>Stepping back, and looking at the first bucket you illustrated; where you’re able to solve the problems today of economic inefficiencies; I think that’s when I got into the crypto, blockchain, decentralized space. With many projects that we worked on or saw, we were trying to use a blockchain or distributed ledger to solve some of these economic inefficiencies. You’ve mentioned supply chains: how could you use a supply chain to lower the cost throughout the chain, to create more transparency or traceability in the supply chain, as well?</p>
<p>We were going after a number of benefits with that. It was interesting, because, since the start of crypto, there’s been this on-and-off trend of people being excited about public blockchains and public crypto. Every now and then, there’s all this excitement about these permissioned or “enterprise-suited” systems. Many of these “enterprise-suited” blockchain systems haven’t really taken off as people would have liked to see them take off. We don’t have to name any specific projects; we all know them.</p>
<p>One of the things we always faced being deep inside of that world, was that if you’re trying to achieve some of the properties that you get from decentralized technology, such as verifiability, or immutability, or traceability; there are different elements to the decentralized stack that need to be deployed. It’s not one solution that fits all. What we saw, is that people are trying to throw everything on the blockchain, but, at that moment, it didn’t really make sense. We always felt like there was a big missing piece, which had to do with credentialing and identity. So, if you want to build a system to achieve some benefits, you’re making a decision to use a private blockchain or consortium environment, because maybe you need performance, or privacy, or whatever the reasons are.</p>
<p>I think that the big piece that we noticed was missing, is this SSI piece. It’s the credentialing piece to it. Another piece that we felt was missing from the enterprise blockchain space, and is a space that you know quite well, is crypto-economics. What’s the point of creating a consortium, when there’s no incentive for people to run these things? That’s where you see a lot of projects die. So, I think it’s clear that verifiable credentials and the SSI stack fit in nicely to this model with these projects, and it fits nicely into public blockchains as well, if you’re using it for specific purposes. How do you view crypto-economics fitting into this whole thing? How does it play with SSI?</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes. Let me address the first part first: In my opinion, I think that I’m not a huge fan of permission blockchains. I think that idea was quickly proven not to work economically. The reason there were still a lot of companies that kept trying, was the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) boom. So, I think it overlapped because there was a lot of excitement about enterprise blockchain. Then, people realized that for several companies, if they have a centralized database with cryptographically signed data, they don’t need blocks; they don’t need this type of complex solution; they only need a way to track authenticated data, and you can do that in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> or <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>. But then, because blockchain was a new technology, not everybody fully understood what it is. As bitcoin was growing and a lot of ICOs popped up, I think that that was a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>I had a few projects that were trying to put coal mines, or gold mines, or oil drilling on the blockchain — that was the permission blockchain, but they had tokens, and they were trying to sell those tokens. I think it doesn’t make sense. I believe that the problem that enterprises are trying to solve, is best addressed by the SSI stack, especially today. I don’t believe that crypto-economic incentives are necessary; I think it’s more about a governance system that is missing. Some of the key areas of innovation for SSI today are actually creating better governance mechanisms that are not economically incentivized, but they are compliant, and they’re transparent. Ideally, they are at least somehow connected to government frameworks; for example, the European Union self-sovereign identity framework.</p>
<p>It’s a good way for enterprises to start using these systems, because it’s not merely blockchain; you have your data off-chain. It’s not as if your competitors can access all your customers’ data. That’s good, but it’s important to think about what Trust over IP is doing, and in general, the governance approach. In other words, how do I trust Issuers or Verifiers, and at the same time, do it in a way that is recognizable by the government or by the legal system? I think <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">it’s important for wider adoption</a>.</p>
<p>The crypto-economics part; that one is necessary when you actually don’t have enterprises. The reason for that, is that you can have superior economic efficiency by removing intermediaries. So, you need crypto-economics to replace intermediaries that are enforcing trust in the system. I can build on the example of professional identity: you can have a centralized university that you pay a hundred thousand dollars. You get your degree, and you get your diploma; it might be a verifiable credential, or a referral credential. At the same time, you can go to Youtube and watch the same lectures. Stanford or Harvard: they have great Youtube channels. You can go and practice, you can do a coding project on GitHub, or meet with someone.</p>
<p>So, the internet allows access to education, and it’s virtually free in a lot of cases. However, you don’t get that degree, that official diploma. We can imagine a system that is, in reality, decentralized, but which can afford you the recognizable educational credentials. For example, if you are a software engineer; you taught yourself, you did a bunch of projects, but then you go on this website, or you have a smart contract. In that event, you have someone who is a Verifier who checks your knowledge. They might run a paired programming session with you and award you with the degree of Software Engineer, Layer Level 3, in TypeScript or something like that. Because the system is prone to fraud — you could collude or bribe that person — we can use crypto-economic mechanisms in order to protect the system. Similar to what OGRE is doing for the prediction market, we could have a staking mechanism. For example, as a verifier, you have a stake of, let’s say, a thousand dollars; you assess different people who come to you, and then this assessment is public. If someone can find that you’ve assessed someone incorrectly, or they think that there was collusion, they can open up a dispute. If this dispute passes, you would have some portion of your deposit removed.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a very rudimentary idea; it has to be tested, it has to be evaluated in the real world because crypto-economics are hard algorithmic economic mechanisms. It’s more about experimentation and iteration than simply creating a great initial idea, but this shows that you can actually have some type of credential that is received through a decentralized mechanism. In that case, you don’t have the intermediary who awards that credential, and in the end, it’s cheaper. So, you can get the same degree or the same credential as a Computer Science Bachelor’s degree, but instead of spending a hundred thousand dollars, maybe you spend a hundred dollars for that assessment.</p>
<p>Mathieu: If you talk about working talent as an example; I totally agree with you. If you have the motivation and the curiosity to learn; if you have access to a computer and to the internet, you could pick up anything. It potentially could lower the value of a university degree, because you could look at this as,” Why am I spending tens of thousands of dollars every year to get this degree? And, when I do get the degree, it proves that you could read, you could write, you could do certain things, but it doesn’t really prove your skills at that point. Whereas, with the internet and access to so many different tools, you could think of an even better micro-transaction-driven skills model. In that model, you could get credentials for smaller things that actually showcase your skillset and suitability for a job, better than if you’re coming at it with a degree. In many cases, it could be: “Okay, it’s cool that you have a degree, but are you actually able to add value to what I’m trying to do?”</p>
<p>If I’m understanding where you’re going here, and going back to one of your comments earlier, there are two approaches. One is that existing institutions and organizations could innovate, and continue to drive down costs and solve economic inefficiencies. But, in your second model, this future-facing new paradigm model, this is where something like crypto-economics is interesting, because you could think of a proper incentive mechanism being put in place that will inherently increase the value of a credential that will come out of an ecosystem.</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes. Maybe to put it in a different format, we can think of different business models. You can get the same results or the same service by different business models. First, it is pipelining a business model, when you have a supplier that fits with a producer, and you have this production chain. At each step, you have some portion of transaction costs that are covering the trust problem, and connecting those different companies in that business model. Something like manufacturing is usually a pipeline business model, and you saw this through economies of scale. So, you build a larger factory, and you have vertical integration, and it works.</p>
<p>What’s happening more and more, especially online, is that we see platform business models. That’s when the platform is not actually producing the product or the service; it’s acting as a facilitator. It connects producers with sellers and with buyers, and the value creation is happening outside the platform. The platform business model is more efficient, because you have a direct relationship between the buyer and the seller. The platform takes a small cut on each transaction, because they provide some guarantee that those sellers are valid or licensed or whatever. If we continue this model, the next step would be a decentralized business model.</p>
<p>That business model is also a peer-to-peer connection, but in that case, the platform is not existent anymore. Instead of a platform, we have a decentralized service. What that does economically, is that the fee that Uber, or the App Store was taking is reduced to the marginal cost of providing or running that smart contract, if it’s a smart contract that connects drivers with a decentralized Uber, as an example.</p>
<p>That model might not make sense for Uber or for other types of business. For example, you wouldn’t build a decentralized steel mill; it wouldn’t work, or it wouldn’t be more efficient than the traditional one. For Uber, it might not be the best example because of a lot of regulation, and it’s still a real-world business. However, it makes sense for anything that is done purely online. Maybe for Uber, an example would be that drivers have their own DIDs, and they have verifiable credentials that prove that they have a car; and its technical status — that it’s operational and working fine. It could include their driving license, their criminal history, Know Your Customer information, and so on. Then, it could be a smart contract; it could be your own chain; it could be a purely SSI system that is working off-chain; you might have multiple user interfaces or apps that allow you, as a passenger, to find the driver. In that system, instead of Uber’s fixed fee, or however much they charge, the marginal cost of each ride can be reduced to, let’s say, half of that, because you only need to essentially fund the gas for that smart contract. Put simply; if it’s an open-source development and maybe a UI or an app that provides a user interface, that might take a small cut. But, it’s definitely much lower than Uber, because it’s a much more competitive market: the protocol and the underlying data are public, and anyone can build an app that uses the same underlying data.</p>
<p>Another way to look at these crypto-economic mechanisms is in terms of how they enable either better service or the same kind of service, but at a lower price through this change of the business model — essentially, through disintermediation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s super interesting. I’m quite a fan of being able to properly understand the pipe versus platform, the business models, and the differentiations. When you’re starting a business or looking at your own business — and I am — I love some of the writing that Sam Smith has done on the platform business models, as well; it’s all about reducing transaction costs. That leads to more of a network of networks effect, and you’re reducing trust costs; you’re able to leverage each other’s networks. I think for both of us, that is what’s super exciting, and how we’re trying to build the foundation to strive towards that.</p>
 SSI Momentum 
<p>I think it’s clear to say that we see significant momentum in the SSI space. There’s a lot of activity happening; there’s more money going into it. This week, there was an announcement from Microsoft that they’re going to be leveraging ID proofing companies’ technologies in order to then issue a verifiable credential inside of their authenticator app. There are clear efficiencies in that too, and that’s an example of what’s happening right now. What’s your view on the space right now? What’s exciting?</p>
<p>I know there are many projects that you’re familiar with; whether it’s the US Department of Homeland Security, or activity that’s happened through MIT, or the <a href="https://northernblock.io/digital-identity-in-canada/">Canadian government is doing interesting stuff.</a> What’s your view on that space right now?</p>
<p>I’ll add a second question on top of that; who absorbs the cost for these ecosystem solutions?</p>
<p>That’s kind of a big theme. We could go one at a time here, but this is another thought: if you are developing these ecosystem solutions, whether it’s government or private sector. Who’s benefiting from this? Who absorbs the costs? I would love to hear your thinking around that.</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes. I agree that the momentum is picking up. I’ve been involved in the SSI industrial market for about three years at this point, and I think the growth that has been happening in the last three to six months is accelerating. The pandemic was definitely a catalyst for some of those changes. One of the products that we developed is called ‘Safe Travel,’ and it’s something that a lot of companies are doing, but I think we have quite a good momentum. It allows people to travel internationally with digital credentials. The main customers for those, are immigration authorities and airline companies, because they are the first players who demand people to have their vaccination records and pre-departure tests. They are the ones who are losing money, or creating public health problems if people are coming with fraudulent documents. It’s also an operational problem, because, for an airline company, it might take a few minutes to verify paper-based documents. This is especially true if it’s in a foreign language, or from some laboratory that you’re not even sure whether it exists. So, verifiable credentials are solving most of these issues.</p>
<p>I think that more and more countries, over the course of this and the next year, will be demanding digital healthcare documents for international travel. For example, in 2019, there were 1.5 billion people traveling internationally, and many of them were doing this multiple times a year. That means that most of those people, in a couple of years, will be users and customers of verifiable credentials or SSI products, and that is a huge adoption. That will happen much faster than some of the blockchain technologies, because cryptocurrency is probably more popular today, but it won’t be growing as fast. If your bank, and your visa card, and your mobile Fintech app work fine for you, then you don’t really need Bitcoin if you’re not an investor and don’t want to risk too much.</p>
<p>SSI can really grow quickly into every aspect of life. Every time you open a bank account, you’ll be giving a KYC document in the form of a credential. Every time you apply for a job, you will have a resume, or previous working history, or your education. For public credentials, you can have pretty much any kind of government documents, from parking tickets, to business licenses, to customs documents, or healthcare. There are a lot of applications; we could spend a full hour discussing those.</p>
<p>So, the potential is there. I think that things like the desire, and the need to open up international trade and travel, but at the same time doing that safely, are some of the important catalysts to spark this growth. It was happening organically. I remember at the last IIW (Internet Identity Workshop), people were talking about use cases; we need more use cases. Everyone talks about technology, and technology is not as hard. It’s much harder to get the business model right and to get adoption. Now, we see much better solutions to that problem, but it’s obviously still in the early stages.</p>
<p>To address your second point about the costs; in my opinion, it depends, but usually, it’s the Verifier who’s benefiting the most. Therefore, they are the one who is paying for the system, but not always. You can think of the SSI system as a closed system: you have a platform or an application, and you have Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers. In that case, usually, it’s the Verifier who’s paying, but not always. They are getting the most value out of the system in most cases, because it’s an optimization and increasing transparency for their business process.</p>
<p>The second option is to have a network approach, where it’s not necessarily one of those three who’s paying for the system. Rather, it’s a network, and the network of networks of different verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>We’re having a few discussions on this topic at DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation), and we started this group called VC Marketplace. The idea is, how can we design a system that allows different Issuers and Verifiers who are not familiar with each other to participate in the same network. To build on the same example of what Microsoft is doing: let’s say, I’m a bank in Canada, and I want to verify the identity of a new customer. I don’t want to build the system for people to acquire those KYC credentials; in fact, I can accept anything that fits certain criteria. That means that this bank can publish a record in that marketplace, saying that we are paying one dollar to any KYC provider who creates a KYC-VC. Then, as a customer, I go to the marketplace, I choose the one that I like the most out of the list, and they can be part of the same network. They can be all partners of Microsoft, or they can be completely independent companies that have some decision capabilities. They’re not necessarily connected because of the niche, but because of the openness and interoperability of the protocol, this would work. Therefore, there’s no need for direct interactions, and then those marketplaces can be decentralized, and they can also have a reputation system within them.</p>
<p>So, you can have 100 different KYC providers, but as a bank, you can say that I’m only trusting the top 50 because there’s been a lot of issuance and verification, and there’s no problem with that data. As a result, we will probably see the cost of a KYC credential going down. Today, we have companies such as Onfido, who are huge and almost have a monopoly. They can set prices for issuance, even though it costs them nothing. The first time they do KYC, they need to verify, but the second time, it’s almost free for them. They still charge, but as the competition increases and the market becomes more efficient, that would drive the cost of issuance down. That’s one example.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s where, for your verifiable credential marketplace idea, it comes back to governance. You mentioned governance earlier as being one of the areas that perhaps requires a little more innovation, and a little more thinking and investment to allow these types of things to happen. I do agree with you on KYC or ID proofing: it’s logical that as these solutions become more and more commoditized, the price keeps going down. Although, it would be nice to be in that space today, and raise 300 million dollars on a crazy valuation. It will be interesting to see how they adapt as things are changing. From my perspective, a lot of the use cases are compliance-driven today. When you talk about the COVID credentials, or the basic ID credentials such as KYC; it’s all compliance-driven.</p>
<p>The interesting thing once you’ve been able to solve a compliance problem is, “Now, how do I extend that, and how do I start tying this original identity credential to further transactions and create traceability in the value chain?” I think that’s an area where there was innovation, or a lot of trial-and-error that was happening with blockchain. But, that’s where I think that traceability is an issue that, for me, SSI is the solution for that property.</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes, and I think the reason it is starting with compliance is that we need to change the perception of what verifiable credentials are today. For most people, it’s blockchain; it’s some technology that no one understands how it works, but you need to invest in this. From the average corporation standpoint (not an IT corporation), it’s something that we need to do, but we don’t understand. As a bank, it will possibly somehow solve our business problems, but we’re not sure. The problem is that the very public credentials are addressing the notion of trust, and trust is such a basic concept that it’s existed for millennia. When the first item, maybe a document that was signed by the king, or some other type of official document; that was the first trust transmission systems. You had people on horses who were distributing different orders from monarchs, and it was hard to change. Today, most people believe that you can trust information either if it’s nice-looking paper; it has a stamp and a wet signature, or if it’s coming from an official email address.</p>
<p>The notion of a cryptographic signature is a little complicated. If we start with compliance use cases, and if this is accepted by someone big, like a government, or immigration authorities, or banks, that would change this perception. I think what we want to achieve as an industry is this equality between a legally valid document and a verifiable credential. It’s maybe not 100 percent correct, but that’s a good starting point. After that, the main positive property that verifiable credentials have, and also other decentralized technologies such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), or NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens), or blockchains have, is that you can stack those one on top of another. So, if someone develops an MD5 protocol like Uniswap, because it’s open-source someone else can go and develop a yearn.finance which helps you to be more efficient in providing liquidity. Then, someone can build something on top of that, which makes it easier to work with a specific asset. It’s the same for verifiable credentials, because it’s intrinsically interoperable. Once you have those KYC documents, then you have a scoring of different KYC providers. You can have a different zero knowledge or a partial disclosure system that allows you to, for example, buy alcohol without revealing your name. The stacking property of decentralized technology is, ultimately, what in the long term will be differentiated from centralized KYC or a trusted data records system.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Stepan, I think we could go all day on that subject, and it would be something interesting to discuss in some forum. I want to thank you for doing this today. I think it was quite a deep and very interesting conversation. I really appreciate you sharing your thinking and your opinion on the space, and on all of this stuff. My last question is: when is this Clubhouse session happening? Let’s do something!</p>
<p>Stepan: Great Question! We need to have some active discussions happening, outside of conferences. There’s an IIW (Internet Identity Workshop) conference coming up. That would be a great community event. I’m very interested in organizing, or at least attending, a Clubhouse event on SSI. Moving forward, it could be an even split because SSI is actually quite a big area. There are more nuanced areas that deserve discussion and sharing of expertise.</p>
<p>Mathieu: &nbsp;Yes, I look forward to making that happen. We’ll try to move that forward. Thanks once again for doing this; this was phenomenal.</p>
<p>Stepan: Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Dock’s newest addition to the delegatable credentials feature now allows delegations to be publicly posted and searchable.</p><p>Since announcing our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/delegatable-credentials-now-available/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=more-features-added-to-delegatable-credentials/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=public-delegation-feature-released">delegatable credentials feature</a> in March 2021, the team at Dock has been working diligently to expand its capabilities. As discussed in the initial announcement, the first version of the feature provided the ability for an entity to delegate credential-issuing authority to another entity by issuing a verifiable credential (that serves as the proof of delegation) to the delegatee. In this version delegation was done in a private manner, with the details of delegation reflected only in the credential issued to the delegatee. This meant that, when the delegatee issued verifiable credentials to others on behalf of the delegator, the holders of these new credentials needed to bundle their credentials with the proof of delegation, and present these together when getting their credentials verified.</p><p>Our latest release, which we call Public Delegation, improves upon the existing feature by adding the following capabilities:</p>  Ability for delegators to publicly attest delegations by adding details of delegation to their &nbsp;DID documents on the Dock blockchain  Ability for credential verifiers to search for delegation details publicly posted on DID documents using a crawler  <p>These new capabilities remove the necessity for the credential holders to present the proof of delegation during the verification process, as verifiers can now search for and obtain the publicly posted delegation information.</p><p>To illustrate this in an example, let’s return to the scenario used in our previous delegatable credentials blog post: a government delegates credential-issuing authority to a private testing center, so that the latter can issue professional licenses to the individuals who qualify. With our updated delegatable credentials feature, the government has an option to include the details of the delegation on their <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_did.html">DID document</a> (which is publicly stored on the Dock network and describes the government’s decentralized identity (DID) on Dock) instead of issuing a verifiable credential (proof of delegation) to the testing center.</p><p>If the government does post the delegation details to the DID document, once the testing center issues verifiable credentials to the individuals who qualify, the holders of these new credentials no longer need to manage and present the proof of delegation as part of the verification process. Instead, the verifier can use the new crawler feature (which we call the “Curious Agent”) in our SDK to automatically seek out and fetch any delegation information on the DID documents associated with the credentials being verified, and determine whether the testing center has the proper authority to issue the credential on the government’s behalf. The result is a simplified credential management and verification experience.</p><p>You can learn more about the public delegation feature by reading our <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_public_delegation.html">concepts document</a> and <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorial_public_delegation.html">tutorial</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>What is left to say about PAM that has not already been said? Well in my opinion, quite a lot – as I hope you find out when you join me at the forthcoming KCLive Event, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/04/operationalizing-privileged-access-management" title="Operationalizing Privileged Access Management">Operationalizing Privileged Access Management.</a></p>
<p>I talk to PAM vendors all the time and I believe it is a truly exciting space to be covering and some of the innovations that vendors of all sizes are bringing to the table promise real progress in how we manage privilege access in the workplace – and, as you will discover, beyond the workplace.&nbsp;</p>
 Punching above its weight 
<p>PAM is not by a long chalk the biggest revenue earner in Access Management, but it punches above its weight in contributing to security and governance, and that’s why new vendors are entering the market and private investors are getting more involved. Already this year we have seen the merger of two of the biggest players in the market, Thycotic and Centrify, who hope to piggyback on each other’s strengths to build a super player to take on the current market leader CyberArk. When I spoke to senior people at Thycotic recently they were bullish and excited about the coming together of the two entities which will have solutions for both SMBs and enterprise. We look forward to developments there and its impact on the market.</p>
 Capital investment into identity 
<p>But private money flowing into the market has been accompanied by movement within the industry as CyberArk, for example, after acquiring iDaptive in 2020 is now heavily trailing its expertise in “Identity Security” in its marketing? At the same time, Okta has added PAM capability to its Identity Management toolkit. Is this a trend, how will it affect traditional PAM? I will be providing some answers at KC Live.</p>
<p>I will also be looking at the impact events and trends are having on PAM, not the least of which was the pandemic and the shift to remote working. The impact of working from home is something we have been talking about a lot recently, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/wfh-trends-2021" title="including this podcast">including this podcast</a> with my KuppingerCole colleagues, Matthias Reinwarth and Annie Bailey.</p>
<p>I am sure that many remote endpoints are now better protected than they were 12 months ago – but you can also find out why EPM must now be accompanied by Remote Privileged Access (RPA) – which is the same but different.</p>
 Millennial focused tech is influencing PAM 
<p>The influence of consumer tech and millennial choice is having an impact in enterprise IT and perhaps a little belatedly PAM is catching up. We are seeing much improved UX and UI designs from vendors with button and menus replacing CLI and clunky windows. This had to happen. Such is the need for PAM across the enterprise that we need ordinary users to be able to do some of the management tasks normally reserved for admins (under pressure to perform too many tasks). I will bring you up to date on this and other PAM product developments at the KCLive Event. And don’t worry, I will of course talk a little about DevOps! I am looking forward to meeting you on the day.</p>

 “Just setting up my&nbsp;twttr”   Jack Patrick Dorsey, first tweet in Twitter,&nbsp;2006  <p>Fifteen years ago, Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey posted the very first tweet (beginning of “tweet”) on Twitter. This famous tweet was converted into a non-replaceable owner’s certificate token (NFT — Non-Fungible Token) which was auctioned for about 2.9 million dollars (about 3.27 billion won). It is not known whether this is an artistic act or a new form of digital ownership, but people have realized that NFTs could be a new opportunity.</p><p>With the recent rise of bitcoin in 2021, the blockchain market has become the spotlight. The need for the blockchain industry and ecosystem is expanding. Here, the ecosystem refers to a group of blockchain networks in which several companies gather a common service rather than a single&nbsp;company.</p><p>As the number of cryptocurrency projects gradually increase, ecosystems are beginning to take shape in new forms such as DTT, DID, and NFT, depending on the use of the service, but realistically dynamic services performed on one consortium blockchain is difficult to migrate to other blockchain platforms.</p><p>Currently, the most widely used blockchain platform for issuing NFT is Ethereum. When issuing NFTs through an open blockchain such as Ethereum, uniqueness is guaranteed to be decentralized. If so, will Ethereum be enough? The biggest problem with Ethereum is the gas fee. The price of Ethereum is currently over $2,400. In addition, the limitations of the network’s scalability led to an increase in gas&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Ethereum Gas Price these&nbsp;days</p><p>Of course, there are also NFTs issued through closed (permitted) blockchains. The closed blockchain is managed by a reliable central authority. We are then left to believe in the institutions and expect them to manage our assets responsibly. To solve this problem, the consortium chain, which is disconnected from the main network, guarantees data integrity through anchoring, but the data in the consortium chain is not transparent to everyone, thus subject to opaque/incomplete blockchain that includes the possibility of manipulation.</p><p>Aergo has conducted research to solve this problem through an ingenious method called the Merkle&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-aergo-merkle-bridge-explained-d95f7dcec510">Merkle Bridge A convenient way of bridging side chains for state-Merkelized blockchains.</a></p><p>The Merkle Bridge enables the movement of data-proven assets through merkle tree proof while maintaining the loosely-coupled state between chains. Merkle Bridge is more flexible than Plasma, more secure and decentralized than using a&nbsp;broker.</p><p>Aergo-Aergo Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p><p>Our partner Blocko has previously created Merkle Bridge and is in the process of rebuilding on the test network so that it can be used for future NFTs. Various data from Aergo Enterprise, including DTT, are expected to be transmitted to and utilized by Aergo Mainnet and cross-species public blockchains through the new Merkle Bridge. Recently, with the 2.2.8 patch, AERGO-AERGO Merkle Bridge has completed the task to pass AERGO&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.2.8">https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.2.8</a></p><p>Aergo Merkle Bridge featuring NFT</p><p>Merkle Bridge can be used not only for Tokens but also for information exchange. Information such as DID and TSA can be moved or utilized between heterogeneous networks. This can be seen as a kind of Smart Oracle between networks. We will be able to transfer important assets normally stored in Ethereum to the Aergo network and use them for day trading at low fees. In addition, NFTs issued by various central institutions on its own blockchain network, can also be transferred to ‘user owned’ wallets on the Aergo Network or Ethereum using Merkle&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>Aergo is exploring various business opportunities, including NFT. In the future, businesses may enjoy Aergo Inter-Blockchain Communication service by using Merkle Bridge to deliver NFT or TSA information issued by the sidechain to the main&nbsp;network.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-merkle-bridge-what-else-is-needed-for-nft-c5170502da3a">Aergo Merkle Bridge: What else is needed for NFT?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For the first time, a US national privacy law looks&nbsp;likely—and soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s been&nbsp;serious&nbsp;movement from both sides&nbsp;of the political divide, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">strong and increasing action from some states</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US has&nbsp;long&nbsp;been lagging behind the rest of the world&nbsp;in this.&nbsp;It’s one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It almost goes without saying now that privacy laws are essential for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/reasons-why-privacy-rights-are-important/">many reasons</a>&nbsp;not least of which is that in an increasingly digitized world, businesses simply must be better stewards of the vast volumes of users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>, to uphold the fundamental human right to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and to protect users from harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For consumers, the delay&nbsp;in getting a national law&nbsp;has not been for want of trying. They’ve&nbsp;long been&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">calling for change</a>&nbsp;to how companies treat their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;In 2019,&nbsp;Pew Research&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Pew-Research-Center_PI_2019.11.15_Privacy_FINAL.pdf">75 percent</a>&nbsp;of consumers want more privacy online.&nbsp;A US national privacy law is no longer about&nbsp;if&nbsp;but&nbsp;when.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a&nbsp;national privacy law would&nbsp;not only bring the US more into line with most other major economies it would&nbsp;establish&nbsp;a uniform set of data privacy rights for consumers and a single set of rules for business.&nbsp;While&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state-level action</a>&nbsp;is applaudable—California and Virginia now have comprehensive privacy laws and we’re watching&nbsp;several&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">other states</a>&nbsp;with interest—only a federal law could offer blanket&nbsp;data protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commentators on this issue are feeling optimistic, particularly&nbsp;this year,&nbsp;because&nbsp;from the&nbsp;plethora of federal privacy bills&nbsp;put forward, there are&nbsp;three standouts:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/COPRA%20Bill%20Text.pdf">Consumer&nbsp;Online&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;Rights&nbsp;Act</a>&nbsp;(COPRA)&nbsp;(Democrats)&nbsp;–&nbsp;Sponsored&nbsp;in November 2019 by Democratic Senator&nbsp;Maria Cantwell of Washington,&nbsp;this bill&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">considered by some</a>&nbsp;to be&nbsp;“GDPR-esque”&nbsp;and more consumer than business friendly.&nbsp;The bill requires&nbsp;“entities that process or transfer a consumer’s data to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  make their privacy policy publicly available and provide an individual with access to their personal&nbsp;data;&nbsp;  delete or correct, upon request, information in an individual’s&nbsp;data;&nbsp;  export, upon request, an individual’s data in a human-readable and machine-readable&nbsp;format;&nbsp;  establish data security practices to protect the confidentiality and accessibility of consumer data; and&nbsp;  designate a privacy officer and a data security officer to implement and conduct privacy and data security programs and risk assessments.”&nbsp;  



<p>The bill will also stop those entities from:&nbsp;</p>



  “engaging in deceptive or harmful data&nbsp;practices;&nbsp;  transferring an individual’s data to a third party if the individual&nbsp;objects;&nbsp;  processing or transferring an individual’s sensitive data without affirmative express&nbsp;consent;&nbsp;  processing or transferring data beyond what is reasonably necessary or for which they have obtained affirmative express&nbsp;consent;&nbsp;  processing or transferring data on the basis of specified protected characteristics (e.g., race, religion, or gender);&nbsp;  conditioning the provision of a service or product on an individual’s agreement to waive their privacy rights; and&nbsp;  retaliating against an employee who provides information about a potential violation of the bill’s provisions, or who testifies or assists in an investigation or judicial proceeding concerning such a violation.”&nbsp;  



<p>If this bill succeeds, it&nbsp;would&nbsp;require the Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;to&nbsp;establish a new bureau to&nbsp;help enforce the provisions.&nbsp;Read what the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/sen-cantwell-leads-new-consumer-data-privacy-bill">EFF has to say about COPRA</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting an American Framework to Ensure Data Access, Transparency and Accountable Ability Act (<a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/BD190421-F67C-4E37-A25E-5D522B1053C7">SAFE DATA&nbsp;Act</a>) (GOP)&nbsp;– Combining three previous bills, the SAFE DATA&nbsp;Act&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">considered by some</a>&nbsp;as more “business friendly”. It is&nbsp;well summarized in&nbsp;<a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/10/what-tech-companies-need-to-know-about-the-safe-data-act/">this article</a>&nbsp;from Security Boulevard:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This law&nbsp;would expand what’s considered sensitive data and include enacting data security standards to accompany data privacy standards. It would create rights to transparency, access, deletion, correction, and portability and require opt-in consent to process or transfer “sensitive covered data.” Under this law, businesses would need to name privacy and data security officers within their firms and meet “reasonable” and “appropriate” data security requirements&nbsp;…&nbsp;This bill introduces an algorithmic ranking system to determine how content can be presented to consumers. It also establishes regulations for the “manipulation of user interfaces”, which prevents deceptive UIs from coercing customers into giving up personal data.&nbsp;The SAFE DATA Act would be enforced by the FTC and state attorney’s general, take precedence over state privacy laws, such as CCPA, and would not include a private right of action.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAPP provides this handy infographic&nbsp;to show the combining of three bills into&nbsp;the&nbsp;SAFE&nbsp;DATA Act:&nbsp;</p>











<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/consolidating-u-s-privacy-legislation-the-safe-data-act/">IAPP</a>.&nbsp;Read what the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/consolidating-u-s-privacy-legislation-the-safe-data-act/">IAPP says about the SAFE DATA&nbsp;Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740">Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Re-introduced by&nbsp;Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (WA-01)&nbsp;for the fourth time (the latest&nbsp;on March 10, 2021),&nbsp;<a href="https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740">this bill</a>&nbsp;“…&nbsp;protects personal information including data relating to financial, health, genetic, biometric, geolocation, sexual orientation, citizenship and immigration status, Social Security Numbers, and religious beliefs. It also keeps information about children under 13 years of age safe.”Beyond this it requires businesses to write their privacy policies in simple language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DelBene’s&nbsp;<a href="https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740">outlines the&nbsp;key elements</a>&nbsp;of the Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act&nbsp;as:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plain English: Requires companies to provide their privacy policies in “plain English” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Opt-in: Allows users to “opt-in” before companies can use their most sensitive private information in&nbsp;ways&nbsp;they might not expect&nbsp;</p>



<p>Disclosure: Increases transparency by requiring companies to disclose if and with whom their personal information will be shared and the purpose of sharing the information&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preemption: Creates a unified national standard and avoids a patchwork of different privacy standards by preempting conflicting state laws&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enforcement: Gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) strong rulemaking authority to keep up with evolving digital trends and the ability to fine bad actors on the first offense. Empowers state attorneys general to also pursue violations if the FTC chooses not to act&nbsp;</p>



<p>Audits: Establishes strong “privacy hygiene” by requiring companies to submit privacy audits every 2 years from a neutral third party.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Enforced by the FTC, this bill also requires the FTC to&nbsp;hire 500 additional&nbsp;staff&nbsp;to&nbsp;focus on privacy and data security issues, 50 with technical expertise in the area, plus for the FTC to receive $350 million to implement the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If enacted,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.databreachtoday.com/federal-privacy-bill-reintroduced-in-congress-a-16178">Omer&nbsp;Tene, VP of the IAPP</a>, says: “This will place the FTC at the forefront of the global regulatory effort to implement data protection laws and develop privacy policies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What would consumers get out of a national privacy law?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We agree with this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">commentator’s&nbsp;</a>perspective on what a US national privacy law will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">need to offer</a>&nbsp;consumers:&nbsp;</p>



  Capacity to opt out of forming long-term relationships with companies for one-off transactions&nbsp;  Freedom from needing to choose services and providers based on location, especially if a US national law works in with the GDPR&nbsp;  New ways to engage with business for those willing to give companies access to their data (new business models emerging from this leveraging of personal information).&nbsp;  



<p>When we forecast where&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">privacy&nbsp;will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the next&nbsp;10 years</a>, we said that we believe by 2030 “opt out” won’t mean “miss out” and big tech will have abandoned the mantra that if you are not charged for the product, you are the product.&nbsp;We foresaw&nbsp;the regulatory environment supporting&nbsp;these changes,&nbsp;with&nbsp;consumers demanding&nbsp;to have their data collected but forgotten and&nbsp;legislation making this possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, we’re really seeing some&nbsp;evolution in this space.&nbsp;Let’s see how much longer this takes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a lot of feedback from the wider community. One of the most common complaints, especially from crypto day traders, is that we do not do enough marketing.</p><p>I call bullshit.</p><p>I don’t tend to cuss, but marketing before your product is available is a recipe for disaster. Holo is not a hype company, we are in this for the long haul. We are a real enterprise doing the work to build and deliver the infrastructure and applications that will power a distributed hosting platform for peer-to-peer applications. This may not sound electrifying, but it does address a real need because blockchains cannot get it all done. Some of the benefits of blockchains such as the supposed decentralisation, transparency of transactions, and the data integrity provided by the validated transactions are not worth the energy costs involved. We know this because of the gap between promises and what has been delivered to the larger world. While the business world has taken note of blockchain because of the hype, it will not get all the innovation value in the long term simply because blockchains are not efficient.</p><p>So back to the marketing. Holo has an adoption strategy which is a long term proposition. When companies like Microsoft and Amazon (yes the behemoth that many of you hope that we can eventually topple) lost the vast majority of their value after the dot-com bust — they did not go under. That is because they had focus and flexibility. They knew that what they were building had real demand and real potential. They along with other notable organisations, like StubHub who incorporated in the month prior to the first crash in 2000, succeeded not because of their marketing spend but because they focused on the real needs of their customers. The companies that played into the hype and spent millions on marketing campaigns and splashy parties are the ones who disappeared. These companies wasted their resources before they had a product and they&nbsp;failed.</p><p>I want to talk a bit about the global market adoption strategy for Holo&nbsp;now.</p><p>It’s all about Holochain.</p><p>Holo is a marketplace for hosting Holochain applications. Nothing matters more for Holo’s success than people learning how to build and then building Holochain applications that can and will be hosted on Holo. So here is what we will be doing to build long term&nbsp;success:</p>  Contracting one of the best Security Review teams in the world to provide the security audit of Holochain and Holo technology  Ensuring that when we go live, US customers can purchase HOT at exchanges so they can participate in the Holo ecosystem  Providing self-service access to developer materials, such as API documentation  Delivering developer resources and programs that are available 24x7  Supplying a lot of sample code that’s simple to try&nbsp;out  Providing quality tech support (specific to developer issues) with quick turnaround  <p>What we have been doing these past months while we’ve been quiet about our adoption strategy, is working to build out our foundations. We’ve outlined plans for content, completed developer segmentation analysis, defined developer journeys and value propositions, set ourselves up to be in a continuous learning process through analytics and user research and we’ve also built up a cohesive core community. Moving into full binary releases for Holochain will mean more content, more meetups, more dev camps, more programs, more videos, more clear community guidelines, and more tools, all of which will directly lead to growing the capacity for developers to build&nbsp;apps.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months we have announcements planned that will touch aspects of our websites, educational programs, and online communities. We have plans for hosts, developers and the end users of peer-to-peer apps. We are also going to promote and support the accomplishments of the projects building on Holochain. And when the time comes we will promote the learning programs and the projects that will catalyse the foundations and infrastructure of the entire ecosystem. We have strategies for global PR and for localised community growth. We will walk before we run. We will learn from the programs we launch and we will automate for scale when the programs are hugely successful.</p><p>To reiterate… we won’t be shilling, promoting or otherwise marketing our token, and if you ever see anyone using our name or logo to do so, be aware of them as scammers and report&nbsp;them.</p><p>That sums it up. <br>Look for a few updates and announcements later this&nbsp;week.</p><p>Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/no-hype-holos-global-adoption-strategy-f845cf563bdf">No-Hype: Holo’s Global Adoption Strategy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Maybe you’re a charity looking to give people a passive way to contribute through their spending.</p><p>And there will be countless compelling use cases none of us have yet thought&nbsp;of.</p><p>For GlobaliD, the vision of Instant Issuance is that anyone can create a Group, connect a wallet to that Group, and issue a branded payments card to Group&nbsp;members.</p><p>With the launch of <a href="https://aptopayments.com/instant-issuance/">Apto’s Instant Card Issuance platform</a>, we’re one step closer to that&nbsp;vision.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1384636232303398916">Greg Kidd</a>, co-founder of Apto Payments, co-founder and CEO of GlobaliD:</p><blockquote>Congrats to Apto Payments for bringing Instant Issuance of payment cards to market. This empowers developers for issuing cards the same way that Stripe empowered developers a decade ago for accepting cards. Super powerful.</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apto-payments-launches-instant-issuance-platform-301272296.html">the announcement</a>:</p><blockquote>Apto Payments, a next-generation cards and payments company, today announced the launch of its <a href="https://aptopayments.com/instant-issuance/">Instant Issuance platform</a>, a self-serve, developer platform that allows companies, merchants, financial institutions, and businesses of all sizes and industries to issue debit cards. With Instant Issuance, card programs for challenger banks, employee payroll, rewards and loyalty programs, and many other use cases can be built with just a few hours of development.</blockquote><blockquote>Designed with developers in mind, the Instant Issuance platform offers a frictionless, self-serve experience that allows companies to quickly bring their card programs to market. While card issuance is often a slow and complex process, Apto’s Instant Issuance platform allows developers to start working in sandbox within minutes. The platform also makes it seamless and easy to switch from development to production, customize cards, onboard users, and track sign-ups and revenue. Going from sign-up to having physical cards in the hands of users can happen in as little as a&nbsp;week.</blockquote><p>Meg Nakamura, co-founder and CEO of Apto Payments:</p><blockquote>“Historically, card issuance has required immense time and resources just to establish relationships with the requisite players, deal with compliance hurdles, and, finally, initiate the program. At Apto, we believe card issuance is overdue for an update. With our Instant Issuance platform, we are not only making the process easier, but fairer and more equitable.”</blockquote><p>Check out <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apto-payments-launches-instant-issuance-platform-301272296.html">the full announcement</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-apto-payments-launches-instant-card-issuance-3a3397e8613a">Partner Spotlight: Apto Payments launches Instant Card Issuance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Over 4,000 developers use <a href="https://usedevbook.com/">Devbook</a> to make them more productive.</p><p>Learn how Devbook chose Magic to onboard users with the least amount of friction possible and achieved over 90% conversion rate.</p> In search of a seamless auth&nbsp;solution <p>Devbook is a search engine, purpose-built for developers. With keyboard shortcuts, you can easily search Stack Overflow and documentation directly without leaving your IDE (integrated development environment). It works similar to Spotlight on&nbsp;macOS.</p><p>The idea for Devbook came from the two co-founders’ own pain points. As developers themselves, <a href="https://twitter.com/mlejva">Vasek Mlejnsky</a> and Tomas Valenta realized they spent more and more time searching for answers to questions on Google or in 3rd party tools. Context switching from code to browser slowed them down, and they became inspired to solve this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>When Vasek was considering authentication, the team was already migrating away from Firebase completely, after deciding not to use their functions and database. The challenge was to find the right authentication service that felt as intuitive to implement and use, particularly as their users are time-strapped developers.</p><blockquote>“From the start, we knew it would be a bad idea to build auth from scratch. We didn’t have several weeks to spend only on that. There are so many possible security headaches, and we’re not security engineers.”</blockquote><p>Rolling their own authentication system was never considered an option. The rationale? Time and speed. The sheer number of weeks and cycles that would have been spent on auth and security was too high an opportunity cost for their lean&nbsp;team.</p><p>In the beginning, Vasek explored Okta and Auth0 and came to the same conclusion: both options felt geared towards enterprises and were not a good fit for a small, fast-growing startup. From pricing to complex documentation, neither felt like friendly solutions that could scale with the hypergrowth they were aiming&nbsp;for.</p><p>With auth, their top priorities were&nbsp;to:</p>  Drive user activation  Offer a great onboarding experience (especially important for a desktop&nbsp;app)  Avoid vendor&nbsp;lock-in   Enter Magic <p>When Vasek discovered Magic, he immediately saw the benefits of passwordless login. The technology stood out as “forward-thinking”, leveraging blockchain-based, public-private key cryptography rather than traditional user-set credentials.</p><blockquote>“Magic was exciting! We wanted to try out something new, something that feels like the app we are developing comes from the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><p>In just a matter of days, the Devbook team made the switch and successfully implemented Magic auth by following the simple, straightforward <a href="https://docs.magic.link/">docs</a>.</p><p>See the end-to-end onboarding experience below — better yet, download Devbook <a href="https://usedevbook.com/">here</a> and try out the product for&nbsp;free.</p> Significant boost to conversion <p>The results far exceeded Vasek’s expectations. Since launch, conversion rate has surpassed 90% with no signs of slowing down. Users have shared overwhelmingly positive feedback.</p><blockquote>“We’ve been asking users how much they like the passwordless login and so far literally 100% of those we asked like it a&nbsp;lot!”</blockquote><p>With Magic, the Devbook team saved valuable time and bandwidth, freeing up focus for them to be more ambitious with their plans to rapidly iterate on the core product. Perhaps most importantly, their users — developers of all levels, from beginners to advanced — are enthusiastic about the ability to log in seamlessly without needing passwords.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-devbook-switched-from-firebase-auth-to-maximize-conversion-rate-with-magic-58faa7bc3f6a">How Devbook switched from Firebase Auth to maximize conversion rate with Magic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Over the past number of years, and particularly last year with the rise of DeFi, Ethereum’s network has been inefficient and troublesome for users to work with. This has been true in the world of tokenized securities, and also for others in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we recently partnered with Polygon, the layer 2 protocol building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. This partnership will accelerate the adoption of security tokens and open new business models for industry actors.</p>
<p>Here are five key reasons why we partnered with Polygon and what it means for the ecosystem:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 1. Cheaper 
<p>The transaction fees are 10000 times cheaper on Polygon compared to Ethereum.</p>

		 
	 
                               
	 
		 
			 2. Faster 
<p>The transaction speed on Polygon is &lt;5 sec which is very quick compared to Ethereum, where users need to wait for &gt;1 min most of the time.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 3. Scalable 
<p>Polygon is scalable, capable of &gt;10k tx/s per sidechain, and is able to use multiple side chains to multiply the maximum throughput while Ethereum is currently limited to 15tx/s.</p>

		 
	 
                               
	 
		 
			 4. Easy-to-use 
<p>Users can still use Metamask and other Ethereum wallets, they just need to switch the network to Polygon.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 5. Interoperable 
<p>Polygon is based on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which means that it leverages the security of Ethereum and everything that was developed to work with the Ethereum blockchain is 100% compatible with the Polygon network, including ONCHAINID.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			<p>As a result of the partnership we recommend Polygon’s Ethereum layer 2 solution to security token issuers. Our customers can now benefit from the security of Ethereum’s decentralized network whilst executing token transfers in under 3 seconds and for 1 cent.</p>

		 
	 
          
	 
		 
			 Compliant securities transfers and management on Polygon 

		 
	 
      &lt; 3 seconds / transaction         &lt; $0.01 / transaction         Secured by 91 validators and 6,000+ nodes

Then the carbon is published for sale to carbon buyers, thus generating income for the&nbsp;farmers.</p><p>Farmers will now also be able to publish their carbon data for sale on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>. Carbon datapools become an additional source of income for farmers working with DOVU, on top of their carbon sales, and provide valuable insight to researchers or the industry into carbon farming practices. The collaboration expands the list of potential data sources on Ocean Market, an open-source community marketplace for&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>We’re pleased to welcome this new stream of data to Ocean Market. By bringing carbon data from DOVU farmers onto Ocean Market, Ocean Protocol continues its mission to bring data sovereignty to the world — in this case, to agriculture. DOVU data has utility for both research and industry to gain insights into agricultural practices and its impact on the environment. Ocean Protocol will allow for AI models to train on the data in a privacy-preserving manner.</blockquote><blockquote>Sheridan Johns, Head of Ecosystem at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Ocean Protocol will also be leveraging the DOVU Carbon Offset Platform to give the Ocean community insights as to how they can reduce their carbon footprint.</p><blockquote>As DOVU sources its own carbon supply the collection of data from our carbon suppliers is essential. This partnership will be welcomed by our farmers as a new source of revenue as well as our carbon buyers as it provides more visibility and therefore increases trust in the process. We also look forward to integrating the DOVU Carbon Offset solution within Ocean Protocol, offering all participants an opportunity to reduce their environmental impact.</blockquote><blockquote>Irfon Watkins, Founder of&nbsp;DOVU</blockquote><p>DOVU’s mission is to incentivize users to carbon offset their lives by capturing and rewarding value.

<p>The data privacy and information security company&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;has joined forces with UK consent&nbsp;and preference&nbsp;management platform (CPMP) provider&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital, adding a new solution to&nbsp;DataGuard’s fully integrated&nbsp;software suite&nbsp;and expanding its footprint&nbsp;in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new product offering, which will be&nbsp;called DataGuard Consent,&nbsp;is a&nbsp;cloud-based data platform&nbsp;that will be integrated into&nbsp;DataGuard’s all-in-one “Privacy-as-a-Service” solution&nbsp;immediately.&nbsp;DataGuard Consent&nbsp;puts people at the heart of their data. It gives them more control and helps build trust with the organisations they share it with – a critical component of long-term customer loyalty.&nbsp;Individuals&nbsp;can view the audit history of all the data an organisation has collected about them and have control over what is shared with third parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving consumers clarity&nbsp;and control over the use of their personal data is central to most privacy laws such as Europe’s GDPR, Brazil’s LGPD or California’s CCPA.&nbsp;Regulatory requirements&nbsp;to allow users to manage their consent&nbsp;are&nbsp;reinforced by consumer and governance pressures.&nbsp;Consent&nbsp;and preference management&nbsp;is clearly&nbsp;a compliance requirement, but as consumers demand more transparent and ethical practices, it also becomes a competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DataGuard Consent&nbsp;makes data collection part of the customer experience, only asking users for their information when it&nbsp;is really required&nbsp;so&nbsp;they are more willing to&nbsp;share&nbsp;their data&nbsp;–&nbsp;increasing&nbsp;opt-ins,&nbsp;boosting&nbsp;engagement, and&nbsp;improving&nbsp;compliance.&nbsp;The platform enables organisations to collect personal data,&nbsp;consent&nbsp;and preferences throughout the consumer relationship,&nbsp;and to&nbsp;host self-service portals across all potential touchpoints.&nbsp;It&nbsp;also has&nbsp;several revenue-enhancing, easy to implement applications for marketing teams to generate greater insights and data usage across their customer base.&nbsp;Via a&nbsp;flexible API,&nbsp;customers can easily&nbsp;link DataGuard Consent into their existing software landscape,&nbsp;including&nbsp;sales and marketing platforms such as Salesforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dataguard.co.uk/webinar/dataguard-consent">Join the Webinar</a>:&nbsp;DataGuard Consent: Best-in-Class Consent and Preference Management in Action on May 25th&nbsp;at&nbsp;10:00h EST /&nbsp;15:00h&nbsp;GMT / 16:00h CET&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DataGuard Consent centralises and synchronises an individual’s choices for data usage and gives a complete audit consent trail, maintaining compliance across most existing and upcoming regulatory frameworks which require consent (incl. EU GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and the&nbsp;ePrivacy&nbsp;Directive).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thomas Regier, DataGuard Co-Founder and Co-CEO: “We are thrilled to welcome the MLD team into DataGuard. Together, we will expand their strong customer base and help many more organisations across the globe become privacy compliant and generate value through transparency and&nbsp;consent.”&nbsp;<br>“The MLD team has built a best-in-class and highly scalable&nbsp;consent and preference management&nbsp;product that will be an integral element of our software suite –&nbsp;allowing&nbsp;us to extend DataGuard’s capabilities into another crucial area of the Privacy UX”,&nbsp;adds Kivanc Semen, DataGuard Co-Founder and Co-CEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jack Mason, Group CEO of MLD’s parent company Inc &amp; Co, says:&nbsp;“We are delighted to have found a fantastic home for&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital, whose technology empowers consumers to think ‘privacy first’ when shopping and doing business online.&nbsp;DataGuard&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital have synergies that will create a strong leader in the privacy and data protection arena, and I’m excited to follow their progress in the coming months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>MLD Co-Founder J&nbsp;Cromack, who&nbsp;was awarded Privacy &amp; Trust Champion by&nbsp;DataIQ&nbsp;in 2020, will become a key member of&nbsp;DataGuard’s&nbsp;leadership team.&nbsp;He&nbsp;says: “We are delighted to join the DataGuard team who have a shared vision and passion to protect the people behind the data. Together as one team, we now have&nbsp;the&nbsp;end-to-end data privacy journey covered for any organisation looking to enhance their data protection and privacy processes to gain competitive advantage. This is an exciting new chapter for the team.”&nbsp;</p>

 Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs — Nuclear Disarmament <p>Earlier, we saw what are <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a> (ZKPs) and the critical role they play in giving the necessary information without revealing the exact&nbsp;data.</p><p>In this article, let’s explore some futuristic possibilities of ZKP implementation.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how ZKPs can be used in nuclear disarmament?</p> Nuclear Weapons and their&nbsp;Danger <p>Nuclear weapons are undoubtedly one of the most dangerous weapons in the world as they have the potential to wipe out life from a vast area within no time. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are classic examples of the scale of destruction that’s possible.</p><p>Since World War II, many countries have built nuclear weapons to protect themselves and to display their growing might on the world stage. Since this poses a threat to international peace and stability, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was formulated.</p><p>This treaty has been signed by 189 countries (out of 197 countries) and has three main pillars — nonproliferation, disarmament, and peaceful use of nuclear technology.</p><p>Out of these, disarmament is the most contentious one, and let’s see if ZKPs can be a remedy for&nbsp;it.</p> How can ZKPs Help with Nuclear Disarmament? <p>The first and the most common question that comes up in this discussion is how <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-not-nuclear-disarmament">compliance with existing nuclear treaties can be verified</a>. An unofficial solution has been to check whether a nuclear-armed country is moving beyond the limits imposed by the treaty militarily. In particular, you’d want to know more about the nuclear head, its design, destruction capability, and exact location.</p><p>Now, how can you check this? One way is to ask this question to the head of the state of the country that’s planning this nuclear move. However, as you may expect, the chances of getting a direct answer are slim given the secrecy of these military operations.</p><p>You may argue that the other option is to send a crew of independent auditors to check, but the chances for them to come back alive is, let’s say&nbsp;minimal.</p><p>In such difficult circumstances, ZKPs can be the answer as they can give information about the nuclear warheads without revealing the actual design, which is often a closed secret. Essentially, zero-knowledge proofs can provide sufficient information to help a verifier decide whether two objects are the same without revealing their actual design or composition.</p><p>This idea is based on a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27649477/">breakthrough research</a> by researchers at the Princeton University, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering where they use binary assertions to validate the similarity of two physical&nbsp;objects.</p><p>Extending it to nuclear warheads, you can know if the design of a nuclear warhead has been changed or not without knowing the exact design, which is, of course, a matter of national security and could have serious ramifications if it gets into the wrong hands. Nuclear warheads are the key part of a nuclear weapon and it contains secret information about the destination, potency, and other details that give one country an edge over another in the event of a&nbsp;war.</p><p>Moving on to how ZKPs can be used in nuclear disarmament, Areg Danagoulian, an MIT Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering, has <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/laboratory-nuclear-security-and-policy-receives-32-million-nuclear-warhead-verification-1126">proposed</a> a way to probe using gamma rays and isotope-sensitive resonant processes that can be used to understand the internal structure of the nuclear bomb including the isotope mix and its shape. He and his team are exploring the possibility of using Zero Knowledge Proof to understand changes made to the nuclear&nbsp;warhead.</p><p>Essentially, the secret nuclear head data is transformed into a long value by encrypting them with a huge number, which is the key. The resulting data is indecipherable and only contains a long set of values that makes no sense to anyone seeing it. However, this long value changes when the data in the nuclear warhead&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Le’s say, for example, the nuclear warhead’s data on Jan 1, 2020, was fsdkfjafjajfkadjfklsfoery89ry913417918–18-e8970r369r6-aksalkndsandjadsfsdfgsgo2y23y130293=ejfkdjflkjf.</p><p>On June 28, 2020, it was jfhwoefhohffo0103910913–03msndfkflkefuerqurpwoq;wmddnfjkfhdnvmdfjfhjfhqo9urpdfa,fmdsmaksdmaksdmaiirpqoe</p><p>Though both the values are gibberish, it’s enough to know that the values are changed, so the design of the warhead has changed too. This is an example of the ZKP that only tells you what you need to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Under the terms of the treaty, every country is assigned a random cryptographic key that encrypts the information from the nuclear warhead at random intervals and sends it to a global Distributed Ledger Technology where every country is an entity. This way, the other countries can know that the nuclear warhead has changed and could take the agreed measures accordingly.</p><p>It’s important to note that these are possible theories and can become a reality when nuclear treaties provide a way to implement these ZKPs. But there’s hope that ZKPs are possibly the closest that we can come to living in a nuke-impact-free world.</p><p>Maybe a futuristic opportunity for your consideration?</p><p>In the meanwhile, to get a hands-on feel of what zero knowledge proofs and how to use them in your way, join our <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">PoCathon</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-2-nuclear-disarmament-abb5c879a7c5">Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs — Part 2: Nuclear Disarmament</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Quick Guide On OWallet Backup &amp;&nbsp;Recovery <p>This guide should help you get through backing up and recovering your wallet originally created with <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet</a>. Guide was prepared by your Telegram admin &amp; Ontology Harbinger <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>.</p> OWallet backup&nbsp;options <p>Before you create your first wallet address, you will be asked to select folder to store your keystore.db file. This file is a database of your private and public keys and can also help you to recover your wallets. However, it is not best option to use as primary&nbsp;backup.</p><p>Once you create new wallet, you will be asked to save your keystore&nbsp;.dat file, which by default, has same name as your wallet. For example, if your wallet name is Jack, the&nbsp;.dat file will be jack.dat. This file contains your wallet’s private key encrypted with password. To use it as a backup, you also need to remember or save the original password. If you have your&nbsp;.dat file, but do not remember the password, you will not be able to recover your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In addition, you can also save your private key in WIF format. This is a good option to store it as a recovery backup, because you don’t need to remember any additional passwords. The private key grants full access to the wallet, therefore, store it in a safe place and never share it with&nbsp;anyone!</p> How to restore the wallet if I have one of the above&nbsp;backups? <p>In case you have your keystore.db file, all you need to do is to click on settings in the lower left corner and change the keystore path to the folder where your file is located. This will load your wallet addresses protected with original passwords.</p><p>In case you have your&nbsp;.dat file backup, navigate to Wallets/Individual Wallet/Import wallet/Keystore (.dat). Here, set a new name for wallet, select&nbsp;.dat file and set original password to decrypt your&nbsp;.dat file. This option will import your wallet protected with the original password.</p><p>In case you have a private key as a backup of your wallet, navigate to Wallets/Individual Wallet/Import wallet/Private key (WIF). Here, set a new name for wallet, type in your WIF private key and set a new password.</p><p>Other import options, such as mnemonic phrases or private keys (64 Hex) serve for importing wallets created elsewhere. For instance, you can use mnemonic phrase to import wallet originally created in&nbsp;<a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a>.</p> That’s it! <p>Warning! Keep all your backups in a safe place. Never provide it to anyone, because who owns your backups has full control over your wallet. Anyone who asks for your backup details is SCAM. Stay&nbsp;safe!</p><p>If you have any questions, or to report missing or wrong content, or if you want to tip my wallet to buy me a cup of coffee, please reach me on <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter.</a> See&nbsp;you!</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

<p>Sevgili Ontolojistlere nihai stake etme kılavuzuna hoş geldiniz! Bu makale, başarılı bir stake etme deneyimine giden yolda ilerlemeniz için tüm stake etme sorularınıza cevap bulabileceğiniz bir yer olarak hizmet etmelidir. Bu makale, Telegram yöneticiniz ve Ontology Harbinger Dumont tarafından hazırlanmıştır ve yaşayan bir belge olarak düşünülmelidir, bu nedenle her zaman günceldir.</p> Bölüm 1:&nbsp;Teori  1.1) Stake&nbsp;nedir? <p>Staking, tokenlerinizi düğüme devretme işlemidir. Basitçe söylemek gerekirse, ONG ödülleri kazanmak için ONT jetonlarınızı kilitlediğiniz süreçtir. Stake edilmiş ONT tokenlerinizi asla kaybetmeyeceksiniz, çünkü node’lar stake edilmiş tokenları hiçbir zaman tutmaz veya yönetmez. Tek risk, aktif tüccarlar veya kısa vadeli sahipler için uygun olmayabilecek stake kilitleme süresi olabilir. Bir düğüm operatörü düğümünü iptal ederse, stake edilmiş tokenleriniz, hissenizi iptal etmişsiniz gibi davranacak ve ilgili kilit süresinden sonra talep edilebilecek.</p> 1.2) Blok ve fikir birliği turları&nbsp;nedir? <p>Blok, işlemlerle ilgili bilgileri depolayan blok zincirinin temel bir parçasıdır. Ontology’de 1 bloğun üretimi 1 saniyeden 30 saniyeye kadar sürüyor, yani birisi her saniye bir işlem yaparsa, blok her saniye üretilecek demektir. Karşılaştırma için, 1 bitcoin bloğunun üretimi yaklaşık olarak sürer. 10 dakika. Bu, Ontology blockchain’in ne kadar ultra hızlı olduğunu — neredeyse anında işlemlere sahip olduğunu gösteriyor. 30 saniye boyunca hiçbir işlem görünmezse, oybirliği turlarının sınırlı bir süre verirken akmasını sağlamak için boş bir blok üretilir. 1 konsensüs turunun 60000 bloktan oluştuğu belirlenmiştir. Basit hesaplama sayesinde, fikir birliği tur süresi 16,66 saatten 20,83 güne kadardır. Yani trafik ne kadar yüksekse, turlar o kadar hızlıdır. Şu anda bir konsensüs turunun ortalama süresi yaklaşık. 7 gün. Raundları izlemek için, son 5 raundun başlangıç / bitiş zamanlarını ve ayrıca yakl. mevcut turun sonuna kadar geçen&nbsp;süre.</p> 1.3) Stake etmede fikir birliği turlarının rolü&nbsp;nedir? <p>Stake etme, fikir birliği turlarına bağlıdır. Peki nasıl çalışırlar? Her stake olayı veya değişiklik, bir fikir birliği turu sona erdiğinde gerçekleşir. Bu, örneğin 139. tur sırasında ONT hissenizi gönderirseniz, 139. tur sona erdiğinde aktif hale gelecek ve kilitlenecek ve ardından ONG ödülleri oluşturmaya başlayacaktır. O zamana kadar hisseniz aktif değildir, dolayısıyla ONG ödülleri üretmez. Bahis tutarınızı iptal etmeye karar verdiğinizde de aynı şey geçerlidir. 139. tur sırasında bahis tutarınızı iptal ederseniz, düğüm türüne bağlı olarak 139 (veya 140) turu bitene kadar kilitli kalacaktır. Dahası, ilgili ONG ödülleri, her konsensüs turunun sona ermesinden sonra stake sahipleri tarafından talep edilebilir.</p> 1.4) Node&nbsp;türleri <p>2 Node tipi, konsensüs node ve aday düğümler vardır. Nodalarin tam listesi ve sıralaması node.ont.io adresinde mevcuttur. ONT staker bakış açısından ana farklar şunlardır:</p><p>fikir birliği node (ilk 15'inci sırada): mevcut turun kilitleme süresi + 1 tam tur, daha düşük ödüller, temel bonus dağıtma (ilk 7), nadiren ödül dağıtım oranını değiştirme</p><p>aday nodalar (seviye 16+): sadece mevcut raundun kilitlenme süresi, daha yüksek ödüller, temel bonus dağıtma, ödül dağıtım oranını daha sık değiştirebilir</p><p>Çoğu staker için aday düğümler için bahis yapmak daha iyidir, çünkü bahis tutarınızı iptal ettikten sonra daha yüksek ödülleri ve daha kısa kilit süreleri&nbsp;vardır.</p> 1.5) Stake etme ödülleri nereden&nbsp;geliyor? <p>ONT stakerları için 3 ONG ödülü vardır. Bu ödülleri stake sahiplerine hangi düğüm türlerinin dağıttığını inceledim:</p>  Konsensüs turu sırasında toplanan işlem ücretleri (her iki düğüm&nbsp;türü)  sürüm modeline göre serbest bırakılan ONG (her iki düğüm türü) — 4. maddede bununla ilgili daha fazla bilgi edinin&nbsp;(burada)  vakıf bonusu   1.6) Neden aday düğümlerin daha iyi ödülleri&nbsp;var? <p>Konsensüs düğümleri ve aday düğümler ödülleri (işlem ücretleri ve serbest bırakılan ONG) 50/50 böler. Şu anda konsensüs düğümlerinde yaklaşık 167,7m ONT varken aday düğümlerde yalnızca 25,1m ONT bulunmaktadır. Aday düğümlerin şu anda stake etme / düğümlerde çok daha az ONT jetonuna sahip olması ve konsensüs düğümleriyle aynı miktarda ödülü dağıtması nedeniyle, 1 ONT başına ödülleri çok daha yüksektir</p> 1.7) Herhangi bir özel düğüm var&nbsp;mı? <p>Düğümler, elbette, paydaşlarını ödüllendirmenin farklı yollarını kullanmaya karar verebilir. Örneğin, kendi tokenlarını veya bazı airdrop’larını dağıtabilirler. Şu anda Sesameseed adında yalnızca bir tane böyle düğüm vardır. Özel SEED jetonlarını kullanarak tüm stake etme ödüllerini dağıtırlar. Bu durumda, stake etme ödülünüz ONG değil, SEED jetonudur. Makalede bununla ilgili daha fazla bilgi edinin. Geçmişte, MovieBloc düğümü ayrıca stakerlara MBL tokenları biçiminde ekstra ödüller dağıtmak için kullanılırdı, ancak bu sona&nbsp;erdi.</p> 1.8) Kilitlenme süresi&nbsp;nedir? <p>Kilitleme süresi, ONT jetonlarınızın stake etme durumunun kilidi açılıncaya kadar beklemeniz gereken zamandır. Konsensüs düğümlerinin 1 tam tur ekstra kilitlenme süresi varken, aday düğümlerin mevcut fikir birliği turunun sonuna kadar kilitlenme süresi vardır. Örnek: 110. tur sırasında konsensüs düğümündeki bahis tutarını iptal edersiniz. Bu, 111. tur bittiğinde ONT jetonlarınızın kilidinin açılacağı ve talep edilmeye hazır olacağı anlamına gelir. 110. tur sırasında aday düğümdeki bahis tutarını iptal ederseniz, ONT jetonlarınız 110. tur sona erdiğinde talep edilebilir olacaktır. Esnek olmak istiyorsanız, aday düğümlerle uğraşmak daha iyidir, çünkü kilit süreleri çok daha&nbsp;kısadır.</p> 1.9) node.ont.io’daki veriler nasıl anlaşılır? <p>2 liste vardır — İlk 15 düğüm fikir birliği düğümleridir ve geri kalanı aday düğümlerdir. Tüm sütunların anlamını açıklayalım.</p>node.ont.io<p>a) Toplam bahis: kullanıcı hissesi (bireysel pay sahipleri tarafından stake edilen jetonlar) + düğüm&nbsp;hissesi</p><p>b) Düğüm hissesi: düğüm operatörünün düğümü oluştururken ilk hissesi olarak düğümünde kilitlediği ONT&nbsp;miktarı</p><p>c) Ücret paylaşım oranı: Temel olarak, düğüm ONT jetonlarının 2 parçaya bölündüğünü, düğümün ilk hissesinin birinci kısım, ikinci kısmının ise kullanıcı hissesi olduğunu hayal edin. Popüler oran% 10 /% 90 olabilir. İlk rakam (% 10), düğümün ilk düğüm hissesi için aldığı ödüllerin ne kadarını stake sahiplerine dağıttığını ifade eder. İkinci rakam (% 90), düğümün kullanıcı stake edilmiş tokenlar için aldığı ödüllerin ne kadarını stake’lere dağıttığını ifade eder. Örnek: (düğüm başlangıç hissesi 10.000 ONT, kullanıcı hissesi 100K ONT, oran% 10 /% 90, 1 ONT başına ödül 0.01 ONG diyelim) Bu varsayımsal durumda, düğüm 10.000 başlangıç hissesi için 100 ONG alır ve bunun% 10'unu verir Stake sahiplerine eşit olarak ve 100.000 kullanıcı için hisseli düğüm 1000 ONG alır ve bunun% 90'ı stakerlara eşit olarak verir. Toplam: Stakers toplamda 910 ONG paylaşırken, düğüm operatörü 190 ONG tutar. Oran% 0 /% 85 ise bu, staker payının 850 ONG olduğu ve düğüm operatörünün 250 ONG tuttuğu anlamına&nbsp;gelir.</p><p>d) Yıllık getiri: (APY), bir sonraki konsensüs turu için mevcut stakerlar için beklenen yıllık ödüllerin gerçek zamanlı dinamik değerini temsil eder. Stake etme ve düğümlerdeki toplam ONT miktarı, düğüm operatörü tarafından belirlenen paylaşım oranı, ONT ve ONG tokenlerinin gerçek zamanlı piyasa fiyatı gibi birçok faktöre dayalı olarak gerçek zamanlı olarak hesaplanır. Fiyat dalgalanması ile APY’nin dinamik olarak nasıl değiştiğini görebilirsiniz&nbsp;. Örneğin, ONG’nin fiyatı% 100 artarsa ve ONT aynı değerde kalırsa, stake etme APY iki katına çıkar. Yeni düğümler,% 1000000 APY gibi çılgın sayıları gösterebilir, ancak bunun tek nedeni, 1 ONT belirteci gibi çok düşük kullanıcı hissesine sahip olmalarıdır. Daha fazla bahis eklendiğinde, ödüller çok hızlı bir şekilde normal değerlere düşecektir. APY’nin gerçek zamanlı hesaplanmasının bir yan etkisidir. Yaklaşık getirilerinizi hesaplamak için bir hesap makinesi kullanabilirsiniz.</p><p>e) Ulaşılan bahis sınırı: Düğüm operatörü, kullanıcının ilk düğüm hissesinin izin verilen maksimum 10x hissesini ayarlayabilir. Ulaşılan pay sınırı, şu anda maksimum kullanıcı hissesi kapasitesi düğümünün ne kadarına sahip olduğu anlamına gelir. Örnek: 10K başlangıç düğüm payına sahip bir düğüm, maksimum 100.000 kullanıcı hissesini kabul edebilir. Daha fazla stake sahiplerine yer açmak için, başlangıçtaki düğüm hisselerini artırmaları gerekir. İlk düğüm hisselerine başka bir 5k ONT ekleyeceklerse, düğümleri ek 50.000 kullanıcı hissesini kabul edebilir, vb.</p> Bölüm 2: Alıştırma  2.1) Nasıl bahis&nbsp;yapılır? <p>Üçüncü taraf seçenekleri olmasına rağmen, en yüksek ödülleri almak için ONTO mobile veya PC için OWallet gibi resmi bir Ontology cüzdanı kullanmanızı tavsiye ederim. Her iki cüzdan için tokenlerinizi nasıl stake edeceğinize dair adım adım yönergeler doğrudan node.ont.io/stake adresinde bulunabilir.</p><p>Cüzdanınızda ONT jetonlarınız olduğunda, gaz ücretlerini ödemek için ONG jetonlarına da ihtiyacınız olacak. Bahis yapmak için 0,05 ONG’ye ihtiyacınız var, ilk ödülleri de 0,05 ONG talep etmek için, aynı, hisseyi iptal etmek ve kilidi açılmış jetonları talep etmek için de aynı. Gaz ücretlerini ödemek için cüzdanınızda her zaman 1 ONG bulundurmanızı tavsiye ederim. Tüm ONG’yi borsalara göndermeyin çünkü 0,05 ONG olmadan işlem yapamayacaksınız.</p><p>ONT jetonlarınızı kazandığınızda, artık herhangi bir işlem yapmanız gerekmez. Bahis tutarını manuel olarak iptal etmeye karar verene veya düğüm operatörü düğümden çıkana kadar stake edilmiş olarak kalacaktır. Bir düğüm operatörü düğümünü iptal ederse, stake edilmiş tokenleriniz, hissenizi iptal etmişsiniz gibi davranacak ve ilgili kilit süresinden sonra talep edilebilecek.</p> 2.2) Bahis edilecek minimum ONT miktarı&nbsp;nedir? <p>Temmuz 2020'den bu yana 1 ONT token kadar düşük bir seviyeden bahis yapabilirsiniz. İlk stake etme sürümü 500 ONT birimi gerektiriyordu ama bu artık geçmişte&nbsp;kaldı.</p> 2.3) En iyi düğüm nasıl&nbsp;seçilir? <p>Bölüm 1'deki tüm yukarıdaki bilgilere dayanarak, en iyi ödüllerin şu anda aday düğümler tarafından sunulduğu açıktır. En iyisi nasıl seçilir? Node.ont.io’da paylaşım oranı sütunu 7 ve APY sütun 8'i kontrol etmek önemlidir. Paylaşım oranını kontrol ederken, düğümün ilk hisseleriyle ürettiği ödüllerin ne kadarının pay sahiplerine dağıtıldığının ilk% olduğunu unutmayın. Bu sayı ne kadar yüksekse o kadar iyidir, ancak düğüm tam stake etme kapasitesine ulaşmazsa, başlangıç düğüm hissesinin ne kadar büyük olduğu da önemlidir (100K’dan% 5, 10K’dan% 10'dan fazladır). Ardından hisse oranının ikinci% oranını kontrol edin. Mümkünse% 90'dan daha düşük teklif sunan düğümlerle stake etmeyi önermem. Ayrıca, yüksek oran sunan düğümlerle ilgileniyorsanız dikkatli olun. Bu taktiği genellikle yeni paydaşları çekmek için kullanırlar ve yeterli hisseyi topladıklarında ödülleri düşüreceklerdir. 90/90 veya 100/100 sunan düğümlerle bahis oynarsanız, oranı düşürüp düşürmediklerini görmek için node.ont.io’da düzenli olarak kontrol edin, böylece size daha az ödül verin. Yöneticiler düğümümüz ►CZ / SK Ontology topluluk düğümü◄gibi bazı düğümler oranımızı değiştirmemek için herkese açık bir söz&nbsp;verdi.</p> 2.4) ONG nereden&nbsp;alınır? <p>ONG jetonlarını nereden alacağınızı bilmiyorsanız, burada CMC’de ONG ticaret çiftleri sunan borsaların listesini bulabilirsiniz. En popüler olanı kesinlikle Binance. ONT tokenleriniz ONTO Wallet’ta varsa ve ücret karşılığında ONG yoksa, bu kılavuzu piyasa oranında 1 ONT’den ONG’ye ücretsiz takas yöntemini kullanmak için kullanabilirsiniz — <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/</a> üzerine / kılavuzlar / varlıklar / takas-ont-for-ong. Son olarak, yukarıdaki seçenekler sizin için mevcut değilse, birinden başlamak için birkaç ONG bağışlamasını da isteyebilirsiniz.</p> 2.5) Stake etme karşılığında ne zaman ödül alacağım ve nasıl talep edeceğim? <p>Tamamen yatırılmış her bir fikir birliği turundan sonra ödüller alacaksınız, örneğin, 110. turda bahis oynarsanız, 111. tur bittiğinde 111. tur için ilk ödülleri alacaksınız. Tur sona erdiğinde ödül bakiyesi güncellenir. O zaman ya ödüllerinizi talep edebilir ya da birikmeye devam edebilirsiniz. Her turdan sonra talepte bulunmanıza gerek&nbsp;yoktur.</p> 2.6) ONG jetonları ile ne&nbsp;yapmalı? <p>Bu, herkesin kişisel stratejisine bağlıdır, bazı olasılıklar şunlardır:</p><p>Gelecekteki olası daha yüksek fiyat takdiri için HODL ONG tokenleri</p><p>ONT için ONG satın ve bahis pozisyonunuzu artırmaya devam&nbsp;edin</p><p>Farklı tokenlar / projeler için ONG tokenları satın</p><p>ONG jetonlarını örneğin wing.finance veya ontology.unifiprotocol.com adresinde likidite olarak&nbsp;sağlayın</p> 2.7) Bahis tutarınızı iptal ettikten sonra ONT jetonlarının kilidi ne zaman açılacak? <p>Jetonlarınızın kilidinin ne zaman açılacağını öğrenmek için bu makalenin 1.7 bölümünü okuyun. Mevcut turun tahmini süresi, artı node.ont.io/stake adresinde bulabileceğiniz önceki turların&nbsp;süresi</p> STAKING’İN KEYFİNİ&nbsp;ÇIKARIN! <p>Herhangi bir sorunuz varsa veya eksik veya yanlış içeriği bildirmek isterseniz veya cüzdanıma bir fincan kahve ısmarlamak için bahşiş vermek isterseniz, lütfen bana <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> veya <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter</a> üzerinden ulaşın.

<p>Mathieu: Welcome to the SSI Orbit Podcast: a forum where we explore the ever-growing ecosystems of Self-sovereign Identity. I’m your host Mathieu Glaude.</p>
<p>In today’s conversation, I welcome Kaliya Young (often referred to as IdentityWoman) for a sneak peek at what to expect from IIW32: the 32nd iteration of the Internet Identity Workshop, which will be hosted virtually. For over 15 years, IIW has been the premier place to bring together the largest concentration of talents dedicated to designing and building identity systems that empower individuals. This episode is meant to give a high-level overview of the topics that are being discussed in the digital and decentralized identity communities in preparation for this event. Listeners of <a href="https://anchor.fm/ssi-orbit-podcast">this podcast</a> who haven’t registered yet for IIW or who are maybe on the fence about registering can get a 20% discount by applying this discount code → ‘SSIOrbit_XXXII_20’ to your purchase <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxii-32-2021a-tickets-131551119941?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch">here</a>. We look forward to seeing you all there.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here’s my conversation with Kaliya Young.</p>
<p>Kaliya, how is it going, and what’s keeping you busy these days?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Thanks Mathieu. I am the Ecosystems Director at the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, so that’s my current main focus of work. In that role, I’ve been tapped to co-chair the interoperability working group for Good Health Pass, which is happening in the Trust over IP Foundation.</p>
 Pseudonymity and Naming on the Internet 
<p>Mathieu: Awesome, I’ve been following both of those projects; the CCI for&nbsp; —&nbsp;wow, over a year now already, and then the Good Health Pass. I definitely see a lot of momentum and excitement behind that project. I would like to go a little deeper into both of those as we go through the conversation here today. This is a quote I pulled from online: you go by the handle of ‘IdentityWoman,’ and IdentityWoman is a ‘nymwarrior’. What is a nymwarrior?</p>
<p>Kaliya: This term emerged around the time when Google created Google Plus, building on top of its email system. Google created profiles for people who had email addresses, and then early on, you could get invited into the Google Plus social network. Those early invitations went out, and they spread around. At some point, they were going to flip over to be totally public, so anybody could join once they had a critical mass. It was at that point that Google effectively decided to implement a ‘real names’ policy, and began cancelling or suspending people’s accounts, who didn’t have what we started to term WASPO-nyms: that is, a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant name. If you were ‘John Smith,’ you were fine, even if that wasn’t your real name because it looks like a real name to the algorithms. But for me, you know, ‘Kaliya IdentityWoman’ (which is my first name in real life plus my online handle) was suspended because it didn’t look like a real name. They were building a social network of people who are online, many of whom have used handles in the online space for a decade or more. The position was, “Well, that’s not real.” Except, it is real because they use it online and have done so for ten years, so stop cancelling people because they don’t match your naming algorithm, which only lets certain types of names through. It became lit; I’m sure that if you search on it today, you’ll find the ‘nym-wars.’ So, people started finding each other on Twitter and being, “what’s going on?” There was a really big fight at the time with Google around this. Folks like Tim O’Reilly got into the fray, and started saying there’s a lynch mob against Google. I was, “Timeout Tim, that’s not an appropriate term for people who are marginalized, who have different identities.” Telling a big corporation that they’re wrong, when lynching was what happened to black people in the South by white mobs; these are not equivalent, and you can’t make this. In fact, I even pointed at the example from Roots, where Kunta Kinte said, “My name is Kunta Kinte,” and the slave owner was, “No, your name’s Toby.” You know it’s not the same at all; slavery and that impact is much greater than these smaller fights we’re having about naming. But still, it’s the entity with more power saying to the other people, “No, your name can’t be Identity Woman, or Rainbow Star Flower or whatever that ‘funny’ internet handle was that you had —that’s not real.” We were talking more about this power imbalance, around who has the right to name themselves, and who gets to say what a legitimate name is.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. There’s something extremely powerful about pseudonymity. That’s one of the things I love on Twitter today, too. You have these people with such powerful voices; I don’t know what their legal name is, and I actually don’t care, either. Your legal name: I don’t know if it’s an antiquated attribute for identifying you, but on certain things, and Google Plus is probably one of them; why can’t you be called whatever you want to be called? What’s the difference?</p>
<p>Kaliya: They came back and said,” Well, behavioural reasons.” All the community managers took the position of, “Behavior in communities isn’t managed by what you choose to call yourself.” Really, names are tools that people use to communicate about each other. What happens to be on our administrative paperwork, and where it’s appropriate to force people to share the name that’s on their administrative paperwork, is something we need to be talking about. It’s not always relevant, and in fact, can be harmful and make vulnerable people even more vulnerable, if they are required to share that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think that from the other perspective, you’re talking about being cancelled because you’re not providing a name. But people get cancelled, because they provide their names, from the other side around. So, it’s an interesting social landscape that’s been developing on the internet. You’ve been in the Digital ID space — I know you started IIW in 2005. This is a broad question, but from when you got into the space, to where we are now, how have you seen the different trends move, or what’s really changed?</p>
<p>Kaliya: My core inspiration, and the place I got started on the path of looking at digital identity, was a community called PlanetWork, which is ‘Planet’ and ‘Network’ mushed together. As a community, they did some discernment after their year 2000 conference that they hosted. They asked what was a missing piece of infrastructure needed to make the internet better for people, and for people to self-organize, to connect to each other, to make the planet, and the ecosystem and the earth that we live on better. It was a very interesting answer that they came up with: they identified a gap, and said there are no open standards for digital identity, for the representation of people in the digital realm, and that we needed open standards for this. And, if we didn’t take the time to invest in creating those open standards, if you took the current trajectory forward without those open standards, then you would end up with governments and large corporations owning everybody’s identity. They were right, right.</p>
<p>They took the paper that was written, the Augmented Social Network Whitepaper: Building Identity and Trust into the Next Generation; they shopped it around to a bunch of foundations, who didn’t understand what they were talking about. They didn’t understand the missing infrastructure piece they were naming, and didn’t understand the implications of not funding its development at the time. And here we are: Facebook kind of owns everybody’s digital representation of themselves, with bonus — Google owns a bunch of them too. Now we have <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, and it’s like Nascar with logins, with these different options, but none of them are you.</p>
<p>To be fair, OpenID and OAuth all came out of, and were developed within, the context of IIW, and they were better than everybody going to a new website and getting an entirely different identity every time. I think that there was corporate capture that happened with those standards, and I think people are very concerned about this with the next generation of open standards, so they are pushing even harder for them to be open and person-driven. Hopefully, we can have truly open standards that have less corporate capture than the first generations, but I’m really optimistic about getting usable PKI (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure#:~:text=A%20public%2Dkey%20infrastructure%20(PKI,and%20manage%20public%2Dkey%20encryption.">Public Key Infrastructure</a>) into the hands of normal people, on apps they control on their devices. That’s super exciting, and has the potential to fulfill those original visions that I was inspired by in the first place. So this keeps me motivated to help these new technologies to succeed, because I think they help to realize key aspects of that original vision, that have yet to be realized.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I definitely think the rise of mobile and other similar developments have put tools in people’s pockets to be able to <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">manage their own identity</a> attributes or all sorts of credentials. I do find it interesting; I think you had founded IIW in 2005; I’m trying to think back to when I opened my Facebook account. It was around that time too, or a bit earlier.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Facebook wasn’t founded until 2004. Sometimes I describe myself as being against Facebook before it ever existed, in the sense that we were naming this issue.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It is funny today, a lot of people have been talking about the security breach that they had — who knows when it happened — but they talked about it a week ago or so; all these accounts that have been breached. Out of 196 million users, they dropped down to 194 million users with an increase in traffic in the time, as well. It’s crazy to see the risks that go with the models that they have in place today. I think we see some really good movements in the communities we’re in, but the people that are using these weak Web 2 systems (however we want to call it) don’t seem to be impacted by this stuff.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Sure. Until we have better tools, they won’t be, because they’re pragmatic. I think we need to take this seedling infrastructure we have and grow it up, so it provides better value to a whole range of actors who today find value in a Facebook ecosystem. Part of that is around entrepreneurs building alternative social networks, who are committed to interoperability and to putting users in control in a way that Facebook has not. A great example is the work that Jim Fournier is doing with a network called Tru.net, which uses both a decentralized identifier in the infrastructure, and also a standard that they’re putting forward for adoption by others, called JLINC. JLINC allows you to see the provenance of information that you’re viewing in your social network, and they’re committed to working with other emerging alternative social network operators, to have interoperability between their platform and other people’s platforms.</p>
 Solving business issues with Open Standards 
<p>Mathieu: That’s awesome. It looks like there are two different types of ways to approach decentralized identity: you could build new platforms and compete with the existing platforms that are out there, but there’s also the existing platforms out there, who could start re-architecting themselves to be able to meet the privacy and consent-driven properties that people are looking for, and should have access to. The Digital ID space is absolutely booming, if you talk about these ID-proofing companies. On one side, there are all these verticals; I got my ID-proofing companies, I got my signature companies, I could even get into the cyberspace; I’ve been talking a lot about identity and access management companies that have been involved in IIW for all these years.</p>
<p>How do you see them going towards that space? It’s one thing to build a new platform from scratch, but what’s your view on how these existing centralized providers are approaching this? </p>
<p>Kaliya: Yes. Those entities are solving business problems that businesses have. The question is, can we solve those business problems with open standards, that make it easier for someone to take a verifiable credential from one party and share it with another, and have them believe it?</p>
<p>I think in the end, if we’re successful with a bunch of these new emerging open standards, they’re very disruptive to the existing business models of identity proofers, etc. They’re making money over the fact that the current paper-based model of document provision means that the only way to figure out whether something is true, is to go and ping large data sets that they have access to and are corralling. And then, making assertions based on those data sets, that other businesses are relying on. I believe that this is another under-reported property of the <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">verifiable credentials technology</a> that is being developed at IIW. If we are successful, we end the problem of: “if I know information about you, I can be you.” The only way that you can be you, is if you actually have the verifiable credential from an authoritative source. I’m sure we will have attacks that try and get those, but that’s different than the current attack model, which is: “I’m going to find information about you, and because I know that information, I’m going to commit fraud or try and steal things from you, because I’m convincing someone that I am you, because I know information about you. That whole set of attack surfaces goes away when you have a verifiable credentials type of infrastructure, where only the person who was issued a credential can assert those things about themselves. They can know information about you, but they can’t replay you presenting the credential, because only you have it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I was on the phone with someone earlier today, who was calling me to ask about his email account. It was taken over, and his email is connected to a whole lot of his different accounts: his banking account, his crypto account, all sorts of things. The person was able to get in and change his recovery email, and he’s been stuck in this whole situation. There are all of these types of issues, such as you just described, that are able to happen.</p>
<p>Kaliya: To be fair, you know that people should be using two-factor authentication, or FIDO (<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/">Fast Identity Online</a>) tokens etc.&nbsp; I do think, though, if we move towards verifiable credentials and that tooling for authentication, it’s also way more secure. That’s why I knew we were onto something, once the banks started showing up. They said, “That’s really cool; that usable PKI you’re embedding in the app is way better than little owls looking back at you and SMTP messages; let’s do that!” My response was, “Yay, the banks are into this because of security properties, not because it’s good for people, and maybe we’ll get both. We’ll get ‘good for people’ and ‘more secure for the banks’, which is the win/win we want, in order to get broad market adoption.</p>
<p>Mathieu: &nbsp;Yes. These processes of authentication like 2FA or this type of thing are still very good processes. You could enable them through <a href="https://northernblock.io/">using verifiable credentials</a>, rather than using a one-time PIN or other methods that have worked for a bank before, such as getting an email with a code or a text message with a code. I probably get these every day now for different services I use, so something like verifiable credentials for a two-factor authentication could be something interesting. I’m not sure if that’s what Microsoft is going to do with an authenticator app, but it is interesting to see companies like Microsoft, who are obviously not new to the space but they’re making significant headway with verifiable credentials.</p>
 Upcoming IIW conference 
<p>So, IIW is coming up next week; it starts on Tuesday, so you must be excited about it. You must be overwhelmed with work right now; what is it looking like this year?</p>
<p>I’m much newer to the space than someone like yourself or a lot of other people that are in there. I think I attended the past two IIWs, so it’s quite new to me still. The first time I attended IIW, I just couldn’t believe the brilliance that’s in there. I absolutely loved the format; you’re not stuck to only listening to people, or to a certain agenda; you could move around and try to progress as you want. I think this ‘unconference,’ or however you label it, as a format for IIW is phenomenal, but what are you most looking forward to for this year’s IIW?</p>
<p>Kaliya: I think we were really fortunate with the pandemic kicking in last year, that we had a pathway to go virtual. My friend Lucas Chaffee had a platform he built specifically to do several different formats, but one of the formats he had in mind when he designed Kiko Chat was Open Space technology. That is what we used to co-create the agenda live on the morning of the event, so that you know where to go. We had six weeks from when we officially decided to go virtual, to be virtual. We were able to use Lucas’s platform to recreate what happens live and in person. If you haven’t been to IIW in person, we sit 250 people in a circle together, and we articulate the principles of Open Space and the ‘Law of Motion and Responsibility.’ That says that if you aren’t learning or contributing in your session, it’s your responsibility to respectfully get up and go somewhere that you are. That works in person, and we took that same format that we use in person and translated it online pretty seamlessly. The great thing about after that first virtual version, is people came to us and said, “Everything is so crazy with the pandemic, but IIW was exactly the same, and I needed that.” So, we’re very lucky that we got to translate it into the digital version and continue the vibrancy and dynamics. We even expanded it, because there were people able to come to ‘Virtual IIW’ who were unable to make it to our physical version in Mountain View. We’re planning to go back to the physical version in the fall, hopefully. We’d like to alternate between digital and in-person to capture some of the good things about being virtual that we’ve liked, but also to reconnect our community with the affordances that an in-person meeting provides that you just can’t recreate digitally.</p>
<p>Mathieu: In the spirit of inclusivity, it was great to see just how people from all over are able to actually participate and see that. I think you and the other organizers do a really good job of making it inclusive, so people have different statures could join.</p>
<p>Now that we’re a week out from IIW32, what are the biggest industry trends that you’re seeing that people are excited to discuss?</p>
<p>Kaliya: I think we’re going to have a big discussion about COVID-19 credentials. They’ve only grown in importance since they were a seedling of conversation at the beginning of the pandemic. A year ago, BBS+ was put forward as a new credential signing format, specifically JSON-LD ZKP (Linked Data Zero Knowledge Proof) with BBS+. That has grown, in terms of people’s understanding of how good it could be, and there’s significant alignment in the industry happening around it. I published a paper in January (which we can put in the show notes), articulating the choice landscape, and the different flavours of verifiable credentials, and why this new format helped to meet many different criteria that different subgroups in the community had. We want to encourage more alignment with it, so we can get real <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/02/11/cci-verifiable-credentials-flavors-and-interoperability-paper/.">interoperability</a>. Writing a standard isn’t enough to build an ecosystem of interoperability; there’s this critical step of implementing the standard, and seeing if your version of what you implemented works in software created by other people who are also conforming with the standard. I believe that’s also going to be a big topic this year, in terms of what’s next, in terms of testing and growing the pie of the systems that work well with each other. In the process, we’re building the market for all the entrepreneurs who are building on the standard. To me, every new client of every company in the ecosystem is a good thing for everyone else.</p>
<p>Mathieu: These BBS+ methods must be exciting to the COVID-19 types of projects; it seems as though they’re the ones spearheading a lot of the interoperability conversations?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Well, we’ll see; I don’t want to get into all the politics that are trying to sort themselves out behind the scenes. I think we’re all doing our best, and I think there is a goodwill effort by everybody, trying to solve for COVID use cases to get to interoperability. There are still distinct differences out there, and we’re continuing to dialogue.</p>
 Developments in Governance 
<p>Mathieu: Have you seen many discussions happening, or looking like they’re going to happen, around governance? I know that’s a very broad topic. I come from the perspective of an <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">ecosystem solutions implementation</a> across the stack; being able to have a registry of bids, and credential schemas, and other similar topics: peer-to-peer communications, the credentialing exchange, the ecosystem rules, and governance. Have you seen a lot of advancement in that over the past years? Or, is this something that you hear conversations around, or are hoping to see at the next IIW?</p>
<p>Kaliya: I would hope that the people who are so gung-ho at Trust over IP make space to listen to people who have chosen to opt-out and not participate in that ecosystem, because there are reasons why people are doing that. I’m very hopeful that the momentum around the JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+ can grow to the extent where we aren’t having a conversation about my flavour of credentials versus your flavour versus another. It’s exhausting, and it has hurt market adoption.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve come to understand also, is that there’s a natural split within the community. One split that continues and won’t ever go away, is the difference between permission ledgers and public ledgers, in terms of where to anchor decentralized identifiers. People simply have different philosophical anchors of which one to choose. I think they both have valid points, so we’re never not going to see people anchor DIDs on public chains, and we’re never not going to see another set of people choose to anchor on permission ledgers for their own business process reasons. One of those reasons have to do with large corporations being completely freaked out that they could be hosting a node that somebody happened to put some PII (Personal Identity Information) in some entry in a ledger three years ago, and now they’re liable under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). So, forget it; we’re controlling the whole chain. Which is fine, in terms of them meeting their business use cases and needs.</p>
<p>That’s one piece of a governance conversation that is there and won’t go away.</p>
<p>I think there’s another piece of governance, which is surfacing existing systems and business processes that people need to name and articulate more clearly. If you look at something like the <a href="https://northernblock.io/pan-canadian-trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>; it’s done an amazing job of surfacing the processes involved in creating identity documentation for both businesses and people in the first place. It’s forcing a detailed examination of the business process steps that go into creating that, getting it all clear, and then identifying, “which ones do you have?”. It’s not so much like creating ‘new’ governance, but surfacing systems and processes that were perhaps taken for granted and making what’s happening more explicit. In that way, apples and apples, and oranges and oranges, can get compared to each other.</p>
<p>For example, how does the identity business process of how British Columbia creates Citizen ID cards compare with how the Province of Quebec does it? If they’re similar enough then, Quebec can trust BC’s credentials, and BC can trust Quebec’s. That’s probably a good thing to be surfacing, and having conversations about what the meaning of different credentials are, and how the creation of those assertions is done in ways that other entities can have confidence in them.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I like the reference to the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, which we are familiar with, being here in Canada. I think the work that Joni has pushed forward through the <a href="https://diacc.ca/">DIACC</a> (Digital Identification and Authorization Council of Canada) both in the public and private sector, has helped with finding a good way to componentize the different atomic processes, or whatever you want to call it. As you said: it’s not a ‘one mould fits all’ type of thing either. If you’re aligned on the principles and certain elements underneath there, then that’s a way that you’ll definitely be able to trust credentials coming between different ecosystems, whatever they are. There are excellent developments coming out of that, going back to your ledger comment; and I think we’ve seen a lot of momentum with the non-ledger type of stuff as well.</p>
<p>We have the permission ledgers, and have the public ledgers; it’s been interesting to see advancements on both sides. It appears that the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) project is gaining a lot of momentum as well, and people seem quite interested in that. We talked a bit about the private sector: what do you see from a self-sovereign identity or decentralized identity perspective? Is there a lot of public sector or government involvement in IIW? That will help folks to know, if they’re looking to have these types of conversations.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Yes, but there could be more.&nbsp; The usual suspects are present; there’s the British Columbia guys, Tim Bouma; who else shows up that’s from government? There’s some interesting work in the states, that you know very well, with the DHS. All of those folks have been in the community for years now. I know companies all around the world, who have been talking to their own governments; whether those government folks actually show up at IIW, I don’t know. My understanding is that there are governments, or government fora, focused on digitization and digital transformation. There are conversations happening that we simply don’t hear about in the private sector, because they feel more comfortable talking to themselves. Hopefully, over time, more of those conversations will come out into more accessible fora.</p>
 The Good Health Pass Initiative 
<p>Mathieu: We touched on this earlier, and there is clearly a lot of conversation around the <a href="https://northernblock.io/patient-centric-identity-management-for-healthcare/">health credentials</a>. Would you mind giving an overview from your point of view, on what has happened with the Good Health Pass Initiative? My perception, having not been involved, since we’re not too involved in health credentials; it’s a project that started under ID 2020 and developed a relationship with Trust over IP to execute some activity. Can you shed some light there?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Yes. Your description is as good as mine in terms of those details. I think that one of the inspirations for it, was to catalyze a global conversation around critical stakeholders in international travel; specifically around test results and sharing those, because the World Health Organization only has the mandate to address vaccine credentials under international regulations. They basically said straight out,” We aren’t dealing with testing.” Okay, great, but given that countries are mandating testing to get in, somebody has to deal with it.</p>
<p>Those entities who make international travel function needed to collaborate together to figure out how there could be a common way to figure out how to get a test from a trusted lab, and share it into a Traveler Decision System. And, to support governments on the other end being able to see those results. That’s a lot of entities, who were really clear that they didn’t want to see a global system with 40 different apps, with 40 different testing lab networks, that might require a person with three flights in a day to go and get three different tests, from three different labs, with three different apps. That isn’t going to help global travel reopen; it’s going to keep it closed. There are a lot of moving pieces. Trying to solve the legitimate business need, to figure out if countries are requiring test results to get in, and airplanes are required to get that proof before they let someone on a plane to go to Country X: how is that going to happen in a way that’s as privacy-preserving as possible, empowering to the individual as possible, and reducing the headache in terms of processing and managing that information in those existing systems?</p>
<p>Mathieu: There are some governments that are mandating it. There have been some announcements; at least, the US federal government announced that they weren’t going to mandate a digital wallet or digital credentials, and some states are not doing it. However, whoever the relying parties are in these transactions…</p>
<p>Kaliya: They’re Verifiers; they’re not relying parties. It’s very important that we call them ‘Verifiers.’ Sure, they’re relying parties, but part of this language is really important. Typically, a relying party is phoning home to an identity provider, and these systems don’t do that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Hmm, I thought those terms were interchangeable; I’m coming from the space where there were banks talking about this stuff, and assuming that the Issuer /Holder /Verifier model was the same as saying Verifiers /Relying party. But, okay, I see the difference that you’re pointing out; that’s interesting.</p>
 The Impact of Culture on Architecture 
<p>Mathieu: You obviously build communities; you build communities through CCI, you’ve built communities in the identity space for many years now. Having done all this; we talked about inclusivity before, and when we talk about adoption, it’s requires thinking more and more about the role that culture plays in this area. A silly example would be an American culture versus a Chinese culture, and how different they are. What role does culture play in the adoption of this on a global scale?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Different cultures make different assumptions and agreements about how they operate.</p>
<p>One of the appealing things about the underlying architectural affordances of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, is that it aligns with core values and current architectural realities of how identity systems work within western liberal democracies.</p>
<p>I’m Canadian; I was born in British Columbia. The Province of British Columbia is the authoritative source of my birth date, because they were the administrative region where I was born. My parents filed a paper with them, and they have that on file. When I talk to government leaders who are active in the space, they want to help me get that information in a form that I can reuse and share with other people. However, they don’t want to be in the middle of every transaction I do forever where I share my birthday. They take the position,” It’s none of my business. I don’t want to know, so don’t build a system where you put me in the loop.” That is quite different from an architectural choice that was made in India, with the development of their Aadhaar system. With the fundamental underlying architectural design, as originally conceived there, every time you presented your Aadhaar number, and by extension, the core demographic information within it, such as your name and your birth date, the government would see it. That’s because it is in a ‘phone home’ authentication system; meaning, you ping the government to do the authentication, to see if the person standing in front of you is the person they claim to be, through having this particular number.</p>
<p>You know, we have identifier systems in the west for social service provision; they’re called social security numbers in the USA, and social insurance numbers in Canada. They have all sorts of different names. I’m sure that in Europe they’re the same; this number that you use to interact with the government, to pay your taxes, to receive pension benefits, to receive disability benefits, and potentially other things. That is a long-lived, indexical number connected to your real name, so that they can figure out it’s you. However, right now, at least in Canada and the United States, there’s no way to do authentication against that number, because it’s not a network endpoint. And, they don’t want it to be. So, part of the reason for innovating these decentralized identity systems, and why western liberal democracies are interested in them, is because they support people being able to prove those things about themselves, without the government being in the loop all the time. They don’t want to be in the loop.</p>
 Closing Thoughts 
<p>Mathieu: Well, Kaliya, as a last question here or a last thought; what would you tell people who are still on the fence about attending IIW, who haven’t attended it before?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Well, I’d enthusiastically invite you! IIW does cost money to attend, and if that is a barrier to you being able to participate, please reach out to us. We are really committed to accessibility. We also have rates that are for students, folks who are with startups in the developing world etc. We charge money, because it costs us money to put on the event — even the virtual event. There’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes in terms of the labour involved in creating the space, and collecting all the notes, and doing all the space creation and holding.</p>
<p>Really, it’s a little bit of the deep end; in the sense of the fact that you’re in the rooms with the people who invented this technology in the first place, but that’s a fantastic thing too. I’d encourage folks who want to explore the space to come. There are other options too: you can <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net/">subscribe to my newsletter</a>. Every week, I publish the ‘Identosphere’ with Infominer. We sort through all of the blogosphere and Twittersphere news, and highlight the best of what happened this week in the industry. There are a ton of webinars, and podcasts, and online resources, and it’s a really friendly community, too. Meaning, if you have questions and you’re confused, you can host a session about your confusion, and people will come and help you. The ‘un’ in unconference means several things; one, the agenda isn’t created until the day of the event, but also, other formats besides presentation are invited and encouraged, including people who are lost and confused, asking questions.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We’ll include the registration links in the show notes with Kaliya’s contact information through social as well. I will say that your Identosphere newsletter is just an amazing resource every week, so if people aren’t on that… I try to keep up to speed with stuff that’s happening; I don’t know what you do to keep up with all these different things that are happening, but, for a one-stop-shop so you don’t get overwhelmed every week with everything that’s happening, it’s the best thing to be subscribed to. I’ll link that in the show minutes, as well.</p>
<p>Subscribe here: <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net/">https://newsletter.identosphere.net/</a></p>
<p>Kaliya, thank you so much for doing this with me today. I very much look forward to IIW.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Thank you so much for having me. Yes, please reach out to me if you want to get connected to the community. I’m thrilled to help you find your niche amongst all of us.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you for listening; I hope you enjoyed the conversation as much as I did. To stay up to speed with future episode releases, please subscribe to the podcast on whatever channel you’re listening to it right now. If you have any questions or comments, please reach out to me directly. You can find me online; I’m quite active on Linkedin and Twitter, so I look forward to hearing from you. See you all next time.</p>

 The GiD Report#156 — Crypto goes mainstream <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-155-coinbase-is-basically-a-bank-and-jamie-dimon-is-worried-1ea396942dc0">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  COIN goes&nbsp;public  The real story:&nbsp;FTX  WSJ slams&nbsp;SEC  Stuff happens   1. It’s finally here — Coinbase is a public&nbsp;company Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Photo: TechCrunch<p>In other words, crypto has arrived. That one of crypto’s biggest companies is trading in the biggest market at one of the biggest valuations.</p><p>It’s a huge deal, the ultimate validation.</p><p>From Satoshi’s white paper to billions of dollars of COIN trading hands on the&nbsp;NASDAQ.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/coinbase-ipo-stock.html">the&nbsp;NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>Digital currency, once mocked as a tool for criminals and reckless speculators, is sliding into the mainstream.</blockquote><blockquote>Traditional banks are helping investors put their money into cryptocurrency funds. Companies like Tesla and Square are hoarding Bitcoin. And celebrities are leading the way in a digital-art spending spree using a technology called an&nbsp;NFT.</blockquote><blockquote>On Wednesday, digital or cryptocurrencies took their biggest step yet toward wider acceptance when Coinbase, a start-up that allows people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, went public. Coinbase shares began trading at $381 each, up 52 percent from a reference price of $250, eventually closing at $328.28. That gave the company a valuation of $85.7 billion based on all its outstanding shares, more than 10 times higher than Coinbase’s last private valuation.</blockquote><blockquote>Call it crypto’s coming-out party. Coinbase, based in San Francisco, is the first major cryptocurrency start-up to go public on a U.S. stock market. It did so at a valuation that rivaled that of Airbnb and Facebook when they went&nbsp;public.</blockquote><blockquote>Cryptocurrency advocates — many of whom expect the technology to upend the global financial system — are celebrating the watershed as vindication of their long-held belief in their cause’s potential.</blockquote><blockquote>Coinbase’s listing answers the question “Is crypto a real thing?” said Bradley Tusk, a venture capital investor whose firm, Tusk Venture Partners, backed Coinbase. “Any industry that can launch an I.P.O. of this size is without a doubt a real thing, and it’s proven by the&nbsp;market.”</blockquote><p>The WSJ also a great feature on Brian Armstrong (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-ceo-to-take-crypto-exchange-public-after-bringing-bitcoin-to-masses-11618392602">Coinbase CEO Takes Crypto Exchange Public After Bringing Bitcoin to&nbsp;Masses</a>  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd">Greg</a>:</p><blockquote>Congrats to Brian and the Coinbase team. What a journey from our YCombinator batch.</blockquote><p>[Disclaimer: Greg is a first round Coinbase investor.]</p><p>And here’s CNBC’s take (via <a href="https://global.id/coddsquad">/coddsqua</a>d):</p>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-is-unlike-any-market-debut-wall-street-has-ever-seen-.html">Coinbase is unlike any market debut Wall Street has ever&nbsp;seen</a>  <p>And here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-15/coinbase-direct-listing-needed-the-coin-ticker">a funny story highlighted by Matt&nbsp;Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said in an interview Wednesday morning that one of the reasons that the company picked Nasdaq was because the bourse offered the ticker symbol “COIN,” which wasn’t part of the New York Stock Exchange’s pitch.</blockquote><blockquote>“Ultimately that they had the ticker COIN, and that was a really great ticker for us to get,” Haas&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 2. But have you heard of&nbsp;FTX? <p>Coinbase is getting all the headlines, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-vegan-billionaire-disrupted-the-crypto-markets-stocks-may-be-next-11618565408">but the WSJ is paying attention</a> (via my friend&nbsp;Alan):</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-vegan-billionaire-disrupted-the-crypto-markets-stocks-may-be-next-11618565408">This Vegan Billionaire Disrupted the Crypto Markets. Stocks May Be&nbsp;Next.</a>  <p>A quick&nbsp;snippet:</p><blockquote>So far this month, FTX says it has processed some $10.7 billion of trades on an average day, up from around $900 million six months ago. That makes FTX one of the world’s top crypto exchanges, even though it only started operations in May&nbsp;2019.</blockquote><blockquote>By comparison, Coinbase — which doesn’t offer derivatives — has handled around $2.6 billion in daily trades this month, according to data provider CryptoCompare. FTX’s activity is also a drop in the bucket compared with traditional derivatives exchanges like CME Group Inc., which handles trillions of dollars of trades each&nbsp;day.</blockquote><p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/vs">/vs</a> — <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crypto-com-buy-bitcoin-now/id1262148500">Crypto.com — Buy Bitcoin&nbsp;Now</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2m7OgWCnlB9y8WPUuCFDoQ?si=p2G4dYU5QbSr-Cz6lDcBIg">#9 — Economics of Self-Sovereign Identity and the Future of Cryptoeconomics with Stepan&nbsp;Gershuni</a>  <a href="https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/cryptocurrency-investors-survey/">62% of Cryptocurrency Investors Believe They’ll Get Rich — MagnifyMoney</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/13/janet-yellen-bitcoin-and-crypto-fearmongers-get-pushback-from-former-cia-director/?sh=79d4e26c9bb7">Janet Yellen, Bitcoin And Crypto Fearmongers Get Pushback From Former CIA&nbsp;Director</a>   3. Despite Coinbase success — a continued lack of regulatory clarity <p>Also highlighted by the WSJ — directly from their editorial board, in fact. (They’re really on it these days,&nbsp;huh?)</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secs-cryptocurrency-confusion-11618611723?mod=opinion_major_pos1">Opinion | The SEC’s Cryptocurrency Confusion</a>  <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secs-cryptocurrency-confusion-11618611723?mod=opinion_major_pos1">The WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The uncertainty is on display in the Securities and Exchange Commission case against Ripple Labs, a digital currency issuer. The SEC in December charged Ripple with issuing $1.3 billion in unregistered securities, based on the company’s initial offering of its currency in 2013. The agency says Ripple’s efforts to promote and profit from its product qualify the currency as a security, subject to the restrictions that govern sales of equities.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet court findings in the discovery phase of the suit have highlighted the inconsistency of the SEC’s approach. In March Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn told lawyers that Ripple “has a utility,” casting doubt on the SEC’s view that the tokens are principally a claim on future profits. And last week Judge Netburn granted Ripple access to the SEC’s discussions of bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, which the agency considers exempt from its&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC believes bitcoin and ether aren’t securities, in part because their developers don’t profit from their sale. But those exemptions were announced through statements from former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in 2019 and 2020, with no formal rule-making. The findings by Judge Netburn in the Ripple case suggest that the agency hasn’t set clear rules for which currencies it regulates and which it&nbsp;doesn’t.</blockquote><blockquote>This confusion poses risks for investors. Coinbase delisted Ripple after the SEC filed suit in December, prompting a selloff that wiped out more than 60% of its value. The prices of Ripple and similar currencies have since tracked with the court’s statement’s on the SEC’s case. U.S. participants in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market are seeking clarity that the agency has declined to provide, preferring to announce its positions through individual enforcement actions.</blockquote><p>There’s really no other way to slice it. The SEC has dropped the ball on its core&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-has-a-full-agenda-as-he-gets-set-to-take-over-the-sec.html">Gary Gensler has a full agenda as he gets set to take over the&nbsp;SEC</a>   4.

<p>The sun is shining, the birds are singing — it’s officially Spring.</p><p>At Magic, we’re channeling a renewed sense of energy into the product to help you achieve better performance, scalability, and security for your apps. And as you build, there are new, fun ways to connect and grow together with the developer community.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share a brief “behind the scenes” look at some key updates for this&nbsp;month:</p> 🚀 Meet the new&nbsp;homepage <p>If you’ve been to <a href="https://magic.link/">magic.link</a> recently, you might have noticed some&nbsp;changes.</p><p>A new narrative, a new look and feel — plus, a friendly ghost&nbsp;mascot!</p><p>So, why the changes? The short answer is to better capture what makes Magic truly unique and unlike other passwordless auth solutions on the&nbsp;market.</p><p>After a busy first quarter to the new year, we found ourselves at an interesting point in the roadmap: the product was maturing at a fast clip and new updates were outpacing what was communicated on the website. It was time to align the&nbsp;two.</p><p>That’s why we refreshed our homepage to showcase new features, brand ethos (say hello to Hiro, our mascot extraordinaire), robust benefits, security expertise, blockchain-based identity and auth, customers, and Magic’s overall commitment to a great developer experience.</p><p>Our goals were to highlight:</p>  Our mission  The problems Magic solves for&nbsp;devs  What differentiates Magic  <p>Rolling auth from scratch is challenging. What if you could avoid reinventing the wheel, side-step the liability of passwords, and at the same time contribute to creating a safer internet? Magic ticks all of these boxes and then&nbsp;some.</p><p>“Plug and play auth” is as simple as it sounds. Check out our <a href="https://magic.link/">new site</a> to learn about our newest features.</p> 💫 Introducing Close-up Magic&nbsp;Meetups <p>At Magic, we’re big believers in the power of community.</p><p>Our team saw an opportunity for a dedicated space where developers could sharpen both technical and soft skills, so we set out to create&nbsp;it.</p><p>In March, we started mapping out a new kind of virtual meetup series. One that’s equally fun and engaging. Monthly meetups that bring developers closer together to inspire and learn from each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Which leads us to the name. Close-up Magic is a term used to describe magic — typically card tricks or coin tricks — performed up close, as opposed to on a stage. Other than proximity to the audience, the main difference between close-up magic and stage magic is the type of skill involved.

<p>Investment to support and accelerate development of HYPR’s True Passwordless Authentication technology</p>
      
<p>NEW YORK, NY, April 20, 2021 /BusinessWire/- <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">HYPR, The Passwordless Company</a> today announced it has raised $35 million in a Series C financing, doubling the company’s total funding to over $70 million. The investment is led by Advent International through Advent Tech, the firm’s dedicated global technology fund. Advent has significant experience in cyber technology, including recent investments in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/wiz-emerges-from-stealth-with-100-million-series-a-financing-and-a-mission-to-reinvent-cloud-security-887511529.html">Wiz</a> and<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyware-announces-30m-series-b-funding-led-by-advent-international-and-ten-eleven-ventures-301248144.html"> Cyware</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>The Series C investment comes amid significant momentum for HYPR as it grows market share and the global workforce pivots to a flexible workplace model.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR will leverage the capital to accelerate its go-to-market strategy and grow its global support organization in an effort to eliminate passwords for businesses worldwide. Advent joins HYPR’s existing investors including RRE Ventures, .406 Ventures, BoldStart, Top Tier Capital, MESH, Alumni Ventures Group, Allen &amp; Co, Samsung NEXT and Mastercard.</p>
      
<p>“Removing passwords for customers and employees eliminates a critical cybersecurity vulnerability, lowers IT support costs, and improves the overall user experience,” said Ashwin Krishnan, a Principal on Advent’s technology team in New York. “HYPR is a leading player in the emerging passwordless space, and has proven its ability to deliver for a large and diverse group of customers. We are incredibly excited to partner with HYPR, and believe the company is well-positioned for continued growth.”</p>
      
<p><a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/300-billion-passwords/">An estimated 300 billion passwords</a> are used worldwide. Yet passwords remain the #1 cause of cybersecurity breaches, over 80 percent of which are due to compromised credentials. The pandemic and a swift global transition to work-from-home have expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals, highlighting the security risk, high costs, and user friction caused by passwords and password-based multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>
      
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless MFA technology has made it easy for businesses to go passwordless by combining the convenience of a smartphone with the security of a smart card. The company emphasizes user experience and takes a standards-based approach to empower IT and security teams to eliminate phishing, fraud, and friction.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>“The shift to remote work has propelled passwords to the top of every security organization’s list of priorities. As the sophistication and volume of cyber-attacks grows, we’re seeing unprecedented urgency for a solution to the password problem,” said George Avetisov, HYPR Co-Founder and CEO. “We are thrilled to partner with Advent to truly accelerate the elimination of passwords. This investment will double the size of our team and expand our product delivery as we empower companies across the globe to go passwordless.”</p>
      
<p>Since announcing its Series B funding in October 2019, HYPR has grown its annual recurring revenue (ARR) by more than 300 percent, driven by key milestones including:</p>
      
  More than doubling HYPR’s customer base of global brands such as Norwegian Airlines, Rakuten, Otis Worldwide, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, CVS Health, Fiserv, and City National Bank;  Delivering passwordless MFA to more than 20 verticals, including financial services, energy, automotive, healthcare, education, and government;  Deploying workforce login solutions at scale across a diverse array of customers, ranging from 50-person firms to enterprises with 300,000 employees and hundreds of millions of customers;  Surpassing more than 100 million licenses sold for the company’s customer authentication solution, spurred by a steep rise in fraud and PSD2 regulations; and  Expanding the<a href="https://www.hypr.com/partners/"> HYPR Velocity Partner Program</a> with a founding network of 30 industry leading experts, including solution resellers, system integrators, and technology partners.  
      
<p>“When we partnered as a first check investor in HYPR, the phrase “passwordless” was relatively unknown. Today the space has heated up tremendously as enterprises scramble to eliminate passwords, especially in light of the pandemic,” said Ed Sim, Founder and Managing Partner of BOLDStart Ventures. “The HYPR team saw where the puck was heading and we couldn’t be prouder of what they’ve built or more excited about the path forward with Advent, an ideal partner given their cybersecurity experience.”</p>
      
<p>HYPR is headquartered in New York City, with teams in Boston, California, London, and Tokyo. HYPR intends to double the global headcount, with hiring ongoing in every department.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>About HYPR</p>
      
<p>HYPR is the leader in Passwordless Multi-factor Authentication.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>The HYPR Cloud Platform makes it easy to eliminate passwords and deliver lightning-fast login experiences that users love. With HYPR, businesses are finally able to stop phishing, reduce fraud, and enable unrivaled security for employees and customers across the globe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is with joy and excitement that we announce that the 3rd and final round of the Pre-IEO sale of the MUI MetaBlock mainnet coin — MetaMUI has been completed. This happened within yet another record-breaking time of 2 minutes, effectively breaking the previously set record which happened in 4 minutes. We can easily call the entire 3 rounds of the Pre-IEO sales an outstanding success, as it has been consistent recording-breaking from start to&nbsp;finish.</p><p>This wouldn’t be remotely possible without the support of the ever-present community who have been there from the very first round till to last. The final round which went live at 8:00 Am Estonian time, saw all 6,000,000 (six million) available MetaMUI coins sold almost in an instant. In all fairness, the <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-introducing-reservation-feature-9c940fa79648">Reservation Feature</a> played a key role as several community members deposited their crypto assets (BTC, USDT, ETH) ahead of time which guaranteed their participation in the final round of the MetaMUI&nbsp;sale.</p><p>Next Steps: We are currently in advance collaborations with leading exchanges working towards the listing of the MetaMUI coins, with the popular crypto pairs. This is to enable the trading of our mainnet coins making them more accessible to the entire global community, and rewarding our loyal community with the opportunity to trade our&nbsp;coins.</p><p>In the past couple of weeks, the SWN Global team have secured proactive partnerships with reputable global bodies, such as the <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/the-partnership-between-digital-economy-incubation-center-and-sovereign-wallet-network-803c8e30cec0">Digital Economy Incubation Center</a> which is a corporation with IT PARK Uzbekistan. A partnership that will see SWN Global work to implement blockchain-based e-government related projects/solutions in Uzbekistan.</p><p>We are also in deep discussions with leading financial institutions and governments in the development of their Central Bank Digital Currency(CBDC), Digital Stock Exchange(DSE) and Cross-Border Payment(CBPM) with the MUI MetaBlockchain, which remains the world’s first finance-specific hybrid blockchain platform, based on self-sovereign identity. This is our belief that these interactions will bring about more value to the MUI MetaBlockchain ecosystem once development starts.</p> Fulfilling The Purpose of the Pre-IEO&nbsp;sale <p>At the start of the Pre-IEO rounds, we stated the purpose of the sale in a previous <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-announcement-d8841875b0ca">Medium article</a> which is to increase SWN global development efforts in the creation of an ideal blockchain-based platform for Central Bank Digital Currency and Digital Stock Exchange creation. The total raised funds will be used to further establish the project road map and features described in our whitepaper found here: <a href="https://sovereignwallet-network.github.io/whitepaper/">https://sovereignwallet-network.github.io/whitepaper/</a></p><p>We are in a strong position to establish ourselves as a leading enterprise blockchain, and our whitepaper showcases a clear vision for establishing that goal. Our team has been actively working on this, and we are ready to utilize the full potential of our technology to impact the global&nbsp;markets.</p><p>A big THANK YOU to our loyal community, as the SWN Global team and management deeply appreciate your continued support. From the mainnet launch till the last round of the Pre-IEO sale, it was the MUI Community support all the way.

<p>Con circa 20 milioni di utenti all’attivo, l’ascesa di SPID non accenna ad arrestarsi, agevolando i cittadini a ottenere le proprie credenziali. InfoCert introduce un nuovo metodo di riconoscimento che sfrutta la tecnologia NFC presente nei device di nuova generazione, già ampiamente sperimentata in ambito bancario, come per &nbsp;Flowe, Open Banking Platform del gruppo Mediolanum.</p>



<p>Se il 2020 ha decretato il decollo di SPID (il Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale), con oltre 16 milioni di identità digitali rilasciate, il 2021 conferma il trend positivo con il raggiungimento di quota 20 milioni. InfoCert è stata una tra le prime Certification Authority ad accreditarsi come Identity Provider per il rilascio dell’identità digitale ai cittadini e ad oggi conta un numero di account attivi intorno alle 700.000 unità.</p>



<p>Le iniziative statali come il Cashback di Stato e il bonus vacanze hanno dato una spinta aggiuntiva alla diffusione già in crescita del Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale; InfoCert ha supportato il progetto SPID sin dal principio, prevedendo che nel momento in cui si fosse raggiunto un numero sufficientemente alto di utenti attivi, le imprese e le aziende private avrebbero cominciato a credere in questo sistema per rendere disponibile l’accesso ai propri servizi. Questo scenario solo immaginabile un anno fa è ora realtà; è ormai frequente infatti che anche imprese private sfruttino SPID per semplificare l’accesso ai propri servizi online per un bacino sempre crescente di utenti. InfoCert nel 2019 ha ottenuto l’accreditamento come Service Provider privato, dando così a clienti retail e corporate la possibilità di ottenere una firma digitale qualificata attraverso l’autenticazione con SPID di livello 2.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://help.infocert.it/home/guida/2820?t=p">Come funziona il riconoscimento SPID tramite NFC, scopri come richiederlo nella nostra guida</a></p></blockquote>



<p>NFC, acronimo di Near Field Communication, è una tecnologia wireless che permette di scambiare dati posizionando due dispositivi a una distanza inferiore ai 10 cm (spesso ridotta a 4 cm per motivi di sicurezza). Se entrambi i dispositivi dispongono di tecnologia NFC attiva possono quindi entrare in comunicazione semplicemente avvicinandoli.</p>



<p>Questa tecnologia è da oggi applicata per il riconoscimento valido al fine dell’ottenimento delle credenziali SPID. InfoCert infatti ha aggiunto fra i già numerosi metodi di autenticazione anche questa modalità: per poterne usufruire basterà selezionare fra le diverse opzioni quella che prevede il riconoscimento Online tramite documento elettronico, avendo in possesso, oltre ai requisiti standard, uno smartphone con sistema Android 7+ o iOS 13+ dotato di tecnologia NFC.</p>



<p>La stessa tecnologia come metodo di autenticazione per il rilascio di un certificato è stata applicata con successo da InfoCert ad esempio per Flowe, il nuovo istituto di moneta elettronica (IMEL) del gruppo Mediolanum il quale ha come obiettivo primario quello di fare evolvere il concetto di Banca Digitale offrendo servizi semplici, intuitivi e accessibili anche ai più giovani a partire dall’onboarding. Per questo, Flowe ha scelto la competenza e l’esperienza di InfoCert come Identity Provider; infatti, per chi fosse in possesso della Carta d’Identità Elettronica, è disponibile anche la lettura del documento al fine dell’attivazione del proprio conto.</p>



<p>Il vantaggio di questo processo è che tutti i possessori della CIE non devono conoscere il proprio PIN, ma possono sfruttare comunque i vantaggi del loro documento elettronico.</p>

 Zero-Knowledge Proofs — The&nbsp;Basics <p>The last few years have seen a big jump in the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and rightly so, given the many benefits it offers over traditional cryptographic methods.</p><p>Let’s look at some different applications and scenarios where ZKPs are being implemented to give you an idea of their future potential and more importantly, to enthuse you to think of the different areas where they can be implemented.</p><p>But before that, a touch on the&nbsp;basics.</p> A Brief Explanation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs <p>At the most fundamental level, a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol where one entity can prove its identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p><p>When you say that an entity has an identity, what you mean is that the entity has a series of claims that are used to uniquely identify it. Breaking it down further, we can say that this process comprises of two&nbsp;steps,</p>  Creating a claim, where each claim is a subset that contributes to making an individual unique. Some examples of claims are date of birth, passport number, driver’s license, Social Security Number, or any other government-ID that belongs only to an entity and can be used solely to identify&nbsp;it.  Proving the claim — A means by which this claim is proven without the actual information.  <p>So, you have two parties to the transaction — a prover and a verifier. The prover is the entity that is claiming while the verifier is the entity that wants to know whether the claim is authentic.</p><p>If you dig deeper here, you’ll notice that these claims are not information about the entity per se, rather it is a need for some proof of the prover’s claims. So, it is enough if the prover can send some data to the verifier to prove the claim without having to give the actual information.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. A prover wants to prove to a verifier that she is over 21 years old. In an interactive environment, she simply walks into a store and buys some alcohol. That’s enough for the verifier to know that she is over 21 years old without knowing her exact&nbsp;age.</p><p>Here, two entities are interacting directly, all that the prover has to do is perform a series of actions in front of the verifier to prove a&nbsp;claim.</p><p>But, what happens in a non-interactive environment?</p><p>The prover has to deliver claims in such a way that they can be verified independently by the verifier, and without sending the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that can allow the verifier to “know” the&nbsp;prover.</p><p>At the most basic level, let’s say that the prover decides to electronically send (email/text/message) her age in the form of an algebraic equation, 7(x+3), where x is a positive integer. When the verifier solves the equation, the value can be anything, but more than 21. Regardless of the “x” value chosen by the verifier, it proves that she is over 21 years. Clearly, the prover has sent the values in such a way that she tells the verifier of her eligibility for the services offered without revealing her exact&nbsp;age.</p><p>But think about it for a moment. Just because she sends an equation, it doesn’t really mean she must be over 21 years. She can just be a smart 12-year-old!</p><p>So, this brings up the need for another entity — someone of authority who can assert that the prover’s claims are right. In the above example, a parent or guardian can vouch that the girl is over 21 years, and it should suffice as the adult takes the responsibility for any legal action, if the girl is less than 21 years of&nbsp;age.</p><p>But what about real-life scenarios? Who takes the responsibility to back the claims of the&nbsp;prover?</p><p>An issuer.</p><p>So now,there are three entities to every&nbsp;claim.</p>  Issuer — An independent third party entity that collates the holder’s claims, verifies the same and creates an identity representation (a ZKP that validates the claims without giving&nbsp;PII)  Holder — The entity that owns/makes the claims and wants to prove it. In our above example, the claim is that the holder is over 21 years&nbsp;old.  Verifier — The entity that verifies the&nbsp;claim  <p>In such a setup, every claim made by the holder is backed up by the issuer, and only the information that the verifier needs is sent to that entity. This way, the verifier knows that the ZKP is a valid one because it has been digitally signed by the issuer, an entity that is authorized to prove the&nbsp;claim.</p><p>Going back to our age example, the holder claims she is more than 21 years old. Her claim is validated by an issuer, which is, let’s say, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Since this issuer had generated the license, it has all the information needed to verify the age of the holder. So, it sends a credential that simply says that the holder is more than 21 years&nbsp;old.</p><p>The holder, in turn, sends this credential to the verifier. Now, the verifier sees the digital signature of the issuer and since this is a trustable source, the verifier accepts the holder’s claim and gives the holder access to its services.</p><p>Here’s how a ZKP would&nbsp;look:</p><p>As you can see, there are no specific details about the person and all that it does is verifies that the holder is over 21 years old using the “ageOver” field in the&nbsp;claim.</p><p>This idea can be extended across many fields, especially the ones that deal with sensitive information. And that’s exactly what we’ll talk about next in our&nbsp;series.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs — Part 1: The Basics</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Tokeny Solutions and Polygon have partnered, allowing asset issuers to easily tokenize compliant securities in a cost-effective and scalable way. Tokeny Solutions provides technology for securities issuers to tokenize their assets and Polygon is a layer 2 protocol building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s smart contract deployment and transaction fees have always been difficult for financial institutions to comprehend. These fees have varied greatly over time, depending on the actions performed and the price of the cryptocurrency (ETH), an asset many institutions are unable to have on their balance sheet.</p>
<p>With the delay of Ethereum 2, the cost has got even higher, closing the door to many projects that wanted to target a large audience of investors, or those that foresaw many management transactions or transfers between token holders.</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership between Tokeny Solutions and Polygon, asset issuers can continue to rely on the security, resilience and ecosystem of Ethereum, whilst reducing gas prices by over 10000 times. Gas fees become so low that they no longer handicap the adoption of security tokens. Alongside this, transaction speeds dramatically improve to under three seconds, greatly facilitating token transfers between investors.</p>

		 
	 
    Polygon’s layer 2 solution brings the efficiency whereas the T-REX protocol enforces the compliance for security token ownership. Now, issuers can easily migrate their operations onto Ethereum and offer a secondary market for a fraction of the cost. By reducing the fees, new segments of asset issuers are opened as it becomes more commercially viable to projects fractionalizing expensive assets, targeting retail investors, or issuing microloans, loyalty tokens and stablecoins.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions       Tokeny’s T-REX solution has been a game changer for firms looking to issue security tokens. Polygon’s high performance and low cost infrastructure will bring a new level of scalability to the existing tech stack and give issuers access to the Ethereum ecosystem at a fraction of the cost. This will allow Tokeny’s customers to offer new solutions and build projects which were previously not possible. We are excited to partner with Tokeny and contribute to their growing presence in the blockchain space.  Arjun KalsyVP Growth at Polygon    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokeny Solutions has recently released the details of the first compliant liquidity solution for security tokens in Europe, T-REX Billboard, which enables investors to participate in an active secondary market for private securities. With this announcement with Polygon, investors can now transfer with one another at a significantly reduced cost, and further improve the liquidity of private market securities.</p>

<p>The Simplicity of Passwordless Authentication With The Security of Non-custodial Public Key Infrastructure.</p><p>Today we’re excited to debut <a href="https://openlogin.com/">OpenLogin</a>, the newest product in our line up of PKI and authentication tools and services, powered by the Torus Key Infrastructure. OpenLogin improves on passwordless authentication, both in terms of UX, privacy and security. Here are the highlights:</p>  Device native biometrics: Familiar Face/TouchID logins to your application.  Social Account SSO, &amp; Passwordless flows: Users can register via Google, Twitter, Github, and email verification.  Hassle-free Data Management: Manage the most sensitive data flows, user encrypt sensitive data, setup for GDPR, CCPA, CPRA compliance.  Non-custodial PKI Architecture: Secured on a mixture of user devices and authentication methods, the architecture makes it impossible to have conventional data breaches.  Customizable and custom logins: So that we blend right into your application.  Integratable in 10 minutes: That’s&nbsp;it!  <p>OpenLogin is available today through the newly unified Torus SDK. Head over to our <a href="https://docs.tor.us/open-login/get-started">documentation</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p> Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) today secures a lot of the&nbsp;web… <p>Since its inception, cryptographic keys have been rapidly adopted to secure many parts of the internet. Today Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) is used for securing almost everything from serving our websites through HTTPS to our end-to-end encrypted iMessages. It is also the foundation for the blockchain ecosystem, which has only popularized the usage of PKI’s further, now as a form of financial ownership. At its essence, PKI provides strong security and privacy guarantees through two functions; encryption, the ability to message only to defined recipients, and attestation, to be able to digitally sign or make a claim as the key owner. The latter being very similar to what we need for online authentication.</p> And it’s coming for user authentication <p>Authentication today inherits problems from the username-password account model that started when web clients first cropped up. While it served its function, passwords had their issues, being just a simple string they were easily guessable and with the millions of web applications being developed, each one of them created different accounts for a user. Solutions like OAuth (i.e. Google Login) made the experience better but both early integrators and providers of these services, unfortunately, exploited access to users’ data and captured far more information than they often needed. Beyond misuse of data by the holding entities themselves, these data pools also created honey pots for external hackers and nefarious actors resulting in <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">many</a>, <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/02/05/data-breach-email-and-passwords-leaked-compilation-of-many-breaches/">many</a>, <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/data-breach-statistics/">many</a> data breaches to date. With just a simple digital signature, PKI presents us with a clear opportunity to replace passwords altogether and secure the data dynamically between applications and&nbsp;users.</p> OpenLogin is PKI with Face/TouchID and Passwordless Authentication Your&nbsp;Way <p>OpenLogin is the first authentication suite to combine the simplicity of passwordless authentication with the security of non-custodial public key infrastructure (PKI). It brings the ease of passwordless, SSO, biometric authentication (WebAuthN) to any native mobile or web applications. OpenLogin makes crypto-friendly FaceID or FingerprintID possible. These user experiences are fast, familiar, and can help you convert more users at&nbsp;signup.</p><p>While each of these features is exciting, the most important detail to highlight is that each of these implementations is non-custodial.</p> Non-custodial Public Key Infrastructure means no data&nbsp;breaches <p>Torus is the only authentication platform that handles accounts in a non-custodial manner. Private keys that are analogous with accounts are generated and stored on a mixture of user devices and nodes on the Torus Key Infrastructure — they are only ever re-composable by the user. The user is always in complete control and the infrastructure is completely open-source.</p><p>This architecture circumvents the data honeypot issue that occurs with traditional account structures by removing data pools altogether, both on the infrastructure and application side:</p> On the infrastructure side <p>User accounts are represented via cryptographic keys secured across user devices and authentication systems, data encrypted only by their account. No central server to hack, meaning the risk of a data breach is virtually zero.</p> On the application side <p>With the ability to user encrypt data, because no personally identifiable information is stored on application servers, the risk of a data leak on the application side also is not possible. An attack on application servers would capture a user encrypted random string of numbers, not a user’s name, email, password or any other personable information.</p> It also means better management of user data and privacy guarantees <p>Also, instead of simply obscuring usernames, emails or passwords, or passing them on to another custodian (ahem, Amazon), using a PKI means developers get better privacy guarantees and more control over the data they collect and handle. OpenLogin doesn’t force applications to capture, handle, or secure usernames, emails, or even passwords (it also goes without saying that if data is never collected, breaches can never happen…).</p><p>Our one-of-a-kind PKI makes OpenLogin an easy choice for developers building applications that touch or handle sensitive data. It makes it easy to manage data flows, encrypt user data, and comply with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA regulations without sacrificing user experience.</p><p>OpenLogin even secures your application data upwards acting as a proxy, when you use social login. Preventing the login provider from tracking the application you’re on, similar to Apple login’s&nbsp;proxy.</p> Non-custodial PKI means digital user-sovereignty and a more open&nbsp;internet <p>Non-custodial PKI is an important step towards empowering the digital individual with self-sovereignty. Instead of login providers attesting for users, key pairs enable users to digitally sign that “I am me”, a building block for secure and private interactions on the web, from decentralized identity to digital ownership. Blockchain has popularized keys for financial use cases, and with OpenLogin we hope to bring the same guarantees to user authentication.</p> Get Started <p>OpenLogin is incredibly simple to implement. Integrating the SDK takes ten minutes and includes SSO logins (e.g. Passwordless, Google, WeChat), device native biometrics via FIDO2’s WebAuthN, as well as the essential linkability/recoverability flows for end-users. It works everywhere on any device or platform. Head over to our <a href="https://docs.tor.us/open-login/get-started">documentation</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>It’s free to download the Torus SDK and our pricing tiers offer a generous free tier.

 Shyft Network Telegram AMA — RECAP <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to the first official Shyft Network&nbsp;AMA.</p><p>It has been quite a ride so far and we are very excited for what’s in store for Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>So, why don’t we start by introducing the co-founder team that will be participating today.</p><p>Chris Forrester and Bruce Silcoff, please give the community a short intro, who you are, what role you play and, more importantly, why</p><p>Bruce Silcoff:</p><p>My name is Bruce Silcoff and I am a Co-Founder of Shyft, Head of Enterprise and Global Services, and CEO of&nbsp;PerseID.</p><p>I am a serial entrepreneur with a 30+ year proven track record of success across more than 25 businesses. I have always been focused on incubating game-changing technology solutions that solve real world problems. I am currently consumed by all disruptive blockchain solutions.</p><p>Before joining the management team at Shyft, I was a pioneer in the loyalty industry, managing some of the world’s most recognized reward programs with over 300 million customers from over 100 countries. Loyalty programs involve alternative currencies and are all about big data. As such we were doing innovative things like digital wallets and predictive modelling long before ApplePay and AI were made&nbsp;popular.</p><p>I was first attracted to Shyft as a seed investor because I recognized the potential behind the pioneering vision to use blockchain technology as a more efficient and secure KYC/AML solution. As I learned more about blockchain and its transformative power, I knew that the world was headed for a paradigm SHYFT and I wanted to be at the leading edge of this next industrial revolution…so I joined the company full time and am now a proud member of Team&nbsp;Shyft!</p><p>I bring value to the company by leveraging my experience, thought leadership, strategic guidance and an expansive network for collaborative partnership opportunities.</p><p>Chris Forrester:</p><p>Hi everyone&nbsp;:) I’m Chris, a co-founder and acting CTO of the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Day to day, I’m the one building the tech, designs, diagrams out, helping strategize, and helping the other engineers get the best results possible from any given scenario.</p><p>Juan Aja:</p><p>Awesome, for those of you who don’t know me, I’m Juan, a co-founder and army of one, managing multiple tasks for Shyft Network including marketing, communications and operations.</p><p>My background is in law and business, I practiced corporate and securities law before changing paths and breaking into blockchain.</p><p>Why? because I believe, at my core, that blockchain is a path to enabling people to take ownership of their own wealth. That type of freedom is invaluable.</p><p>So, we are going to do a round of questions. We’ll open the chat briefly so the community can post their questions. The team will select seven questions and respond. If we have time after that, we’ll do the second round of 4–5 questions.</p><p>I also want to remind everyone that we cannot comment on price and listing, so please stick to Shyft Network as a transformative technology 😁</p><p>Also, very important, we’ll select the top 5 questions for a total price of $200 USDT/C reward to be divided among them, so make them&nbsp;count!</p> FIRST ROUND OF COMMUNITY QUESTIONS: <blockquote>🅡 Tom:<br>Do you plan on partnering with more governments on top of the government of&nbsp;Bermuda?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Yes. Our plan is to show and sell our DiD framework to other jurisdictions by demonstrating a solution that has been deployed and actually works. Bermuda is the first of hopefully many jurisdictions.</p><blockquote>Richie Boy: <br>What do you see as the best outcome and network adoption for&nbsp;Shyft?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja: <br>So, there are a number of best-case scenarios here:</p><p>1. DeFi. Thanks to Shyft Network, institutional players step in, now confident that they can trace sources of funds and know that they are not enabling money laundering or financing terrorism. This brings about a new wave of decentralized financial services and products. More capital = better options and&nbsp;funding.</p><p>2. VASPs are compliant and using Shyft Network for all their KYC/AML. After seeing the effectiveness that the industry has on enabling users to do more with their wealth, governments finally understand that blockchain is a technology built to improve the lives of individuals.</p><p>3. Incredible new use cases are built on the platform, e.g. Digital Identity, Notarial services, digital rights management, all enabling businesses and users to finally work as GLOBAL citizens.</p><p>Bruce Silcoff: This functionality of the Network is intended to facilitate entirely new data marketplaces that empower individual users through an opt-in consent framework that protects their personally identifiable data. By building a more secure and efficient “data superhighway” for interoperable data exchange, the best outcome for network adoption would be rapid scaling by bringing together high volume data users with large holders of data (i.e. networks). That is why strategic partnerships with sector leaders of the industry, exchanges/vasp’s and with governments and their populations make sense as they will help us scale the network&nbsp;fast.</p><blockquote>Bart E:<br>Hello, I see there are a number of other groups working in this area. What partnerships have you made that make you believe SHYFT will be used universally? As opposed to other ventures.</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Our work with the exchanges via FATF-required regulatory processes (the “Virtual Asset Service Providers”) gives Shyft’s technology and public blockchain infrastructure the demand requirement for continual progression.</p><p>Given our team’s product cycle (VASPs with our Veriscope product, and government-vetted digital identity solutions like Perseid, we believe we have enough top-down product cycles with major partners to service the network for&nbsp;years.</p><blockquote>Reinout Wijnholds ✤:</blockquote><blockquote>Hi there! Happy to be&nbsp;here.</blockquote><blockquote>So, the way I see Shyft is that it tries to bring a connection from already registered KYC information to another platform, so you’d not have to give up all the information at all the companies. Is this correct? If so, I see that blockpass has a similar vision, how would Shyft network be better than&nbsp;them?</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Yes, much like how current O-Auth solutions function (google et al.) what needs to happen is an equivalent “log in” event to any transactional purpose. Whether it’s participating in a legitimate complaint activity like sales, exchanges, swaps, and (in specific jurisdictions) ultimately people can extend the Shyft platform as regulation evolves to incorporate new requirements of how assets are&nbsp;moved.</p><p>Our primary advantage is that we can incorporate other’s oraculized services into this routing network, with opt-in at the very top of it so that the user, at the end of the day, is in charge of their relationships and not the other way&nbsp;around</p><blockquote>Master Yi:</blockquote><blockquote>Today, the community figured out that this wallet moved the token to gate.io. As we believe that this exchange is unofficial. And then, the token moving out from gate.io and sell immediately on Uniswap. Can you clarify for the community about these suspicious transactions?</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Hi, great question and as always transparency is important — so this move was originally said by me to be happening a couple of days ago. We are striving to be 100% transparent preemptively, and so far we’ve hit that mark. We’ll keep doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>The answer to this question: Any liquidity that has moved in this respect, was to partnered ecosystem professionals who are working on distributing liquidity in order to meet incoming demand requirements.</p><blockquote>Tim S:</blockquote><blockquote>Has Shyft had any direct contact with regulators in the US, and in particular the incoming chair of the&nbsp;SEC?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Shyft has taken a collaborative approach to drive success. To ensure adoption and validity, we have to be in ongoing dialogue either directly or indirectly with regulators like the SEC, OECD, FATF, etc.. to make sure that our solution(s) are compliant.</p><blockquote>Philippe 🇧🇪🇧🇷:</blockquote><blockquote>Could you elaborate a bit on current and planned partnerships and community partners, and how it will add value to the Shyft proposition?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>For sure. We are currently focusing on four main verticals:</p><p>1. VASPs that are affected by the Travel Rule. These are exchanges, and other service providers that will have to deal with regulation;<br>2. DeFI, a longer play as DeFi is still somewhat in the early stages. Working with platforms that enable DeFi applications;<br>3. Governments. As Bruce said above, we are working on the deployment of a Digital Identity solution for Bermuda, once the product is deployed and proven, we plan on taking it to other jurisdictions, and<br>4. Infrastructure that expands capabilities of the Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><blockquote>Master Yi:</blockquote><blockquote>Exchanges have partnerships with Shyft — do they use shyft network as a solution for KYC? If not, when and how can they use&nbsp;it?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>We are first working with exchanges to deliver our Veriscope solution enabling them to comply with FATF’s new Travel Rule. KYC/AML and other products/solutions will also be made available to them in&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Philippe 🇧🇪🇧🇷:</blockquote><blockquote>What is the next big milestone after Mainnet&nbsp;Launch?</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>That’s a great question&nbsp;-</p><p>So there are a few things that will be happening in the next weeks on the product side, and they’re all excited for the community.</p><p>The first will be a specific interaction point w/ metamask UI to have an extra reward from playing AMM LP liquidity up. We’ll have more details very soon but anyone that is currently providing liquidity should be eligible. This may happen before mainnet&nbsp;launch!</p><p>The second will be an incredible offer to *anyone with any erc20 stablecoin liquidity of specific well-known types*, to receive SHFT token rewards simply by taking a zero-risk 1:1 pegged movement of your existing assets into a wrapped version with opt-in compliance features. We’ll be releasing details on this amazing program shortly after mainnet launch has occurred!</p><p>Of note — we may give the community winners &amp; those that *submitted all the documentation but simply did not win the lottery for the whitelist* a chance at early usage/rewards from&nbsp;these!</p><blockquote>Sol M:<br>I love the name Shyft. It’s catchy, can you give some insight on why you went with that name, and how you plan to use the name and brand to enhance marketing?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Thank you. So do we! While founders may have their own reasons why they like and chose the name Shyft… I like it because it best reflects what we are doing: Creating a paradigm Shyft in the way data is managed…and even the way we spell the word shift&nbsp;:)</p><blockquote>Dan:</blockquote><blockquote>Without market adoption, don’t you think that it is a bit premature introducing your own blockchain?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>Not at all. The enhancements that Chris and her team have built, the products and target customers, the technology itself, all of them require very specific security and resilience features. The scope of what we are building here requires its own infrastructure from the&nbsp;get-go.</p><blockquote>youri:</blockquote><blockquote>Nobody knows Shyft right now, when is marketing starting?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>We started building Shyft more than three years ago, but we had one thing very clear: build first, market later. That’s why we flew under the radar for so long. There are thousands of projects out there doing a ton of marketing on just a whitepaper. We decided not to do that, and now, Shyft Network is almost&nbsp;live.</p><p>I also wouldn’t say that “nobody” knows us, we have communities in &gt;5 languages, generating more than a million impressions per month for the past three months (when marketing started ramping up). And there’s a lot more to come. My co-founders have been hosted on the industry’s top podcasts and our press releases go out on top&nbsp;media.</p><blockquote>Bart E:</blockquote><blockquote>Thanks for answering our questions. You’ve outlined payments of SHFT will be needed to access the SHYFT network. Will this be enough to propel the token forward, or will you introduce other methods to draw prospective investors to the&nbsp;token?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>It all comes down to the basic economics of demand and supply. We are focused on the demand side by building or attracting viable and revenue-generating business use cases for our protocol. The more users we bring to the ecosystem, the more transactions happen, the more SHFT tokens are needed to pay for those transactions.</p><blockquote>Golden Ape:</blockquote><blockquote>Hello team, love what you&nbsp;do!</blockquote><blockquote>What is the plan for NFTs, do you see an application or a play in that&nbsp;sector?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>There is a play for NFTs. But that’s a bit further down the&nbsp;line…</p><blockquote>Peyman:</blockquote><blockquote>What’s your stake program&nbsp;plan?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>We will be releasing a blog post on this soon (not in the next few weeks though, we have mainnet and other partnerships to discuss).</p><blockquote>Reinout Wijnholds ✤:</blockquote><blockquote>How are you planning on getting Shyft out there in the world. A successful project has to be seen by others. Do you have new partnerships in&nbsp;mind?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>We have a growing BD team and it will be, along with product and marketing, one of the key activities that Shyft Network Inc. will focus on post-mainnet launch.</p><p>We are focused on building an ecosystem of VASPs, tech integrations, and developers.</p><blockquote>Base:</blockquote><blockquote>Give us an announcement u said we should expect something 😊</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>We are committed to and always hoping to share any and all good news with our loyal community of supporters. As such, we hope to share news related to technology advancements and milestones, strategic partnership signing, industry events (i.e. hackathons, conferences) and anything else deemed worthwhile.</p><p>Juan Aja:<br>We are still on track for mainnet in April. Testing has gone incredibly well and everything is coming together.</p><blockquote>youri:</blockquote><blockquote>Is there any competitor with shyft for the same use&nbsp;case?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>There are some that do small pieces of what Shyft is capable of doing, the reality is that they CAN operate and interact with SHYFT. Shyft is not a product, it’s a framework.</p><blockquote>Kras:</blockquote><blockquote>Do you plan to focus on marketing as well, in order to make Shyft more popular among the crypto&nbsp;world?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Up until recently, we have been focused on taking a whitepaper vision and making it a reality. Now that we have accomplished this, our amazing marketing team has started to aggressively spread the gospel through multiple social mediums. We recognize the importance of a strong community and are committed to growing it virally by sharing exciting accomplishments and interacting in manners such as this or conferences once things return to&nbsp;normal.</p><blockquote>🅡 Tom:</blockquote><blockquote>As you know there has been a lot of confusion regarding the Shyft token economics, and despite the very good medium articles you wrote about it. People have a hard time making distinctions between the active circulating supply (actually trading in exchanges), and the circulating supply that is used by the ecosystem and therefore not really circulating. Could you give us an estimation of what would be the active circulating supply tradable on exchange) in 4 or 5&nbsp;months.</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Hi, so there are technical 193m tokens in the circulating supply based on the initial schedules.</p><p>I’d like to take a moment to just describe and entwine a bit with my previous response about the various community-reward sub-products we’ll be releasing shortly — these were engineered with an expectation of a specific reward-for-work.</p><p>If that specific reward means more now than before, fewer tokens will be entering the market, because the reward rate can be reflexive relative to the work performed.</p><p>So these numbers are *maximums* but depending on reward cycles may be significantly less in token amounts during a specific time period.<br>For reference, the *absolute maximum supply* of the aforementioned community-reward programs were ~5.5% and ~4.5% of the network respectively, over a 15 and 10 year time period. At this point, the number of tokens for said rewards is vastly overestimated in the distribution number I just&nbsp;gave.</p><p>Juan Aja:</p><p>Ok, so we are wrapping up the AMA.

             April 2021   
	 
		 
			<p>This week could go down as a watershed moment for the crypto industry. Coinbase, a digital asset marketplace (DAM) for cryptocurrencies, listed on the Nasdaq just yesterday. When Netscape IPO’d in 1995 it was the beginning of the ‘dot-com’ boom, and a spate of other like-minded companies went public. What does this mean for the digital asset industry?</p>
<p>The news is undoubtedly positive for the rest of the blockchain industry,&nbsp;Coinbase was one of the first Digital Asset Marketplaces (DAM)&nbsp;to emerge as a trusted platform. It won’t be the last. Other types of marketplaces have also accelerated recently. As we recently saw with the emergence of NFTs, a number of asset specific marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible grew in tandem. Decentralized lending marketplaces have also emerged such as Aave and Compound.&nbsp;The next wave will be for security tokens.&nbsp;Now that the technology is ready, the missing piece is a recognized financial institution launching its own digital asset marketplace.</p>
<p>Indeed,&nbsp;the industry needs a credible entity to aggregate an audience of issuers and investors in a trusted and digital environment.&nbsp;These web platforms, powered by banks, asset managers and broker dealers, will help digitize capital markets by facilitating the discovery of investment opportunities. In turn, this will accelerate the qualification and subscription of investors, reducing management costs by digitally controlling securities, and ultimately improving liquidity.</p>
<p>All of this will become possible thanks to the use of a shared IT infrastructure, the blockchain, where all participants can manage and transfer assets digitally, under the control of securities issuers and marketplace operators. Using the same infrastructure creates significant network effects, where entities bringing trust will aggregate the main transactions volumes.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/">the Billboard release last week</a>,&nbsp;the first secondary market solution for tokenized securities available in Europe, we now propose an end-to-end solution for marketplace operators.</p>

					<p>Of the 1,000+ organizations who’ve used Trinsic since we launched the world’s first <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) platform 1.5 years ago, a large subset are building “trust ecosystems”, or networks of organizations and people that can share trustworthy data in a standardized and privacy-respecting way. While Trinsic’s platform has always served as a scalable, easy-to-implement way for these trust ecosystems to incorporate the technical standards required, organizations building trust ecosystems had to solve other problems themselves, including developing ecosystem governance and building tools to facilitate adoption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is why we are excited to announce Trinsic Ecosystems, our enterprise-grade product for building Trust over IP ecosystems. Coined a “trust ecosystem in a box”, Trinsic Ecosystems is the only product that combines the technology and governance into a single solution to scale a verifiable credential ecosystem. Over the last year, we’ve worked hands-on with a set of customers building trust ecosystems, which have collectively achieved adoption of over 100,000 end-users. Now, we’re offering Trinsic Ecosystems to select additional customers as capacity allows—<a>join the waitlist</a> to be notified.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The key to creating a trust ecosystem 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>A helpful model called the “<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-the-verifiable-credentials-model/">trust triangle</a>” is a good start to understanding how digital trust can be established, but issuers, verifiers, and holders won’t spontaneously create organic trust ecosystems. For years, industry nonprofits like the Sovrin Foundation and the Trust over IP Foundation have referred to a fourth party, a “<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2020/05/toip_050520_primer.pdf">governance authority</a>“, which could develop a governance framework for an ecosystem. <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">A year ago</a>, we took that one step further and introduced the concept of a “Provider”. Today, we propose driving that model all the way through to its logical conclusion by proposing that this fourth participant become a core part of the trust triangle.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>A trust ecosystem needs three things to be successful: interoperable technology, trustworthy governance, and tools for adoption. Trinsic Ecosystems is designed to provide these three components in a fully-integrated, programmatic platform, built specifically for providers.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Interoperable technology 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>In order for ecosystems to share and authenticate data seamlessly, standardized data models and formats must be utilized. Trinsic Ecosystems leverages the Trinsic Platform, a modular, technology-agnostic platform that allows providers to choose the tech stack they’ll build their ecosystem on—whether it’s using JSON-LD verifiable credentials that leverage existing PKI infrastructure, or ZKP-enabled credentials on the Sovrin blockchain, or other options coming soon on our roadmap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the standards and protocols evolve rapidly in the decentralized identity market, Trinsic stays abreast of changes and works to ensure continued interoperability so that you can focus on building your trust ecosystem.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Governance as code 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Developing governance for a trust ecosystem used to mean sitting in working groups in industry consortiums and drafting language through committees and Google docs. While that model still has its place, it’s wholly incomplete unless the software can effectively enforce the governance rules. Instead of making governance a purely legal construct, providers can program it into their ecosystems using Trinsic. Governance-as-code can answer the following questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Who are the ecosystem participants, and what are their roles?: Providers vet and admit participants into their ecosystem. These participants are automatically added to a Trust over IP-compliant Trust Registry, which allows all parties to know who to trust. Providers can be interoperable with other ecosystems by incorporating other Trust Registries into their own.  What kind of data will be exchanged?: Providers determine what kind of digital credentials (ID cards, health credentials, etc.) will be issued and verified in their ecosystem. This ensures authorized issuers can issue important credentials and prevents phishing and coercion from unauthorized verifiers as well.  How will credentials be bound to customer identity, and how will access be granted?: Trinsic makes it easy to deliver wallets to end-users via browser, mobile, desktop, SMS, or in-person, while enabling cross-device syncing and offline capabilities. Providers can evaluate the trade-off between low-friction onboarding methods with strong identity binding and configure the solution that’s best for them.

					<p>Once an ecosystem is configured, providers need to onboard participants like issuers and verifiers. Trinsic Ecosystems comes with an API that’s extremely easy for any issuer or verifier to integrate and can be white-labeled with the name of the provider. In addition to the API, ecosystem participants can use the Trinsic Studio, a white-labeled web dashboard.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 A frictionless consumer wallet experience 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Current standalone digital wallets introduce friction and sometimes frustration for end users. The user experience of downloading an app, configuring it, scanning QR codes, accepting various prompts—all to get their first credential—is less than ideal. Cloud wallets can address this, but they’re usually build for web-first experiences, not mobile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Embedding wallet functionality into existing applications people know and love is consistently the favorite way for end-users to access their credentials. But these users also expect production-grade capabilities such as cross-device syncing, backup &amp; recovery, strong security, and offline capabilities. Developers love Trinsic for its ease of integration, allowing you to provide the tools needed for adoption in your ecosystem.</p>

					<p>In order for customers to adopt a solution, they must know it’s scalable. Trinsic Ecosystems supports various standard technology implementations, each with varied scalability. The most scalable options support hundreds of millions of verifications per day and thousands of credentials issued per second. That’s orders of magnitudes more scalable than other options.</p>

<p>Welcome dear Ontologists to the ultimate staking guide! This article should serve as a place to find answers to all your staking questions for you to get on the road to a successful staking experience. This article is prepared by your Telegram admin &amp; Ontology Harbinger <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>, and should be considered as living document, so it is always up-to-date.</p> Part 1:&nbsp;Theory  1.1) What is&nbsp;staking? <p>Staking is the process of delegating your tokens to node. To put it simply, it's process where you lock your ONT tokens to earn ONG rewards. You will never lose your staked ONT tokens, because nodes do not ever hold or manage staked tokens. The only risk may be the staking lock period, which may not be suitable for active traders or short term holders. If a node operator cancels their node, your staked tokens will behave as if you had canceled your stake, and will be available to claim after the respective lock&nbsp;period.</p> 1.2) What are block and consensus rounds? <p>A block is a fundamental part of blockchain which stores information about transactions. At Ontology, production of 1 block takes from 1 second to 30 seconds, which means, that if someone performs a transaction every second, the block will be produced every second. For comparison, production of 1 bitcoin block takes approx. 10 minutes. This shows how ultra-fast the Ontology blockchain is- it has almost instant transactions. If no transactions appear for 30 seconds, an empty block is produced to keep consensus rounds flowing while giving it finite duration. It is set that 1 consensus round consists of 60 000 blocks. Through simple calculation means consensus round duration is from 16,66 hours to 20,83 days. So the higher the traffic, the faster the rounds. Currently the average duration of a consensus round is approx. 7 days. To track rounds use <a href="http://node.ont.io/stake">node.ont.io/stake</a> which displays the start/end times of the last 5 rounds as well as an approx. time until the end of the current&nbsp;round.</p> 1.3) What role consensus rounds play in the&nbsp;staking? <p>Staking is dependent on consensus rounds. So how do they work? Each staking event or change happens when a consensus round ends. That means, for example, if you submit your ONT stake during round 139, it will become active and locked when round 139 ends and it will then start generating ONG rewards. Until then, your stake is not active, hence it does not generate ONG rewards. Same applies when you decide to cancel your stake. If you cancel your stake during round 139, it will stay locked until round 139 (or 140) ends, depending on the node type. Moreover, respective ONG rewards are claimable by stakers after each consensus round&nbsp;ends.</p> 1.4) Node&nbsp;types <p>There are 2 node types, consensus nodes and candidate nodes. Full list and ranking of nodes is available at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>. From an ONT staker point of view the main differences are:</p>  consensus nodes (rank top 15): lock period of current round + 1 full round, lower rewards, distribute foundation bonus (top 7), rarely change reward distribution ratio  candidate nodes (rank 16+): lock period of current round only, higher rewards, do not distribute foundation bonus, can change reward distribution ratio more&nbsp;often  <p>For most stakers, it is better to stake for candidate nodes, because they have higher rewards and shorter lock period after cancelling your&nbsp;stake.</p> 1.5) Where do the staking rewards come&nbsp;from? <p>There are 3 ONG rewards for ONT stakers. I’ve broken down which node types distribute these rewards to&nbsp;stakers:</p>  transaction fees collected during consensus round (both node&nbsp;types)  released ONG based on release model (both node types) — read more about this in point 4&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/strengthening-ontologys-governance-and-staking-economic-model-245faf02107a">(here)</a>  foundation bonus (top 7 consensus nodes&nbsp;only)  <p>Learn more details about staking rewards from the <a href="https://node.ont.io/Ontology%20Staking%20Incentive%20Calculation_202006.pdf">Ontology Staking Incentive Calculation</a> published by Ontology.</p> 1.6) Why do candidate nodes have better&nbsp;rewards? <p>Consensus nodes and candidate nodes split the rewards (transaction fees and released ONG) 50/50. Currently there is approximately 167,7m ONT at consensus nodes while only 25,1m ONT at candidate nodes. Due to the fact that candidate nodes currently have much less ONT tokens in staking/nodes and they distribute the same amount of rewards as consensus nodes, their rewards per 1 ONT are much&nbsp;higher.</p> 1.7) Are there any special&nbsp;nodes? <p>Nodes can, of course, decide to use different ways of rewarding their stakers. For instance, they can distribute their own token, or some airdrop. Currently there is only one such node, Sesameseed. They distribute all staking rewards using their special SEED token. In this case, your staking reward isn’t ONG, it is SEED token. Read more about that in the <a href="https://medium.com/sesameseedorg/sesameseed-is-now-operating-on-ontology-f2a97378bf44">article</a>. In the past, the MovieBloc node also used to distribute to stakers extra rewards in the form of MBL tokens, but that has&nbsp;ended.</p> 1.8) What is the lock&nbsp;period? <p>Lock period is time you need to wait until your ONT tokens are unlocked from staking. Consensus nodes have 1 full round extra lock period, while candidate nodes have lock period until end of current consensus round. Example: You cancel stake at consensus node during round 110. That means your ONT tokens will be unlocked and ready to claim when round 111 ends. If you cancel stake at candidate node during round 110, your ONT tokens will be claimable when round 110 ends. If you want to be flexible, it is better to stake with candidate nodes, because lock periods are much&nbsp;shorter.</p> 1.9) How to understand data at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>? <p>There are 2 lists — Top 15 nodes are consensus nodes and the rest are candidate nodes. Let’s explain the meaning of all the&nbsp;columns.</p>Screenshot from node.ont.io website<p>a) Total stake: user stake (tokens staked by individual stakers)+ node&nbsp;stake</p><p>b) Node stake: amount of ONT which node operator locked at his node as initial stake when creating the&nbsp;node</p><p>c) Fee sharing ratio: Basically, imagine the node ONT tokens split into 2 parts, the node’s initial stake as first part while second part are user stake. Popular ratio can be 10%/90%. The first figure (10%) stands for how much of the rewards, which the node receives for their initial node stake, they distribute to stakers. The second figure (90%), stands for how much of the rewards, which the node receives for user staked tokens, they distribute to stakers. Example: (node initial stake 10k ONT, user stake 100K ONT, ratio 10%/90%, reward per 1 ONT are lets say 0.01 ONG) In this hypothetical case, node receives for 10k initial stake 100 ONG from which 10% he gives evenly to stakers and for 100K user stake node receives 1000 ONG from which 90% he gives evenly to stakers. Sum: Stakers share 910 ONG in total, while node operator keeps 190 ONG. If the ratio was 0%/85% that would mean the stakers share is 850 ONG and the node operator keeps 250&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>d) Annualized yield: (APY) represents real time dynamic value of expected yearly rewards for current stakers for next consensus round. It’s calculated in real time based on multiple factors, such as total amount of ONT in staking and nodes, sharing ratio set by node operator, real time market price of ONT and ONG tokens, etc. You can see with price volatility how APY dynamically changes. For example, if the price of ONG goes up 100% and ONT stays at the same value the staking APY would double. New nodes can display crazy numbers like 1000000% APY, but its only because they have very low size of user stake, such as 1 ONT token. When more stakes are added, rewards will drop to normal values very quickly. It is a side effect of real time calculation of APY. To calculate your approximate returns, you can use a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">calculator.</a></p><p>e) Reached stake cap: Node operator can set a maximum size of 10x allowed user stake of his initial node stake. Reached stake cap means how much of the max user stake capacity node currently has. Example: A node with 10K initial node stake can accept a maximum of 100K user stakes. In order to create room for more stakers, they would need to increase their initial node stake. If they were to add another 5k ONT to their initial node stake, their node can accept an additional 50k user stake,&nbsp;etc.</p> Part 2:&nbsp;Practice  2.1) How to&nbsp;stake? <p>Altough there are third-party options, to get the highest rewards I recommend using an official Ontology wallet such as <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO </a>mobile or <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet</a> for PC. Step-by-step guidelines for both wallets on how to stake your tokens can be found directly at <a href="http://node.ont.io/stake">node.ont.io/stake</a>.</p><p>Once you have ONT tokens in your wallet, you will also need ONG tokens to pay for gas fees. To submit staking you need 0.05 ONG, to claim first rewards also 0.05 ONG, same for canceling stake and claiming unlocked tokens. I recommend to always have 1 ONG in your wallet to pay the gas fees. Don’t send all ONG to exchanges, because you will not be able to make any transactions without 0.05&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>Once you stake your ONT tokens, there is no action required anymore. It will stay staked until you decide to cancel the stake manually or the node operator quit the node. If a node operator cancels their node, your staked tokens will behave as if you had canceled your stake, and will be available to claim after the respective lock&nbsp;period.</p> 2.2) What is the minimal amount of ONT to&nbsp;stake? <p>You can stake from as low as 1 ONT token since July 2020. First staking version required 500 ONT units but that is history&nbsp;now.</p> 2.3) How to select best&nbsp;node? <p>Based on all above information in part 1, it is clear that best rewards are currently offered by candidate nodes. How to pick the best? It is essential to check the sharing ratio column 7 and APY column 8 at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>. When checking the sharing ratio, keep in mind that first % is how much of the rewards, which the node generates by their initial stake, they distribute to stakers. The higher that number the better, but if the node does not reach full staking capacity, it is also important how big their initial node stake is (5% from 100K is more than 10% from 10K). Then check the second % of share ratio. I would not recommend staking with nodes offering lower than 90%, if possible. Also be careful if you stake with nodes offering high ratio. They often use this tactic to attract new stakers and once they collect enough stake, they will drop the rewards. In case you stake with nodes that offer 90/90 or 100/100, check regularly at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a> whether to see if they lowered the ratio, thus giving you fewer rewards. Some nodes like our admins node ►CZ/SK Ontology community node◄ made a public promise to not change our ratio. It can be good to know who is the node operator when selecting a node for staking. Read the article about our node&nbsp;<a href="https://dumontiskooo.medium.com/be-smart-maximize-your-staking-potential-with-ontology-telegram-admins-node-96a2b81d2dbf">here.</a></p> 2.4) Where to get&nbsp;ONG? <p>If you do not know where to get ONG tokens, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/markets/">here at CMC </a>you can find the list of exchanges that offer ONG trading pairs. The most popular is definitely <a href="https://accounts.binance.cc/en/register?ref=27915785">Binance</a>. In case you have your ONT tokens in ONTO Wallet and have no ONG for fees, you can use this guide to use the fee-less swap for 1 ONT to ONG at market rate — <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/assets/swapping-ont-for-ong">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/assets/swapping-ont-for-ong</a>. Lastly, you can also ask somebody to donate a few ONG to get started, if the above options are not available to&nbsp;you.</p> 2.5) When will I get rewards for staking and how to&nbsp;claim? <p>You will get rewards after each fully staked consensus round, for example, you stake during round 110, you will get first rewards for round 111 when round 111 ends. The rewards balance updates once the round ends. Then you can either claim your rewards or keep accumulating. There is no need to claim after each&nbsp;round.</p> 2.6) What to do with ONG&nbsp;tokens? <p>This depends on everyone’s personal strategy, some possibilities are:</p>  HODL ONG tokens for possible future higher price appreciation  Sell ONG for ONT, and keep increasing your staking&nbsp;position  Sell ONG tokens for different tokens/projects  Provide ONG tokens as liquidity for example at <a href="http://wing.finance">wing.finance</a> or <a href="http://ontology.unifiprotocol.com">ontology.unifiprotocol.com</a>   2.7) When will ONT tokens be unlocked after canceling your&nbsp;stake? <p>Read section 1.8 of this article to learn when your tokens will be unlocked. Estimated duration of current round, plus duration of previous rounds you can find at <a href="http://node.ont.io/stake">node.ont.io/stake</a></p> ENJOY STAKING! <p>If you have any questions, or to report missing or wrong content, or if you want to tip my wallet to buy me a cup of coffee, please reach me on <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter.</a> See&nbsp;you!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ultimate-ontology-staking-guide-e70c44330429">Ultimate Ontology Staking Guide</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tramite l’accordo tra InfoCert e Regione Lazio per certificare lo stato di avvenuta vaccinazione dei cittadini, si potrà disporre del proprio attestato vaccinale.</p>



<p>Roma, 19 Aprile 2021 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo, con le proprie soluzioni di firma digitale e marca temporale, garantisce non solo l’autenticità ma anche la conformità alle normative Europee degli attestati vaccinali anti-COVID emessi dalla Regione Lazio che, ad oggi, sono oltre 200.000.</p>



<p>Rilasciato a tutti coloro che abbiano completato l’intero ciclo vaccinale – secondo le modalità di volta in volta previste dalle diverse case farmaceutiche – l’attestato riporta i dati anagrafici del cittadino, le date della prima e della seconda somministrazione, la tipologia di vaccino, nonché il codice farmaceutico AIC e il numero di lotto di produzione.</p>



<p>Per garantire autenticità agli attestati vaccinali cartacei e digitali, LazioCrea – la società di informatica della Regione Lazio – ha scelto InfoCert e le sue soluzioni di Firma/Sigillo digitale e Marca Temporale e LAND per le soluzioni anticontraffazione basate su Contrassegno Elettronico.</p>



<p>Prima di essere reso disponibile per consultazione e verifica, ogni attestato viene inviato ad un Servizio Anticontraffazione che applica un QR Code Sicuro (Contrassegno Elettronico) che utilizza i Servizi di InfoCert per apporre un Sigillo Elettronico che è la Firma del soggetto giuridico della Direzione Salute Regione Lazio garantendone così l’autenticità e impedendone qualsiasi contraffazione.</p>



<p>Integrato nel Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico del cittadino, l’attestato è agevolmente consultabile e verificabile con l’App Salutelazio mediante lettura di un QR Code.</p>



<p>La tecnologia applicata da InfoCert è conforme ai requisiti fissati dal regolamento eIDAS: conseguentemente, gli attestati vaccinali della Regione Lazio – disponibili in italiano ed inglese – sono automaticamente conformi alle normative UE, l’ideale per il futuro adeguamento al passaporto europeo d’immunità.</p>



<blockquote><p>“In un contesto ancora molto fluido, la Regione Lazio ha scelto di giocare d’anticipo. In modo centralizzato, ha deciso di puntare sul digitale, scegliendo una realtà affidabile quale InfoCert. In questo modo, l’Amministrazione riesce a garantire ai propri cittadini un servizio d’eccellenza, che consentirà loro di disporre di uno strumento riconosciuto per muoversi, speriamo molto presto, ovunque e in libertà”</p>Maurizio Stumbo – Direttore Sistemi Informativi di LazioCrea.</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>&nbsp;“Siamo riconosciuti come gli specialisti del Digital Trust, cioè la Fiducia Digitale, determinante per garantire certezza assoluta e valore legale a numerose azioni e documenti sia nel mondo business sia per cittadini e pubbliche amministrazioni e siamo particolarmente orgogliosi non solo che questo ruolo ci sia stato riconosciuto anche dalla Regione Lazio in un ambito così delicato, ma soprattutto di essere riusciti a rispondere alla sua richiesta in tempi rapidissimi e con soluzioni collaudate”</p>Marco Di Luzio – Chief Marketing Officer di InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>L’attestato vaccinale può essere veicolato sia in digitale che in cartaceo. Ove stampato manterrà il trust digitale grazie al contrassegno elettronico realizzato da LAND Srl, azienda informatica specializzata in Fraud Detection, Electronic Signature e dotata di un centro di competenza tecnico-legale nell’ambito della digitalizzazione. Consegnato in formato cartaceo, con una semplice scansione il cittadino può ricondurre il proprio attestato al formato digitale originale.</p>

<p>In the beginning, AERGO selected the best advisors from the financial, technical, and the crypto world. These advisors helped to launch the AERGO project and set the tone for future directions.</p><p>AERGO has made great strides in 2020 and the momentum is carrying into 2021. Now it is not about launching the platform, rather getting corporations and consumers to adopt the platform. There are a lot of projects that Blocko, closest partner, utilized AERGO to production in many of the large corporate customers, such as Hyundai, Shinhan Bank, Lotte Cards, and many more. We have consumer applications around NFT and credential certifications with CCCV and CRISPY&nbsp;WHALES.</p><p>Now is the time to recruit new advisors that will help AERGO penetrate the everyday services and companies. In the next few months we will select advisors who are experts and influencers in their own industry. We have a clear vision and reason for selecting our advisors, the collaboration with the advisors will bring meaningful outcomes to&nbsp;AERGO.</p><p>It is our pleasure to announce our latest advisor Dr. Min Sun Park. Dr. Park is the founder and the director of The Clean Clinic (<a href="http://www.thecleanclinic.com/">http://www.thecleanclinic.com/</a>). Dr. Park holds a PHD in Nephrology and specializes in internal medicine and Hemodialysis. New to blockchain, Dr. Park has been studying and sees a place for blockchain in the medical field. Her clinic caters to many patients daily and soon will be an administerer for Covid19 vaccines. Dr. Park is allowing AERGO to explore real applications and deploy proof of concepts right in her clinic. This is a huge step in using real data to create solutions on the AERGO platform. Dr. Park will advocate in the medical industry the use of blockchain and evangelize AERGO.</p><p>We are very lucky to have such an enthusiastic advisor in the medical industry. Some may just discuss and theorize, but our new approach in selecting the next generation of advisors will allow AERGO to execute real life applications. Dr. Park is the first of many relevant advisors that will advance AERGO to the next&nbsp;level.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-advisors-the-next-generation-9694de8352b8">AERGO Advisors- The Next Generation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our credentials act as a record of our achievements or carrying out daily peer-peer transactions, but when you need them? Where are they?

<p>As I pored over <a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_/status/1379858946446462977">the most recent dev updates</a>, I struggled to find a cohesive story to share. There’s no one thing I can point to and say “See, this is what’s happened since the last Dev Pulse.” Just a lot of small updates. And then I realised — that is the message. Right now we’re making consistent, steady progress. Components are being optimised and rewritten, bugs are being found, core apps are seeing accelerated development. For those who would rather not read a tweet stream, here are the major points:</p>  HPOS, the HoloPort operating system, has seen a version bump of Holochain that’ll make integration of all the upcoming improvements a lot faster. This has involved a bit of work updating the Holo hosting components — Chaperone/Envoy (the parts that connect the user to their chosen host) and the HoloPort/Holochain API.  One of the upcoming improvements is a new proxy server, which is substantially faster than the previous one. The devs are currently working through a bug in which gossip is sometimes slower than before, and then it'll go to testing.  Another improvement is a new database layer built on <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. It's is unoptimised and currently slower than the current one built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database">LMDB</a>; our expectation is that it will enable optimisations that make it as fast or faster, as well as new Holochain features (such as sharding) that make the entire network more efficient.  There are now low-level components that install hosted hApps onto HoloPorts (previously the hApps were hard-coded).  DeepKey, our distributed public key infrastructure application, is in <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/branches/active">active development</a>. It features the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/main/zomes/deepkey/src/change_rule/validate.rs">most</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/main/zomes/deepkey/src/keyset_root/validate.rs">complex</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/2021-03-24-key-registration/zomes/deepkey/src/key_registration/validate.rs">validation</a> code of any hApp we know of, and requires rigorous testing. So we’ve introduced a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/674">mocking framework</a> that lets you <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/2021-03-17-keyset-mock/zomes/deepkey/src/change_rule/validate.rs#L291-L326">unit-test</a> any of your functions that use the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.100/hdk/index.html#modules">host API</a>.  Elemental Chat’s registration process is getting support for joining codes, so we can open it up to the wider world of the web while maintaining a manageable number of alpha testers. This feature will be available to any Holo-hosted hApp that needs ‘<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#membrane-proof">membrane proofs</a>’.  Rigorous testing of the Elemental Chat registration process has revealed a few bugs in the way Holochain handles cell creation.  <p>That last bullet is an interesting one, and I think it might help you understand just a bit more about what’s going on under the hood if I try to explain where those bugs are coming from.</p><p>The bugs we’re seeing are all about setting up a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#cell">‘cell’</a> for a new web user on their assigned HoloPort. A cell is a combination of an app binary (or <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#dna">DNA</a>) plus an <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#agent-id">agent ID</a>, and every agent who wants to use the app must have one running. (In fact, if there are no cells — no users actively using the app — the app can’t really be said to exist.) The cell is how you (or rather, the UI on your computer) interact with your own data in your <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#source-chain">source chain</a> and others’ data from the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#distributed-hash-table-dht">DHT</a>.</p> Preserving your agency <p>As you probably know, Holo hosting is a compromise between the full P2P, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#agent-centric">agent-centric</a> world of Holochain and the centralised world of the web. But one thing we refused to compromise was your agency, which is most powerfully expressed in your ability to choose what goes into your source chain. That source chain is a public record of the things you’ve done in the app, and you don’t want anyone else messing around with it.</p><p>In order to preserve agency at this level, a HoloPort should never be able to write to your source chain, even if it wanted to. You see, every source chain entry has to be signed by your <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#public-key-cryptography">private key</a>, which is a secret component of your agent ID. The signature has to cryptographically check out against your public key (which appeared in element #3 of your source chain). And that private key is generated and safely stored in your browser every time you log in. That’s what protects you from being impersonated by a rogue HoloPort.</p><p>The way Holochain apps work, when you want to perform an action (say, publish a tweet) your UI calls a function in the cell, which ‘stages’ a few writes to the source chain. Then the Holochain runtime validates those writes against the DNA’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#validation-function">validation rules</a>, creates a signature for each of them using your private key, and writes them to storage.</p><p>But this creates a bit of a problem if your private key is on your machine and your cell is on a HoloPort. So the HoloPort has to send a signing request back to your browser, consisting of all the source chain writes it wants you to sign. This happens in a separate HTTP cycle.</p><p>Now there’s another problem: there’s a very thin window of time, between making a function call and signing the writes, where you might just close your browser and scuttle your HoloPort’s attempt to get those writes approved. If that happens during registration, where your HoloPort is trying to write your Elemental Chat invite code and public key to your source chain (the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#genesis-elements">genesis elements</a>), it can’t actually create a valid cell for you.</p><p>So the Holo dev team is working on addressing that edge case. There are two parts to this: one is to fix an issue where the Holochain conductor locks up on failed validation (that’s just a common bug with an engineering solution <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-nixpkgs/pull/790">on the way</a>), and the other is to recover gracefully when the genesis elements can’t get signed on first try.</p> Keeping bad actors out of the network <p>With Holochain, every application (or rather, every DNA within every <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#dna-bundle">hApp bundle</a>) enjoys its own isolated network with its own separate store of data (its <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#distributed-hash-table-dht">DHT</a>). And sometimes it makes sense to restrict access to that network.</p><p>For this we have the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#membrane-proof">‘membrane proof’</a>, an element near the beginning of your source chain, that supplies some sort of evidence that you should belong to the network you’re trying to join. Depending on the app, it could be a simple invite code, or it could be something complex such as a cryptographic certificate signed by three existing members. This membrane proof is something you supply when you start up your cell, and it’s validated by your initial <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#bootstrapping">bootstrap</a> peers before they let you access the rest of the network and its data.</p><p>Elemental Chat is one of those applications; it requires an invite code on signup. The Holo single-sign-on dialog has a field you can paste your invite code into; this gets passed on to your assigned HoloPort.</p><p>But what happens when you get the invite code wrong? The validator network should reject you before you even get the chance to take a look at the data in the DHT. This is tricky, because you’re supposed to self-validate before joining — that prevents you from publishing bad data. But if validating the invite code requires access to DHT data, you might not be able to self-validate!</p><p>This chicken-and-egg problem has sparked a series of discussions about the best way to handle membrane proof validation. It’s an example of the sorts of engineering challenges the dev team face regularly, challenges in which they have to consider the impact on user experience while maintaining commitment to a ‘correct’ design that ensures data integrity. (I love observing their conversations; it makes me feel smart but also gives me a sobering appreciation for how much I still have to learn about Holochain’s inner workings.)</p><p>The first step is to fix a bug that locks up Holochain when the Elemental Chat invite code is invalid. As with the previous section, this is just a routine engineering matter. The more important step, currently being worked on in parallel to the bugfix, is to identify the most sensible design for membrane proof validation — one that is easy for developers to understand and use, ensures correctness, and minimises unpleasant user experience.</p><p>The most likely candidate design involves a three-step process:</p>  The agent’s cell calls a basic sanity check callback on the membrane proof; this can do things like check for correct structure or catch typos.  The agent’s cell tries to bootstrap into the network and publish their genesis entries; selected peers validate the membrane proof properly, potentially using DHT data in the process.  The agent detects whether they’ve successfully been granted access to the network; if they haven’t, they destroy their cell and try again with a new agent ID (and possibly a new membrane proof, depending on how the app’s membrane protection is designed).  <p>The goal of this process is to catch as many classes of honest mistakes as possible before you try to join the network, while still allowing the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#immune-system">immune system</a> to identify truly bad actors and giving you a chance to try again if you’re mistakenly identified as one yourself.</p> So what does this mean for hosted Elemental chat? <p>By now you’re probably wondering whether that long-awaited <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">milestone</a>, hosted Elemental chat for web users, is being delayed.</p><p>Nope! This is all an expected part of the development cycle. When theory meets the real world, there’s always a process of adjusting the two to match each other. I’m glad to see it happening; it means we’re identifying all the weird edge cases that tend to hide when it’s all just theory. And as we deal with each edge case, it’s just going to make Holo-hosted apps (and Holochain in general) that much better.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@christianlue?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Christian Lue</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/broken-glass?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

Their first project will be under the umbrella of <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/">GAIA-X</a>, the European Association for Data &amp; Cloud, as part of the GAIA-X 4 Future Mobility Project, which aims at bringing cloud applications to autonomous &amp; networked vehicles.</p><p>The project’s overall goal will be the creation of a decentralized ecosystem of data &amp; services that allows autonomous &amp; networked vehicles to integrate into smart infrastructures and third-party services, following GAIA-X’s design principles. With mutual trust as its core concept, its stated goal will be achieving data sovereignty.</p><blockquote>Our deep belief is for data to be treated as an asset. By tapping into underutilized data from mobility IoT sensors, AI can uncover mobility patterns and optimize services / reduce waste. Machines can speak to each other and algorithms can make optimizations — all in real-time. Ocean can tokenize mobility data from devices, thereby creating an opportunity for these tokens to be used as instruments in DeFi projects. This is one of the many ways in which we enable data owners to share in the value their data&nbsp;creates.</blockquote><blockquote>Razvan Olteanu, COO of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Different market actors will price data differently, depending on the method of data generation, data quality, and its utility to the potential buyer. Ocean Market allows for dynamic pricing and thus for optimal value generation for data generators and data curators, in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><p>This project will use Datarella’s Enterprise Blockchain Solutions which prominently features Ocean Protocol technology in its stack. This will serve as the foundational, underlying protocol for digital business transformation with converging technologies such as AI and autonomous machines. Datarella’s future mobility solutions are fueled by blockchain technology, real-time decentralized data management, transparency and GDPR compliance. Given the natural synergies between Ocean and Datarella, this partnership is the first of many that will drive enterprise adoption of Ocean Protocol technology in Datarella’s client&nbsp;base.</p><blockquote>For Datarella, technology is an instrument to increase the quality of living, by supporting human beings in all kinds of professional and private activities. The growing complexity and diversity of our ecosystem require technological infrastructures that facilitate collaboration and cooperation. By planning, developing and implementing blockchain solutions worldwide, Datarella meets this requirement: in the fields of Finance, Supply Chain, and Mobility, we enable industry participants to join forces and create sustainable, crisis-proof business&nbsp;models.</blockquote><blockquote>Michael Reuter, CEO of Datarella</blockquote><p>Ocean Protocol (BigchainDB) is a Day 1 Member of GAIA-X Association AISBL, an international non-profit organisation established to achieve the GAIA-X project goals for the development of an efficient, competitive, secure and trustworthy federation of data infrastructure and service providers for Europe — fostering digital sovereignty of European cloud service&nbsp;users.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

<p>Using Helm Charts to set up the Epirus Chain Explorer and connect it to a running Quorum&nbsp;network.</p><p>Some weeks ago we published an <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/quorum-kubernetes-templates-6cda506a6887">article</a> in which we refer to one of our <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template/tree/main">GitHub projects</a> that you can use to deploy a quorum network with a dynamic amount of nodes to your Kubernetes cluster. In this article, I will describe how to set up our newest addition to the Helm Chart — the Epirus block explorer.</p> Why we use&nbsp;Epirus <p>If you come across the task to choose a block explorer in 2021 you will most likely have 2–3 viable solutions of which some are licensed and some are free to use. Most Ethereum Clients will most likely favor <a href="https://blockscout.com/poa/sokol/">BlockScout</a>, an open-source block explorer with a wide variety of features. But, if it comes to quorum-based networks we discovered some quirks that do now align well with BlockScout. One example would be the BlockScout having <a href="https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/3294">problems parsing rafts block timestamp</a> which is in nanoseconds instead of seconds. We discovered that those kinds of problems often arise with open-sourced explorers in combination with quorum-based networks. This could be due to the enterprise nature of quorum which ultimately could lead to fewer open-source contributions.</p><blockquote>Based on those discoveries we decided to stick with the explorer that is covering most of quorums peculiarities and is also referred to in the official quorum documentation — <a href="https://www.web3labs.com/epirus-explorer">Epirus</a>.</blockquote> How to deploy the&nbsp;Explorer <p>To deploy the Epirus Explorer to your cluster adjust the epirus values in the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template/blob/main/quorum/values.yaml">values.yaml file</a>. Enable the ingress value to make it accessible locally or adjust the node value to change to which node Epirus will connect&nbsp;to.</p><p>After adjusting these values simply run helm install — if you don't have a running cluster — or helm upgrade if you already deployed a cluster on your machine to deploy/upgrade the&nbsp;charts.</p> helm install nnodes quorum -n quorum-network                       helm upgrade nnodes quorum -n quorum-network  Accessing the&nbsp;UI <p>After a successful deployment of the explorer, we can access the UI using the Cluster’s IP.

<p>The purpose of this page is to be a resource about the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.</p>
 1. Update on Canada’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (Tim Bouma) 
<p>• Video Link: <a href="https://youtu.be/WAvjFuJqEYw">https://youtu.be/WAvjFuJqEYw</a><br>
• Guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma">https://twitter.com/trbouma</a></p>
<p>I’m excited because we just put the finishing touches on the use case chapter for the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">self-sovereign identity book</a> that Drummond Reed will be talking about later.&nbsp;The title of the chapter is “Canada: Enabling Self-sovereign Identity,” and we’ve got substantive information in there.</p>
<p>There are about 10 or 12 pages of content. I’ll walk you through some of the things that we’ve been going through in the Canadian Public Sector, and I’ll connect it back to this product that you see on the screen.</p>
<p>The PCTF model.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/</a></p>
<p>We’ve been looking at self-sovereign identity for a long time in terms of what the technologies are and what the model is. Things are still evolving.</p>
<p>In the early days of identity management, we had more of a program-centric point of view. First, we shifted it to a user-centric point of view, and now we’re moving to a self-sovereign point of view. We’ve learned a great deal over the years, if not the decades, and we’ve been able to come up with a policy approach or a Pan-Canadian approach that doesn’t necessarily lock us into any particular technology.</p>
<p>In fact, when we started in earnest on the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, self-sovereign identity wasn’t even a term that existed yet. It might have existed in certain quarters, but it was certainly something that we weren’t aware of.</p>
<p>We began to get familiar with the concepts, and we followed very closely with what Drummond has been doing in the self-sovereign community. We’re actively ingesting those concepts into the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.</p>
<p>Because we’re the Public Sector, we’ve also had to pay very close attention to many legacy systems, centralized systems, that is, the Federated systems. They’re not going away anytime soon, so we have to come up with an approach that’s a synthesis that enables those systems to come together effectively. This is the current status of what we’ve been calling the ‘public sector profile’ of the Pan-Canadian Trust framework.</p>

Definition:
<p>It’s a model of agreed-upon concepts, definitions of processes and conformance criteria. Equally important is an analytical approach that enables us to do a detailed assessment of other jurisdictions, such as other sectors, so we can accept trusted digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing that’s happened behind the scenes is our active work with the Government of Canada over the past ten years. In 2009, we introduced our first policy instrument: the directive on identity management. Ten years later, in 2019, we revised it. When we updated the directive, we added several new concepts, such as trusted digital identity and trust frameworks. The additions have enabled us to accept self-sovereign identity or <a href="https://northernblock.io/">trusted digital identity</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been taking those ideas and making sure they fit seamlessly into the policy framework that we’ve been developing. That way, we can truly be ready for the future and not be locked into the past. This approach is proving itself out.</p>
<p>You may not be aware: as of February 10th, we have the province of British Columbia integrated into the federal programs within the Canada Revenue Agency. We also have the example of the province of Alberta, which is integrated into the My Service Canada account and accepting the trusted digital identities. I spoke earlier about traditional legacy human integrations: Now, we’re setting the stage for enabling <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">digital wallets</a> and the notion of self-sovereign identity, so an individual can present their trusted digital identity to be consumed by the federal government.</p>
<p>We’ve been conceptualizing to help us fit this together. I’m showing you a block diagram here: we have this all up on <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">GitHub</a>, so you can read about it, along with formal definitions. What we’re calling the normative core of the model is that we formally define what we call Identity Domains, Foundational Identity, and Contextual Identity. We formalize this notion of digital representations, the identity of individuals and organizations, and businesses. We’re looking at relationships.</p>
<p>We defined many atomic processes; that’s the required detail that enabled us to do the conformity assessments and evaluate dependencies on other organizations or other jurisdictions. We can apply that against the conformance criteria and qualifiers. It’s really a conformity assessment framework. Now, we have the ability to do the due diligence to accept a Province as an issuer of claims, to use some of the lingo in self-sovereign identity. Quite frankly, digital identity or trusted digital identity is simply a very specific use case of the broader case of verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>The other part is the Mutual Recognition Process. We go through from the bottom to the top: mapping the processes, aligning them to other frameworks. We’re starting to have conversations with the <a href="https://www.eid.as/">eIDAS</a>, what we call the digital nations.</p>
<p>These are other countries with whom we can start mutual recognition, have a formal assessment, and an acceptance process.</p>
<p>There’s a notion of digital ecosystem roles and supporting infrastructure. We know that this has to work with existing investments and existing infrastructure, and also has to fit into institutional frameworks. So, we’ve spent a lot of effort on formally defining this.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/version-1-1-of-the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-is-now-available-feacc883d190">https://trbouma.medium.com/version-1-1-of-the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-is-now-available-feacc883d190</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Model of Verifiable Credentials</a> and self-sovereign identity, you’re probably familiar with the roles of issuer, holder and verifier.&nbsp; We’ve mapped that out more fully with the idea of Subject and Claims. We’ve also added another box at the bottom, which we’re calling “Methods.” What we’ve learned is that you need to trust an entire system. That’s more than just a single organization; it’s more than a blockchain; it’s more than a database. It’s a set of methods through which you can register and confirm, but also make sure that everything is correct and nothing has been changed. I wanted to show that in the diagram. We found that we can take this model and we can map authoritative parties, relying parties, and service providers. We do have a mapping in the trust framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing that we’ve learned is that we’re making a clear separation between what we’ve been calling the “conveyance network”: that is, processes that actually convey the proofs versus those that issue and verify the proofs. Now we know where the infrastructure players can fit in. It doesn’t matter whether it’s centralized, federated or blockchain, or completely decentralized. We know how to box those things in the middle to actually convey the proofs. Our primary concern is making sure that whatever gets issued onto that network, we actually trust in the first place. And then when it gets verified, it hasn’t changed since. We have a nice, clear separation now.</p>
<p>We’ve also been working with Drummond to make sure that we’re mapping with the notion of four layers in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> stack, and this is where we’ve mapped to the model of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Normative Core and the Mutual Recognition set up the layer of Governance Frameworks when mapped to the stack. It’s not a formal governance framework per se, when viewed with the larger picture of legislation, regulation, and formal agreements between jurisdictions. It fits in very nicely, a little below there.</p>
<p>Layer 3, the Credential Exchange, basically that encompasses the Digital Ecosystem Roles that Drummond will be talking about a little bit later.</p>
<p>All the aspects of the bottom two layers of the stack, DIDComm and DID Registries, fit into the notion of Supporting Infrastructure.</p>
<p>It’s not directly within the scope of the PCTF, but we see the massive potential of these emerging technologies. We also understand that we have to effectively support traditional technologies, such as SAML integrations, and OpenID Connect. So, we’re making sure that we can actually migrate to the new platforms without burning the old platforms down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that this has to fit into the larger context of making sure we meet our digital service delivery level requirements, the user needs, and so on.</p>
<p>We’re not reinventing privacy and security; we already have a privacy impact assessment/security assessment authorization. We know there are several interoperability standards, and we’re not redefining those things; in fact, we’re leveraging that. Coming back to the province of BC during the assessment process, that was only one of eight work streams that were involved in actually on-boarding a Province. There were also communications, agreements, the privacy impacts assessments, technical integrations, security assessment, and there was an overall governance stream.</p>
<p>This shows how everything fits together. I know it’s a bit of a mile-a-minute here, but returning to the chapter that we had written, I’ll just read some of the statements that we made. We said:</p>
<p>“Trust Frameworks such as PCTF and self-sovereign identity are parts of a larger global picture. Domestically and internationally, there is a new and emerging global equal system incorporating a mixture of new technologies and legacy systems. It is anticipated that these technologies and approaches will co-exist just for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>As I said, we have assessed and accepted integration from the province of Alberta and the Province of BC. They used traditional integration methods, but we certainly see how we could actually integrate the <a href="https://www.aceprogram.ca/">Alberta Credentials Ecosystem</a> and also the <a href="https://vonx.io/">British Columbia Verifiable Organizations Network</a>. There are other activities that BC is doing, activities taking place in Ontario and globally as well.</p>
<p>We’re actively pursuing SSI. It’s still too early to predict the future. That’s one thing that we’ve learned, we’ve got to keep our options open as much as possible. With what I’ve shown here, the PCTF is a tool to help relate SSI into the government context, and to drive the hard task of the institutional change needed to better serve Canadians. Honestly, the hard part is dealing with all the legal folks and the policy folks. You don’t see that on the surface, but that’s where a lot of the hard work resides. We see this approach encouraging new institutional relationships that can leverage self-sovereign identity. If we do it right, it’s going to become pervasive, and it’s going to create a better digital ecosystem.</p>
 2. Update from Joni Brennan, President of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) 
 Digital Identity in Canada 
<p>Mathieu: I think that gets you much closer to a user-centric scenario that is security-by-design, and privacy-by-design. All of these experiences that we’re striving for, come from having the ability to be selective about what you’re sharing or not sharing, and from the ability to be selective about your personas, as you mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Moving on, I appreciate the overview here of Digital ID as a whole, but now, I’d like to look at Digital ID from a Canadian perspective. You would have great visibility into this, at both a federal and provincial level — it’s apparent that many of the government bodies here in Canada are investing significantly into their digital identity strategies. They’re working hard to fully revamp the architecture and accelerate the progress towards some of these goals that we’ve been talking about here.</p>
<p>How do you see digital identity in Canada, and how does it compare to what’s happening in other countries or regions like the European Union? I think there’s a lot of innovation and leadership happening in Canada. How do you compare the digital identity progression in Canada to what you’re seeing in the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, there is. That’s a great question, and I would say it’s also a particularly interesting question to me, as an immigrant from New Jersey to Canada. From that perspective, feeling the cultural differences of how particular regions might look at things, and also being someone who’s worked in the space in a global landscape — I would say there are times when we’re not always good at calling out the places where we are moving forward. There are times when we are also falling behind, so there’s not a singular perfect answer. If we get into levels of assurance, we’ll talk about the importance of having more defined scorecards to measure progress. Where we are, and how we’re doing — it very much depends on what kind of question we’re asking.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, DIACC (Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada) put out a white paper titled “Building Canada’s Digital Future”. The white paper outlined that the opportunity for the public and private sectors to come together in Canada, and to put an economic-benefits-for-all approach at the forefront of the economy, is important for everyone. Regardless of whether you’re an individual or a business owner, or you’re a government entity, the economy matters to all of us. So let’s put the economy, and benefits-for-all first. Then, let’s put public and private together under that umbrella to collaborate, and to develop an approach forward. That kernel right there is world-leading, I would argue. Until I got to Canada and joined DIACC, I hadn’t seen any organization or region take that very specific approach. I think that’s unique. In many other countries around the world that I visited (New Zealand for example), they have very clearly stated that that was fascinating and inspiring to them. I’ve since seen many other regions around the world start to move towards using that kind of economic lens, and I think that’s fantastic.</p>
 <a></a> European Union Progress 
<p>These entities are even going as far as the eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) program. eIDAS is instantiated to enable benefits delivery, so we have trust point anchors across each of the European member states. That means we can ensure that people can get access to their insurance or their service delivery. From the government side, a single market for that eIDAS wouldn’t be able to build in that type of broad economic private sector lens.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Angela Merkel of Germany gave a speech where she spoke about the importance of these systems; for a single digital market for economic growth that benefits everyone. The next version of eIDAS deeply considers the question of how we bring in both sides of this picture. In other words, bringing public capabilities and private capabilities into the same ecosystem. Using that framing, I’d say we were way ahead in looking at that as a collaborative effort. Recognizing that people are at the center and that they make transactions, whether they’re transacting with the government or whether they’re transacting with business. So we’re way ahead there.</p>
 <a></a> Challenges in Canada 
<p>There’s also a tendency to look to our friends in Estonia. Which is great, there’s lots to learn there. We should always be looking at what’s happening around the world, but we have to also recognize that we’re a federated country. Our healthcare system is a great example. People say “Oh, Canadian public health care”. Well actually, it’s provincial public health care. There are 14 different entities providing health care services; not a singular one. Identity works in the same way, so we have to be able to pick and choose the things that work for us, and organize them in a way that works with our federated governance and our culture as well. We have our own cultural uniqueness in terms of what people are looking for, and what they aren’t. What we’ve seen on the digital identity front is that it will typically be done in a top-down, federal governmental approach. It’s handled in a very singular approach and solves a particular need. There are places where we are behind, even in that top-down, “How do I transact with government” approach. We’re not as far along as we’d like to be.</p>
<p>When it comes to that economic view, I think we’re quite ahead. Is it an easy path? No, it’s not an easy path. You’re bringing together players that have different cultures, and different priorities. Maybe the priorities are similar, but they’re organized in different ways and different working styles. So, it’s fascinating to be in DIACC where we have peers, partners, and competitors working together. We have healthy collaboration and healthy tension — whether that’s across public sector actors, private sector actors, or the collective as a whole. We’re quite ahead in the sense of the collaborative, the vision, and the view, and in the way that we’ve crafted our framework for that purpose and for some of the specific use cases. We’re behind on that journey and we need to get moving, but ultimately I do think that we’re in a good position because we’ve looked at this all the way through. However, if we don’t have the political priority from different levels of government (federal, provincial, and territorial), we are not going to be able to excel the way that we need to. If we don’t have a common data approach, and common data strategy where people’s data is concerned, we’re not going to be able to leverage all the acceleration that’s happened. It’s not a simple answer.</p>
 <a></a> Digital Wallet Opportunities 
<p>Looking at identity in the context of banking or the financial sector, we have lots of collaboration happening there. We’re either on pace or ahead in terms of how the financial sector is collaborating, depending on where and how you’re comparing When we look at the matter from the public sector perspective, the provinces and the territories are all in different places. So I think there’s a real opportunity for them to come together and be clear about the kind of ecosystem that’s needed. For example, the number of credentials that will be available in each of the provinces could drive a market. If we knew the numbers on how many credentials we need in play going forward, it would help digital wallet designers and the direction that they’re taking. I think there’s a real opportunity there.</p>
<p>Also related to this question: you asked earlier about how the distributed ecosystem looks to someone who’s been doing this for at least 20 years. I think that we have to be careful. We have to recognize that there is a global landscape on the technologies. The governance and the policy are going to be very local in focus. When we try to form global governance and policy, we have to recognize all the complexities that come into play. When it comes to the technology, it’s not exactly the same space. So, I think that if Canada were to try to technically control the solution so tightly for digital wallets as an example, we might find ourselves in a place where we’re not going to be able to interact with ecosystems around the world. We have to be watching, and contributing, and consuming, and paying attention, and incorporating what’s happening on a global landscape.</p>
<p>I’ll give you an example: there’s not a unified standard for digital wallets yet. There’s barely even a collection of standards around digital wallets. That’s a space that needs to play out in the ecosystem before we can make any kind of statements or decisions about what the technology should look like. We can certainly have principles, and we can certainly have guidance that needs to play out further. From my perspective, I would say when we look at data models such as the Verifiable Credentials of the W3C (WorldWide Web Consortium), and particularly JSON LD; this is a place where we’re seeing global momentum towards this data model. It’s not the only data model, but we are seeing momentum there. So we’re suggesting that if we can ask questions such as “Hey, what’s happening with W3C on that data model?”, that’s important.</p>
<p>We need to pay attention to that. We need to have systems ready for that because that could be an initiative that’s building towards a global convergence and consensus. Where we’re not seeing that global consensus or convergence, we can’t run to try to tighten things down. We might end up in a place where we’ll have to reverse engineer. In that case, we’ll lose funds and we’ll lose time, so we have to stay very agile.</p>
 <a></a> Moving Forward 
<p>Yeah, it is a complex landscape. Pieces are moving forward, and when we think about what we’re doing in Canada and in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAvjFuJqEYw">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> as well, I like to think that it’s really additive. What do I mean by “additive”? I remember very clearly the development of the Security Assertion Markup Language, SAML. I also remember very clearly the emergence of OpenID and OpenID Connect, and I recall people claiming “Oh, SAML is dead, now SAML is over”. Well, SAML is not over, and it’s not going to be over any time soon. Neither is OpenID going to be over anytime soon. If you look at something like the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance protocols, the UAF and the U2F, and the web tokens, the FIDO Alliance would say “Kill the password”.</p>
<p>I think that’s something we can all get behind. But I think rumors of the password’s death are very hasty, because I think we’re probably going to have passwords for quite some time still. I think we’re going to see the slow demise of passwords eventually, but they’re not going to go away overnight. When we think about technology and the way that we move forward, we also have to think about Canada being ahead or behind. We definitely have to think about the ecosystem as being additive, recognizing that many technologies will be in play. We have to have structures that can handle and verify when and how those technologies are used, and what governance is overlaid. We also need to be able to slice through on the things that are important to help us move forward. I believe whether you’re talking about self-sovereign identity, or you’re talking about classic federation, what’s important for all of those is access to verified and verifiable data.</p>
<p>We need to keep our focus there and recognize that interoperability in 2021 is not necessarily what interoperability looked like in 2010. It’s not: “Let’s all use the same spec, and all design the same way, and now we’re all interoperable”. Interoperability now needs to address different networks, different architectures, different technologies, and different governance.</p>
<p>Now, can we consume the same data, can we take that data and make it usable in our ecosystem? I think you have to take a scorecard look at it, versus a singular kind of position. It’s complex, and it’s a moving target.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s a lot to unpack out of that journey! Where to start?</p>
<p>I think we hear this all the time — Estonia gets thrown out there as a successful program, with the discussion being “Why don’t you implement this?”. As you mentioned, based on Canada, and the way Canada is structured — it’s just so different. We’re unique compared to anywhere else. For that matter, every place has its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Joni: It’s quite interesting to see some top-down initiatives happening. We’re seeing them in Germany too, where they had meetings at the end of last year to emphasize the importance of the digital identity strategy. I think it’s awesome that these countries are realizing numbers that the DIACC put out as well. There’s not an insignificant percentage of a country’s GDP that could be gained in value from a proper digital identity strategy. That’s even more important in emerging economies. I recognize and appreciate that we need to set principles, but we can’t simply jump into anything. We’re going to shoot ourselves in the foot if we do that, and it isn’t just local. It’s a global concern and I think the one thing to remember, is that no one solution fits the whole thing, collaboration is needed.</p>
<p>Every different group of people brings different tools that are part of the same overall toolkit, but they all need to be able to work together to take us to the next stage. With the Pan-Canadian trust framework and the principles coming out of that, and the collaboration between the public and the private sector, this is really what you’re trying to achieve here in Canada. Everyone needs to be working together, and then you could agree to disagree on certain things. However, everyone needs to agree on certain sets of principles.</p>
 <a></a> Interoperability and the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework 
<p>Mathieu: The last topic I wanted to address follows our discussion about ecosystem collaboration. You mentioned interoperability. How are you and the DIACC pushing to make interoperability a reality in 2021, or at least in the next few years?</p>
<p>Joni: That’s a great question and I believe we do have some degree of interoperability already. We see some networks that are sharing information today. I think we have building blocks in place, and pieces of the solution, and I think we have a ton of goodwill, and passionate people and passionate organizations. It’s about focusing and supercharging on what’s important; collaborating, and working together.</p>
<p>With the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF), it’s been a very interesting and special journey. Different orders of government, as well as private sector players, are sitting together at the virtual table, and we’re having many public consultation periods. We received over 4,000 comments, from at least five countries around the world. We’re being very open and collaborative, but still creating a safe governance space for different partners to work together. It’s been quite a journey, and we are in the process right now of alpha testing the framework. We’re not alpha testing solutions, because what we want to do here is to validate and make sure the framework behaves the way we thought it was going to, and the way that we specified it. If that’s the case, it is going to provide value on the interoperability front.</p>
 <a></a> Framework Principles 
<p>When we look at the principles of the way the framework is built, one of the things that was so challenging and exciting is that it’s not built for a singular model. It’s built in a way that must be applicable to classic federation models, or for authentication hubs, and for all those pre-existing systems. It’s also built to be able to bend and flex for hybrids across multiple ecosystems and networks, such as:</p>
 <a></a> – Distributed identity ecosystems, 
 <a></a> – Permission distributed identity ecosystems, 
 <a></a> – Trusted networks, and 
 <a></a> – Trusted operator networks. 
<p>This holds true, all the way to very distributed, very open, self-sovereign networks that may have fewer controls in terms of how participants engage in that ecosystem. It’s always easier if you start with a common picture. For example, “This is what a house looks like. We’re all going to design for this house”. It’s a lot easier if you start with a clear picture: it might be a house, it might be a tent, it might be a lean-to. You have to find your way through, and recognize how you can approach the design in a way that achieves à la carte functionality, as well as combined utility for all the pieces.</p>
<p>The way that we worked through that was with a very component-based approach. We could have a specific component for credentials, a particular component for authentication, a component for verifying a person or verifying an organization. We have a privacy component, but we also have privacy built-in to every single piece of the framework. One way to deal with a wicked problem is to componentize. That’s what we did, so we can fix one piece and not tussle with all of the others if there’s no reason to do so. That approach also enables organizations to come and pull off-the-shelf for the piece that’s most important to their requirements.</p>
 <a></a> Current Status 
<p>Right now, we are alpha testing the framework with different kinds of actors, both public and private, and with assessors. Through this process, we’re going to learn what may need to change, and what may not need to change. We’re going to get real knowledge there. I will say that what we’re seeing already, is that DIACC and our priorities are really driven by members. Our members are experts in digital identity. While some organizations focus on every piece of the puzzle and the ecosystem, we are truly focused on that horizontal of “identity”. The approach cuts across all the different verticals, and so we are driven by those member experts and their experience-based priorities. One item that the members were calling for, is a digital wallet component for the PCTF. They’re actively working now on what that could look like. Since we’re using that component approach, we’re very likely to add other components as we move forward in this framework, as the ecosystem demands.</p>
<p>We have a timed review process for how those components may need to adjust over time. So, this is all exciting. We’re kicking the tires on version one. The group is already demanding functionalities around a digital wallet, and working out what those principles look like. The framework contains our defined processes for different features and capabilities. There are notions of levels of assurance, that are tied in or identified. The framework also works by reference, in terms of calling out specific technologies. For example, it may be calling out where you should use particular encryption, or what technologies would be acceptable in which instances.</p>
 <a></a> Trust Networks 
<p>Our next stage in the roadmap is to launch the certification program for the PCTF, which is called “Voilà Verified”. The Voilà Verified program will launch at the end of 2021. Once that’s in place, then organizations will be able to pull pieces off of the shelf, and work through our process with recognized information security auditors in a laboratory. We need to recognize the information security auditors, to provide verification that the organization has been following the processes, the procedures, and the governance that have been defined. Then, we can review in a laboratory setting, from the perspective of how the code was actually implemented, and validate that it was implemented as specified. So, you need those two pieces of the puzzle.</p>
<p>We’re excited about that program, and the organizations who are alpha testing the PCTF right now are all DIACC members. What’s great about that, is the participants get real operational knowledge by going through the materials that we’ve prepared. They get strategic information and operational knowledge by going through that internally. They also get a view on where they might be, in terms of being able to achieve that trust mark or not. When we do launch the program, I would suspect that the organizations that have done alpha testing are probably going to be further down the line, or they’ll have a good idea in terms of their ability to earn a trust mark or not. So our roadmap requires launching that program at the end of 2021 and expanding it in 2022.</p>
<p>I would also predict that we’re likely to have what we call “profiles” or “schemes”. That is, we have the base Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, and if we have a particular network or a particular community, they may say “Well, okay, we have the base.” We’re not loosening the rigor on the base, but we might add on top of the base. A given player might say, “These are the pieces that are important to us, so for network x, then profile x or scheme x is the one that we’re using”. I think we’ll see different flavors of how a trust mark is applied, and the utility that particular trust mark provides.</p>
 <a></a> Verification and Certification 
<p>The other thing that we’re contemplating with regard to interoperability, is having a pathway for what we’ll call “network interoperability” or network verification. What I mean by that, is: if you’re working in the ecosystem of a trusted operator or a trusted network operator, or even a classic federation operator, there’s a specific set of agreements. Those agreements might dictate “These are the things that we have to follow”, and so you may need a certification to get in that virtual door.</p>
<p>In the very open, <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">self-sovereign identity ecosystem</a>, there are no requirements to have specific certifications to be a part of a given network. So, that might be more of a market differentiator, in terms of wallets or organizations that display that trust mark. Yeah, we’re being very flexible and agile about the way the PCTF is applied, and the potential to apply it in these different models. Not all models are built the same, and we have to be able to work in that environment because that is the reality of what the ecosystem looks like. We don’t foresee a singular model anytime soon, so we have to plan for that vibrancy, and we have to plan for that diversity.</p>
<p>I think we do see some interoperability now. We’ll see more “verified interoperability”, that addresses both the technology and the code. We’ll also see interoperability in terms of the policies and the processes that are being applied. We’ll see that with the Voilà Verified program, beginning at the end of 2021, and then growing through 2022.</p>

			<p>Digital Asset Marketplaces provide a complete framework for their users. They act as a trusted intermediary between issuers and investors by proposing a set of tools and services to facilitate transactions between the different players. These tools can be made directly available to the users, and/or additional services can be provided in order to enhance the customer experience.</p>
 Who are the stakeholders? 
<p>The principal objective of an online marketplace is to connect several players. When it comes to an investment-related marketplace, the main players are issuers, investors, the marketplace operator, and possibly other service providers.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Investors 
<p>Investors are looking for quality investment products. A DAM is first and foremost a central, easily accessible venue where they can discover financial securities. They want direct access to information in order to assess investment opportunities, expected benefits and associated risks. Ideally, the marketplace, knowing the investor’s profile, only offers them products they are eligible to subscribe for.</p>
<p>Services required for investors:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 Issuers 
<p>For issuers, the main goal of a marketplace is to reach an audience. If the issuer already has a regular customer base, they can decide to become the operator of its own marketplace by offering a website where its investors can discover and subscribe to one or more of its projects. More generally, issuers can also come into contact with larger marketplace operators who can aggregate several issuers and their investment products, offering a greater choice to their users.</p>
<p>Services required for issuers:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 Marketplace Operator 
<p>The operator of the marketplace is the entity and team that provides the solutions and services to investors and issuers. The operator helps the latter to work in a safe environment through the application of a robust governance policy and the clear definition of rules and responsibilities that apply to the marketplace. For example, the operator will conduct its due diligence on the projects listed on the platform, provide software where Issuers can enter their offering information and documents, control the access to this information by verifying the information of the Investors and so on.</p>
<p>The main role of the marketplace operator is to enter into a cycle where supply brings demand and more demand brings more supply, all within the context in which their service improves through networking effects. The marketplace aggregates an audience by helping its users with the curation of content and products proposed on the platform.</p>
<p>Services required for the operator:</p>

 25+ Use Cases of Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable credentials</a> are the next frontier in the world of digital identity and security. They address many of the concerns we face today with regards to our documents and identities.</p><p>But since it is a relatively new technology, there are gaps in connecting it to real-world scenarios, and his article aims to bridge this gap. The use-cases that we have come up with are some potential areas where VCs can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>It is aimed to give insights on the unlimited potential of VCs across every sphere of our life. Specifically, we hope that business leaders, entrepreneurs, and developers will use this article as a guide to create some breakthrough solutions that will benefit the society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>So, let’s jump into the use-cases and before that, a brief introduction on the three parties involved in VC-based transactions.</p> Issuer <p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, and possibly even organizations that provide proof of employment.</p><p>These entities use a combination of methods such as digital signatures and custom schemas to prove that they are competent to issue a credential.</p> Holder <p>A holder is someone who is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders are typically individuals or organizations.</p><p>Since the holder is the owner of the credential, the onus is on this entity to create a verifiable presentation, which is the compilation of data sent by one or more issuers in a machine-verifiable format that adheres to the existing standards.</p> Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p><p>Let’s know look at how these three entities figure in different use-cases.</p><p>Image Source: <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2285225-Use-Case-Icons">Jeremiah&nbsp;Chaney</a></p> VC Use-Case#1: Employment Endorsements <p>VCs can be used to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">verify current and past employment</a> and is a safe way to share them with prospective employers and entities who need this information.</p>  Issuer — Employers, job search sites, payroll providers, and startups like <a href="https://www.goodworker.in/">GoodWorker</a> that verify a user’s work experience.

<p>#ThrowbackThursday</p>



<p>Attending events was a good way to get the discussion around data privacy and ethics started.&nbsp;This&nbsp;one&nbsp;was&nbsp;particularly interesting when you consider Artificial Intelligence and the possibility for it&nbsp;to be a black box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Will GDPR affect advancements in Artificial Intelligence?&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>The short answer is, yes!&nbsp;But that&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;make&nbsp;it a bad thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Innovation in Artificial Intelligence&nbsp;(AI) is one&nbsp;of the greatest achievements in the modern digital age.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is the&nbsp;ability&nbsp;for&nbsp;computers and machines to&nbsp;perform human-like activities such as&nbsp;learning, problem solving and decision making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The potential of AI is something of great excitement to futurists and transhumanist believers, who predict that AI could be billions of times smarter than humans, with the possibility of individuals needing to merge with computers to survive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular&nbsp;technology integrated with AI includes&nbsp;device wearables&nbsp;for example&nbsp;an Apple Watch&nbsp;that&nbsp;can monitor your physical activity and certain health attributes.&nbsp;Such&nbsp;devices have a private benefit to the individual consuming it,&nbsp;but they also&nbsp;create a wide array of data sets,&nbsp;that&nbsp;contribute to creating the internet of things.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organisations&nbsp;can benefit from access to this data, to continue innovating technologies and solutions through AI or by using the data to produce sophisticated insights for both the consumer and&nbsp;organisation. When put to good use, the potential these technologies produce for society is exponential. However, when&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;take advantage and negatively exploit the wide array of personal data created by such technologies, we could see the current global&nbsp;trust&nbsp;crisis deepen.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>A colleague attended an&nbsp;event&nbsp;that&nbsp;discussed&nbsp;the potential of AI applications to be further&nbsp;integrated within the NHS. Here&nbsp;concerns were raised by&nbsp;several AI developers that GDPR could stifle innovation within the field.&nbsp;This was immediately challenged by the&nbsp;“GDPR experts” in the room.&nbsp;Their&nbsp;view&nbsp;was that GDPR is necessary to protect the collection, use and sharing of personal data.&nbsp;And,&nbsp;those who worked within the NHS believed GDPR would actually reduce the number of opt-outs, stating that;&nbsp;if citizens had greater control over&nbsp;how&nbsp;their personal data was used, for example, development of applications to improve their healthcare management, they would be&nbsp;more likely to give permission for this purpose.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another point raised was that&nbsp;fully&nbsp;anonymised&nbsp;data is not covered by GDPR. AI developers can continue to freely use&nbsp;anonymised&nbsp;data to develop AI applications. Those creating AI solutions that will have a benefit to the citizen or the wider public could&nbsp;consider&nbsp;claiming&nbsp;either legitimate or public interest as the legal justification for collecting,&nbsp;using&nbsp;or sharing personal data.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;to use this compliantly would require transparency and an&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;would need to&nbsp;demonstrate that have considered the citizen’s rights.&nbsp;Organisations&nbsp;that do this and truly&nbsp;deliver value from using citizens’ personal data,&nbsp;can genuinely build&nbsp;stronger trust&nbsp;the&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;and citizens.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR will ensure that&nbsp;organisations, either using personal data to develop AI or capturing personal data through applications run by AI algorithms, are not crossing the moral&nbsp;line&nbsp;and&nbsp;exploiting citizens personal data. GDPR&nbsp;should&nbsp;not&nbsp;stifle innovation within this sector&nbsp;if&nbsp;data&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;ethically&nbsp;and the&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;is being fully transparent about the purposes of using individuals’ personal data.</p>
