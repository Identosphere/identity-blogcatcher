<p>If you were present for CEO Boris Mann's presentation at the PL Summit, you heard the alpha on Everywhere Computer. Yes, that's right. After several years of being deep in the protocol mines, Fission is thrilled to launch our first product! </p>IPVM Protocol | Everywhere Computer | Homestar Mascot<p>We've shared several exciting announcements over the past few months, so let's break them down in full context now.</p><p>IPVM is the open source protocol that powers Everywhere Computer.</p><p>Homestar is the individual node that makes up the network (similar to how IPFS Kubo, Iroh, Nabu, or other implementation nodes make up the IPFS network). It's written in Rust, and is designed for performance and composability.</p><p>Everywhere Computer is Fission's platform: a branded and supported distribution that bundles homestar + control panel, a function &amp; workflow marketplace, and managed compute resources.</p>Slide from Boris Mann's PL Summit 2023 Presentation Writing Wasm Functions  <p>Today we've got a few sample functions to test the network, with Rust → Wasm being the happy path. We'll have some tooling and examples for JavaScript → Wasm soon.</p><p>Like NPM providing a library of functions that developers use to quickly write applications, Everywhere Computer's directory will lead to re-use of serverless functions. UCAN can be used to gate access to functions, or specific communities or companies can federate their own set of functions for internal usage only, or to share with everyone.</p> Goodbye Cloud, Hello Crowd <p>As an application developer you can take advantage of Everywhere Computer's Wasm functions to replace backend functions in a serverless style. You're not locked into any one cloud provider's serverless stack, and can pick functions from the directory rather than needing to write them from scratch.</p><p>Additionally, not every job needs to go to the cloud. Many jobs can be done locally on an application's clients desktops and browsers. Every compute cycle that gets done locally is one that you don't need to pay for in the cloud.</p><p>When it's time to scale up, you can utilize Everywhere Computer's distributed network to orchestrate jobs along the parameters you've set, allowing it to utilize whichever platforms are most efficient. Everywhere Computer never locks you into any subscription. You pay when you compute, so you never worry about getting locked into one provider. </p><p>This means your job could run on your desktop, Homestar nodes in your community network, or managed compute services from Fission and other compute providers.</p> What's Coming Next - Future Plans <p>Speaking of writing functions and workflows, one of the things we'll be exploring is to fix some of the issues with directories where developers don't get directly compensated even though potentially 10s of millions of applications use their libraries. We will look to support development of high quality, performant, and maintained functions by having compute providers pay the developers who write them.</p><p>Don't have a Wasm-compatible function but still want to connect to Everywhere Computer, taking advantage of its distributed and interoperable network? If your service is <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a>-enabled, you will soon be able to plug it in, introducing new functionality to the entire network. As has always been the plan, UCAN's capabilities model provides a flexible IAM-like backbone that can connect the open web, rather than locked to one cloud provider.</p> <p>We are so excited to share <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> with you. If you'd like to join the early access beta, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfREjmoTBOW2gyUSFypn3omifibvptH0K_IQwtFWiGORU5vAQ/viewform">complete this form</a>. We're looking for enthusiast hackers &amp; node hosts, function writers, and compute providers.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about the underlying IPVM protocol, you can join the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM Working Group</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I published a blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/11/aes-turns-20/">AES Turns 20</a>, celebrating the 20th year since the trusted symmetric algorithm was approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the article, I dug into post-quantum and how Lov Grover’s quadratic speed-up algorithm might be applied to brute force attacks on symmetric algorithms. NIST’s position on this remains unchanged; symmetric algorithms such as AES 192 and AES 256 bit are good for the next couple of decades. The general recommendation persists: Anything with less than 112 bits of classical security should not be used. If there are any doubts, consider doubling the key length if you are using shorter bit lengths.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about the post-quantum threats being discussed and the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attack frequently mentioned on technology websites and cited by some of my colleagues. I decided a blog post was in order to investigate a bit further. My colleague Dave Butcher, Technical Sales Consultant, is as passionate about PQ as I am, and I enlisted him to discuss the topic in more detail and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap on what is meant by Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. The attack assumes that classical encryption techniques applied to data today, to make it unreadable and unusable, will in the future be vulnerable to attack from post-quantum computers. They will be able to crack the hard math problems that today’s computers would take in some cases hundreds and even thousands of years to solve. So, the idea is bad actors and nation-states will intercept and steal (harvest) data. They’ll then store it and wait until quantum computers are capable of crunching the numbers and decrypting the data to make it readable.</p>
 Data In Motion with TLS 
<p>Some of you might be thinking that most data at rest is encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES, so surely we are in decent shape and this isn’t a real threat? I initially jumped to the same conclusion and then realized it is a bit more nuanced. Data at rest is typically encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES and should be resilient to Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attacks. However, data is typically transported to a location before it comes to rest using network switches, routers, load balancers, etc. And this is where is gets a bit more nuanced. As data is moved around on the internet, a range of communication protocols are in play. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the de facto protocol in use on the Internet securing HTTPS web pages, email, WhatsApp, and a myriad of other applications. To establish a secure connection between a client and server the TLS handshake is invoked:</p>
 
 The client sends a Hello message detailing the TLS version being used and available cipher suite. 
 The server responds back with their Hello message confirming TLS version and cipher suite followed by the server’s certificate, which includes the public key of the server’s asymmetric key pair. 
 This is then used in a key exchange where a symmetric-based session key is encrypted and sent to the server using the server’s public key. 
 
<p>The server now has the same symmetric encryption key as the client – this is a pre-requisite for symmetric encryption. A secure bi-direction channel is now established between client and server and data can be efficiently encrypted, transported, and stored at its final destination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main takeaway here is the session key is based on a symmetric algorithm, which is the most efficient way to encrypt bulk data – asymmetric algorithms are not efficient at<br>
encrypting bulk data. Based on current NIST recommendations, as long as the symmetric key is a decent length of bits it’ll be resistant to a PQ attack. However, the asymmetric public/private keys used in the key exchange step are most likely using RSA- or elliptic-curve-based cryptography. These are the classical asymmetric algorithms that Peter Shor identified in the late 1990s as being vulnerable to being compromised by a quantum computer. It is unlikely that state-sponsored actors will be targeting data stored at rest; instead they’ll be targeting data in transit armed with the knowledge that asymmetric keys are used in the key exchange process. If they can intercept that transaction and store it away while biding their time, then in the future they’ll be able to use a quantum computer to factorize the asymmetric key pair, allowing them to expose the symmetric key and thus decrypt the data. Voila!</p>
 Actionable Steps to Mitigate against Harvest Now, Decrypt Later 
<p>So, Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is a valid concern for organizations who store long-term encrypted data. What steps should you be taking to mitigate such attacks?</p>
 
 Start using longer symmetric key lengths. This is likely an easy change as AES with a 256-bit key has been part of the AES standard from the beginning. Most TLS services rely on standard TLS implementations that include configurable cipher suites. Changing to a longer key length is likely as easy as updating a configuration file and restarting a service. Many other tools you are using may also have this option. 
 Consider adding protection to communication paths that move high-value data to prevent Harvest Now, Decrypt Later later attacks. For example, there are VPN implementations (e.g. Open Quantum Safe’s OpenVPN project) that have been built using newer quantum-resistant cryptography. These are not fully standardized, but when you control both ends of a communication path (for example, between a branch location and headquarters) utilizing a non-standard protocol is not an issue. 
 Think about using pre-shared keys for certain interactions where you share symmetric encryption keys out of band, such as by exchanging physical media. This eliminates the asymmetric key exchange that is vulnerable to quantum computers. 
 Understand if there are already quantum-resistant versions of the protocol that you are using that you could migrate to today. For example, the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/#introduction">Signal messaging protocol</a> has been updated to be quantum-resistant. Consider becoming a first adopter. 
 Prioritize crypto-agility within your organization. Planning and building crypto agility are going to be key to adopting quantum-safe cryptography. While this does not fix the problem today, it puts your organization in the best position to quickly adopt post-quantum cryptography as it becomes available and minimize the vulnerability window for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. 
 
<p>One of the tools that can help you plan is Mosca’s Theorem. Understanding how long your data needs to be secure is key to prioritizing projects to mitigate Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data that has fleeting value is probably not at high risk for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data whose value remains high even as time begins to approach the advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers needs to be a priority for secondary protection. Mosca’s Theorem is discussed in more detail in an earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/07/a-bridge-to-post-quantum-cryptography/">A Bridge to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 The PQC Elephant In the Room 
<p>The elephant in the room when post-quantum cryptography is being discussed is “when”? When is this going to happen? The answer is of course we don’t really know. It could be five years away. It could also be 10 or 20+ years away. However, to play devil’s advocate, what if nation-state actors already have quantum computers with sufficient processing capability running in their labs? It’s not quite apples to apples, but there are some precedents. Public key cryptography was first postulated by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 and its implementation as RSA announced in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. At least that is what was understood to be the case until in 1997 some UK secrets held by Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) became declassified, revealing that British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks">Clifford Cocks</a>, working for the&nbsp;intelligence agency, described an equivalent public/private key system in an internal document in 1973. Whether it was ever used is pure speculation, but it does illustrate the art of the possible. With that we will leave you to ponder, but at least you should now be clear that Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is real.</p>

This allowed a guarantor to fund a contract, designate a beneficiary, set a time interval, and define the conditions for the transfer of ownership. Beneficiaries could redeem and allow access through the Ocean Protocol’s access control mechanisms within the limits set by the guarantor. xTRUST targeted a traditional financial wealth and data ownership management gap, offering a digital asset transfer solution. The team was inspired by Ocean Protocol’s initiatives in safe AI, finance, and data sharing, focusing on democratizing access to opportunities. They demonstrated their application using the Ocean <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">Smart Contract</a> libraries for various functions and hosted the dApp on&nbsp;AWS.</p><p>This niche financial mini-product targets a demand in traditional financial wealth management and data ownership management does not equate to support: Digital Assets and ownership transfers.</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission statement and value proposition inspired the team to ensure safe AI, Finance, and data sharing globally while preserving privacy.</p><p>View xTrust <a href="https://github.com/Jacob8765/eth-miami-hackathon">Github Repository</a>.</p><p>In this short concept and idea definition, the repository above shows the team’s basic attempt to launch a full-stack DeFi dApp for initiating trust funds and enabling a beneficiary to redeem them. In the hackathon, they were able&nbsp;to:</p><p>- Develop a minimum solidity&nbsp;contract</p><p>- Sketch out the UI in&nbsp;Figma</p><p>- Begin implementation of the front-end UX/UI</p><p>- Set up AWS infrastructure to host the&nbsp;dApp</p> 2nd — Data Sea — Data Access &amp; Ownership <p>Data Sea was on a mission to revolutionize data access and ownership. They addressed the problem of accessing niche and consistent datasets, which is incredibly challenging in the real estate, finance, and healthcare sectors. Data Sea’s solution included features like encrypted data streaming, consumer data ownership, dynamic NFTs, ERC-20 access tokens for secure data transfer, and robust data storage using Ocean’s technology. They also provided an automated AI integration for property data and a mechanism for data reselling. Data Sea outlined simple steps for uploading data, controlling access with tokens, reselling data, and integrating AI.</p><p>DataSea took a mission statement to ‘Revolutionizing Data Access &amp; Ownership’</p><p>This team diagnosed features used to offer solutions to the problem statement above:</p>  Encrypted Data Streaming: DataSea allows providers to stream waves of encrypted datasets and AI models to buyers, ensuring security and authenticity.  Consumer Data Ownership: Empower users with the ability to securely sell their data, fostering a new age of data sovereignty.  Dynamic NFTs: Utilization of Ocean Protocol to create dynamic NFTs that store encrypted user data, combining data innovation with blockchain integrity.  ERC20 Access Tokens: Facilitating the secure access and transfer of data ownership.  ERC 725 Data Storage: Leveraging Ocean’s key-value pairing, DataSea provides a robust data storage mechanism, ensuring consistency and reliability.  Reselling Mechanism: Owners can monetize their data by reselling the ownership and tokenized data through the dispensary.  Automated AI Integration: Streamlining property data to seamlessly integrate into AI or predictive models, paving the way for cutting-edge analytics.  <p>Knowing the relevant features above, we can showcase Ocean Protocol tools to execute full capability interactions with smart contracts for both NFT and access token creation.</p><p>Further, this concept proves an alternative use of various core Ocean Technologies including <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge">Barge</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius">Aquarius</a>, &amp; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider">Provider</a>: Here, these tools are responsible for storing and encrypting data tied to&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Data Sea <a href="https://github.com/imatomster/DataSea">Github Repository</a>.</p><p>Congratulations to the team for an excellent hackathon sprint!</p> 3rd — FINZA — Crypto-backed Mortgages <p>FINZA aimed to connect dream homes with crypto-backed mortgages. They tackled issues such as high down payments, complex mortgage approvals, and traditional barriers to entry. Before the hackathon, FINZA had already partnered with <a href="https://propy.com/home/">PROPY</a> to leverage blockchain technology for real estate transactions. They developed a Smart Contract-Based DeFi Mortgage Platform that allowed crypto assets to be used as collateral and offered opportunities for liquidity provision.</p>A simple hand-drawn sketch acts as a title slide for the FINZA startup&nbsp;vision<p>The startup is actively exploring technology to implement in its journey. For this hackathon track, Ocean Protocol access control, signature, and data sharing capabilities were put to exploration.</p><p>FINZA has already developed a pioneering, Smart Contract based, DeFi Mortgage Platform that not only lets you use your crypto assets as collateral but also offers a chance for others to earn by providing liquidity to our decentralized pool.</p><p>A brief <a href="https://photos.onedrive.com/share/8E5666391FA96D03!160770?cid=8E5666391FA96D03&amp;resId=8E5666391FA96D03!160770&amp;authkey=!ALLEYOQyLlv7P_U&amp;ithint=video&amp;e=wsnW9V">Demonstration Video</a> details the service’s function and user&nbsp;journey.</p><p>View Finza <a href="https://github.com/Jacob8765/eth-miami-hackathon">Github Repository</a>.</p> Summary <p>Ocean Protocol was able to form a strategic partnership with the organizers of ETH Miami for recurring participation of Ocean Technology up for grabs at the annual hackathon.

<p>IBM <a href="http://ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> is changing the game for enterprises of all shapes and sizes, making it easy for them to embed generative AI into their operations. This week, the CEO of WellnessWits, an IBM Business Partner, announced they embed watsonx in their app to help patients ask questions about chronic disease and more easily schedule appointments with physicians.</p>



<p>Watsonx is comprised of three components that empower businesses to customize their AI solutions: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a> offers intuitive tooling for powerful foundation models; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a> enables compute-efficient, scalable workloads wherever data resides; and the third component, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a>, provides guardrails essential to responsible implementation. Watsonx gives organizations the ability to refine foundation models with their own domain-specific data to gain competitive advantage and ensure factual grounding to external sources of knowledge.</p>



<p>These features—along with a broad range of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence-apis">traditional machine learning and AI functions</a>—are now available to independent software vendors (ISVs) and managed service providers (MSPs) as part of IBM’s embeddable software portfolio, supported by the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ODNKAAKJ">IBM Ecosystem Engineering Build Lab</a> and partner ecosystem.</p>



<p>The watsonx platform, along with other IBM AI applications, libraries and APIs help partners <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-10-25-IBM-Helps-Ecosystem-Partners-Accelerate-AI-Adoption-by-Making-it-Easier-to-Embed-and-Scale-AI-Across-Their-Business">more quickly bring AI-powered commercial software to market</a>, reducing the need for specialized talent and developer resources.</p>



 A platform prioritized for enterprise AI 



<p>IBM is focused on helping organizations create business value by embedding generative AI. Watsonx provides the functionality enterprise developers need most, including summarization of domain-specific text; classification of inputs based on sentiment analysis, threat levels or customer segmentation; text content generation; analysis and extraction (or redaction) of essential information; and question-answering functions. The most common use cases from partners often combine several of these AI tasks.</p>



<p>ISVs need the flexibility to choose models appropriate to their industry, domain and use case. Watsonx provides access to open-source models (through the Hugging Face catalog), third-party models (such as Meta’s Llama 2) and IBM’s own <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/building-ai-for-business-ibms-granite-foundation-models/">Granite</a> models. IBM provides an <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-09-28-IBM-Announces-Availability-of-watsonx-Granite-Model-Series,-Client-Protections-for-IBM-watsonx-Models">IP indemnity</a> (contractual protection) for its foundation models, enabling partners to be more confident AI creators. With watsonx, ISVs can further differentiate their offering and gain competitive advantage by harnessing proprietary data and tuning the models to domain-specific tasks. These capabilities allow ISVs to better address their clients’ industry-specific needs.</p>



<p>Let’s explore a few AI use cases that span different industries.&nbsp;</p>



 Exceptional customer care through AI solutions 



<p>Today, customers expect seamless experiences and fast answers to their questions, and companies that fail to meet these expectations risk falling behind. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service">Customer service has leapfrogged other functions to become CEOs’ top generative AI priority</a>. Given this trend, companies should be looking for ways to embed generative AI into their customer care portals. To accelerate this process, companies can implement AI-infused customer care commercial solutions. IBM’s embeddable AI technology, such as IBM watsonx Assistant and watsonx.ai, allows ISVs to quickly and easily build AI into their solutions, which in turn helps them to reduce time to market and reach their customers sooner.</p>



<p>Watsonx allows enterprises to effortlessly generate conversation transcripts with live agents or automate Q&amp;A sessions. With watsonx.ai, they can obtain concise conversation summaries, extract key information and classify interactions, such as conducting sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction. This information will further refine and improve the information available to the agents.</p>



 Streamline your procurement process using watsonx 



<p>By embedding AI technology in enterprise solutions, organizational leaders can connect disparate, broken processes and data into integrated end-to-end solutions.</p>



<p>For example, supply chain management can be a challenge for companies. The process of changing suppliers can be a time-consuming and complex task, as it requires intensive research and collaboration across the organization. Instead of spending cycles and resources on creating an in-house solution that streamlines this process, companies can implement an AI-infused supply chain management solution developed by ISVs. ISVs are experts in their domain and build their solution with enterprise-grade AI–such as watsonx Assistant, watsonx.ai, and watsonx.data–so companies can feel confident in their selection.</p>



<p>Watsonx Assistant can serve as a user-friendly, natural-language Q&amp;A interface for your supplier database. In the background, watsonx.ai generates database queries and content like Requests for Proposals (RFPs) or Requests for Information (RFIs), while Watson Discovery analyzes supplier financial reports. Watsonx.data acts as a front end for the company’s ERP system, with up-to-date attributes about inventory items, ratings of suppliers, quantities available and so on, along with a third-party data warehouse providing further decision criteria. Thus, teams can work smarter and move toward better, more integrated business outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

 Protect access to all applications and resources with Security Service Edge 
<p><br>Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">now in preview</a>, includes Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access, and secures access to any app or resource for users and devices connecting from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integrations across Microsoft’s SSE solution and the Microsoft Entra portfolio make it possible to enforce unified Conditional Access policies that consider identity, device, application, and now network conditions before granting access to any application or website. This works no matter which identity provider the application uses—without requiring any changes to the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of you are testing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access?rtc=1">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a>, our identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG), to secure access for Microsoft 365 traffic. We are expanding the public preview to include all internet apps and resources by the end of 2023 with new core capabilities:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Context-aware SWG with web content filtering to restrict end user access to unsafe and non-compliant content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Universal Conditional Access to extend adaptive access controls to any network destination, such as an external website or a non-federated SaaS application.  &nbsp; 
 Compliant Network Check,&nbsp;an easy-to-manage construct within Conditional Access. With this control, you can protect Microsoft Entra integrated cloud applications against token theft and ensure users do not bypass network security policies specific to their tenant while accessing critical cloud services.&nbsp; 
 Source IP restoration in ID Protection and Conditional Access location policies that maintains each user’s original source IP to enable backward compatibility of trusted location checks and continuous access evaluation, identity risk detection, and logging.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> is our identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for any private app or resource. New capabilities in private preview include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for more protocols in addition to TCP, including UDP and private DNS, so you’ll be able to transition from your traditional Virtual Private Network (VPN) to a modern ZTNA solution. 
 Conditional Access controls and modern authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), to secure access to all private applications and resources for remote and on-premises users. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our SSE solution works with your existing security and network solutions through integrations across Microsoft’s security stack and open partner ecosystem. We’re partnering with other vendors in this space, starting with <a href="https://docs.netskope.com/en/netskope-help/integrations-439794/solution-guides/microsoft-security-and-netskope-integration-solution-guide/microsoft-and-netskope-sse-coexistence/">Netskope</a>, to demonstrate seamless side-by-side operation in the same environment. We’re committed to giving you the flexibility to choose the SSE solution that best fits the network traffic in your environment. For both Internet Access and Private Access, we’re also announcing cross-OS client support for Windows and Android in public preview, and for MacOS and iOS in private preview. Our SSE solution is now available globally (except in China and Russia) with SSE edge locations coming in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us at our upcoming <a href="https://aka.ms/AccelerateSecurity">Tech Accelerator Ask Microsoft Anything (AMA) session</a> to discuss with our product experts all your questions about Microsoft’s SSE solution!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies and more 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we turned on security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name">Azure Active Directory</a>) for almost seven million existing tenants, which cut the number of compromises in those tenants by 80 percent. Based on the positive customer feedback, we’re helping more Microsoft Entra ID customers protect themselves by automatically enrolling eligible tenants into Conditional Access policies based on customer risk signals, current usage, and licensing. Microsoft-managed conditional access policies&nbsp;will start with three policies that enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) in high-risk scenarios. You can learn more details in Alex Weinert’s recent blog post, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant with Microsoft managed Conditional Access policies. The policy details are shown in a context pane to the right, indicating that the selected policy requires certain administrator roles to perform multifactor authentication when accessing the Microsoft admin portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not all MFA methods offer equal protection. The more effective MFA methods, such as FIDO2 Security keys, Windows Hello, Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA), and passkeys, use cryptographic techniques to make authentication phishing-resistant. The preview of Microsoft Entra CBA allows you to tailor authentication policies by certificate, resource type, and user group. All these phishing-resistant authentication methods make it possible to eliminate passwords altogether, so they can’t be guessed, intercepted, or phished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is committed to supporting passkeys across our ecosystem, starting with Windows 11. Once you create a passkey for a website, application, or service using Windows Hello, you can sign in from your device using your face, fingerprint, or device PIN. This gives enterprises and government customers an additional, phishing-resistant alternative to physical FIDO2 security keys. Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to sign in using passkeys managed from the Microsoft Authenticator app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-protection">Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a> now detects anomalies such as an unusual token lifetime or a token played from an unfamiliar location. When a trigger is alerted, Conditional Access can immediately expire the token and force reauthentication along with other measures, such as a password reset or step-up MFA, without requiring manual intervention. If a user makes a password change on-premises, Entra ID Protection can now <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/remediate-user-risks-in-microsoft-entra-id-protection-through-on/ba-p/3773129">automatically remediate their risk</a>. This makes it easier for hybrid organizations to take advantage of user risk policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Integrations for more robust Permissions Management 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management</a> has two significant integrations that will give you insights on permission risks so you can improve your security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/PermissionsManagementDefenderForCloud">Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) integration</a> preview consolidates identity and access permission insights with other cloud security information in a single interface. This view will display actionable recommendations for addressing permissions risks, as well as the Permissions Creep Index, and make it easier to enforce least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which is now in public preview, provides and efficient way to consolidate insights into other cloud security posture information on a single interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">second integration</a>, now generally available, allows ServiceNow&nbsp;customers to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) via the ServiceNow portal. This popular IT service management (ITSM) solution strengthens your Zero Trust posture by adding access permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow. Now when a user requests access approvals, the ServiceNow Plugin fetches the latest data from Permissions Management, then sends the requested user permissions, along with time-bound approval based on the requestor’s roles, back to ServiceNow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Evolving secure identity and network access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a single integrated solution with comprehensive capabilities with Microsoft Entra will simplify access security for your admins and give your end users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra portfolio works together to help you secure identities, devices, networks, and workloads. It extends to any user type, including customers, partners, and digital workloads. And now, with our SSE solution, Microsoft Entra is converging identity and network access controls into a single policy engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the latest innovations in Microsoft Entra will make it easier for you to secure access to everything for everyone.</p>

Spokeo aggregates many sources of data about people and sells that data to verifiers. So at first blush, Harrison is an unlikely person to be a massive advocate for SSI and co-chair of the W3C Credentials Community Group.<br><br>We dig in to why Spokeo cares about verifiable credentials, and how verifiable credentials represent the opportunity to deliver more trust to Spokeo’s customers and how they allow Spokeo to participate in the next wave of digital identity innovation. We also explore complex concepts like negative reputation and how AI will impact the personal data landscape.

<p>Zug, Switzerland – November 15, 2023 – <a href="https://appruvr.co.uk/?ref=blog.dock.io">Appruvr</a>, a platform that automates the qualification verification process for employers and candidates, announced the integration of <a href="http://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a>’s Verifiable Credential technology. Using Verifiable Credentials, Appruvr makes it easy for organizations to verify credentials instantly without contacting the issuing party or checking physical documents while enabling individuals to control their own data.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential</a> is a fraud-proof digital document that proves something about an individual or entity, such as someone’s identity or qualification. Verifiable Credentials are instantly verifiable and enable users to present information in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp; </p> Problems: Credential Fraud and Unnecessarily Long Verification Processes  <p>Delaney Millward, Founder of Apprurvr, started the company because he had first-hand experience of seeing how many job applicants embellished their credentials. He relied on websites including LinkedIn and recruitment agencies but found many people didn’t fit what they were looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with the traditional recruitment processes is that the information relies solely on what candidates claim they are qualified for. This experience started his journey to find a solution where an organization could quickly and efficiently verify the credentials. At the time, the solution didn’t exist.</p><p>Credential fraud is a huge global problem:&nbsp;</p>  83% of employers believe their hires have lied about qualifications  1 in 5 employers admit to not verifying graduate qualifications  47% of job applicants admit to inflating grades  Fake diplomas and degrees make 7 billion dollars a year worldwide  Credential fraud costs UK businesses £23 billion pounds every year  <p>Credential fraud has financial consequences and affects public safety, particularly when fraudsters work in high-stakes jobs like surgeons, nurses, or construction workers. Many people around the world have died or been injured by unqualified people working in jobs that they got as a result of fake credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Credential verification is still generally slow, complex and expensive. To illustrate, even the fastest verification times are approximately 3.8 days, which is cumbersome when we consider the speed of the job market in many sectors. Employers don’t have the capacity to verify all of these credentials, particularly when they need to hire many people in a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Appruvr is at the forefront of harnessing verifiable credential technology to solve credential fraud issues and give organizations the solutions to make credential verification easier and faster.</p> How Dock's Technology Enables Appruvr to Fast-Track the Credential Verification Process <p>When Appruvr was building their solution and researching Verifiable Credential providers, they felt that Dock could meet their technological needs and shared the same goals of empowering both organizations and individuals with tools to make the journey from education to employment more seamless and efficient.</p><p>These are some of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials in the education and workforce sectors:&nbsp;</p>  Employers can hire candidates faster because they can check the authenticity of credentials instantly.&nbsp;  Organizations can verify credentials without storing that data because individuals hold and control the data on their mobile identity wallet app.  Graduates can conveniently and efficiently prove their credentials in a way that preserves their privacy without relying on a third party.  Job applicants can prove their credentials anywhere in the world at any time in an era where remote and gig work is growing.  <p>By integrating Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials Platform</a>, Appruvr seamlessly transforms education and workforce credentials into fraud-proof and instantly Verifiable Credentials. Verifiable Credentials leverage cutting-edge cryptography, ensuring strong data integrity and protection against tampering.</p><p>“Dock’s partnership with Appruvr will lead the way in introducing new and innovative technology that will have significant benefits for the background screening industry, and support the drive towards true digital hiring whilst removing the pain felt by all who utilize current screening methods. We are very excited through this partnership to bring verifiable digital credentials to the mainstream, creating an ecosystem where individuals are back in control of their data and employers can verify a candidate's credentials in a matter of moments.” said Delaney Millward, Appruvr’s CEO.</p><p>"Our collaboration with Appruvr is more than just a technology partnership; it's a shared vision to transform how credentials are verified and combat pervasive credential fraud. We're uniting our strengths to make credential verification seamless and secure by providing organizations with the tools to verify credentials instantly while placing data control back into the hands of individuals," said Nick Lambert, Dock's CEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> About Appruvr <p>Appruvr simplifies credential sharing between learning providers, candidates, and employers. Using blockchain technology, the verification is not only quick, the results are 100% reliable and secure. Appruvr's solution has been specifically designed to improve the recruitment journey for employers, institutions and candidates. Bringing qualification checks into the 21st century to stop recruitment fraud and the reliance on outdated and inefficient processes.</p> About Dock <p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential platform makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the Certs API, the Certs no-code web app, an ID wallet and a dedicated blockchain. Using Dock, organizations reduce data verification costs while increasing the operational efficiency of verifying and issuing digital credentials. Individuals can fully control their data to access products and services more conveniently in a privacy-preserving way. Dock has been a leader in decentralized digital identity technology since 2017 and trusted by organizations in diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education.</p>

				  What sets one digital wallet apart from another and what are the key features you should look for before starting to store your personal data? Here, we discuss the three that we find the most important and explain why.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Between Apple Pay, Cash App, Google Pay and others, the number of digital wallets has exploded in recent years, with Capital One reporting there were <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/digital-wallet-statistics/#:~:text=Digital%20Wallet%20User%20Statistics&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%203.4%20billion%20digital%20wallet%20users%20in,60%25%20of%20the%20global%20population.">roughly 3.4 billion users</a> worldwide in 2022. As more consumers familiarize themselves with wallet apps, using them for moving money or purchasing goods or services has become commonplace.</p>
<p>If identity verification is to emulate the convenience of digital payments, the wallets we use need to offer more functionality than just the ability to accept, hold, and present a verifiable credential, they need to have the tools to fully manage your digital identity and data sharing.</p>
<p>The first additional feature to look for in a digital identity wallet is process management. Sometimes the process for being issued with a verifiable credential is simple: you fill out a few forms from the issuing party, which are confirmed by the issuing party, and then you are issued with a credential. For example, when applying for a mobile driver’s license there are several attribute fields to fill out, such as name, height, weight, eye color, etc. These allow the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to confirm that you are the correct person to issue the license to.</p>
<p>But what if the DMV decides it needs more information? Does the wallet notify you? Does the DMV have a procedure in place to notify you? Often services like this simply don’t have the time or processes in place to inform you of the need for more information, and the onus is on you to follow up. By having process management built into the wallet it would be able to easily notify you that the process is stalled and explain why.</p>
<p>The second feature to look for is the ability to act as a verifier and be able to read credentials. Every identity wallet by default is designed to hold credentials and create presentations of the information they contain; this allows you to share your mobile driver’s license or a proof of your age. But before you share this information, it would be ideal to be able to verify for yourself who you’re sharing this information with. For example, if you were pulled over by someone dressed as a police officer, this functionality could confirm that they actually are a police officer, and even provide you with important information such as their jurisdiction, name, and badge number. Similarly, this function would also allow two people to simply verify each other, for example when meeting someone for the first time: if a person comes to your door claiming to be from the gas company you could verify their credentials before letting them in to your house, and they could verify that you are the correct customer they are supposed to be helping, providing an additional layer of security and confidence.</p>
<p>The third feature we recommend is the ability to offer mutually authenticated two-way messaging. This allows you to cryptographically validate the identity of who you are interacting with (and they, you), and is a powerful way to deter fraud. (To learn more about how this works, <a href="https://indicio.tech/secure-two-way-communication-is-decentralized-identitys-secret-sauce-to-stopping-financial-scams/">read our recent article.</a>)</p>
<p>But besides stopping fraud, this feature also changes the way businesses and individuals can interact: instead of getting a letter or email from your bank, it can ping you to ask questions or start a conversation. Unlike email, this is a direct, encrypted communication that you know is coming from your bank. You can also easily sever this connection, and while you probably don’t want to do this with your bank, you may want to remove the ability for other parties to contact you.</p>
<p>In sum, we see identity wallets as building the foundation for digital relationships and these features provide powerful ways to build trusted digital relationships that are more richly interactive.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Indicio offers a free-to-use wallet, <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, which you can download right now to see some of these features in action, such as secure, mutually authenticated communication. Future versions of Holdr+ will have all the functionality outlined above.</p>

<p>Passwords, while integral to security measures, can pose significant threats due to their inherent vulnerabilities. Weak or reused passwords, susceptibility to phishing and brute-force attacks, and potential insider threats all make passwords a weak link in your security posture.</p>
<p>Although ubiquitous and seemingly secure, passwords can pose a significant threat to organizations for various reasons. Common issues include the use of weak or easily guessable passwords and password reuse across multiple accounts, making it easier for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, the prevalence of phishing scams and brute-force attacks means that even the most careful users can become victims. Lastly, the risk of insider threats, where employees with compromised credentials can exploit their access, is an ever-present concern.</p>
<p>To effectively counter these risks, organizations need to look beyond passwords and embrace robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implementing MFA introduces an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors. It not only validates user identities using their passwords but also involves a second form of verification like a one-time code sent to the user’s mobile device. However, while MFA provides additional security over passwords, it is still susceptible to MFA bypass attacks such as SIM swap, MFA prompt bombing, and more.</p>
<p>For these reasons, organizations must explore comprehensive security solutions beyond just passwords and traditional MFA and look to phishing-resistant MFA such as certificate-based authentication.</p>
 The Entrust Solution 
<p>Entrust Desktop Credential Provider for Microsoft Windows, which provides robust passwordless and multi-factor authentication for Windows desktop login, is one such solution. It integrates with Entrust Identity Enterprise (IdE) and Identity as a Service (IDaaS), allowing comprehensive user authentication and management. Entrust Desktop responds to various use cases like workstation login, password change, and unlock, thereby enhancing security and providing better access controls.</p>
<p>Using MFA with Entrust Desktop Credential Provider increases organizational security, provides better control over system access, offers various choices to meet specific security needs, and helps meet regulatory requirements.</p>
 MFA Methods Supported by Entrust Desktop: 
 
 Passwordless Authentication: This method eliminates the need for users to remember and input a password for subsequent logins after their initial setup. Instead of the traditional password-based approach, it relies solely on Entrust’s second-factor authentication mechanisms. This not only simplifies the user’s experience but also offers a secure way to verify their identity, given the robustness of the second-factor authentication techniques involved. 
 OTP (One-Time Password) Authentication: A unique, time-sensitive password is dispatched to the user’s registered contact details – either their email address or phone number. Since the PIN is valid for only a short duration and can’t be used more than once, it reduces the chances of unauthorized access. 
 Token Authentication: Here, users authenticate themselves using secure tokens, which can be either hardware devices or software-based. These tokens can originate from Entrust or other reputable vendors in the cybersecurity realm. Entrust provides support for two main types of tokens:
 
 Response-Only Tokens: Provide authentication through a simple response mechanism 
 Challenge-response Tokens: Engage users in an interactive authentication process, where the system sends a challenge and awaits a correct response 
 
 
 
 
 Mobile Soft Token Authentication: In this approach, users receive an out-of-band authentication challenge directly on their mobile devices. These challenges can range from simple prompts to more interactive mechanisms, making the process both user-friendly and secure. 
 Grid Authentication: A unique method that presents users with a grid filled with an assortment of characters organized in rows and columns. During the login process, users are asked to provide specific characters from predetermined coordinates on the grid. Given its unconventional nature, this method offers an extra layer of security against automated bot attacks. 
 Knowledge-Based Q&amp;A Authentication: Here, users respond to a set of personalized questions either online or offline. These questions are typically formulated during the user’s initial setup and are based on information only the user is likely to know. The Q&amp;A mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into the Entrust Identity Enterprise platform, specifically via the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Server (or the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Module) or the Identity as a Service platform. This method combines the security of knowledge-based tests with the convenience of user-defined answers. 
 Mobile Smart Credentials Authentication (Certificate-based authentication with Bluetooth proximity): This is an advanced out-of-band authentication strategy. Users receive a challenge on their mobile devices, which is then signed by the Entrust Mobile Smart Credential app upon verification of the user through biometrics or a unique PIN. Once signed, the challenge is verified by the Entrust Identity Enterprise or the Identity as a Service platforms. 
 
<p>While Entrust supports multiple MFA authentication mechanisms, we highly recommend using a phishing-resistant authentication mechanism with passwordless certificate-based authentication via our mobile smart credential application.</p>

   A new study shows that organizations can enjoy a range of benefits by migrating — if they can overcome internal challenges 

<p>In the early days of cloud adoption, organizations were understandably apprehensive. Many of the early adopters were particularly concerned about security, and tested the waters with non-essential apps that were easy to migrate and presented minimal risk. In the years since, with most organizations well into their cloud journeys, cloud migration has proven its value in material ways, enabling greater productivity, better customer engagement, lower costs, and improved efficiency. And it's strengthened security by moving visibility and control to anywhere users and data happen to be.</p>

<p>Most would agree that identity and access management (IAM) is a critical component of a robust security ecosystem. So, it only makes sense that organizations would look to move IAM to the cloud as part of their overall digital transformation initiatives. Yet, many organizations remain hesitant to jump in and begin the process of migrating IAM systems to the cloud, despite its potential benefits.</p>

<p>We set out to find out why with the help of Forrester.</p>

<p>The result of this work is a custom study by Forrester Consulting in November 2023, commissioned by ForgeRock and Ping Identity and titled, "<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/cloud-migration-optimizes-identity-and-access-management">Cloud Migration Optimizes Identity and Access Management</a>."</p>

<p>The study's purpose was to investigate the challenges that are holding organizations back from migrating IAM to the cloud. The survey also explored the benefits and opportunities awaiting those that embrace cloud IAM.</p>

 About the study 

<p>The commissioned study queried organizations around the world with at least 5,000 employees to explore their concerns about migrating IAM systems and solutions to the cloud. It also sought to understand the perceptions of IAM administrators and security leaders about cloud migration, the potential benefits of embracing a move to the cloud, and how cloud migration impacts their success. Ultimately, it looked to help guide organizations considering a move to the cloud to create a plan for IAM cloud migration.</p>

 Cloud IAM can help organizations achieve their objectives, so why aren't more adopting it? 

<p>Organizations in all sectors face challenges related to demands for stronger security and better experiences for customers and employees. They're fielding requests for multi-factor authentication (MFA), including passwordless authentication, while navigating a complex web of regulations that vary by region.</p>

<p>For most, the answer may be cloud IAM. According to the survey, 86% of respondents indicate that fully migrating IAM to the cloud is important to their success. That number jumps to ninety-two percent for organizations using both workforce IAM and customer IAM (CIAM).</p>

<p>But despite broad interest in its benefits, organizations have been slow to make the move. According to Forrester, only 12% of organizations are fully embracing identity in the cloud.<a>1</a></p>

 For many organizations, the culprit is internal 

<p>The survey showed that organizations are having trouble overcoming the challenges with cloud migration, primarily in two areas: organizational barriers and complexity.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of cloud IAM technology is that it enables enterprises to transition from an on-premises IAM system to the cloud to deliver the agility, reliability, and scalability commonly associated with cloud technologies and services. But the complexity of legacy IAM ecosystems creates barriers to success.</p>

<p>Assessing and managing existing infrastructure, including highly distributed identities, identifying integrations and incompatibilities between apps and cloud solutions, and realigning internal technologies to facilitate a move to the cloud represent arduous but critical tasks. Add to that organizational silos, including siloed IAM, and a lack of leadership support at the highest levels, and it's no wonder that the journey to the cloud for many organizations is an uphill battle.</p>

 What benefits await? 

<p>Although the challenges can be intimidating, the journey to the cloud offers a bounty of rewards that make the endeavor worthwhile. More than 60% of survey respondents indicate that successful migration can enhance security, including improving password security and enforcing Zero Trust security.</p>

<p>Cloud IAM also helps businesses deliver the kind of frictionless user experiences that attract, engage, and retain customers, and enhance employee engagement and productivity. Equally significant are the operational improvements offered by cloud migration, including reduced complexity in governance and management, improved agility to comply with regulations, and the freeing of resources normally burdened with these tasks — many of the manual — to focus on other activities that deliver greater business value.</p>

 How can you move forward?

<p>Driver’s licenses serve more use cases for us than simply proving our capability to operate a vehicle–many people use their driver’s license as their primary form of identification. As we shift to a digital-first world, people will need credentials to represent all facets of their identity digitally in a secure way. Whether it be proving identity to apply for a loan or purchasing a controlled substance online, it’s becoming increasingly important and necessary for entities to offer people the option to present a digitally issued ID document remotely.</p><p>This means that it is critical to build mobile driver’s license (mDL) solutions using standardized data formats, so verifiers across different geographies and industries can use a consistent framework to confirm a person’s identity. To ensure the secure and interoperable use of these digital credentials, international standards are being developed and tested. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event, organized by SpruceID, was a significant milestone in this ongoing journey.</p><p>We’re delighted to have hosted a successful, fully-remote, and asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations. Read on to learn more about ISO/IEC 18013-7, a recap of the interoperability event, and how the results and findings are being used to drive the digital identity industry forward.</p> A Brief Introduction to ISO/IEC 18013-7 <p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 is the working group that defines standards for motor vehicle driver’s licenses and related documents, to provide a common technical framework and promote the safe and secure use of this technology. The 18013-5 standard specified by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 defines requirements for the security, data elements, and information exchange of mobile driving licenses (mDL) between the mobile device and authorized parties while upholding user data protection and safeguarding driver privacy.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 focuses on attended in-person use cases where parties are in close proximity during the presentation of a digitally issued ID document. After introducing the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC17 took another step forward by publishing a Committee Draft consultation of ISO/IEC 18013-7, a draft technical specification that focuses on unattended or fully online use cases of mDL where parties are remotely connected at the time of presentation.</p><p>The objective of our interoperability event was to provide a collaboration forum for implementers of ISO/IEC 18013-7 to come together and test their respective solutions to drive forward cross-industry interoperability and adoption while accelerating feedback and clarity for implementations of the standards.</p> Joining Forces for Testing <p>The Interoperability Event was hosted remotely, with an asynchronous testing window spanning three weeks. This allowed participants enough time to actively test and collaborate iteratively with other implementers to optimize their own implementations and use cases.</p><p>The event was open for all implementers of 18013-7 to participate without any restrictions regarding organization size or any particular working group membership. Participants came from a variety of backgrounds, including both public and private sectors, across multiple geographies. Any observers interested in understanding the maturity and adoption of the draft standard were also welcome to join and listen in.</p><p>The participating mDL reader implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Credence ID, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Okta, OneProof, Panasonic, Ping Identity, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID, and Thales.</p><p>The participating mDL implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, NEC, OneProof, Panasonic, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID (jointly with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles), and Thales.</p><p>Testing participants were encouraged to test both Rest API and OpenID4VP implementations to inform recommendations for refining the clarity of the technical specification related to both protocols.</p> Results and Reflections <p>There were many takeaways and learnings from the test event that will ultimately help to inform both the standard and interoperability moving forward. Notably, the draft specifications were found to have no major issues necessitating normative changes. Most interoperability challenges were largely a result of updates to the draft documents in advance of the interoperability event, which some participants did not have sufficient time or resources to address. However, the successful resolution of these issues demonstrated a shared commitment to fostering interoperability and will help improve this documentation in the future.</p><p>Feedback from the event, along with preliminary aggregate, anonymized test results, and troubleshooting, was presented to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 WG10 in Singapore. The findings and resolutions were documented as N2349 in the ISO Global Directory. So far, these insights have been incorporated into the latest version of ISO/IEC 18013-7, submitted as N2356. N2356 is the first draft of a Technical Specification, which includes all the improvements and insights we've gathered during our test event to enhance the specification for better interoperability.</p><p>If you’re interested in taking a deeper dive into these findings, a comprehensive event results publication can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114730549750609434292&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">be found here</a>. </p> Onwards and Upwards for 18013-7 <p>We look forward to continuing to play a role in advancing the 18013-7 standard and other digital identity standards. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event was a testament to the collective effort to advance standards for mobile driver's licenses, and how much progress we can make together to eventually bring this standard to life for public use. The successful interoperability demonstrations of mobile driver’s licenses that can be presented and verified remotely over the internet will introduce a new class of use cases for verifiable digital identity and evolve the way we use mobile driver’s licenses today.</p><p>At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. As digital identity technologies, such as mobile driver's licenses, become more pervasive and usable for online user experiences, it is important to be mindful of introducing privacy-preserving capabilities from their inception. To that end, we think carefully about technology mitigations for privacy risks and concerns raised by civil liberties organizations, such as "phoning home," in the mDL implementations that SpruceID works on. You can learn more in our <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p><p>We’d like to thank all implementers for taking the time to participate in the test event. This event marked a crucial step towards creating a digital identification landscape that is secure, interoperable, and universally accessible. As we continue our journey towards fully realizing the potential of mDLs, collaborative, open events like these play a vital role in shaping the future of digital identification.</p>  📄  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Event Results Publication</a>   <p>About SpruceID: At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. </p>

 The Brazilian gambling industry is about to become regulated. IDnow investigates how the grey market currently works, and some of the dangers of using unregulated gambling platforms. 



 



<p>Brazil effectively banned gambling in 1946; a more-or-less all-encompassing restriction that remained largely in place until 2018, when sports betting was legalized. However, as virtually no regulation was ever implemented, Brazilian players and international gambling platforms have been operating in a somewhat grey area ever since. This is all due to change once Brazilian online gambling regulation is formally approved in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The limbo appears to work, at least on the face of it. And at least for international operators. Surprisingly, despite the lack of clear regulation, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">a projected $1.5 billion in 2023</a>) and bring it back within the fold of the Brazilian economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the projected numbers are likely to be even larger when regulation finally passes, as there are vast swathes of the Brazilian would-be gambling community that are not currently gambling, despite wanting to.</p>



 To gamble or not to gamble? That is the Brazilian question. 



<p>In 2021, a survey on Brazilian attitudes toward gambling discovered that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/o-desafio-da-preven%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-lavagem-de-dinheiro-nos-jogos-odilon-dutra/?originalSubdomain=pt">39% of Brazilian participants said they didn’t gamble</a> because they felt uncertain of the safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just over half of all potential players said they would feel more confident playing online if they had more information about the companies. This is understandable as many gambling operators are not very clear about who their owners are, or even the location of their headquarters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same survey, 51% of participants said they would like to see more player protection mechanisms put in place. Read more opinions from the Brazilian betting community in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">blog, ‘How does the Brazilian betting community really feel about upcoming regulations.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite operating in the grey, international gambling operators have achieved considerable visibility through advertising on television and the internet, and through sponsorship of Brazilian football clubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the wave of publicity and ensuing popularity <a href="https://mundorubronegro.com/apostas-brasil/casas-apostas-ilegais">has raised concerns</a> about the impact of gambling addiction, the growth of scams, and the threat of money laundering.</p>



 Wait, so is online gambling legal or illegal in Brazil? 



<p>The most obvious question that many have when they see adverts for online gambling platforms but find out online gambling is essentially illegal, is well, how does that work? The answer lies in <a href="https://seudireito.proteste.org.br/site-de-apostas-e-ilegal/">Law 13.756,</a> which allows operators to offer their services in Brazil if their headquarters are outside of Brazil and there are no physical points of sale. In practice, this law enables bookmakers to use websites, on the condition they are hosted internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As these websites operate according to the rules of the countries in which they are based, such as Curaçao, the UK or Malta, they are not required to obey Brazilian laws, such as the Consumer Defence Code. This is all set to change when Brazilian regulations are formally passed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has meant that from 2018 until whenever the regulations finally come into force, international bookmakers have operated with a sort of impunity and without needing to implement fair gaming rules or player protection measures.</p>



 What do Brazilian players think about using unregulated gambling platforms? 



<p>The Brazilian gaming community is waking up to the realities of dealing with unregulated gambling operators. Common complaints made on social media and forums include users making deposits but being unable to withdraw them, and even stories of players who have had their accounts blocked following a good streak in sports betting or on online casinos. However, there is a growing awareness among the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">Brazilian betting community</a> that these kinds of scams are not representative of the entire gambling industry, but rather just unreliable websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An upside to the online proliferation of so many negative stories has led to <a href="https://www.extraclasse.org.br/geral/2023/03/bicheiros-e-contraventores-investem-em-cassinos-on-line-e-apostas-esportivas/">increasing numbers of Brazilian gamblers</a> actively seeking information about the risk of less reliable, unregulated online gambling sites.</p>



 Arguments for and against KYC processes in Brazil. 



<p>While the vast majority of the Brazilian betting community seem to accept the value of undergoing a KYC process, there are <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/betano/casa-de-aposta-nao-quer-pagar-meu-saque-e-fica-pedindo-fotos-de-todos-o-tip_DSBUzJ1HW0713vYD/">some who have expressed privacy concerns</a> over some operators’ requirements for players to take and send photographs of themselves holding identity documents. Many also fear that when dealing with an international operator, if there was a problem associated with sending documents, for example a data breach, then they would not be able to rely on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farialimabets/comments/11txan7/%C3%A9_seguro_enviar_meus_documentos_para_uma_casa_de/">national legal protection measures</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A common complaint among international gambling operators is on the difficulty of performing the Brazilian KYC process due to the wide variety and disparity of identity documents in Brazil. For example, each state in Brazil offers slightly different ID cards, which have dates and document numbers in different places, for example. Difficulties <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/bc-game/verificacao-kyc_OcihHkmZ_wp6BSrb/">surrounding the KYC process</a> has affected some players’ ability to <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/188bet-apostas-esportivas-online/verificacao-de-identidade-kyc-prejuizo-de-u-75_Gp8gh8oJt_YPqbvA/">transact and make withdrawals</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes the integration with the Cadastro de Pessoas Fiscias (CPF), a tax number that every Brazilian is issued with, all the more important for identity verification and KYC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian industry insiders say that the implementation of KYC measures to obtain a licence (Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">‘Unpacking the complexities of the Brazilian gambling license structure’ here</a>) means more than just following a legal requirement, it will also <a href="https://g-mnews.com/pt/compliance-kyc-transparencia-que-gera-confiabilidade/">help operators prevent fraud</a>.</p>

 Mattereum as a Synthetic Jurisdiction <p>Recently, I attended the <a href="https://lu.ma/tnsconf">Network State Conference</a> in Amsterdam, as the innovative <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> created by my company could have an important role to play in a network state future.

This means, in effect, they create a synthetic jurisdiction that sits between nation states, resting on international treaties, The Mattereum model can be seen as a new form of network state itself, as well as a convenient legal tool to be used by other network states (or indeed any other individual or entity) for managing trade in physical goods. It could become a “pluggable” legal layer to support other network states, particularly the ones exporting physical goods. If a thing has a price tag, it can be part of this synthetic jurisdiction, irrespective of whether the object is land in Oregon, gold in a vault in Singapore or investment grade whisky in a barrel in Scotland, subject to the same law and the same guarantees. It is a state for physical objects, rather than a state for people, but arguably a state nonetheless. What makes it so is that it has the machinery to resolve legal disputes between people, under the rules that they opt into when they use Mattereum. It’s where your legal problems go to be resolved. Resolving trade disputes is one of the more critical aspects of a state, isn’t&nbsp;it?</p><blockquote>The innovative Mattereum Asset Passport created by my company could have an important role to play in a network state&nbsp;future</blockquote><p>This is not new to us; while network states are gaining in prominence and importance as their potential becomes clear, Mattereum has been thinking about this kind of thing from the very start. Five years ago, in the early days of our company, I wrote a speculative document about this very thing with two of my colleagues from Mattereum. Until now it has not been published outside the organisation but given its new relevance I thought I would share it. The language does not perhaps use current terminology (e.g. for Free Economic Zones read network states, for smart property register, read MAPs), but I feel the ideas are possibly even more relevant now than they were&nbsp;then.</p> “Towards a Digital&nbsp;Hansa: <p>Past Precedents as Inspiration for a Global Confederation of Free Economic Zones By James Hester, Anton Shelupanov, and Vinay&nbsp;Gupta</p><p>As Free Economic Zones (FEZs) have emerged and developed, these unique commercial entities have gradually come to share more in common with each other than with the parent nation states in which they are located. It is only natural, then, that a desire would arise to unify their efforts towards common business goals, as for example in the Eurasian belt where the Digital Silk Road initiative seeks to facilitate interaction between FEZs in the region. Since formal unification would be geopolitically disruptive, the goal should be a strong but informal confederation capable of acting on the world stage at state-like levels and capable of facilitating commerce between members. As it happens, there exists a precedent for such a vast and formidable mercantile body in Europe’s past which could provide an inspiring model for how an equivalent organisation could be formed and governed&nbsp;today.</p><p>The Hanseatic League, also known as the Hansa (Middle Low German for ‘guild’), was a confederation of trading centres in the Holy Roman Empire which, founded in the 12th century, became the dominant mercantile power in Northern Europe for the next four centuries. Composed primarily of German towns and headquartered in Lübeck, member towns worked to ensure mutual protection of trade and the smooth conduct of commerce between them. They were never formally unified, being towns under the control of the Empire or neighbouring kingdoms including Sweden, Denmark, England, and Kievan Rus. Yet all members adhered to the bonds required of them in the Hanseatic charters, and heads of state learned quickly not to antagonise them lest they risk being cut out of trade (effectively an economic death sentence). They were governed by the consensus of their members, with regular meetings of representatives from each town to decide on pressing issues. They even levied troops and ships from members for mutual protection when necessary, meaning that they were capable of amassing a respectable military presence. So although not a state, they acted with near state-like power and were regarded as such by Europe’s&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>When we consider the degree of organisation which was achieved by the Hansa with the technology at their disposal, it is easy to see how a similar institution is not only possible today, but greatly enhanced and facilitated by our current technological innovations. Near-instant communication enables unprecedented efficiency in logistics coordination and maintaining relationships with clients and partners. Containerisation has revolutionised the transport of goods through standardisation and optimal use of space. And now, blockchain technology stands poised to automate elaborate and time-consuming administrative and legal procedures, reducing once exasperating but inevitable aspects of conducting business to previously unthinkable levels of ease and straightforwardness. Not only could we establish such an institution today and reap the resulting commercial benefits, we could do it better than our ancestors ever&nbsp;dreamed.</p><p>So what would an equivalent confederation of FEZs, our Digital Hansa, look like? A single strong economic centre (Lübeck) provided the foundation on which the original Hansa was built, with all members consenting to abide by the ‘Law of Lübeck’ in governing their activities. To avoid any one member becoming overly influential, member FEZs could jointly adopt a governance framework of a neutral body such as UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). They would also agree on a means of achieving consensus on policy and activities, and commit to abide by a single set of standards and regulations. These would apply appropriately across the confederation’s three tiers: individual companies operating in an FEZ, individual FEZs, and the combined global&nbsp;network.</p><p>Members would also pledge mutual aid to one another. This aid would take several forms. Parent states would negotiate the necessary economic concessions to enable member FEZs and their component companies to conduct business among themselves in the same manner worldwide. Members would speak with a collective voice in international forums such as the UN, and organise a communal legal defence and hardship funds to be drawn upon by any member in need. It is even possible, after delicate negotiations with each parent state, to organise some form of mutual defence pact whereby member states would contribute somehow to the protection of one another in times of necessity. A useful existing model is the single market and customs union established across members of the European Union. Just as these agreements remove economic barriers and facilitate trade with EU member states, a Digital Hansa would enable unhindered commerce between FEZs regardless of their location on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The blockchain applications developed by Mattereum are well placed to provide much of the necessary digital infrastructure for a global confederation of Free Economic Zones. The identities of member individuals and companies, the standards adhered to by all tiers of the organisation, and perhaps a complementary industry-standard accreditation such as a D-U-N-S Number, would be recorded on an immutable and accessible digital record. Consequently, external businesses engaging with members would be able to easily verify relevant details and proceed, safe in the knowledge that any company operating within a member FEZ operates under the same established regulations and practices.</p><p>The Smart Property Register operated by Mattereum would track and manage assets and resources across the confederation’s three tiers. No matter the asset’s location in the world, while in custody of a member, clients could rest assured that its storage and transport would be managed with an established standard of care. Tokenization of assets would also enable trade to be conducted without necessitating the transfer of physical goods from owner to&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Furthermore, since economic concessions from parent states would enable the transport of goods between member FEZs with reduced or eliminated tariffs and other expenses normally incurred while engaging in international trade, using member companies for transport and logistics would become particularly enticing.</p><p>For whatever governing framework member FEZs choose to jointly subscribe, Mattereum’s smart contracts could provide the means by which members commit to abide by them. This would prove especially useful in the resolution of disputes. Mattereum’s arbitration mechanisms would be in place both to resolve any claims or grievances that arise, and enable governing powers to enforce resolutions with all due authority and means. Streamlining such otherwise onerous processes will both reduce administrative and legal costs for all parties, as well as allay fears of time and resources wasted should a dispute&nbsp;arise.</p><p>The positive impacts would be considerable. Political benefits would be significant, as parent states which are not currently influential players on the world stage would gain influential partnerships in the wider international community. They would also have a greater voice in world affairs by virtue of the confederation’s collective actions. The economic benefits would be equally striking. Member companies would dramatically reduce administrative and legal costs, and would also see increased profits as clients are attracted to the reduction of costs and hassle which would come from working with members. Furthermore, the necessary digital infrastructure would already be in place within member FEZs, allowing businesses to plug into existing systems rather than building them from the ground up. Parent states would also reap commercial benefits through greater internal economic activity and increases in&nbsp;FDI.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest impact of a Digital Hansa would be the advent of a new commercial ecosystem. The confederation imagined here would create a new global standard of business conduct which would dramatically strengthen relationships between companies and clients. If a company is ‘Hansa’-backed, no matter its location or its jurisdiction, clients could know exactly what that means, and proceed with confidence. As the original Hansa ushered in a period of previously unprecedented commercial cooperation and prosperity for the Holy Roman Empire, a Digital Hansa stands ready to do the same for the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Over the last year or so, I have written pieces about how the innovation created by Mattereum, the <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> can help bring about <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">limitless ecommerce</a>, how it can <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/ai-oracles-super-empower-real-world-assets-on-the-blockchain-and-super-empower-ai-to-act-in-the-619aa2ba5bf1">help AI </a>revolutionise the way we do business, how it can enable not only a circular economy but the more efficient and realistic <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-the-spiral-economy-a-reality-8a5930cc80cd">spiral economy</a> as well as how it can transform the trade in real world assets through <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fractional-ownership-rwa-daos-and-the-holy-grail-557b99e8e045">tokenization and fractionalization</a>, and now I am talking network state. I sometimes feel we could be seen as just jumping on the latest bandwagon to catch the eye of VCs looking for the flavour of the month, but then I realise that we are just showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing.</p><blockquote>We are showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing</blockquote><p>Mattereum’s innovation is deep and profound; it took six years and several million pounds to get our system to work, it was not easy, and no one else has come close to achieving the same thing, but it is working, and has been live and serving customers for over two years&nbsp;now.</p><p>By creating a connection between a token on the blockchain and a physical thing in the real world that will stand up in court in 172 jurisdictions worldwide we have made something that will provide the deep foundations for trade in the future. It really can make ecommerce faster and smoother by removing the majority of the barriers to high value transactions. The same thing makes it possible for AI to recognise that the digital twin of a physical object really does represent something in the real world and to enable the tracking of objects through their lives so they can be reused and recycled efficiently. In addition, by being able to facilitate the tokenization and fractionalization of physical assets with ownership firmly established, it does utterly change the way things like <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/revolutionising-real-estate-with-the-blockchain-a9a90afd7d3d">real estate</a> and<a href="https://mattereum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The_Case_for_Gold_on_the_Blockchain.pdf"> gold</a> can be traded. So too, can it provide a way for network states to manage physical assets that enhances their function, and there will be other things it can revolutionise too, it’s just waiting for people to identify the potential.</p><blockquote>The MAP is deep infrastructure, like railway lines or HTML; it does the same thing, whatever the traffic you choose to run on it, and it has the potential to change the future just as&nbsp;much.</blockquote><p>If you are working on a project that you think could be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via <a href="mailto:contact@mattereum.com">contact@mattereum.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">The Network State and the Digital Hansa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, the world’s most popular open-source <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration platform</a>, is considered a major milestone in the history of cloud-native technologies. Developed internally at Google and released to the public in 2014, Kubernetes has enabled organizations to move away from traditional IT infrastructure and toward the automation of operational tasks tied to the deployment, scaling and managing of containerized applications (or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>). While Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container management, many companies also use the technology for a broader range of use cases.</p>



 Overview of Kubernetes 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">Containers</a>—lightweight units of software that package code and all its dependencies to run in any environment—form the foundation of Kubernetes and are mission-critical for modern microservices, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> software and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> workflows.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker">Docker</a> was the first <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open-source</a> software tool to popularize building, deploying and managing containerized applications. But Docker lacked an automated “orchestration” tool, which made it time-consuming and complex for data science teams to scale applications. Kubernetes, also referred to as K8s, was specifically created to address these challenges by automating the management of containerized applications.</p>



<p>In broad strokes, the Kubernetes orchestration platform runs via containers with <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/How+does+Kubernetes+create+a+PodF/1_9z271sfl">pods</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/bg/cpl?topic=process-concept-nodes">nodes</a>. A pod operates one or more Linux containers and can run in multiples for scaling and failure resistance. Nodes run the pods and are usually grouped in a Kubernetes cluster, abstracting the underlying physical hardware resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kubernetes’s declarative, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">API</a>-driven infrastructure has helped free up DevOps and other teams from manually driven processes so they can work more independently and efficiently to achieve their goals. In 2015, Google donated Kubernetes as a seed technology to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF) (link resides outside ibm.com), the open-source, vendor-neutral hub of cloud-native computing.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/kubernetes-history/">Read about the history of Kubernetes </a>



<p>Today, Kubernetes is widely used in production to manage Docker and essentially any other type of container runtime. While Docker includes its own orchestration tool, called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-a-comparison/">Docker Swarm</a>, most developers choose Kubernetes container orchestration instead.</p>



<p>As an open-source system, Kubernetes services are supported by all the leading public cloud providers, including IBM, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google. Kubernetes can also run on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/bare-metal-dedicated-servers">bare metal servers</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a> in private cloud,&nbsp;hybrid cloud and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">edge</a> settings, provided the host OS is a version of Linux or Windows.</p>



 Six top Kubernetes use cases 



<p>Here’s a rundown of six top Kubernetes use cases that reveal how Kubernetes is transforming IT infrastructure.</p>



 1. Large-scale app deployment 



<p>Heavily trafficked websites and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> applications receive millions of user requests each day. A key advantage of using Kubernetes for large-scale cloud app deployment is autoscaling. This process allows applications to adjust to demand changes automatically, with speed, efficiency and minimal downtime. For instance, when demand fluctuates, Kubernetes enables applications to run continuously and respond to changes in web traffic patterns This helps maintain the right amount of workload resources, without over- or under-<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/provisioning">provisioning</a>.</p>



<p>Kubernetes employs <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA)</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) to carry out <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/load-balancing">load balancing</a> (as for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tivoli-monitoring/6.3.0.2?topic=usage-cpu">CPU</a> usage or custom&nbsp;metrics) by scaling the number of pod replicas (clones that facilitate self-healing) related to a specific deployment. This mitigates potential issues like traffic surges, hardware problems or network disruptions.</p>



<p>Note: HPA is not to be confused with Kubernetes vertical pod autoscaling (VPA), which assigns additional resources, such as memory or CPU, to the pods that are already running for the workload.</p>



 2. High-performance computing 



<p>Industries including government, science, finance and engineering rely heavily on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hpc">high-performance computing (HPC)</a>, the technology that processes big data to perform complex calculations. HPC uses powerful processors at extremely high speeds to make instantaneous data-driven decisions. Real-world uses of HPC&nbsp;include&nbsp;automating stock trading, weather prediction, DNA sequencing and aircraft flight simulation.</p>



<p>HPC-heavy industries use Kubernetes to manage the distribution of HPC calculations across hybrid and multicloud environments. Kubernetes can also serve as a flexible tool to support <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.2?topic=types-batch-jobs">batch job</a> processing involved in high-performance computing workloads, which enhances data and code <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/txseries/8.2?topic=decisions-portability">portability</a>.</p>



 3. AI and machine learning 



<p>Building and deploying <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> systems requires huge volumes of data and complex processes like high-performance computing and big data analysis. Deploying machine learning on Kubernetes makes it easier for organizations to automate the management and scaling of ML lifecycles and reduces the need for manual intervention.</p>



<p>For example, the Kubernetes containerized orchestration platform can automate portions of AI and ML predictive maintenance workflows, including health checks and resource planning. And Kubernetes can scale ML workloads up or down to meet user demands, adjust resource usage and control costs.</p>



<p>Machine learning relies on large language models to perform high-level <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a> like text classification, sentiment analysis and machine translation, and Kubernetes helps speed the deployment of large language models to automate the NLP process. As more and more organizations turn to <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> capabilities, they are using Kubernetes to run and scale generative AI models, providing high availability and fault tolerance.</p>



<p>Overall, Kubernetes provides the flexibility, portability and scalability needed to train, test, schedule and deploy ML and generative AI models.</p>



 4. Microservices management 



<p>Microservices (or microservices architecture) offer a modern cloud-native&nbsp;architecture approach where each application is comprised of numerous loosely connected and independently deployable smaller components, or services. For instance, large retail e-commerce websites consist of many microservices. These typically include an order service, payment service, shipping service and customer service. Each service has its own <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis">REST API</a>, which the other services use to communicate with it.</p>



<p>Kubernetes was designed to handle the complexity involved to manage all the independent components running simultaneously within microservices architecture. For instance, Kubernetes’ built-in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.2?topic=availability-high">high availability</a> (HA) feature ensures continuous operations even in the event of failure. And the Kubernetes self-healing feature kicks in if a containerized app or an application component goes down. The self-healing feature can instantly redeploy the app or application component, matching the desired state, which helps to maintain uptime and reliability.</p>



 5. Hybrid and multicloud deployments 



<p>Kubernetes is built to be used anywhere, making it easier for organizations to migrate applications from on-premises to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a> environments. Kubernetes standardizes migration by providing software developers with built-in commands for effective app deployment. Kubernetes can also roll out changes to apps and scale them up and down depending on environment requirements.</p>



<p>Kubernetes offers portability across on-premises and cloud environments since it abstracts away infrastructure details from applications. This eliminates the need for platform-specific app dependencies and makes it easy to move applications between different cloud providers or data centers with minimal effort.</p>



 6. Enterprise DevOps 



<p>For enterprise DevOps teams, being able to update and deploy applications rapidly is critical for business success. Kubernetes provides teams with both software system development and maintenance to improve overall agility. And the Kubernetes API interface allows software developers and other DevOps stakeholders to easily view, access, deploy, update and optimize their container ecosystems.</p>



<p>CI/CD—which stands for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-integration">continuous integration (CI)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-delivery">continuous delivery (CD)</a>—has become a key aspect of software development. In DevOps, CI/CD streamlines application coding, testing and deployment by giving teams a single repository for storing work and automation tools to consistently combine and test the code and ensure it works. Kubernetes plays an important role in cloud-native CI/CD pipelines by automating container deployment across cloud infrastructure environments and ensuring efficient use of resources.</p>



 The future of Kubernetes 



<p>Kubernetes plays a critical IT infrastructure role, as can be seen in its many value-driven use cases that go beyond container orchestration. This is why so many businesses continue to implement Kubernetes. In a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">Cloud Native Survey</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) conducted by the CNCF, Kubernetes usage is shown to have reached its highest point ever, with 96% of organizations using or evaluating the containerized platform. According to the same study, Kubernetes usage continues to rise in emerging technology regions, such as Africa, where 73% of survey respondents are using Kubernetes in production.</p>



 IBM and Kubernetes 



<p>Kubernetes schedules and automates tasks integral to managing container-based architectures, spanning container deployment, updates, service discovery, storage provisioning,&nbsp;load balancing, health monitoring and more. At IBM we are helping clients modernize their applications and optimize their IT infrastructure with Kubernetes and other cloud-native solutions.</p>

<p>Data monetization is a business capability where an organization can create and realize value from data and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>&nbsp;(AI) assets. A value exchange system built on data products can drive business growth for your organization and gain competitive advantage. This growth could be internal cost effectiveness, stronger risk compliance, increasing the economic value of a partner ecosystem, or through new revenue streams. Advanced data management software and generative AI can accelerate the creation of a platform capability for scalable delivery of enterprise ready data and AI products.</p>



 Why data monetization matters 



<p>According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/07/a-better-way-to-put-your-data-to-work">McKinsey in the Harvard Business Review</a>, a single data product at a national US bank feeds 60 use cases in business applications, which eliminated $40M in losses and generates $60M incremental revenue annually. In the public sector, <a href="https://content.tfl.gov.uk/deloitte-report-tfl-open-data.pdf">Transport for London</a> provides free and open data across 80 data feeds powering over 600 apps and contribute up to £130m to London’s economy.</p>



<p><a href="https://cisr.mit.edu/publication/2023_0801_DataMonetization_WixomBeathOwens">Data monetization is not narrowly “selling data sets</a>;” it is about improving work and enhancing business performance by better-using data. Internal data monetization initiatives measure improvement in process design, task guidance and optimization of data used in the organization’s product or service offerings. External monetization opportunities enable different types of data in different formats to be information assets that can be sold or have their value recorded when used.</p>



<p>Creating value from data involves taking some action on the data. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/data-monetization">Realizing that value is the activity that ensures there is an economic benefit from the created value that contributes to the organization’s bottom line</a>.</p>



 Data monetization strategy: Managing data as a product 



<p>Every organization has the potential to monetize their data; for many organizations, it is an untapped resource for new capabilities. <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P31301">Data-as-a-Service and data marketplaces are well established</a> to create data value from initiatives built on data analytics, big data and business intelligence. But few organizations have made the strategic shift to managing “data as a product.” This <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-management">data management</a> means applying product development practices to data. High performing, data-driven organizations have created new business models, utility partnerships and enhanced existing offerings from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025">data monetization that contributes more than 20% to the company’s profitability</a>.</p>



<p>The key play is to treat data as a strategic asset with a user-centric product approach where this new product can be consumed by a diverse set of applications. Organizations build trust in their data and AI by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/dont-pause-ai-development-prioritize-ethics-instead/">demonstrating transparency and ethics</a>, recognizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-privacy">data privacy</a>, adhering to regulations, and keeping data safe and secure.</p>



 Data products and data mesh 



<p>Data products are assembled data from sources that can serve a set of functional needs that can be packaged into a consumable unit. Each data product has its own lifecycle environment where its data and AI assets are managed in their product-specific <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lakehouse">data lakehouse</a>. Flexibility in data collection is made possible when product lakehouses connect to and ingest data from many sources, using many different technology protocols. Additionally, by managing the data product as an isolated unit it can have location flexibility and portability — private or public cloud — depending on the established sensitivity and privacy controls for the data. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">IBM watsonx.data</a> offers connectivity flexibility and hosting of data product lakehouses built on Red Hat OpenShift for an open hybrid cloud deployment.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">Get started with watsonx.data </a>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-mesh">Data mesh</a> architectures have now emerged as the cost-effective way to serve data products to a variety of endpoint types, with detailed and robust usage tracking, risk and compliance measurements, and security. One or more data products are served over the mesh and consumed by an end-user application as an auditable transaction.</p>



<p>For example, a financial markets business might offer one product giving a real-time market data feed and another offering finance-related news. A consumer might build a decision-making application leveraging both of those products and offer trading options based on price and political or environmental news.</p>



 Building a solution capability for data management 



<p>Developing a capability depends on the ability to “connect the dots” for your stakeholders. It is a supply chain from your raw data sources to the transparent and traceable exchange of value when a data asset is consumed in an end-user experience.</p>



<p>You can do this by developing a solution framework for data monetization that incorporates:</p>



 
 Lifecycle processes 



 Technology components 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-integration">Continuous integration</a> (CI), <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-delivery">continuous delivery</a> (CD) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-deployment">continuous deployment</a> automation 



 Platform service models 
 



 Three stages of the data monetization lifecycle process: 



 
 Create: Raw data is accessed and assembled into data products. 



 Serve: Data products are discoverable and consumed as services, typically via a platform. 



 Realize: Each data service has an agreed unit of value which is transacted and measured. 
 



Figure 1: The Data Monetization Lifecycle



<p>The raw data that fuels data monetization will come from three source categories: enterprise systems, external data and personal data. Data products are assembled from operational and analytical views of company and customer data which can be combined with public data sets (not necessarily free). Personal data is an important view across enterprise and public data that needs to be managed correctly by an organization. When a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">“right to be forgotten” request</a> is invoked it spans from the raw data source to the data product target.</p>



<p>Data products come in many forms including datasets, programs and AI models. They are packaged and deployed for consumption as a service, and there can be multiple service types for any one product. Popular service consumption types include download, API and streaming.</p>



<p>Take the example of a client who integrated a set of disparate company ESG data into a new dataset. Their data services were a full dataset download plus an API wrap around the data, which could be queried for ESG data based on a company ticker symbol.</p>



<p>Data monetization is about realizing value from data. The consumer of data product services needs the ability to find and assess a product, pay for it and then invoke one or more of the service endpoints to consume it. Depending on the user’s business model they may be consuming that service for their own use in their capabilities, or under appropriate license terms to create a downstream product or customer experience using the data product for their own revenue stream.</p>



Figure 2: The Data Monetization Value Chain



 Achieve scale with a platform approach 



<p>A user’s options for consumption vary. The traditional approach may have been for the data product supplier to distribute its large one-size-fits-all datasets direct to clients or into multiple data marketplaces. For APIs, they may have built them into the catalog ecosystems of each hyperscaler cloud catalog. For AI models and associated datasets, they could look to utilize a marketplace like <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>. These consumption provisions now start to become a complex, federated and less cost-effective way of maximizing profit from transaction and subscription revenues.</p>



<p>With the data monetization solution framework, the maximized return on value can come from a data product provider becoming a data SaaS business. The framework defines a reference architecture that integrates a set of technologies and products including IBM Data and AI products.</p>



Figure 3: Implementing the Solution Stack with IBM Data and AI



<p>Implementation across the full lifecycle covers:</p>



 
 Create: Ingest source data sets and feeds and transform these into data product assets using hybrid cloud lakehouse technology with integrated data science and AI development environments. 



 Serve: Build cloud services for data products through automation and platform service technology so they can be operated securely at global scale. 



 Realize: Instrument the data product services to enable adherence to risk and compliance controls with event and metrics data integrated to financial management. 
 



<p>A further extension on this SaaS capability is where the data product provider also offers a multi-tenant, multi-user creator environment. Multiple parties collaborate in their own development spaces, consuming the data product services on the platform in their offerings and then hosting for consumption by their customers.</p>



 Enterprise artificial intelligence 



<p>Many organizations have built mature software systems with machine learning and deep learning functions to power their business processes and customer offerings. Generative AI has only served to accelerate the options for data product design, lifecycle delivery and operational management.</p>



<p>Platform builders and operators can use AI models to build tools. Creators can use those tools to discover or learn about data in enterprise systems and public domain. Code generation “co-pilot” tools (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-code-assistant">watsonx Code Assistant</a>) build and maintain automations and create natural language driven experiences for operations or customer service. These add to established practices of using AIOps and advanced analytics around finance and risk functions.</p>



<p>Data product owners and service owners can innovate with Generative AI tools. They can augment data set assembly with generated synthetic data and create new analyses of data sources, which in turn can eliminate outliers and anomalies. Doing so can increase the quality of data integrated into data products. It can be used to develop data product specific classification and knowledge bases of data sets, as well as build organization and domain specific AI models to offer as products.</p>



<p>Enterprise Generative AI is beginning to orient itself around what are the right type of models and training approaches. More importantly they are looking at the trust and transparency of the datasets these models are trained on, plus the legal indemnification position when using them.</p>



<p>Data product owners that are building or integrating such models must consider trust and transparency when designing the value exchange. By utilising watsonx.ai, an organization’s data monetization roadmap can take advantage of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/building-ai-for-business-ibms-granite-foundation-models/">models such as IBM Granite</a> to be assured of its transparency and indemnification.</p>



 Accelerating data monetization 



<p>The foundational products that can be used to build the platform are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">IBM Cloud Pak for Data</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-integration">IBM Cloud Pak for Integration</a>. Their components enable development of data products and services for end user consumption at production scale. watsonx.data adds data product lakehouse abilities and watsonx.ai adds advanced generative AI model development.</p>



<p>A cohesive data monetization service experience can be built with these products and pre-designed automation workflows. Built to run on Red Hat OpenShift this gives the advantage of a scalable platform that can be built once, deployed across multiple private on-premises and public cloud infrastructures, and run as a consistent single service.</p>



<p>Using this IBM solution framework organizations can shift to using data as a strategic asset and inject innovation into the business model through enterprise AI technology.</p>

			<p>14th November, Luxembourg – &nbsp;Today holds dual significance: not only does it mark the launch of <a href="https://www.artsgain.com/en/">Artsgain</a>‘s groundbreaking tokenized blue-chip art fund, but it’s also the birth anniversary of the legendary artist, Claude Monet. </p>
<p>A trailblazer, Monet forever changed the way we perceive art. In the same pioneering spirit, Artsgain’s tokenized fund will introduce unprecedented liquidity avenues for art investors, echoing Monet’s revolutionary essence in today’s financial world.</p>
<p>Artsgain, a Barcelona-based VC firm specializing in high-quality blue-chip investment funds featuring art, antiques, and collectibles from globally renowned artists, is excited to partner with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading enterprise-tokenization platform, to make their vision of increasing liquidity for these one-of-a-kind assets a reality.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, art has been an exclusive asset class which can be attributed to its limited access and significant initial capital requirements, making it challenging for many to participate and even more frustrating knowing that the art market has been consistently outperforming many other asset classes.</p>
<p>In fact, since the year 2000, the art market, categorized by blue-chip artists’ performance, has statistically proven a higher return than popular indices like the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 by a multiple of 3x proving to be a great diversification strategy.</p>
<p>Artsgain is on a mission to transform the art market by offering tokenized shares, in order to improve liquidity and create a secondary market for its tokenized art securities. Their collaboration with Tokeny aims to simplify the investment process, guiding investors seamlessly into the world of blue-chip art.</p>
<p>By seamlessly integrating the open-source permissioned token standard ERC3643 via Tokeny’s platform, Artsgain not only assures regulatory compliance within the EU securities regulation framework under MiFID, but also fosters enhanced liquidity for art assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization allows for easier trading and transferability of art-related tokens, leading to improved liquidity in the market. The innovation offers new opportunities for shares in the art fund while maintaining compliance standards at the smart contract level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Artsgain emphasizes the ESG components of its operations: from transporting to managing artworks in a sustainable way, dedicated 0.3% of the funds to NGOs for disabled artists, and positive screening for women artists.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    We are excited to support Artsgain in the world of art investing with our cutting-edge software. Art, like technology, is an ever-evolving canvas of innovation and creativity.

<p></p><p>"What can you actually build with Web5?" This is one of the most common questions I've heard as I enter my two-month mark at TBD. It's one thing to discuss the theoretical aspects of Web5, with its focus on decentralization and user empowerment, but it's another to see tangible, innovative applications come to life. This is why builders, visionaries, and project maintainers at TBD are excited to showcase <a href="https://www.netonomy.io/">Netonomy</a>, a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/">Web5</a> project built by <a href="https://github.com/demattosanthony">Anthony Dimatteo</a>.</p> What is Netonomy?<a title="Direct link to What is Netonomy?">​</a> <p>Anthony describes Netonomy as "an application that allows users and organizations to own their digital identities, data, and finances." The goal is to give users a digital home for their identity, data, and assistants - all under their control and not dependent on centralized platforms. Netonomy leverages Web5 concepts for data management and storage, but it also incorporates artificial intelligence through vector databases. </p><p>Here's how it works from a user perspective: a user can upload any document, from developer documentation to rental insurance information. Then, the user asks an AI-powered chat assistant questions about details within the document, such as "When does my rental insurance expire?" Subsequently, the chat assistant would quickly search the document and respond to the user.</p> Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?<a title="Direct link to Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?">​</a> <p>Anthony used the following Web5 technologies to build Netonomy:</p>  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> - The app generates a DID to identify you when you first launch it. This is stored in the browser and acts as your identity.  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a> - A DWN is created in the browser to store your data encrypted securely. Anthony uses it to store uploaded files.   Future plans<a title="Direct link to Future plans">​</a> <p>There are many cool features Anthony wants to explore next, including:</p>  Decentralized vector databases - When you upload files like PDFs, the content is extracted and indexed in a vector database. Vectors allow data developers to embed data for meaning and quickly queried. The vector database is centralized, for now, hosted by Anthony. But he wants to eventually decentralize it by storing vectors directly in the DWN   Data sharing - Via protocols to share files with other DID owners  Payments - Integrate Bitcoin and blockchain payments  Contacts directory - Manage contacts via DIDs  Messages - Decentralized messaging between DWNs  Mobile app - Bundle DWN in a mobile app for access across devices   Check it out!<a title="Direct link to Check it out!">​</a> <p>To accelerate development, Anthony plans to open-source the project and invite community contributions. You can check out <a href="https://github.com/Netonomy/netonomy">Netonomy on GitHub</a>. </p> Rewatch the full episode<a title="Direct link to Rewatch the full episode">​</a> <p>Learn more about what he's building and watch the full live stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ9Vq_Moa8I">here</a>.</p>

  <p>The side effects of (re)generative AI impacting cyber security</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The polarizing public discussion about ChatGPT and its siblings and the smokescreens of those responsible for technology and business behind the brands obscure a differentiated view on the non-obvious side effects of a completely overheated Chatbot rally. This makes it difficult to seriously address the partially mutually dependent side effects of the large-scale public use of this technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employers in particular are torn between giving in to the tempting benefits of this technology while, at the same time, they have to live up to their responsibility towards the law, regulations such as ESG, their organizations and their digital assets, the society and the duty of care towards their employees. All of that without missing a beat of innovation in that field.</p>

<p>In today’s hyper-competitive digital landscape, the rapid development of new digital services is essential for staying ahead of the curve. However, many organizations face significant challenges when it comes to integrating their core systems, including Mainframe applications, with modern technologies. This integration is crucial for modernizing core enterprise applications on hybrid cloud platforms. Shockingly, a staggering 33% of developers lack the necessary skills or resources, hindering their productivity in delivering products and services. Moreover, 36% of developers struggle with the collaboration between development and IT Operations, leading to inefficiencies in the development pipeline. To compound these issues, repeated surveys highlight “testing” as the primary area causing delays in project timelines. Companies like State Farm and BNP Paribas are taking steps to standardize development tools and approaches across their platforms to overcome these challenges and drive transformation in their business processes.</p>



 How does Wazi as Service help drive modernization? 







<p>One solution that is making waves in this landscape is “Wazi as a Service.” This cloud-native development and testing environment for z/OS applications is revolutionizing the modernization process by enabling secure DevSecOps practices. With flexible consumption-based pricing, it provides on-demand access to z/OS systems, dramatically improving developer productivity by accelerating release cycles on secure, regulated hybrid cloud environments like IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services (FS Cloud). Shift-left coding practices allow testing to begin as early as the code-writing stage, enhancing software quality. The platform can be automated through a standardized framework validated for Financial Services, leveraging the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center service (SCC). Innovating at scale is made possible with IBM Z modernization tools like Wazi Image Builder, Wazi Dev Spaces on OpenShift, CI/CD pipelines, z/OS Connect for APIs, zDIH for data integrations, and IBM Watson for generative AI.</p>



 What are the benefits of Wazi as a service on IBM Cloud? 



<p>Wazi as a Service operates on IBM LinuxONE, an enterprise-grade Linux server, providing a substantial speed advantage over emulated x86 machine environments. This unique feature makes it 15 times faster, ensuring swift and efficient application development. Furthermore, Wazi bridges the gap between developer experiences on distributed and mainframe platforms, facilitating the development of hybrid applications containing z/OS components. It combines the power of the z-Mod stack with secure DevOps practices, creating a seamless and efficient development process. The service also allows for easy scalability through automation, reducing support and maintenance overhead, and can be securely deployed on IBM FS Cloud, which comes with integrated security and compliance features. This means developers can build and deploy their environments and code with industry-grade regulations in mind, ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Additionally, Wazi VSI on VPC infrastructure within IBM FS Cloud establishes an isolated network, fortifying the cloud infrastructure’s perimeter against security threats. Furthermore, IBM Cloud services and ISVs validated for financial services come with robust security and compliance controls, enabling secure integration of on-prem core Mainframe applications with cloud services like API Connect, Event Streams, Code Engine, and HPCS encryptions.

<p>Over the last decade, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/solid-state-drives">solid-state drives (SSDs)</a> have become the top choice for many compute environments because of their better read/write speeds and lack of moving parts when compared to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/hard-disk-drive-vs-solid-state-drive/">hard disk drives (HDDs)</a>. However, with many options to choose from, finding the right fit for your needs can be challenging.</p>



<p>In this post, we’re going to look at one of the most widely used types of SSD, the M.2, and the most popular (and fastest) protocol available for connecting SSDs to motherboards, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/nvme">non-volatile memory express (NVMe)</a>.</p>



<p>While the terms M.2 and NVMe are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to different technologies that can be used together or separately. Simply put:</p>



 
 NVMe is a storage and transfer protocol specifically designed for high-performance, non-volatile storage media. 



 M.2 is an SSD form factor that enables high-performance storage. 
 



<p>M.2 SSDs connected using the NVMe interface deliver some of the fastest data transfer speeds available.</p>



 What is a solid-state drive (SSD)? 



<p>SSDs are a type of semiconductor-based storage device that relies on flash memory to store data in a computer. Unlike magnetic storage—such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy drives that store data using magnets—SSDs use NAND technology, a type of non-volatile storage that doesn’t require power to maintain its data. In an SSD, each memory chip is constructed of blocks containing memory cells (also known as pages or sectors) that each have bits of memory. Whereas hard drives have inherent latency and access time because of platters and the movement of read/write heads, SSDs have no moving parts, making them much faster.</p>



 What is NVMe? 



<p>NVMe (non-volatile memory express) is a protocol for data transfer with reduced system overheads per input/output per second (I/O, or IOPS) that is used in SSDs and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/flash-storage">flash storage</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US49243923">2023 International Data Corporation (IDC) report</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), NVMe was designed to speed data transfer to systems connected via a PCI express, a serial expansion bus that’s standard for connecting a computer to one or more peripheral devices. Unlike its predecessor, Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA), NVMe was built for high-performance, non-volatile storage media, making it an excellent choice for both consumer and enterprise workloads.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/nvme-vs-sata">For a full comparison of NVMe and SATA, read “NVMe vs. SATA: What’s the difference?”</a>



<p>NVMe can be used at the enterprise level with a smaller infrastructure footprint and using less power than the popular Small Computer System Interface (SCSI). NVMe SSDs can deliver better response times than HDDs because of improvements to their drivers, allowing for parallelism and polling and helping reduce latency to avoid CPU bottlenecks.</p>



<p>In 2011, NVMe storage technology was introduced as an alternative to SATA and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) protocols, which had been the industry standard for several years. In addition to improvements in storage and technology over its predecessors, NVMe contributed to the development of important technologies that were being developed at the same time, including the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus 



<p>One of the most important differentiators of NVMe SSDs is the way it accesses flash storage. By using a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus, it removes the “middleman” controller, greatly reducing latency. However, NVMe’s can also run on any type of “fabric” interconnect—such as Fibre Channel and Ethernet—and within Ethernet, iWarp, RoCEv2, iSER and NVMe-TCP.</p>



<p>PCIe Gen4 is the latest PCI Express specification, and its data transfer rate is double Gen3’s. While Gen3 PCIe’s have a transfer rate of 8 giga transfers per second, (GT/s) per PCIe lane, Gen4’s rate is 16 GT/s, or two GB/s per PCIe lane.</p>



 Parallel command queues 



<p>Unlike drives using SCSI protocol, which can only deploy a single command queue, NVMe SSDs can run tens of thousands of parallel command queues at once. With NVMe SSDs, the connection method is independent of the protocol. For example, NVMe PCIe connectors can access a single drive via a PCIe link running the NVMe protocol.</p>



 What is an M.2 SSD? 



<p>M.2 drives (or Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF) drives) are a kind of SSD that connects to a computer’s motherboard via an M.2 interface. M.2 drives are extremely power efficient compared to other kinds of SSDs and take up less space. Additionally, they don’t require cables of any kind to connect, and they are both smaller and faster than the widely used, 2.5-inch SSDs.</p>



<p>Despite their relatively small size, M.2 drives still hold just as much data as their peers (up to 8 terabytes, or TBs) and typically run faster. They’re easy to install and compatible with any motherboard that has an M.2 slot. Even if your motherboard doesn’t have an M.2 port, an M.2 drive can still be connected using an adapter card that fits a PCIe slot.</p>



 SATA M.2 SSDs 



<p>SATA drives are becoming an increasingly popular form factor due to their compatibility with older technologies. While NVMe SSDs still have more bandwidth, many older computers don’t support either NVMe or PCIe technology, making an M.2 SATA interface the best option.</p>



<p>SATA SSDs can achieve a maximum data transfer speed of 6 gigabytes per second (Gbps), which is slower than other, newer interfaces. Strictly in terms of performance, SATA M.2 is the lowest-grade type of SSD on the market. But the technology is still considerably faster than an HDD, with three or even four times the bandwidth. Additionally, SATA M.2 SSDs are more affordable than NVME SSDs, and for motherboards that don’t have room for a 2.5-inch drive, SATA M.2 is a great alternative.</p>



 M.2 NVMe SSDs 



<p>NVMe technology is characterized by high bandwidth and fast data transfer speeds. Top-performing NVMe drives exceed 3,000 megabytes per second (MB/s), and some of the newer models can reach up to 7,500 MB/s. NVMe M.2 SSDs provide the fastest data transfer speeds on the market, by far. Another attractive feature of NVMe technology is right there in its name: Non-volatile memory. This specification means that power is not required for an NVMe device to retain its data.</p>



<p>Unlike other technologies, NVMe M.2 SSDs connect directly to a computer’s CPU using a PCIe socket. This feature enables the drive’s flash memory to function through PCIe as opposed to a SATA driver operating at a considerably slower speed. Through the PCIe bus, an NVMe M.2 SSD drive can achieve a transfer speed of a whopping 20 Gbps, more than three times that of a SATA M.2.</p>



 Which kind of SSD is right for you? 



<p>Users who are new to these technologies may find themselves asking which is better—NVMe or M.2?The reality is that there really is no comparison. They’re different technologies and you don’t need to choose between them because you can have both. When choosing a storage drive, an NVMe M.2 SSD is one of the fastest and easy-to-install drives available.</p>



<p>However, there are many factors to consider besides speed and performance when purchasing a drive. To streamline the process, we’ve compared the most popular technologies using four critical factors: Price, technical specifications, storage capacity and speed.</p>



 
 Price: Until recently, SATA M.2 SSDs were comparably cheaper than NVMe M.2s, making them an attractive option for budget-minded users. However, with the price of NVMe M.2s dropping every year, price isn’t as important a factor as it used to be. As of the writing of this article, a Samsung NVMe and a Samsung SATA M.2 SSD with storage capacities of either one or two TB ranged from between USD 64 and 130 on Amazon. 



 Technical specs: This is where the difference between the two technologies really begins to stand out. Some older devices simply won’t support NVMe technology, making a SATA M.2 the best choice. Also, before purchasing an NVMe drive, users will want to check the compatibility of their system and make sure it has enough PCIe connections to support multiple devices. 



 Storage capacity: NVMe and SATA M.2 drives are typically offered in either 1TB or 2TB options. Users looking for something larger can upgrade to 4TB and 8TB models at a considerably higher price point. At the time of writing, 4TB M.2’s of both the NVMe and SATA variety were going for between USD 200 and 300 on Amazon, and their 8TB SSD counterparts were closer to USD 400. &nbsp; 



 Speed: NVMe M.2 SSDs high-performance, high-throughput and high-speed data transfer capabilities are key differentiators in the market. NVMe technology leverages the PCIe interface, allowing it to connect straight into the CPU and the SSD. This helps lower latency and improve system responsiveness. Depending on your needs, however, you might not require the lightning-fast speeds an NVMe M.2 SSD provides, in which case a SATA M.2 SSD is a slightly cheaper option. While not as fast as NVMe SSDs, SATA drives are still considerably faster than any HDD. If you’re a gamer or using your PC for office applications, a SATA M.2 SSD is probably fine.&nbsp; 
 



 NVMe and M.2 use cases 



<p>At this point, we’ve established that NVMe and M.2 aren’t competing technologies—instead, they can actually complement each other. For business needs at the enterprise level, the benefits of using NVMe are simply impossible to ignore. M.2 SSDs certainly have plenty of enterprise use cases, but they are also widely popular among consumers looking to upgrade a laptop or PC. Here are some of the most popular use cases for both technologies:</p>



 
 High-performance computing: NVMe has the speed and storage capacity necessary to handle parallel processing, one of the key requirements of demanding applications like as high-frequency financial trading, AI and ML. 



 Demanding applications: Apps featuring real-time customer interactions and fast access to large volumes of data often rely on NVMe technology to run their workloads. Examples include e-commerce, personal finance and many <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> apps. 



 Data centers: NVMe M.2 SSDs help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> expand their storage capabilities and still deliver lightning-fast speeds. According to <a href="https://research.esg-global.com/reportaction/DataInfrastructureTrends2021/Toc">a recent report from Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG)</a>, nearly three-quarters of businesses already use NVMe SSD storage or are planning to acquire it in the next year. 



 Video and graphics editing: Many video editors use NVMe M.2 SSDs to expand their storage and still get the high processing speeds their applications require. What’s more, the slim, small profile of at portable NVMe M.2 makes them ideal for lightweight computers like laptops, notebooks and ultrabooks for editors on the go. 



 Gaming: Many serious gamers have come to depend on the fast load times that NVMe M.2 SSDs provide. An affordable, easy-to-install upgrade, NVMe SSDs deliver a smooth gaming experience and enhance day-to-day PC usage for a variety of other applications as well. 
 



 NVMe and M.2 solutions 



<p>NVMe technology paired with the M.2 form factor helps consumers and enterprises achieve the fastest data transfer speeds on the market. For gaming enthusiasts, video editors and other users looking to upgrade their PC storage and transfer capabilities, NVMe M.2 SSDs make an attractive option.</p>



<p>At the enterprise level, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/flashsystem-5200">IBM Storage FlashSystem 5200</a> provides compact, powerful storage along with all the benefits of NVMe technology. The 5200 helps enterprises achieve greater speed, performance and scalability from their data storage solution.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 31st October to 13th&nbsp;November <p>Welcome to our latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Turkey’s planned crypto regulations aimed at exiting the FATF grey list, the UK’s focus on stablecoins, New York’s task force on digital currencies, and the SEC’s call for clearer crypto rules. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Emerging Global Trends in Crypto Regulation <p>The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation is undergoing significant changes worldwide, with countries and regulatory bodies adapting to the evolving digital asset&nbsp;market.</p><p>Turkey’s Regulatory Push: Turkey is moving towards introducing new legislation for crypto-assets. This step is aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. The nation’s goal is to exit the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list,” indicating its commitment to addressing strategic deficiencies in its financial systems.</p><p>UK’s Stablecoin Focus: In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England are seeking public feedback on their approach to regulating stablecoins. They aim to balance the potential benefits of stablecoins for faster, cheaper payments with the need to protect consumers and maintain financial stability.</p><a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1722289568563531909?s=20">Image Source</a><p>New York’s Exploratory Task Force: New York is proposing a task force to study the impacts of digital currency and blockchain industries. This initiative aims to guide the state in addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities presented by these emerging technologies.</p><p>SEC’s Call for Clearer Crypto Rules: At the SEC Regulation Outside the United States conference, Commissioner Mart Uyeda stressed the importance of providing definitive rules and guidance for the cryptocurrency market rather than relying solely on enforcement actions. This stance highlights the ongoing debate over the classification and regulation of digital assets as securities.</p><p>These developments signify a global trend towards more structured and comprehensive cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. As nations and regulatory bodies navigate this complex and dynamic field, the focus should remain on ensuring consumer protection, market integrity, and fostering responsible innovation within the digital asset ecosystem.</p> Turkish Government Proposes New Crypto Laws to Address FATF Compliance Gaps <p>Turkey is on a mission to revamp its stance on cryptocurrency regulation in a bid to shake off the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list” label, a designation underscoring the country’s previous shortcomings in anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) practices.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of addressing these critical areas, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has announced imminent legislative proposals targeting the crypto sector, marking a significant step towards aligning with 39 of the 40 FATF standards.</p> Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>Turkey’s push to strengthen AML and CTF regulations in the crypto sector could greatly enhance investor confidence, making the market safer and more attractive for investment. Additionally, aligning with FATF standards may ease Turkey’s integration into the global crypto economy, allowing for smoother international crypto transactions and partnerships.</p><p>On the flip side, the upcoming legislative changes could also bring a wave of uncertainty for crypto businesses operating in Turkey, as the specifics remain unclear. This could create challenges in compliance and strategic planning. Furthermore, the new laws might impose rigorous compliance requirements on crypto entities, potentially stifling innovation and adding to operational costs.</p><p>Overall, as Turkey advances toward legal reform, the global financial and crypto communities remain watchful. The outcome of these regulations will not only influence Turkey’s financial standing but also set a precedent for how emerging markets should navigate the intricate balance between innovation and regulatory compliance in the digital asset&nbsp;space.</p> New York State Senate Pushes for Crypto Task&nbsp;Force <p>In a significant move, New York State Senate Banking Committee Chair James Sanders is advocating for a proactive approach towards digital currency, cryptocurrency, and blockchain industries. Sanders proposes a 16-member task force, appointed by the governor and the Legislature, to comprehensively study these sectors. This includes examining their impacts on state tax revenues, energy consumption, and the environmental implications of digital&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Mike Lomas of the Financial Guys supports minimal regulation in general but suggests more oversight in the crypto sphere, especially for currencies not traded on public exchanges. Drawing parallels with the dot-com bubble, Lomas advocates for federal rather than state-level regulation, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding investments and banking stability.</p> Positive Aspects: <p>New York’s approach, characterized by forward-thinking, can catalyze enhanced comprehension and regulation of digital currencies. This initiative positions New York potentially as a frontrunner in the evolving crypto industry. With its balanced perspective, the Task Force strives to marry regulatory needs with the acknowledgment of the burgeoning industry’s potential, thereby nurturing responsible growth within this&nbsp;domain.</p> Negative Aspects: <p>However, the path toward new regulations may breed uncertainty among crypto businesses and investors. This could translate into a temporary deceleration in market dynamics within New York. Additionally, there lies a risk of potential overregulation.</p><p>An overly cautious regulatory approach could echo the apprehensions reminiscent of the dot-com era, inadvertently stifling innovation in the crypto sector. Such a scenario might prompt crypto businesses to migrate to jurisdictions with more accommodating regulatory landscapes.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/five-must-have-attributes-for-your-travel-rule-solution">Five Must-Have Attributes for Your Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/decoding-fatf-travel-rule-solution-pricing-your-ultimate-guide-to-compliance-costs">Decoding FATF Travel Rule Solution Pricing: Your Ultimate Guide to Compliance Costs</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, legacy applications often stand as barriers to progress. These existing systems, characterized by outdated technology and architecture can hinder an organization’s ability to keep up with changing business needs and pose significant security and operational risks. Staying competitive is essential in today’s fast-paced business industry—this is where legacy application modernization comes into play.</p>



<p>In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the intricacies of software modernization, its profound importance, strategies for successful implementation, potential challenges and the integration of new technologies.&nbsp;</p>



 Understanding legacy applications&nbsp; 



<p>Legacy applications, in the context of information technology, refer to systems that have been in use for an extended period and typically exhibit the following characteristics:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Outdated technology: Legacy applications often rely on outdated technology, which means they were built using older tools and systems. These outdated technologies can make them incompatible with modern standards and best practices.&nbsp; 



 Inefficient performance: These systems might suffer from inefficiencies and slow response times that hinder productivity.&nbsp; 



 Security vulnerabilities: Due to outdated security measures and lack of updates, legacy applications are more susceptible to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> threats.&nbsp; 



 High maintenance costs: The need for ongoing maintenance and support for legacy applications can result in escalating costs over time.&nbsp; 



 Limited scalability: Scaling these systems to accommodate growing demands can be challenging and costly.&nbsp; 



 Poor adaptability: Legacy applications might not easily adapt to changing business requirements, making them ill-suited for modern, dynamic organizations. This is one of the main issues with legacy applications. They are often built on legacy code, which can be poorly written and annotated. This results in knowledge silos, which can be a huge strain on an organization when employees move on. Their successors may find it very hard to understand the code that’s been written, blocking the progress to making changes.&nbsp; 
 



 Approaching legacy system modernization 



<p>Legacy system modernization is the process of upgrading or transforming outdated, often monolithic and inefficient legacy systems into more contemporary, efficient and adaptable solutions. Developing a solid app modernization strategy is key to success. This strategy helps guide you through the process of adopting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>, encapsulating legacy software and introducing modernization solutions. The goal is to create a new system that enhances business processes and improves customer experience.</p>



<p>Microservices are a crucial component of modernizing legacy applications. They involve breaking down large, monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable components or services. The practice of encapsulating or enclosing certain data or components within well-defined boundaries is essential to achieve better maintainability in software systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legacy application modernization is often approached as part of a broader <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> initiative. Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new business processes and customer experiences (or modify existing ones) to meet changing business and market requirements. It often involves the integration of digital technologies and customer-centric approaches to improve business operations and competitiveness. Improving business value often involves enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing competitiveness.</p>



 Benefits of modernizing legacy systems&nbsp; 



<p>Modernization is not necessarily about replacing these applications entirely, but rather about revitalizing them to meet contemporary needs and standards. Modernizing legacy applications offers a multitude of advantages for organizations seeking to remain competitive and efficient:</p>



 
 Improved performance and efficiency: Modernization can significantly enhance the performance and operational efficiency of legacy applications, resulting in quicker response times and improved user experience.&nbsp; 



 Enhanced security and compliance: Upgrading security measures and ensuring compliance with industry standards are integral components of modernization. Doing so helps reduce the risk of security breaches and avoid costly compliance issues. &nbsp; 



 Better user interface and experience (UI/UX): Modernization often involves revamping the user interface and user experience, contributing to increased customer and employee satisfaction.&nbsp; 



 Cost savings: Through modernization, organizations can reduce maintenance costs, optimize hosting and better leverage a global workforce, leading to substantial cost savings in the long run. For example, a retail company that has been using a legacy inventory management system for several years is less cost-efficient. This system is outdated, slow and requires constant maintenance to keep it running smoothly. Modernization would reduce maintenance costs and improve employee productivity by speeding up the process.&nbsp; 
 



 Application modernization strategy: Assessment and planning 



<p>The journey to modernization begins with a comprehensive assessment of your organization’s applications and systems. This assessment aims to evaluate the current state, strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement. After a thorough assessment, the next crucial step is to develop a clear modernization strategy aligned with your business goals and objectives. A well-crafted modernization strategy ensures that the efforts are focused, cost-effective and designed to yield the desired outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the assessment and planning phase, consider various modernization approaches. The IBM topic page addressing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a> highlights the following:</p>



<p>“The most important way to start any application modernization project is with an application assessment. Taking an inventory of what you have is almost always one of the most obvious ways to start a transformation like this. Once you have a list, you can start plotting all of those applications against an x and y axis of ease/difficulty and potential increased value if modernized.”&nbsp;</p>



 Five key modernization strategies&nbsp; 



<p>Modernizing legacy applications can take various forms, depending on the specific needs and circumstances of your organization. The choice of strategy depends on factors like the current state of the application, budget constraints and the desired outcome. Some common strategies include the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Rehosting: Rehosting involves migrating legacy applications to a new environment with minimal changes to the existing code and functionality. It’s a suitable choice when a quick transition is required, but it may not leverage the full potential of modernization. Understanding the code structure is essential in understanding the organization and arrangement of source code in a software application. 



 Refactoring: Refactoring is the process of restructuring and optimizing existing code to improve its performance and maintainability without altering its core functionality. This strategy can be effective for enhancing an application’s efficiency. 



 Replatforming: Replatforming entails moving legacy applications to a different platform or infrastructure. This can lead to performance improvements and scalability, but it involves some level of code adaptation. 



 Re-architecting: Re-architecting involves a comprehensive redesign of the application’s architecture to meet modern standards. It often requires a phased approach, effectively managing the process while addressing architectural issues. 



 Full replacement: In cases where legacy systems are too outdated, a full replacement may be necessary. While this strategy provides a fresh start, it comes with the challenge of potential disruptions during the transition.&nbsp; 
 



 Potential challenges and solutions 



<p>Modernization journeys will vary organization to organization, but there are a few very common aspects that many modernization efforts must address.</p>



 Technical debt 



<p>Modernizing legacy apps can be a complex undertaking, often hindered by technical debt. Technical debt is a metaphor in software development that refers to the consequences of choosing a quick solution to a problem instead of a more comprehensive and responsible approach. Like financial debt, it represents a trade-off between short-term gains and long-term costs.</p>



<p>Technical debt occurs when software developers or teams make deliberate or unintentional decisions to take shortcuts or compromise code quality in the interest of meeting immediate development goals or deadlines. This is often because it can be time-consuming to effectively update system quality. These shortcuts can result in poor code quality or workarounds that don’t necessarily address the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root cause</a> of the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address technical debt, you can:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Prioritize reduction: Focus on reducing technical debt within legacy code by restructuring and refactoring to make it more maintainable and adaptable.&nbsp; 



 Transition to cloud-native systems: Moving toward <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> systems can enhance scalability and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that your applications are ready to meet future demands. You might also consider a broader <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">cloud migration</a> strategy (perhaps as part of a digital transformation effort) or a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> approach if on-premises solutions are still required.&nbsp; 



 Embrace a DevOps methodology: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> outlines a software development&nbsp;process and an organizational culture shift that speeds the delivery of higher quality software&nbsp;by automating and integrating the efforts of development and IT&nbsp;operations teams. With a DevOps practice, companies can be more agile and more proactive, taking insights into how their software systems are behaving in real-world scenarios into account as they consistently roll out software updates and new features to meet users’ needs. 
 



 Security&nbsp; 



<p>Security is a core consideration in modernization efforts. Modernization provides an opportunity to reinforce and update security measures. To ensure the security of modernized applications, integrate security early. Incorporate security measures from the beginning of the modernization process, making it a core component of the application’s architecture and design:</p>



 
 Conduct a risk assessment: Conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment to identify potential threats that may emerge during modernization. 



 Define requirements and expectations: Clearly define security requirements and expectations for the modernized application. This should cover areas such as data protection, access controls, encryption and regulatory compliance. 



 Ensure compliance: Lastly, ensure that modernized systems comply with relevant regulations and that there is a regular process in place that ensures compliance stays up to date. 
 



 Future-proofing 



<p>The planning aspect really can’t be stressed enough. Create a comprehensive roadmap that outlines how an organization intends to modernize its applications and maintain current moving into the future. It should include goals, methodologies, timelines and resources required for achieving modernization objectives.</p>



<p>To stay competitive and future-proof your modernized applications, consider the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Develop APIs: Create <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> to connect modernized systems with existing applications and the broader ecosystem. APIs are crucial for enabling the integration and interaction of various software systems, services, and platforms.&nbsp; 



 Use frameworks: Frameworks are pre-established sets of libraries, tools and conventions that provide a foundation for developing software applications. They help streamline development by offering ready-made solutions for common tasks. 



 Leverage modern technologies: Incorporate modern technologies like automation, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> and other new solutions. This can involve delivering modernized applications with new features and capabilities or even upgrading the entire system infrastructure when necessary. 
 



<p>Overall, it is important to update legacy applications to ensure business growth and to keep pace with the ever-changing business landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once your business has decided to switch to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</a> software system, the next step is to implement ERP. For a business to see the benefits of an ERP adoption it must first be deployed properly and efficiently by a team that typically includes a project manager and department managers as well.</p>



<p>This process can be complicated and feel overwhelming, depending on the needs of your organization. However, once new software is implemented successfully, organizations will ideally see the increases in productivity and cost savings benefits an ERP system can bring to your business. The switch to an ERP system can streamline your business needs and be beneficial to both the end user and entire organization.</p>



 Steps to implement ERP&nbsp; 



<p>Below is a breakdown of a step-by-step ERP implementation plan. We’ll start by going through what organizations should do prior to choosing an ERP system and then dive into best practices for implementation success.</p>



 1. Discover and plan to implement ERP 



<p>Before the ERP implementation process can occur, an organization must assess how its current systems are functioning. This is the first step to a successful enterprise resource planning integration and must be completed prior to choosing an ERP software.</p>



<p>In the first step of this implementation methodology, an organization must review the current system and processes to get a full picture of how the business is working and where there might be pitfalls. In this step, an ERP implementation project team should also be established for decision-making purposes. Areas to assess can include, financial, manufacturing, inventory, sales and more. This step will also be important to understand gaps and current issues, such as process inefficiencies and potential requirements for the ERP system.</p>



<p>Once the review of the organization’s current system, workflow, and everyday functions are assessed it’s time to select the right ERP system that meets your business requirements, such as budget forecasting and pricing. An ERP software can be acquired in this first step if the requirements have been well-defined. These requirements will depend on if an organization uses ERP system on-premises or in the cloud ERP.</p>



<p>A change to a modern ERP system can be very straight forward if there is a clear roadmap and project plan for your ERP deployment. A clear and honest conversation with employees will ensure organizational buy in.</p>



 Questions to ask as you define the scope of your organization’s needs: 



 
 What business functions will be automated by the ERP software? 



 What are the ERP system’s specific data requirements and is it compatible? 



 Which key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be tracked? 



 Is the software scalable and flexible enough to evolve with the organization’s needs? 



 What is the timeframe for implementation and deployment? 
 



 2.&nbsp;Create a design and prepare to implement 



<p>At this point you’ve chosen the ERP system for your business. The next step is the design phase. This is the step to configure the ERP software solution so it fits your organization’s specific needs.</p>



<p>A new design requires <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/organizational-change">change management</a> to make more efficient workflows, along with the potential need for new business processes that are a better fit with the soon-to-be implemented ERP system. It’s important to have a team within the organization dedicated to this design step and determining an appropriate plan.</p>



 Steps to configure the ERP system: 



 
 Create an organizational structure by defining all the necessary aspects of your business, such as the chart of accounts, cost centers and business units. 



 Customize your ERP software so that it aligns with the existing workflows in place and set up the modules you think your organization will need, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM), human resources and supply chain management. 



 Set the parameters for user roles and permissions so that you can control everyone’s access across the system and make sure data controls are put in place. 



 Integrate ERP software with other existing systems within your organization like accounting software, inventory management and e-commerce platforms if they apply. 
 



 3.&nbsp;Migrate and development 



<p>Once the design requirements have been established, the development phase can begin. This involves the customization of the software so that the redesign can occur. The development, or preparation, stage is vital and can be a daunting task; but if done properly, it could help your ERP system function for the long-term.</p>



<p>You have established a redesign, now it’s time to clean and format the current system’s data so that it’s compatible with the new system. In this step, an organization will need to assess and prepare all existing data into a compatible format that fits your new ERP software. Once loaded into the new system and formatted correctly, your first ERP test can be performed. In this step you should also monitor and note the key metrics of your business operation, including any disruptions.</p>



 Ways to plan and prepare your data for migration: 



 
 Complete a data audit of all existing legacy systems and applications to have a clear picture going into the data migration. 



 Categorize the types of data you need to migrate and identify any redundancy by combing through the data and cleaning for accuracy. 



 Define what data transfer method you want to use and test it to be sure it is the right migration process. 



 Make a backup plan and a recovery plan in case errors occur or data is lost. 



 Create a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">data governance</a> policy and put protocols in place. 
 



 4.&nbsp;Test the ERP system 



<p>All the preemptive steps have been taken and now it’s time to do some system testing before you go-live. In this stage, development might still occur and that is normal. The testing of one ERP module may occur and fixes or adjustments might need to be made, while other modules are being tested simultaneously. Team members should be put through user training and key stakeholders should be involved in this testing process as well.</p>



<p>It is vital to test the entire system and ensure its functioning properly and running data accurately. This is the most important phase because it will ensure all system applications and processes are running as they should before the ERP software is officially up and running.</p>



 Things to remember during the testing phase: 



 
 Keep track of user acceptance criteria and document the information. 



 Test the system for functionality from start to finish and validate all migrated data for accuracy purposes. 



 Check for user accessibility by conducting reviews and reviewing feedback. 



 Conduct all necessary tests prior to deploying the ERP software, such as testing automation processes, workflows and system security. 



 Ensure the ERP system is compatible with the other existing systems and applications in place. 



 Make sure all employees are trained on the system; consider implementing ERP software in stages before going company-wide. 
 



 5.&nbsp;Deliver a successfully implemented ERP system 



<p>If the steps above have all been taken, then great news, your organization is ready to launch its new ERP system. Assuming all employees have been properly trained on the software, it’s now time to roll out the new ERP solution.</p>



<p>The project team that started the implementation process should be at the ready in case employees are confused or other potential issues arise. Be prepared for issues and have contingency plans in place if there is a serious malfunction. All ERP modules can be deployed concurrently but can be done in stages as well. Some organizations might choose to prioritize certain modules and add others as they go, which is completely normal.</p>



<p>No two organizations are alike and deploying an ERP software can differ greatly but remember to make the ERP solution accessible to all employees and make sure automated processes are activated.</p>



 What to look for once implementation occurs: 



 
 Is the data accurate and functioning properly? 



 Do all users have real-time accessibility without issue? 



 Are security protocols in place and functioning? 



 Is the workflow in place and processing as it should? 
 



 6. Manage your ERP solution 



<p>Now, assuming the implementation is complete, it’s important to create a protocol for ongoing maintenance for your ERP system. Your organization should be performing regular maintenance checks and upgrading software periodically. Creating a team or having a professional in place to maintain the health of your ERP system is key to the longevity of the solution.</p>



<p>The ERP vendor you select should be available for any questions and ongoing maintenance or updates needed. Best practices for this implementation process should include a well-managed team and strong communication between the organization, its employees and key stakeholders to ensure the ERP solution is working effectively and efficiently.</p>



 Best practices for managing your new ERP system: 



 
 Listen to user and client feedback often. 



 On-premises ERP systems will require periodic software updates and sometimes hardware updates as well, while cloud-based ERP will update automatically. 



 Create standard operating procedures (SOP) to ensure common issues can be addressed quickly.

<p>PCI DSS version 4.0 is the latest iteration of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, released on March 31, 2022, and is currently in effect. The previous version, PCI DSS version 3.2.1, will remain active until March 31, 2024, to give organizations time to adopt the latest version of the standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is an information security standard designed to reduce payment card fraud by increasing security controls around cardholder data. The standard was created in 2004 by five major credit card companies: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, JCB, and American Express. The primary goal of PCI DSS is to safeguard and optimize the security of sensitive cardholder data, such as credit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.</p>
<p>The standard’s security controls help businesses minimize the risk of data breaches, fraud, and identity theft. Compliance with PCI DSS also ensures that businesses adhere to industry best practices when processing, storing, and transmitting credit card data. The standard applies to all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. The standard is not a law but is enforced through contracts between merchants, acquiring banks that process payment card transactions, and the payment brands.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of the PCI DSS – version 4.0 – was released at the end of March 2022. The standard provides specific, actionable guidance on protecting payment card data, which can be applied to organizations of any size or type that use any method of processing or storing data.</p>
<p>Let’s review some of the key differences between PCI DSS version 4.0 and the previous version:</p>
 
 Compensating Controls: PCI DSS 4.0 replaces the concept of compensating controls with customized implementations, which provides organizations greater flexibility in how they meet the standards. 
 Security Needs: PCI DSS 4.0 aims to address developing threats and technologies, facilitate more effective ways to combat new threats to cardholder information, boost payment flexibility, and improve business procedures to meet security needs. 
 Continuous Security Processes: PCI DSS 4.0 focuses more on maintaining continuous security processes. 
 Validation Methods and Procedures: PCI DSS 4.0 enhances validation methods and procedures. 
 Flexibility: PCI DSS 4.0 adds flexibility and support for alternative approaches to achieve security. 
 
<p>PCI DSS version 4.0 addresses emerging threats and technologies by focusing on four core goals:</p>
 
 Ensuring that the standard meets the security needs of an evolving payment industry. 
 Promoting continuous security processes. 
 Enhancing validation methods and procedures. 
 Adding flexibility and support for alternative approaches to achieve security. 
 
<p>To achieve these goals, PCI DSS 4.0 introduces new requirements and modifies existing ones to address potential vulnerabilities and reinforce the security posture of organizations. Some of the changes include:</p>
 
 Detection and protection against phishing attacks. 
 More stringent password requirements. 
 Multi-factor authentication. 
 All vendor and third-party accounts must only be used when needed and continuously monitored for vulnerabilities and security risks. 
 
<p>PCI DSS 4.0 also places greater emphasis on security results, giving businesses greater flexibility to select the security technologies and methods that are suitable for their particular environment. The standard aims to continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of the payment card industry and the new technologies being implemented daily.</p>
<p>1Kosmos can help you meet these new requirements specifically, the MFA and password requirements PCI DSS 4.0 requires. The new and more stringent authentication requirements are designed to improve the security of cardholder data by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access systems and networks.</p>
<p>The following are the key authentication requirements for PCI DSS 4.0:</p>
 
 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all remote access to the cardholder data environment (CDE), as well as for all non-console administrative access to the CDE from within the entity’s network. MFA is also required for all access to the CDE from cloud-based or hosted systems. 
 Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be reset every 90 days and cannot be reused. 
 Account lockout must be implemented to prevent brute-force attacks. After a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users must be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means. 
 Strong authentication mechanisms must be used for all privileged accounts. This includes using MFA and/or complex passwords. 
 
<p>The approach we follow here at 1Kosmos ensures organizations can meet these requirements out of the box. Our elegant self-service KYC workflow is an innovative identity proofing and authentication solution designed to remove friction during onboarding to accelerate customer acquisition. We then give those customers a convenient digital wallet that eliminates account takeover and financial fraud and matches the authentication method to the risk associated with the activity.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos organizations will authenticate users via any of our methods depending on the business need, the risk profile of the activity, and the security requirement for each access request. These methods include:&nbsp; a phishing-proof real biometric – LiveID and device biometrics plus, push message, email/SMS/Token, 3rd party hardware token, Windows Hello, and Mac TouchID.</p>
<p>All user data is encrypted, and (for the highest level of security) stored in a distributed ledger compliant to the W3C DID standard. As such, they are accessible only via a FIDO2 certified public/private key pair secured in the TPM/Secure Enclave of a device and under sole control of the user, typically via their live biometric selfie, made possible by our innovative LiveID feature. The distributed ledger also provides immutable audit logs to prove every transaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Semiconductors act as the secret powerhouse behind various industries, from healthcare to manufacturing to financial services. In the last few years alone, we’ve seen how essential semiconductors can be and why companies need to develop this technology rapidly to maximize productivity. As semiconductor manufacturers strive to keep up with customer expectations, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/leveraging-ibm-cloud-for-electronic-design-automation-eda-workloads/">electronic design automation (EDA)</a> tools are the keys to unlocking the solution. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, to truly drive innovation at scale, EDA leaders need massive computing power. As the need to manage compute-intensive workloads with high levels of resiliency and performance grows, now is the time to turn to the cloud for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hpc">high-performance computing (HPC)</a>.</p>



<p>By taking advantage of solutions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">IBM Cloud® HPC</a>, organizations can more effectively manage their peak workloads while mitigating the risk of downtime. In the coming years, we expect having high levels of compute power will become even more crucial as more organizations turn to generative <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and large language models (LLM) to enhance productivity across the EDA space. This is where hybrid cloud HPC solutions can be especially valuable.</p>



 Cadence leverages IBM Cloud HPC 



<p><a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-03-Cadence-Leverages-IBM-Cloud-HPC-to-Accelerate-Electronic-Chip-and-System-Design-Software-Development">Cadence</a> is a global leader in EDA.

				  The Essence of Ecosystems 
<p>Ecosystems aren’t just about a collection of apps and platforms; they’re about the roles and activities within that ecosystem. Ecosystem governance dictates what’s encouraged, what’s allowed, and what’s forbidden. It’s the set of rules that govern how different players interact, collaborate, and contribute value to the ecosystem.</p>
 Beyond Platforms: Ecosystems vs. Platforms 
<p>Darrell made a clear distinction between ecosystems and platforms. While platforms may be a component of an ecosystem, they are not enough to define an ecosystem. Platforms primarily focus on technical interactions, such as how things work and data flow. However, ecosystems encompass a broader scope, including governance, compliance, liability, and more. The actual value of ecosystems lies in the business and governance aspects.</p>
 Minimum Viable Ecosystem vs. Minimum Viable Product 
<p>We often hear about Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) in the agile world. An MVP is a learning, exploring, and prototyping tool, but it’s not the final product. On the other hand, a Minimum Viable Ecosystem (MVE) is about delivering a real value proposition. It’s not about exploration but about having tangible value. MVEs aim to attract and align partners within the ecosystem to fulfill different roles and activities, as no single company can do it all.</p>
 Ecosystem Governance Frameworks 
<p>Ecosystems can be complex, and their governance is crucial. Darrell emphasized the importance of ecosystem governance frameworks, which help organizations understand where they fit, what value they add, and where opportunities lie. These frameworks also highlight gaps in the ecosystem that require new roles or partners to fill. Governance frameworks address compliance, liability, and other governance issues that drive value within ecosystems.</p>
 The Trust Continuum™: Tools for Ecosystem Governance 
<p>Darrell introduced the Trust Continuum™ Tools, a toolbox designed in-house to assist organizations in navigating the complexities of ecosystem governance. These tools are not only useful for governance but can also be applied in various scenarios:</p>
 
 Product and Platform Design 
 Product Strategy&nbsp; 
 Interoperability and Conformance Testing 
 
<p>These powerful resources will support your journey in building successful Minimum Viable Ecosystems and establishing effective Ecosystem Governance Frameworks. You can access the entire Trust Continuum™ Toolbox <a href="https://mailchi.mp/continuumloop/tctools">here</a>.</p>
 Influence over Control 
<p>The mantra of “Control only what you must, influence the rest” underscores the importance of understanding where strict governance is needed and where influence can lead to positive outcomes. By applying the Trust Continuum™ tools and principles, organizations can navigate the intricate world of ecosystems and drive value in this dynamic landscape.</p>
 <p>Control only what you must - influence the rest<br><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp3XwXg-Tgg&amp;text=Control%20only%20what%20you%20must%20-%20influence%20the%20rest&amp;via=continuumloop&amp;related=continuumloop">Click To Tweet</a><br></p> 
<p>Darrell’s presentation sheds light on the critical aspects of ecosystem governance and provides practical tools for organizations to navigate and excel in this complex arena. Ecosystems are the future of business, and understanding how to govern them effectively is essential for success. With the right knowledge and tools, organizations can unlock the power of ecosystems and thrive in the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>

<p>This blog will focus on the integration of IBM Cloud Code Engine and IBM Cloud Event Notifications along with IBM Cloud Secrets Manager to build a robust use case that will automate your certificate renewal process for applications in your code engine project. We will build a simple app using IBM Cloud Code Engine to update your secrets in a Code Engine Project.</p>



<p>The services which we will be using are:</p>



 
 IBM Cloud Code Engine 



 IBM Cloud Event Notifications 



 IBM Cloud Secrets Manager 
 



<p>It is not required to have a prerequisite knowledge on these services—although brief knowledge would be good. You can just follow the instructions and you will be able to build this sample application. All the code is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine/tree/main/app-n-event-notification">Github URL.</a> Before we continue let me give you a brief knowledge on these services.</p>



 What is IBM Cloud Code Engine? 



<p><a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-getting-started">IBM Cloud Code Engine</a> is a fully managed, serverless platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, microservices, event-driven functions, and batch jobs with run-to-completion characteristics. The Code Engine experience is designed so that you can focus on writing code and not on the infrastructure that is needed to host it.</p>



 What is IBM Cloud Event Notifications? 



<p><a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started">IBM Cloud Event Notifications</a> is a routing service that provides you about critical events that occur in your IBM Cloud account. You can filter and route event notifications from IBM Cloud services like IBM Cloud Monitoring, Security and Compliance Center, Secrets Manager, IBM Cloud Projects, and Toolchain to communication channels like email, webhook, slack, IBM Code Engine, et al.</p>



 What is IBM Cloud Secrets Manager? 



<p><a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-getting-started">IBM Cloud Secrets Manager</a> is a service where you can create, lease, and centrally manage secrets that are used in IBM Cloud services or your custom-built applications. Secrets are stored in a dedicated Secrets Manager instance, built on open source.</p>



 Embarking Journey with apps and certificates 



<p>Let’s say you have your Code Engine Application which has its own secret—TLS Certificate and Private Key. Generally, you would keep these secrets in something like a vault that would manage it. Assume that you store this secret in Secrets Manager. You will also store the same secret in your Code Engine Project where the App resides. So far, all good, your app will be able to use this secret and will be functional.</p>



<p>However, secrets can expire after a certain time period and therefore needs to be renewed. Everything was working fine until the secret expired, your app which uses this secret will be disrupted, thereby affecting your customers.</p>



<p>If you know about Secrets Manager, then you would be familiar that it can also rotate the secrets to new one automatically when they get expired. Let’s say you rotate the secrets in the Secrets Manager. Then what about your Code Engine Project? The secrets won’t be updated there, unless you manually do it. Let’s say you built another Code Engine Application which will retrieve the secrets from the Secrets Manager and update it in the project.</p>



<p>So far so good, but there is still one problem: How will your app know when to update the secret? Unless there was some way the app gets notified when the secrets were rotated in the Secrets Manager. In this scenario you can use Event Notifications to send notification to your app whenever the secret got rotated in the Secrets Manager. When the app gets notified, it can then do the update.</p>



<p>This is what we will do, we will use these different services and automate our secret renewal process. Therefore, you as a user do not have to manually update the secrets and preventing disruptions of your applications due to expired certificates</p>



 Let’s dive right in 



<p>Clone the repository <a href="https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine">https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine</a> and hop into the “app-n-event-notification” directory. You would have to create an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/app-connect/containers_cd?topic=servers-creating-cloud-api-key">API Key</a> in your IBM Cloud Account. You would have to insert the API Key in the script. You must log into the IBM Cloud and select the Code Engine Project you want to work on. After that execute the run script and this is what will be happen after execution.</p>



<p>The run script will:</p>



 
 Create an instance in the Secrets Manager and Event Notifications 



 Create a secret in the Secrets Manager 



 Build a Code Engine App (code is already provided) 



 Create same secret in the Code Engine Project 



 Create necessary sources, topics, destination etc., in Event Notifications 



 Bind all these components together 



 Rotate the secrets in Secrets Manager 



 At last, we will check the logs of the apps to verify if secret got updated in Code Engine Project 
 



 Delving deeper: Unraveling the process 



<p>Here is an architecture which will help you visualize the components we are working with.</p>







<p>When you execute the run script in the samples, it creates the Event Notifications Instance and Secrets Manager Instance of lite plan in your IBM Cloud Account. We create custom certificates using openssl commands and store in a temporary directory. A secret is created in the Secret Manager and is populated with this certificate and key. Necessary components like topics, sources, destinations, and subscriptions are created in the Event Notification Instance. A Code Engine application is built using local source code and a Code Engine secret is also created containing the same secret (certificate and key). Both the app and secret will reside in the same project selected. At last, we rotate the secret in the Secrets Manager with a new certificate.</p>



<p>When the secret is rotated, your Secrets Manager will act as a source and it will send a <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-event-notifications&amp;interface=ui#event-notifications-payload">notification payload</a> of json structure to Event Notification Topic. The Topic will have a filter which is configured in such a way that it will extract the notification data and check if that particular certificate was rotated. If and only if it that particular certificate was rotated, then it can pass through to the topic. There would be a destination created with the app URL. A subscription would be made between the topic and the destination. When the notification comes to the topic, the Event Notification will invoke the Code Engine Application by sending POST request to it with data being the notification payload. The App is configured in such a way that it will retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager and after that it will update the code engine secret with the retrieved secret.</p>



 A word of caution 



<p>As we have seen that Event Notification will invoke our application via sending POST request to it with the notification. But there is one caveat here, there is a response timeout from Event Notifications which is 60 seconds. To know more about it check the&nbsp;documentation of <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-codeengine#en-codengine-retry">retry policy</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put the app should scale up and process the response (i.e retrieve secret from Secrets Manager and update it in the project) within 60 seconds. If you consider executing a longer workload then you can use the Code Engine Job for the same. Refer to this&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-job-plan">documentation</a>&nbsp;to know more about Code Engine Jobs.</p>



 Goodbye 



<p>We learned and created an automation tool for certificate renewal. If you have your certificates from third-party vendors, then you can refer this <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-add-certificate-authority&amp;interface=ui">documentation</a> on how to connect third-party certificate authorities to Secrets Manager.</p>

  <p>We‘ve repeatedly emphasized the importance of multifactor authentication (MFA) and emphasized that not all MFA is equal – the Authenticator is much more secure than phone authentication (so hang up!). Through the implementation of number matching, we've successfully thwarted criminals engaging in MFA fatigue attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this has been very effective, attackers attempting these methods can still annoy users, and Authenticator prompts—while extremely helpful when a user is trying to log in—can provide a “hook” for social phishing when triggered by a hacker. In response to this, we took additional steps to keep users happy and secure by suppressing Authenticator pop-up notifications when a request is anomalous. The rollout of these changes was completed at the end of September, and we’ve successfully reduced the number of otherwise unworthy notifications. We've prevented more than 6 million passwordless and MFA notifications since the deployment began. By the vast majority, these were hacker-initiated notifications serving no value to customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Suppressing Risky Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the deployment of this feature, we now suppress Authenticator notifications when a request displays potential risks, such as when it originates from an unfamiliar location or is exhibiting other anomalies. This approach significantly reduces user inconvenience by eliminating irrelevant authentication prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When everything looks acceptable, users receive notifications on their mobile devices as depicted below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the event of a login request that looks risky to us, the standard notification will not be sent to the user. Instead, they’ll be given the following instructions: “Open your Authenticator app and enter the number shown to sign in,” with no corresponding notification displayed on the user's phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens their Authenticator app, it will present the request, allowing the user to take appropriate action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens the Authenticator App, the request will be available for the user:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Retrieving Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the notifications are not deleted. They’re simply suppressed and can still be accessed by the user within the Authenticator App. If a user encounters a genuine request from an unusual source, they can retrieve the notification by accessing their authenticator app. The app serves as a repository for all authenticator notifications, ensuring users have a convenient way to retrieve any missed requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation of this feature has led to a smoother and more secure experience for users. As technology evolves, enhancing user convenience while also enhancing security is crucial, and this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app">new approach</a> is a great example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FATF Travel Rule makes it mandatory for VASPs, including crypto exchanges, digital wallets, custodial services, etc., to exchange specific customer data when transacting crypto assets above a predefined threshold.</p><p>As more countries implement the Travel Rule, the onus is on VASPs to adopt solutions that adeptly manage detailed customer information exchanges — without slowing down transactions or infringing on user privacy. It’s a delicate balance, and the right solution must navigate these requirements deftly.</p><p>This article will unpack the core attributes these solutions should have to equip VASPs for compliance in a way that aligns with the fast-moving nature of the digital asset industry.</p> Easy Integration <p>Travel Rule solutions must have a straightforward integration process within the diverse technological setups of VASPs. They should offer plug-and-play capabilities that require minimal adjustments to existing infrastructure, ensuring that different data formats, tech stacks, or protocols are harmonized effortlessly. Their aim should be to help VASPs meet their compliance obligations without the burden of significant system overhauls or operational downtime.</p> Highest Security and Encryption Standards <p>Travel Rule Compliance Solutions must empower VASPs to efficiently manage transactions with counterparts, in line with FATF Recommendation 16. These solutions must protect sensitive exchanged information with the highest security standards, prioritizing data&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Robust data security and encryption protocols are not just beneficial but essential to prevent breaches. Secure data transmission channels are equally crucial to safeguard user information from unauthorized access.</p><p>This is why leading Travel Rule Solutions incorporate stringent security practices, including sophisticated encryption and secure data transmission channels. They equip users with robust control over data exchanges, allowing for the approval or denial of transfer requests, thereby safeguarding customer data with the highest level of security.</p> Interoperability <p>There are several Travel Rule Protocols worldwide, with differing approaches to collecting Originator and Beneficiary information and how they handle transactions with self-hosted wallets. Interoperability within Travel Rule Compliance Solutions is essential in bridging these differences, enabling secure and efficient information exchange.</p><p>That’s where <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> comes into the picture, as its approach to interoperability directly addresses the fragmented nature of global Travel Rule Protocols. By integrating with various Travel Rule Solutions and blockchain analytics providers, Shyft Veriscope creates a network that supports diverse fund-transfer thresholds and the intricate requirements for Originator and Beneficiary information.</p> Automated <p>Automation is a critical component of an effective Travel Rule solution. It streamlines processes, reduces the potential for human error, and speeds up the identification and verification of VASPs at an entity level. An automated system supports real-time discovery and confirmation of counterparty entities, essential for maintaining compliance and operational efficiency.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities exemplify this automated approach. By utilizing just the crypto wallet address, Shyft Veriscope’s system can automatically detect counterparty VASPs in real time, negating the need for manual entry of additional information or the publication of wallet addresses by VASPs. This not only simplifies the process but also enhances security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Additionally, Shyft Veriscope’s automated address proofing validates the accuracy of the VASP identified, mitigating the risk of data breaches due to incorrect data sharing. This system provides a reliable framework for the identification of counterparties, respecting both legal entity and jurisdictional considerations.</p> Dealing With Sunrise Issues Effectively <p>The “Sunrise Issue” refers to the staggered global implementation of the Travel Rule. Since countries adopt the FATF’s Travel Rule at different times, VASPs in jurisdictions where the rule is already enforced may need to exchange information with VASPs in places where it’s not required yet. This time lag creates a challenge: how to ensure compliance when not all parties are subject to the same regulations at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope addresses the Sunrise Issue with its innovative “historic look back” capability. This feature allows VASPs to comply retroactively by obtaining transaction information even if it occurred before the counterparty had implemented a Travel Rule solution. When a new VASP joins Veriscope, it can respond to past information requests, thus ensuring compliance continuity. This solution not only bridges the compliance timing gap but also facilitates a seamless transition as new jurisdictions come online with the Travel Rule, maintaining the integrity of the global VASP&nbsp;network.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The right Travel Rule solution blends simplicity, security, adaptability, and foresight. It should effortlessly merge with existing systems, uphold the strictest security, ensure seamless communication across global protocols, automate complex processes, and skillfully handle the staggered adoption of regulations worldwide. Shyft Veriscope rises to these challenges, providing VASPs with a forward-thinking compliance partner as dynamic as the industry.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In May of this year, Deloitte announced the integration of KILT for creating new markets with reusable KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) digital credentials. The first Deloitte credentials are now&nbsp;live!</p><p>KYC/KYB credentials are increasingly required for regulatory reasons to verify the identity of an individual or existence of a business. Typically, these credentials are paper-based and single-use. Deloitte has now harnessed the power of the KILT blockchain to reimagine the process of issuing KYC and KYB credentials, making it more efficient and giving the user sovereignty over their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Deloitte used solutions “Built on KILT” that mean it could create a service built on blockchain without having to deal with cryptocurrencies or needing blockchain experience.</p><p>The Enterprise Service, provided by KILT partner <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/">BTE BOTLabs Trusted Entity</a>, enables enterprises to pay in advance via bank transfer for a large volume of blockchain transactions, which can then be processed over time as needed. No cryptocurrency is needed by the enterprise or their customers.</p><p>Applications that interact with the blockchain can be <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-kilt-suite-introducing-opendid-and-the-ctype-hub-dbe5bc769560">built without blockchain knowledge</a> using the TypeScript software development kit (SDK) and code examples, or by adapting existing open source applications. Deloitte created its own digital wallet for managing credentials based on the KILT Sporran wallet (a browser extension).</p><p>Users can follow the Deloitte process to get a decentralized identifier (DID; a string of letters and numbers unique to that user) which forms the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/decentralized-identifiers">core of their identity</a>. Once the information provided for KYC/KYB is approved, the credential is attested by Deloitte, linked to that DID. To maintain privacy, the user always retains control of their DID and credential in their personal wallet on their own&nbsp;device.</p><p>This reduces the need for centralized storage of credentials and puts the user in charge of their own data. The user decides who they share the credential with and how much information in the credential they share (selective disclosure). Only a hash representing the data is stored on the blockchain, keeping the information private. The credential can later be revoked using this hash when the information is no longer&nbsp;valid.</p><p>We are delighted to see credentials “Built on KILT” in action. The <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/polimec-and-deloitte-switzerland-introduce-new-kyc-credentials-to-enhance-regulatory-compliant-5a6bb0654dd4">first use case</a> has already been announced, with more to follow shortly.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> data feeds predict whether BTC, ETH etc will rise or fall 5min or 1h into the future. Such feeds are alpha to traders. These feeds are crowdsourced by “predictoors”: people running AI-powered prediction bots. Predictoors earn from sales of the feeds (to traders) and from stake reshuffling ($ going from incorrect predictoors to correct ones). Predictoor’s longer-term vision is 10,000 feeds, going beyond finance to weather, agriculture, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Predictoor is a product built by <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> core team. Predictoor smart contracts run on <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire">Oasis Sapphire</a>, the only privacy-preserving EVM chain in production. The Ocean and Oasis core teams collaborate closely&nbsp;❤️.</p><p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean’s incentive program. It rewards OCEAN to participants who lock OCEAN into veOCEAN, curate data, or make predictions — all in the name of driving data consume volume (DCV). DF is organized into two streams: Passive DF and Active DF. Passive DF allows for passive earning potential. Active DF requires more engagement; it has several substreams.</p><p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor Data Farming</a> is a new substream of Active Data Farming. It amplifies existing predictoors’ earnings based on their accuracy and stake. It does so by basically contributing extra sales to Ocean Predictoor data feeds. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> 2. Predictoor DF&nbsp;Timing <p>Predictoor DF starts counting on Nov 9, 2023, at the beginning of Data Farming Round 62 (DF62). It runs indefinitely.</p> 3. Predictoor DF Reward&nbsp;Amounts <p>Predictoor DF has two components: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/about-us/ocean-token">OCEAN</a> rewards and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">Oasis ROSE</a> rewards. Here are&nbsp;details:</p>  OCEAN payouts of 37,000 OCEAN/week, ongoing. <br> — A special “DF buyer” bot purchases Predictoor feeds. It starts operating on Nov 9. Every day, it spends 1/7 of the weekly Predictoor OCEAN budget for another 24h subscription. It spends an equal amount per feed. (Currently there are 20 feeds: 10 x 5min, 10 x 1h.) <br> — The OCEAN comes from the Ocean DF budget, as part of the 75,000 OCEAN/week for Active DF. The Volume DF budget has been adjusted to 37,000 OCEAN/week, and Challenge DF to 1,000 OCEAN/week. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#a171">Here</a> are&nbsp;details.  ROSE payouts of 100,000 ROSE/week for the first 4 weeks. <br> — Payout is at the end of the DF round. Therefore there will be payouts at the end of DF62, DF63, DF64, and DF65. Payout for a given predictoor is pro-rata to the net earnings of that predictoor over that DF round, specifically (total sales $ to the predictoor) minus (predictoor stake slashed due to being wrong). <br> — The ROSE comes from a generous contribution of <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol Foundation</a> 👪🙏.  <p>For further details about DF more generally, including DF stream budgets, see <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards">Data Farming docs</a> and “<a href="http://Here%20are%20details.">Ocean Data Farming Main is Here</a>” blog&nbsp;post.</p> 4. How to Earn $ Via Predictoor DF  4.1 How to become a predictoor <p>Simple, run your own prediction bot!&nbsp;🤖</p>  Play with the dapp: <a href="http://predictoor.ai">http://predictoor.ai</a>  Then follow <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor/pdr-earn">Predictoor usage guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs  Or, go straight to <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">the quickstart README</a>&nbsp;:)&nbsp;🏎️   4.2 On OCEAN Rewards in Predictoor DF   Duration: ongoing  To be eligible: predictoors are automatically eligible&nbsp;🧘  To claim: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4.3 On $ROSE rewards in Predictoor DF   Duration: Runs 4 DF rounds — DF62, DF63, DF64, DF65. Limited&nbsp;time!  ⚠️ To be eligible for a given DF round: you MUST run Predictoor $OCEAN payout script &lt;= 4 days after the round ends, i.e. between Thu 00:00 UTC &amp; Sun 11:59 PM&nbsp;UTC  To claim: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs   5. How to Earn More $ Via Passive DF &amp; Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Predictoor DF makes Active DF more attractive, and in turn Passive DF. Let’s zoom&nbsp;in.</p><p>First, we review Passive DF and Volume DF (details&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>):</p>  Passive DF has 75K OCEAN weekly rewards budget. To participate, one locks OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. Rewards to a user are pro-rata to the user’s veOCEAN holdings.  Volume DF has 37K OCEAN weekly rewards budget. To participate in Volume DF, one allocates veOCEAN towards data assets. Rewards to a user are higher for more veOCEAN allocated, and for more DCV on the data asset that’s allocated to (DCV = Data Consume&nbsp;Volume).  <p>Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo, because the volume-based bounds on weekly rewards trends tend to be qualitatively higher for prediction feeds. (See the Appendix for details.)</p><p>Curating is straightforward. Ocean assets with high DCV are easy to identify: it’s the 20 OPF-published prediction feeds. This makes the choice of veOCEAN allocation easy: point to those 20 assets&nbsp;[2].</p><p>Doing Volume DF gives Passive DF rewards too, of&nbsp;course.</p><p>The net result: Predictoor DF means earnings potential from Predictoor DF, Volume DF, and Passive&nbsp;DF.</p> 6. Conclusion <p>A “predictoor” runs AI-powered prediction bots in the <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem. They onboard <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">here</a>. They earn $ from sales of prediction feeds; higher accuracy and higher stake mean higher&nbsp;$.</p><p>Predictoor DF is a new incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via extra sales to Ocean Predictoor data feeds. Predictoor DF has 37K OCEAN weekly rewards (ongoing) and 100K ROSE rewards (first 4&nbsp;weeks).</p><p>The higher baseline sales makes Volume DF and Passive more attractive.</p><p>Challenge DF rewards are reduced, and will wind down soon; the Appendix has&nbsp;details.</p> Appendix: Updates to Challenge DF <p>Challenge DF rewards are reduced, and will wind down soon. Here are&nbsp;details.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Challenge DF was introduced &amp; shipped</a> in July 2023 in DF Round 48 (DF48). It was always conceived as an onboarding mechanism to becoming a predictoor, ie someone who runs a bot predicting ETH and more within the <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem. Since Predictoor was introduced, predictoor onboarding has greatly improved. It’s no longer worth doing Challenge DF first. So let’s simplify:)</p><p>Therefore, since the launch of Challenge DF, there are two important updates.</p>  Reduced payouts. As of DF62, Challenge DF payouts are reduced from 5000 OCEAN / week to 1000 OCEAN / week. DF62 counting starts on Nov 9, 2023 and concludes on Nov 16, 2023. (Predictoor DF is introduced in DF62.) The Active DF budget is 37K / 37K / 1K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor / Challenge DF respectively.  Wind-down. DF65 is the final round for Challenge DF. Starting in DF65, the 1000 OCEAN / week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF. The Active DF budget will37K / 37K / 1K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor / Challenge DF respectively.  <p>For further details, see the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> post, which includes “Predictoor DF” posts and other DF posts, all in chronological order.</p> Appendix: On DCV Bounds of Prediction Feeds <p>Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo. Active DF’s rewards are bounded by DCV_bound which in turn is bound by sales volume and fees. In Predictoor DF, both those factors are raised; which raises the bounding in Volume DF; this in turn means higher earning potential. Let's elaborate.</p><p>At one time, Volume DF had a “wash consume” problem, where people published and consumed their own datasets. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">DF9</a> onwards address this, by putting a bounds on weekly&nbsp;rewards:</p><blockquote>DCV_bound = DCV *&nbsp;m</blockquote><p>Where m = DCV_bounding_multiplier = Ocean community fee (0.1%) + publish market&nbsp;fee.</p><p>This stopped wash consume because it became unprofitable to do wash consume: fees eat up all potential profits.</p><p>A low DCV (data consume volume) or a low m (publish market fee) mean low DCV_bound.</p><p>Predictoor DF makes both DCV and m&nbsp;higher!</p>  DCV is higher: the 37K OCEAN/week counts as consume&nbsp;volume  m is higher: publish market fee is 20% for prediction feeds  <p>Therefore DCV_bound is higher. Specifically: DCV_bound = 37000 * (0.001 + 0.20) = 7437 OCEAN. In other words, at least 7437 OCEAN is available for Volume DF in any given&nbsp;week.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $21K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Nov 8, 2023: $0.39 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.065 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.39 / OCEAN * 17,000 OCEAN = $14,430&nbsp;USD  $0.065 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $6,500&nbsp;USD  Total: $14,4300 + $6,500 = $20,930 ≈ $21K&nbsp;USD  <p>[2] The BTC/USDT 5m and 1h feeds follow the same Volume DF mechanics as the other feeds, despite being free on the&nbsp;webapp.</p><p>Details: the BTC feeds are priced at the smart contract level. The webapp receives datatokens for those feeds and makes the prediction values public. Because the BTC feeds are priced, then: their DCV is non-negligible; allocating veOCEAN to them makes sense; and Volume DF rewards accrue to them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a>.

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  Reference Wallet  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   OpenID and Reference Wallet <p>We are working on implementations of OID4VCI and OID4VP and have recently refactored them to match the latest version of the specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vci-rs/pull/10?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vci-rs#10</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vp-rs/pull/3?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vp-rs#3</a>)</p><p>Work is underway to update our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/wallet?ref=blog.spruceid.com">reference wallet</a> (formerly known as Credible Wallet) and refactor it as a collection of our mobile-related technologies which include credentials and keys management but also the OID4VCI protocols.</p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms, including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Merged an initial implementation of SD-JWT (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/529?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#529</a>)  A major refactor of ssi continues to be underway. This refactor will help us to better handle Linked Data and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.   Rebase&nbsp;   Rebase was refactored to support multiple async runtimes, this allows developers to use Rebase in popular Rust async runtimes like Tokio. Before, it only supported WASM.  Rebase is being refactored to support witness flows without issuance. All previous issuance work will still be available, but developers will be able to use the witness flows to simply determine if a fact is true and no longer have to issue a credential at the conclusion of the flow. This supports more flexible implementations in apps that call Rebase libraries.   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID lets users control their data across the web. SpruceID provides an ecosystem of open-source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

<p>Azure AD Graph Updates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a three-year deprecation period, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced in June 2023</a> that we are entering the retirement, or shut down, cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs, which are now out of support (other than security-related fixes). This aligns with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support">Breaking Change Policy</a> that promises a minimum two (2) year deprecation period before API retirement. In June, we also described that this retirement would happen in stages and with advanced notice between each stage. The first stage will involve newly created Applications being unable to use Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While there are limited substantial updates to share at this point, we do want to provide an interim update. Our goal is to be transparent and establish a regular cadence of communication as we work with and support our customers through this service retirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>September 2023 updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Some customers have told us that it is hard to identify or find which applications are using the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs, and at what scale. We are now working to deliver an analytics experience through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Identity Recommendations</a> that will provide the information that you need to identify and prioritize applications that require update or modification to avoid further disruption. We will provide an estimated release date for this experience soon. 
 As described in our prior communication, the first stage of retirement for Azure AD Graph APIs will involve a change that prevents newly-created <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0">Applications</a> from using Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). We will provide a minimum of three (3) months advance notice before this date. At this first stage, only newly created Applications, and not existing Applications, will be impacted.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a near-future update, we will provide more detail on the timeline and actions needed to avoid disruption for (new) Applications that are not yet migrated to Microsoft Graph. We have not yet set the date at which newly created Applications will be prevented from using Azure AD Graph APIs, but we are working diligently towards providing that clarity and to deliver experiences that will help support customer efforts in migrating applications away from this retiring API service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Action:</p>
<p>Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Migrate Sign-in risk policy and User risk policy and from Entra ID Protection to Conditional Access</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have User risk policy or Sign-in risk policy enabled in Entra ID Protection (formerly Identity Protection) today, we invite you to migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a>. The UX in Entra ID Protection for these two risk policies will be retired on October 1, 2026</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuring Sign-in risk and User risk policies in Conditional Access provides these benefits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Manage all access policies in one place. 
 Report-only mode and Graph API support.&nbsp; 
 Greater flexibility by combining risk conditions with other conditions like location for granular access control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced security with multiple risk-based policies targeting different user groups or risk levels.&nbsp; 
 Improved diagnostics experience by viewing which risk-based policy applied in Sign-in Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Registration campaign improvements</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow. Note: admins can decide if they want to opt out of the “limited” 3 snooze configuration or give their end users the ability to snooze indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Entra ID tenants that are Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning&nbsp;September 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change for Entra ID premium tenants.</p>

<p>Optimized MFA OTP delivery via WhatsApp</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;Entra ID&nbsp;(Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options#sms-message-verification">text message</a>. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-September 2023, users&nbsp;in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method 
 Already use WhatsApp 
 Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations with users in the listed countries that don't want their users to receive MFA text messages through WhatsApp will need to disable text messages as an authentication method in their tenant(s). Depending on where they manage their authentication methods this means they need to disable "Text message to phone" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.activedirectory.windowsazure.com%2FUserManagement%2FMfaSettings.aspx&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2wENNOj7suQmnsgX%2BErw3SzyGW2dKlEjo7%2BZ7GumgTY%3D&amp;reserved=0">per-user MFA policy</a>&nbsp;and / or "SMS" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fentra.microsoft.com%2F%23view%2FMicrosoft_AAD_IAM%2FAuthenticationMethodsMenuBlade%2F~%2FAdminAuthMethods%2FfromNav%2FIdentity&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347428104%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=47wDN5b8%2FVhKNbOlUc4UEyXhEtBhR9tBKn9kWBe1gac%3D&amp;reserved=0">Authentication methods policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra admin center which states, “Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access,” will be retired. This means disabling My Groups will no longer be possible. In June, a new setting that enables admins to restrict end users from viewing and managing security groups in My Groups will take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the existing setting for Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Panel is configured as Yes, the new setting will restrict users' ability to see and edit security groups in My Groups. 
 &nbsp;If the existing setting is configured as No, the new setting will expose security groups in My Groups.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable HTTP/2 on the Graph service endpoint</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454">previously announced</a> in September of 2022, the Microsoft Graph engineering team plans to begin rollout of HTTP/2 support on the Microsoft Graph service endpoint on September 15, 2023. HTTP/2 support will be in addition to existing HTTP/1.1 version support. Once HTTP/2 is enabled on the Microsoft Graph endpoints, clients that support HTTP/2 will negotiate this version when making requests to Microsoft Graph. Focus for improvements in the HTTP/2 specification concern performance, including perceived latency, and network and service resource usage (reference <a href="https://http2.github.io">https://http2.github.io</a>), including multiplexing, parallelism, and efficiency through binary encoding and header compression. These benefits may offer substantial value to Microsoft Graph clients and customers. HTTP/2 is expected to be entirely backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and to require no code changes in client applications. It's possible, in rare cases, that negative impact may occur with some client applications, if the application does not adhere to HTTP specifications concerning case-insensitive comparisons for Header keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Government organizations with significant technical debt require modern approaches for delivering services. Deploying services using DevOps techniques and a DevOps-enabled identity and access management (IAM) platform can improve application performance, availability, and scalability, while reducing maintenance and deployment costs.</p>

 Why DevOps? 

<p>DevOps is a methodology that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, communication, and efficiency in delivering software applications.</p>

<p>Docker and Kubernetes are two foundational technologies that can be used for any deployment methodology — not just cloud computing — because they support building applications that can run on any modern operating system, and in any environment.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> is a tool designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create, deploy, and run applications at scale and in any environment by using containers. Containers allow a developer to bundle an application with all of the parts it needs — such as libraries, code, and other dependences — and deploy it as one package.</p>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

<p>Together, Docker and Kubernetes enable developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the systems that it will be running on. The combination enables them to orchestrate and deliver faster services with flexible deployment options, whether they are to run in an on-premises, hybrid, or multi-cloud environment.</p>

 The benefits of DevOps-based IAM 

<p>Time is of the essence when developing and deploying capabilities that support the growing need for digital government services or for mission-critical applications used in denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited (DDIL) environments.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to speed deployment, scale for peak demand, and increase efficiency and security is by using a modern, comprehensive IAM solution that supports a multi-cloud DevOps deployment model with Docker and Kubernetes-based containerization and orchestration technologies. With the cloud now a top government strategic priority and more workloads shifting to cloud platforms every year, it's imperative to protect these workloads, no matter where they reside.</p>

<p>Large government agencies and organizations that are using older, on-premises IAM systems can't deliver the scale and security needed for digital government services for constituents or mission-critical applications used in intelligence and defense. Traditional IAM solutions are often complex and difficult to deploy, lacking the scalability and flexibility needed for quickly rolling out new services, upgrades, or releases.</p>

<p>In contrast, DevOps-friendly IAM solutions are designed to support automated and continuous delivery requirements, which are essential for DevOps practices across any environment.<br>
By containerizing IAM using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, government agencies can achieve greater flexibility when deploying IAM solutions.</p>

 Comparing DevOps-based IAM with legacy and cloud-only solutions 

<p>ForgeRock fully supports DevOps-based IAM and offers several advantages over legacy, monolithic IAM solutions and cloud-only IAM:</p>

  Deploy anywhere, online or offline: DevOps-based IAM can be deployed in any environment: on-premises, in private or public cloud, and in offline access scenarios such as on military vessels with intermittent internet connectivity. Our Cloud Deployment Model (CDM) adheres to the DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design for deployment in a containerized environment. 
	 Best of both worlds: The comprehensive ForgeRock IAM platform provides the features, capabilities, and customization you need, without the hassle of maintaining a monolithic IAM system. Cloud-only IAM solutions offer agility and scalability, but they may not be suitable for government agencies and organizations that are managing complex use cases or DDIL low-bandwidth and offline requirements. 
	 Up-to-date security: Unlike a monolithic IAM solution, DevOps-based IAM can be patched quickly for security updates and new features without taking the entire solution offline. 
  The ForgeOps deployment methodology 

<p>Customers that use the ForgeRock DevOps deployment model called <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.4/cdm/intro.html">ForgeOps</a> have accelerated projects by three to six months, saving 25% on implementation costs. Agencies can deploy updates between their containerized applications and ForgeRock with the ability to test, QA, and deploy ForgeRock into Kubernetes clusters in minutes by running a simple command. And they can choose the operating system that meets their needs.</p>

<p>Government agencies requiring high security often choose OpenShift, an on-premises platform-as-a-service Kubernetes implementation that supports public cloud, on-premises, hybrid cloud, or edge architectures. The ForgeOps-provided Kubernetes scripts can be modified to support an OpenShift deployment.</p>

<p>With the right identity solution, organizations can easily protect workloads in any cloud; support millions of identities of any type; enable rapid solution development in a repeatable way; and conduct fast, simple, and highly available deployments — all without sacrificing rich features and extensibility. This ultimately leads to immediate business benefits, including accelerated time to market, increased flexibility in rolling out new services, availability and scalability, and time savings.</p>

 The ForgeRock difference 

<p>By making it easy to utilize Docker and Kubernetes technology, ForgeRock provides the fastest and most flexible multi-cloud IAM deployment options. Our cloud deployment model removes complexity and can help you accelerate development, making it easy to deploy millions of identities in minutes, on any cloud – whether it's a private cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>You can validate deployment options against ForgeRock benchmark results and analyze the most cost-effective cloud solution based on multiple factors so that your organization can reduce costs and ensure optimal performance, availability, and reliability to meet customer demand quickly.</p>

<p>YeshID is now <a href="https://trust.yeshid.com/">SOC II compliant</a>! 🎉 Not sure why this is important? In an increasingly digital world, safeguarding sensitive information, especially during <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">employee IT onboarding and offboarding</a>, is of critical importance. SOC II compliance represents a major commitment to data security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to share this news with you for two reasons:</p>
 
 To help deepen your trust in YeshID as your tool of choice for secure onboarding and offboarding.&nbsp; 
 You might want to achieve SOC II compliance for your growing company one day too! We’re hoping our journey can help you with yours.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore what SOC II compliance means, its significance for YeshID, and how it benefits your organization.</p>
 What is SOC II compliance? 
<p>SOC II, or Service Organization Control 2, is a rigorous auditing process that evaluates a company’s controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data. Achieving SOC II compliance demonstrates that YeshID has undergone thorough assessments and meets high industry standards in data security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SOC II compliance is usually conducted by a third-party assessor that measures the following:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security: Assesses measures in place to protect the organization’s systems, data centers, networks, access controls, and more from unauthorized access, physical and otherwise 
 Availability: Examines downtime, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning to assess the reliability of systems and services as agreed upon with customers 
 Processing integrity: Evaluates if data is processed accurately, completely, and in a timely manner&nbsp; 
 Confidentiality: Assesses access controls, encryption, and data privacy measures to focus on the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure 
 Privacy: Assesses the management of personal information and its compliance with relevant data privacy regulations

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The result of this meeting was “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023">The Bletchley Declaration</a>”, an international agreement signed by 29 countries, including the US, EU, and China, to confirm their shared commitment for future AI developments that “should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible”.</p>
<p>Sounds promising, right? Experts have been talking about the dangers of uncontrolled AI proliferation for years. James Cameron warned us about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">AI gaining self-awareness</a> forty years ago! Elon Musk has been <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">calling for a pause in AI development</a>, citing grave dangers for our society. On a slightly more serious note, our own KuppingerCole analysts have published numerous articles on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/iantorno/the-triple-threat-ai-ethics-bias-and-deepfakes-in-cybersecurity">AI risks and challenges</a> as well, including those in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/ai-and-cybersecurity-a-new-hope-for-cyber-defenders">the field of cybersecurity</a>. And yet, major world superpowers have been engaged in an AI arms race in recent years, and just a week ago, the US president has issued a landmark <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order on trustworthy development and use of AI</a> to strengthen his country’s position in this race.</p>
<p>So, why such a sudden demonstration of unity amidst an ongoing global conflict? British prime minister Rishi Sunak called the Bletchley declaration “a landmark achievement… helping ensure the long-term future of our children and grandchildren”, but can we really expect any substance from this claim, or should we treat this paper as a mere symbolic gesture?</p>
<p>After all, the entire summit was full of overt symbolism. Bletchley Park, the location of the event, is, of course, the historic site where during the World War II, top British experts worked to break the secret communications of the Axis powers, especially the notorious German Enigma machine. And of course, this valiant work was led by none other than Alan Turing, the same guy that later proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">eponymous test</a> to measure a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m well aware of the fact that the actual cracking of the Enigma code was mostly done by Polish mathematicians years before, as well as of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death">appalling treatment of Turing himself</a> by the British authorities that led to his suicide, and this alone makes the entire symbolism a bit too shallow for me. But even if we ignore the history and only focus on the Turing test itself, we should keep in mind that it was a ground-breaking (and highly controversial) philosophical concept back then, but it bears very little relevance to the modern AI developments that the declaration is supposed to regulate.</p>
<p>Does it really matter if a chatbot can fool you into thinking that you’re communicating with a human? There are much more urgent and practical technological, cultural, and moral problems that need to be addressed soon: for example, who is responsible if a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car_liability">driverless car runs over a pedestrian</a>? Or a multitude of much smaller but equally critically important issues like dealing with bias and prejudice, ethical consequences of AI tools making carrier-defining decisions for humans, deepfakes, etc., etc. Or defending against threat actors wielding their own AI tools…</p>
<p>Surely, all these issues must be addressed, and regulation is the most efficient way to do that. But there is an important distinction between regulating AI usage and its development. The latter is simply meaningless, especially around technologies that can be easily weaponized. No matter how many times governments agree not to create “killer robots”, then will continue developing them anyway because having killer robots at your army’s disposal is much better than not having them, especially if your country is planning another war.</p>
<p>So no, I do not consider this declaration a landmark achievement. It was merely an empty gesture to make British politicians feel a bit more important than they perhaps deserve. An imitation game, if you will. Or, more likely, a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult</a>. And of course, the AI battle between the US and China will continue. And nobody will voluntarily give up productivity tools like ChatGPT and surely, the black market of AI-based threats and exploits will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>But perhaps sometime in the future, when AI safety summits are attended by industry experts and not politicians, we will see more practical developments tailored to specific issues in certain fields or geographies. Until then, we will have to defend against the evil AIs ourselves. And a great place to discuss your immediate risks and challenges is the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference, which opens next week in Frankfurt, Germany, as well as online. Will we see you there?</p>

Because the systems in place to stop it are slow, outdated, or unintuitive. In this article we’ll explain how verifiable credentials can fix the issue.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Systems to prevent fraud and scams are in place across every industry; and yet, the FTC reports <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-show-consumers-reported-losing-nearly-88-billion-scams-2022">fraud increased by 30%</a> from 2021 to 2022. Some may point to the number of chances that bad actors have: the US averages <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">1,739 credit cards swiped per second,</a> with the average card holder making <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">210 credit transactions per year.</a> Surely, with that many transactions systems can’t catch everything. Maybe not. But it is troubling that even as security technology advances, fraud is trending ever upward.</p>
<p>2023 saw many technological advances, with one of the most noteworthy being <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT,</a> an artificial intelligence program that generates “human-like text.” Almost immediately, it was misused: a study by SlashNext found a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">1,265% increase in general phishing</a> attempts since ChatGPT launched in November of 2022, and a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">967% increase in credential phishing</a> attempts. And with ChatGPT built on open-source code, it wasn’t long before malicious actors began making their own programs to do even more damage, leading to the creation of <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/wormgpt-and-fraudgpt-the-rise-of-malicious-llms/">WormGPT and FraudGPT.</a></p>
<p>Instead of playing “spot the scam,” against a background of ever more complex scams, we need a better way of knowing for sure who we are interacting with. This is where verifiable credentials come in. Someone once described verifiable credentials to me as “multi-factor authentication for life.” Imagine a world where before you even opened the email you could be certain who it was from because there was an authentication process built into the sending.</p>
<p>Today, if you get an important-looking email from the government or your bank, the onus is on you to verify it. Some people might call to double check (and get that second point of authentication), but many might just respond, or worse yet click on links they shouldn’t and&nbsp; provide personal information. The extra step to verify is time consuming. People want convenience, and, frankly, the main line of defense against phishing and other cyber scams shouldn’t be to inconvenience them. We need a fast, easy to use, technical answer.</p>
<p>Indicio believes that verifiable credentials are this answer because we’ve seen them work across a variety of use cases for different customers. With a simple scan of a QR code you can be sure of who you are interacting with and who has issued their credential. Think of your bank issuing you a verifiable credential for your bank account. Every time you connect with your bank, it knows you’re the person it issued the credential to, automatically. Similarly, you know you are interacting with your bank and not some fake version of it. And this all occurs before any data is shared. Combine this with the way parties can prove that information shared from a credential hasn’t been tampered with, the use cases are innumerable. Trust is foundational to all business and social activity, and now we have a way to trust each other and what we share online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see how fast and easy verifiable credentials make accessing something like your bank account you can see a demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ">here.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We recognize the unique skills, experience, and dedication that veterans bring to the table. As such, we actively seek veterans to join our team and contribute to our mission to secure our ever-changing world. In this blog post, we share the story of one of our Veterans Alliance members, Mark Joynes, CD, and highlight the parallel between his military experience and the rewarding career opportunities he has built at Entrust over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>The Road to PKI</p>
<p>Mark embarked on his career in the Canadian military in 1976. He started as a ground and air-to-ground photographer and spent eight years serving in Canada and West Germany during the Cold War era. However, his true transformation began when he was commissioned from the ranks and trained in the Security Branch. In his last four years, he served in the Computer Security Shop of Defense Headquarters, diving into the very early days of computer security (and before any thought of Zero Trust technologies).</p>
<p>Mark’s exposure to computer security continued in 1985 when he attended a secure systems design course at NCSC in Baltimore. He was later assigned as a Lieutenant to the Computer Security Shop, highlighting the military’s recognition of his abilities and potential in cybersecurity. Soon after leaving the military, Mark was with Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) as the Canadian government deployed the Canadian PKI root. This experience laid the foundation for his now 30-year expertise with PKI (public key infrastructure), a pivotal technology that has shaped data security.</p>
<p>PKI and Mark’s Contributions</p>
<p>Mark’s journey in the military led him to become a PKI Product Marketing Director at Entrust, where he plays a crucial role in driving the commercialization of our comprehensive ePassport PKI architecture. Leveraging his extensive experience, Mark was instrumental in deploying CSCAs (Country Signing Certification Authorities) and signers in the UK, US, and Singapore. His ambitious vision also led to the development of the EAC (Extended Access Control) based PKI investment for 2nd generation ePassports, setting new standards in the European market.</p>
<p>As a result of Mark’s contributions, Entrust now provides the trust architecture for over 40 countries worldwide. In fact, approximately 50% of the ePassports in circulation feature the signed booklets from Entrust PKI, a testament to the trust and confidence placed in our technology.</p>
<p>Why Veterans Make a Great Fit for Our Company</p>
<p>We understand that the military instills exceptional qualities in individuals, including agility, empowerment, and a sense of urgency. These traits, combined with a “can-do” attitude and a passion for security, align perfectly with the opportunities available at Entrust.</p>
<p>In addition to appreciating the valuable skills veterans bring, we also recognize the importance of fostering capability and supporting individuals in realizing their ambitions. Our company culture emphasizes leadership development and personal growth, ensuring that each team member can contribute to our collective goals while fulfilling their own aspirations.</p>

  <p>The healthcare industry has long grappled with the challenge of delivering the retail-like consumer experiences that patients and members demand. According to a Harris Poll, 67% of patients described every healthcare step as a chore, and 62% believed the system was inherently confusing<a>1</a>. Yet, in the pursuit to improve healthcare experiences, both payers and providers face a host of challenges that are often at odds:</p>

  Provide streamlined experiences across the growing digital health ecosystem (including third parties) – yet avoid fraud, account takeover (ATO), ransomware, and breaches. 
	 Meet the demands for innovative patient- and member-facing services – but not at the expense of compliance with HIPAA, CCPA, and other stringent regulations. 
	 Create operational efficiency and achieve cost savings – while simultaneously looking for ways to improve consumer satisfaction and increase revenue. 
 <p>The remedy to these seemingly conflicting challenges lies in an enterprise-grade identity and access management (IAM) platform that provides the foundation for delivering consumer experiences to keep patients and members coming back for more. The following are a few examples of how healthcare leaders are using digital identity to revolutionize healthcare experiences that acquire and retain consumers, and drive profitability.</p>

  Build Personalized, Secure, Seamless Experiences: Use a no-code approach to build consumer journey experiences with features such as progressive profiling, passwordless authentication, and AI-informed threat detection. 
	 Give Consumers Control with Self-Service: Drive engagement while reducing operational costs by giving patients and members control over their profile, login, and data sharing preferences with self-service functions. 
	 Get A Single View of Your Consumer: Get a single, organization-wide view of a patient or member to facilitate personalized, omnichannel experiences and drive customized services across all lines of business. 
	 Add Speed to Digital Services: Accelerate the retrieval of identity-related information across all legacy and modern solutions to deliver improved application performance and user experiences. 
	 Gain Privacy Protection and Anti-Fraud Capabilities: Enhance consumer interactions, brand loyalty, and cost-savings through privacy protection, compliance features, and AI-powered anti-fraud capabilities. 
	 Achieve Interoperability and Build Secure Partner Services: Bridge the gaps in your hybrid IT environments, unlock siloed data, and safely expand your digital ecosystem to partners for value-added services that boost revenue. 
 <p>Adopting ForgeRock's robust digital identity platform is your gateway to today's era of consumer-centric healthcare experiences.</p>

<p>ICC DSI’s recently published <a href="https://www.dsi.iccwbo.org/_files/ugd/8e49a6_2d93b2f219cf404ab91bafd028e31fcc.pdf">Key Trade Documents and Data Elements</a> kicks off with this beautiful diagram:</p>Figure 1: ICC DSI’s beautiful diagram.<p>The diagram displays the data elements, many of which are duplicated, that belong to seven major global trade documents. The red and green circles at the bottom denote the trade parties responsible for exchanging the documents.</p><p>From a modern technology perspective, the top row screams Linked Data. The bottom part maps equally well to Verifiable Credentials’ digital signatures issuance and downstream verification.</p><p>We will explore this further based on this sample implementation:</p>Figure 2: Sample implementation: two issuers, carrier and seller respectively issue and present BL and PL to a shipper, which in turn presents both documents to&nbsp;customs. Actors <p>On the ICC DSI diagram, Packing Lists are exchanged from Seller/Exporter to Buyer/Importer. While true, this is not the full story; for example, Customs also require Packing List documentation.</p>Figure 3: The Three Party Model. Source: <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CrossBorderTrade_September2022.pdf">UN/CEFACT</a>.<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials data model</a> maps perfectly to how trade documents are actually passed through multiple parties along the supply chain. Throughout the entirety of the supply chain, data can be verified, cryptographically tying back to the original&nbsp;issuer.</p> Relationships <p>The top row of ICC DSI’s diagram lists numerous relationships, which can be broadly categorized as Collections, Repetition, and Relationships.</p> Document Pouches <p>Documents are often presented to the same actor at once, in a “pouch.” A pouch of documents is expected to be related in customs and trade finance use&nbsp;cases.</p>Figure 4: A data graph representing a Packing List and a Bill of Lading Verifiable Credentials, joined together as part of the same Document&nbsp;Pouch.<p>Above, two credentials are joined by the same <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#workflow-instance">Workflow Instance</a>, explicitly indicating relation across multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>.</p> Inter-Document References <p>Documents typically carry identifiers and reference each other. For example, a Commercial Invoice typically references a Purchase Order, usually with a Purchase Order number, which is unique to the two organizations’ business relationship.</p>Figure 5: Expanding data graph elements, illustrating common nodes and repeated data elements.<p>As you can see on figure 5, both the Packing List and the Bill of Lading references the same Unique Resource Identifier (the yellow&nbsp;node).</p><p>Note that the trade parties are also represented by the same green nodes, referenced from both documents. “Seller Inc.” is the Issuer, Seller and Ship From party on the Packing List, and the consignor on the Bill of Lading. This is because the documents reference URIs, in this case Decentralized Identifiers.</p> Repeating Elements <p>Non-identified values are usually just repeated on the documents where they are required. For example, a weight measurement is typically not identified (although it could be), so the values are repeated whenever required. For example, a shipment’s product Gross Weight is listed both the Packing List and the Commercial Invoice.</p><p>Also shown on figure 5, the goods weights and measurements are repeated on the Packing List and the Bill of Lading. Automating a consistency check to confirm that the documents represent the same shipment is trivial when the data comes with strong semantics in this&nbsp;way.</p> Conclusion <p>I wrote this article based on a quick implementation of ICC DSI’s model using prevalent, modern web technologies. This was quickly done using the open source for example these <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#PackingListCredential">PL</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#MultiModalBillOfLadingCredential">BL</a> schemas, and our Verifiable Data Platform for credentials management and constructing the corresponding <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/adapters/urn:transmute:adapter:neo4j">data&nbsp;graphs</a>.</p><p>The intention of this article has been to present a direction, from the ICC DSI model towards a scalable, interoperable implementation model.</p><p>Similarly, talking about Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers in the abstract can be rather alienating. But as we have seen, they address some very tangible elements of global trade, beautifully introduced by the ICC&nbsp;DSI.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen">Nis Jespersen</a>, Transmute’s Solutions Architect, is editor of the United Nations CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary project and author of the W3C Traceability Vocabulary specification.</p><p>Connect with Nis on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nissimsan">Twitter</a>, &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nissimsan">GitHub</a></p><p>Sign up for free on Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/digital-trade-document-relationships-2f263b410e3">Digital Trade Document Relationships</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The holiday season is a time of gift-giving and therefore increased online shopping, which naturally increases the risk of cyber threats. As we shop for presents online, we expose our digital identities to potential risks. Cybercriminals are always looking for opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities and steal sensitive information. In this blog, I’ll provide essential tips for keeping your digital identity safe while holiday shopping.</p>
 Use Strong, Unique Passwords 
<p>One of the most basic yet crucial steps in safeguarding your digital identity is using strong, unique passwords for each online account. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like “123456” or “password”. Instead, create complex passwords that include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
<p>To manage these passwords and encourage the use of strong passwords, consider using a trusted password manager, which can generate and store them securely.</p>
 Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your online accounts. An example of this is Two-Factor Authentication which typically involves something you know (your password) and something you have (e.g. a code sent to your mobile device). The other option is something you are, which generally means biometric authentication – such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. Enabling MFA can significantly reduce the chances of unauthorised access to your accounts, even if someone obtains your password.</p>
 Shop from Secure Websites 
<p>When holiday shopping online, always make sure you are on a secure website before providing any personal or financial information. Look for “https://” in the URL and pay attention to trust badges or seals from reputable security providers. Be cautious when dealing with unfamiliar or suspicious websites. And remember, even familiar websites may be duplicated to phish your login details.</p>
 Avoid Public Wi-Fi 
<p>Public Wi-Fi networks may be convenient, but they are often not secure. Avoid making online purchases or accessing sensitive information while connected to public Wi-Fi. If you need to shop online while on the go, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and add an extra layer of security.</p>
 Be Wary of Phishing Scams 
<p>Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to trick people into revealing sensitive information. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or links, especially if they seem too good to be true. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. Always verify the sender’s authenticity before sharing any personal data.</p>
 Monitor Your Accounts 
<p>Frequently monitor your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorised transactions. Set up account alerts to notify you of any unusual activity. The sooner you catch any fraudulent charges, the easier it is to resolve the issue and prevent further damage to your digital identity.</p>
 Keep Software Updated 
<p>Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and antivirus software to patch any security vulnerabilities. Outdated software can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain access to your device or personal information.</p>
 Use a Protected Payment Method for Online Purchases 
<p>Protected payment methods offer better protection against fraudulent charges than standard debit cards, for example. When making online purchases, consider using a protected payment methods such as a credit cards or payment apps, especially with MFA setup, which reduces your risk of hackers being able to access your details and account.</p>
 Educate Yourself 
<p>Staying informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices is essential. Educate yourself and your family members on the risks and preventive measures to ensure a safe online shopping experience.</p>
<p>Holiday shopping online offers convenience and access to a vast array of products, but it also exposes your digital identity to potential risks. By following these essential tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of falling victim to cyberattacks and protect your sensitive information. Stay vigilant, use secure practices, and enjoy a safe and joyful online shopping experience during the holiday season.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>In their constant quest for keeping organizations secure, cybersecurity professionals always need to look into the future in order to assess the likelihood of potential attacks. They need to combine their knowledge of the past and the present with their evaluation of the development of prominent attack vectors and come to a risk assessment for their work in the future.</p>
<p>In his discussion with our CEO Berthold Kerl, Jonathan Blanchard Smith, Director and Fellow at SAMI Consulting, suggests that “foresight consulting is explicitly not looking into the crystal ball”. Instead, when he and his team created the SAFIRE scenarios for the European Commission, they focused on the fact that there is not just one possible future but many. Hence, you need not only prepare for the future, but for several futures.</p>
<p>Tune in to Jonathan’s cyberfile today and take a glimpse into his two-part workshop on future scenario analysis which he will give at cyberevolution 2023 on Tuesday, November 14. Join us in Frankfurt or online.</p>
<p>Part one “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5650/1">Shaping the cybersecurity landscape of the future using the SAFIRE Scenarios</a>” deals with exploring the intricacies of future scenario analysis using the cutting-edge SAFIRE methodology and decoding the interplay of societal, technological, economic, environmental, and political factors that shape our digital future.</p>
<p>Part two “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5653/1">SAFIRE Scenarios – four Futures for the world (continued)</a>” is all about enriching your strategic thinking and scenario-building skills with the SAFIRE approach.</p>

<p>Fission is the lead organizer for IPFS Connect Istanbul. During the event, we are thrilled to be putting on our own workshop showcasing IPVM. </p><p>IPVM, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, aims to be the easiest, fastest, most secure, and open way to run WebAssembly functions anywhere.</p><p>Using content-addressed data, public key infrastructure (PKI), and capabilities, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on pre-negotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p><p>If you've been following our work at Fission, you'll note that IPVM has been our vision from day one. But we knew that before we could get to distributed compute, we had to build the auth and data layers first. Now that <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> are done, we're ready to launch <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>. </p><p>The IPVM workshop will be the first-ever interactive workshop. You can get hands-on without having to go to the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">repo</a>. Here are the details:</p><p>IPVM Workshop: Running WebAssembly Workflows with IPFS</p><p>November 16th, 1:30 - 3:30 PM</p><p>Join the Fission team in a live workshop about the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM), an open protocol for decentralized computation.</p><p>We'll be walking through how to set up and install a Homestar node, an IPVM reference implementation written in Rust optimized for running WebAssembly (Wasm) functions in workflows. </p><p>Workshop participants should bring their laptops. We'll walk through the following experiences:</p>  Install a Homestar node  Connect to Homestar node peers in the workshop  Run example workflows  Share results of computation between local peers  Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions   <p>Let's break each of these experiences down:</p><p>Install a Homestar node and connect to Homestar node peers - Homestar is Fission's Rust + Wasm implementation of IPVM. During the workshop, users will be able to install Homestar on their machines and connect to other Homestar nodes </p><p>Sneak Peak at the Homestar Mascot!</p>Homestar Mascot designed by Bruno Monteiro<p>Run Example Workflows - A workflow is a series of individual tasks (also known as a step function) wired together. In the IPVM Workshop, we will demonstrate a couple of workflows to showcase some of the capabilities of IPVM. </p><p>There will also be a control panel that will serve as the UI where the user can track their activity, view the receipts they are outputting, review pre-deployed WebAssembly tasks, and more.</p><p>Share results of computation between local peers - This is a fun one! One of the impressive features of IPVM is the more IPVM is used, the more efficient it is! That’s because every time a task is run, the output is saved in the network as a CID and is used in future computations. Think of it like global caching! The technical term for this is memoization. Homestar keeps a table (like a spreadsheet) of the ID for the function, its arguments, and its result. It allows the user to skip running the task and substitute the result. Just like IPFS's table that associates hashes to data to let anyone find and download the content, this does the same for function results. During the workshop, we will see this play out in real-time as we run computations and share those results with our fellow workshop attendees/node peers.</p><p>Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions - Once attendees start getting comfortable with IPVM, they can begin to play with workflows, tweak parameters, and even bring their own Wasm functions.</p> <p>Who should attend this workshop?</p><p>IPVM is for Front End Web Developers</p><p>Anything you would normally need a backend for, IPVM can do for you. For example, IPVM can help you resize images. If you need to parse a large text document and it's too big to do locally on your machine, give it to IPVM. IPVM can pull data off of IPFS so you can operate on it and generate a new CID to pass around. You can even build map tiling. OpenStreetMap, for example, utilizes too much data for your phone or browser to work with, but you could parallelize that work across many machines and have them send you back the rendered map.</p><p>IPVM is an excellent serverless computing option. Whether you want to use the cloud, someone else's machine, your own machine, or a mix, IPVM is the solution you've been looking for.</p><p>IPVM is for Web3 Developers</p><p>Similar to a computation rollup, but instead of needing to be on-chain, it also extends off-chain. Imagine if you need to call something out in the real world, like Twitter, Bluesky, or an email server. You want to talk to external systems. </p><p>For example, say you want to take your NFT and make it gray-scaled. </p><p>Option 1: Do the image manipulation on-chain. The problem with this is the cost of gas would be prohibitively high. As in thousands and thousands of dollars. </p><p>Option 2: Run a server. This would work, but now you're no longer Web3 and paying money to a centralized cloud provider. </p><p>Option 3: IPVM. You get the benefits of decentralization, but the functions can run off-chain, saving you money and compute resources. </p><p>In the same way that IPFS saves developers from storing their NFTs on-chain, IPVM saves developers from having to run computations on-chain.</p><p>IPVM is for ETHGlobal Hackathon Participants</p><p>For those participating in the <a href="https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul">ETHGlobal Istanbul Hackathon</a>, IPVM is a great tool to have in your toolkit. You'll probably do some computations locally, but if they slow your machine down, you can always push them to the hosted IPVM node to do the heavy lifting. Unlike centralized cloud platforms that require users to go through the network for everything, IPVM lets you choose where you want to do your computations, so you are always in control of how you allocate your resources.</p> <p>In conclusion, we're so excited for you to get your hands on Homestar. This is an early version for folks to experience and learn how decentralized compute with content addressing can work. Run it yourself and get ready to plug into a larger network of function writers and node providers. </p><p>Sign up for the IPVM Workshop by purchasing a ticket to <a href="https://istanbul2023.ipfsconnect.org/">IPFS Connect Istanbul</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/kr5UedcVEcdnnYdi7">letting us know which of the workshops you'll be attending</a>, including options from our friends at Iroh and Web3 Storage + Saturn (you can attend all three!)</p><p> Can't make it to the event?

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), compliance with the FATF Travel Rule isn’t just about adhering to regulations — it’s also a significant operational consideration that impacts the bottom&nbsp;line.</p><p>Travel Rule solutions come with a variety of pricing models, each with its distinct advantages and challenges. To simplify it, we have prepared this comprehensive guide that demystifies these models, providing VASPs with the insights needed to make informed decisions that balance cost with compliance.</p> Sign-up Fee + Annual Fee&nbsp;Model <p>In the sign-up fee plus annual fee model, VASPs pay an initial fee to gain access to the Travel Rule compliance service. After this initial payment, they are charged recurring annual fees that cover ongoing access to the service, including regular updates and customer&nbsp;support.</p><p>Sygna Bridge, for instance, follows this model. It requires VASPs to pay an upfront fee for integration into their network, followed by an annual fee that provides ongoing compliance support and secure information exchange capabilities.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Predictable annual budgeting due to fixed&nbsp;costs.  Continuous access to compliance updates and&nbsp;support.  Potentially lower costs for VASPs with high transaction volumes due to spreading the fee across numerous transactions.  <p>Cons:</p>  High initial sign-up costs can be a barrier to entry for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Annual fees apply regardless of actual usage, which may not be cost-effective during periods of low activity.  Less flexibility to scale costs with the business’s transactional demands.   Monthly Charge&nbsp;Model <p>The monthly charge model entails a regular monthly fee that covers the operational costs of the compliance solution. This cost often becomes more economical as more members join, thanks to shared expenses.</p><p>An example of this is TRUST by Coinbase, which allocates operational costs across its members on a monthly basis, with the cost per member potentially decreasing as more join the initiative.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Consistent monthly expenses make financial planning straightforward.  As more members join, individual costs can decrease due to shared operational expenses.  No large upfront payments are required.  <p>Cons:</p>  Costs may be relatively higher for smaller VASPs with fewer transactions.  Monthly fees accrue regardless of service usage, which can be inefficient for intermittent compliance needs.  Possible overpayment during slower business&nbsp;months.   Two-Tiered Pricing&nbsp;Model <p>A two-tiered pricing model offers a base service tier at a fixed cost and an advanced tier with more features, which may have customized pricing.</p><p>Notabene, for example, provides a ‘SafeTransact-Rise’ plan for basic compliance requirements and a ‘Full-Feature’ platform that caters to more complex needs, with specific pricing determined following a product demonstration.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Offers a choice between basic and advanced services to match different compliance needs.  Lower tier may provide an affordable entry point for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Higher tier can be customized, potentially offering a better fit for larger VASPs with complex&nbsp;needs.  <p>Cons:</p>  The basic tier may not be sufficient for all compliance requirements, leading to eventual upgrade&nbsp;costs.  Customization in the higher tier can be more expensive and time-consuming to negotiate.  VASPs may end up paying for unused features in the tiered structure.   Free Trial and Premium Plan&nbsp;Model <p>This model offers a complimentary trial period with fundamental service access, after which users can opt for premium plans that provide a wider range of services for a&nbsp;fee.</p><p>Sumsub exemplifies this model by giving VASPs a six-month free trial for their compliance services, after which there are options to upgrade to more comprehensive premium or enterprise plans.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Free trial period allows for testing the service without financial commitment.  Opportunity to evaluate the solution’s effectiveness before investing in a premium&nbsp;plan.  <p>Cons:</p>  After the trial, VASPs must commit to premium plans, which can be&nbsp;costly.  Transitioning from free to paid service may require budget reallocation.  Premium plans may include features that some VASPs don’t need but still pay&nbsp;for.   Membership Fee&nbsp;Model <p>With a membership fee model, organizations pay an annual fee based on the company’s size and type, which grants them access to the service network and its resources.</p><p>Open VASP, for example, uses this model where the fee structure varies based on the size and type of the company, catering to both VASPs and non-VASPs.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Annual membership provides clarity on yearly expenses.  Access to a network of compliance solutions and peers in the industry.  Fees can be tailored to company size, making it fairer for smaller organizations.  <p>Cons:</p>  Fees are due regardless of the level of service utilization.  Membership costs can be substantial, especially for larger&nbsp;VASPs.  Additional costs may arise for services not covered by the membership fee.   Pay-as-you-go Model <p>The pay-as-you-go approach is flexible and cost-efficient, particularly suitable for entities with fluctuating service needs, where they pay solely for the services utilized.</p><p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers this model, allowing VASPs to pay in alignment with their transaction volumes, avoiding upfront costs, and ensuring the scalability of the compliance solution.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Ultimate flexibility with payments aligned to actual service&nbsp;usage.  Ideal for VASPs with fluctuating transaction volumes.  No upfront costs, allowing better cash flow management.  <p>Cons:</p>  Can become expensive, in general, if transaction volumes are consistently high.   Concluding Thoughts <p>The diverse pricing models of Travel Rule solutions, as we have explored, cater to the varied needs and capabilities of VASPs — ranging from startups to established financial institutions.</p><p>Each model presents a distinct approach to cost management, from the predictability of sign-up and annual fees to the flexibility of pay-as-you-go options, such as the one offered by Veriscope. This particular model is designed to adapt organically to the VASP’s activity levels, providing a cost-effective solution for those with fluctuating transaction volumes.</p><p>VASPs must weigh these options carefully, considering both short-term financial implications and long-term compliance strategies. Whether seeking a trial to test the waters, a simple membership to join a community of peers, or a comprehensive service plan for extensive transaction needs, the key lies in selecting a model that aligns with the organization’s transaction patterns, size, and growth trajectory.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision is a testament to a VASP’s commitment to not only meet the regulatory standards but to embrace the evolving digital asset landscape with a forward-thinking approach to compliance and operational excellence. The pay-as-you-go model exemplifies this commitment, offering an agile and scalable financial framework that stands as a testament to Veriscope’s understanding of the sector’s dynamic&nbsp;nature.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

			<p>6th November 2023, Luxembourg –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.terazo.network/">Terazo</a>, a groundbreaking private market investment platform in India, has joined forces with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform, to spearhead the first regulated tokenized real estate asset in India under the regulatory sandbox framework established by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (<a href="https://www.ifsca.gov.in/">IFSCA</a>). IFSCA is a dynamic and forward-thinking regulator committed to driving India’s fintech innovation and propelling the nation to the forefront of the global financial services landscape</p>
<p>Terazo’s involvement and authorization to operate within the sandbox strengthens investor confidence and enables the platform to present premium private assets to a broader range of investors. Historically, private investments, particularly in real estate, have been limited to wealthy individuals, excluding the majority from access. With regulatory approval and Tokeny as its technology partner, Terazo seeks to democratize the market through its flagship project, Oryx and beyond.</p>
<p>Oryx, a ~USD 50 million greenfield development, is the first regulated tokenized real estate project in India. Terazo, through its maiden USD 7 million tokenized fund, will allow qualified primary investors the opportunity to invest in Oryx, from $100,000 and allowing secondary investors with as little as $1,000. The ~8,50,000 sq ft Grade A Commercial Property located in the heart of GIFT SEZ, India’s first global financial services hub, and is positioned as the first step to revolutionize the real estate investment landscape in India.</p>
<p>By collaborating with Tokeny, Terazo has utilized its SaaS tokenization platform to seamlessly issue and administer asset backed tokens on the Polygon blockchain. Leveraging Tokeny’s infrastructure and the open-source <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 protocol</a>, Terazo can seamlessly incorporate compliance measures and automate ownership transfers, simplifying asset management for investors.</p>
<p>This partnership also ensures fully traceable and unalterable cap tables on the blockchain, granting investors unmediated ownership and transparency. Furthermore, Terazo can effortlessly carry out real-time procedures, including the distribution and token recovery tool of tokens to investors.</p>

		 
	 
    We are excited to launch a blockchain-based marketplace, starting from tokenization of real estate assets in India. Our vision is to democratize access to high-quality private assets such as real estate, private equity, venture capital and improve liquidity in the market. With Tokeny's expertise and technology, we are confident that we can deliver a world-class solution for investors.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaan-zaveri-6a35a737/">Shaan Zaveri</a>Partner at Terazo       We're excited to support Terazo's mission to democratize private market investment from India. As one of the world's most populous nations with a booming economy, India has traditionally been a significant contributor to global software solutions for the financial industry. It's indeed time for them to harness this technological prowess for their own financial advancement.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucfalempin/">Luc Falempin</a>CEO at Tokeny

  November 3, 2023 –Toronto, Canada – Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.

<p>November 3, 2023 –Toronto, Canada –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.</p>



<p>As part of its ongoing efforts to maximize available corporate resources, the Company continues to dedicate efforts to its Liquid Avatar Mobile App and Aftermath Islands Metaverse programs. However, given the difficult market conditions, changes in government’s dedicated efforts with digital identity, changing market demands for new fintech services including financial card products, and despite the continuing efforts of Management and the Board of Directors, the Company continues to find itself having difficulty meeting its required capital objectives to further its program development and execution.</p>



<p>On August 21, 2023, the Company announced that it had received a non-binding offer for its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) and its Liquid Avatar Mobile App from a private Swiss based Metaverse and virtual experience organization.&nbsp; The offer was contingent on financing amounts and terms to be agreed between the Companies. The proposed buyer has been unsuccessful in its efforts to raise the requisite financing.&nbsp; The Company remains on cordial terms with the proposed buyer, but the non-binding offer has now expired, and it is not expected to be renewed at this time.</p>



<p>An ongoing result of these difficulties resulted in a cease trade order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission on May 5, 2023.&nbsp; The Company cannot raise capital directly into Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. at this time due to both the cease trade order and its inability to file the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 2022 and its subsequent quarters. The Company anticipates upon raising capital that it will have sufficient resources to file the necessary statements to apply for the removal, in part, or in whole of the cease trade order.&nbsp; However, currently, the Company does not envisage, at least in the foreseeable short term, a revocation of the current cease trade order under the current circumstances.</p>



<p>On June 30, 2023, the Company filed Form 51-102F6V, Statement of Director and Named Executive Officer Compensation.&nbsp; This statement reflected the compensation earned by each member of management and outlined the outstanding unpaid compensation owed to each as of December 31, 2022.&nbsp; No compensation has been paid to management from the date of that filing and accrued compensation now dates back from April 1, 2022, for each member of management.&nbsp; Additional compensation has also been accrued and is outstanding to other employees, consultants, and vendors. Despite the Company’s inability to provide compensation, management, employees and select vendors have largely continued to support the Company’s efforts, including some members of management, on a priority basis, have provided limited loans to the Company for certain critical expenses, which are deemed a related party transaction.</p>



<p>The Company would like to report the resignation of the Chief Financial Officer, Craig McCannell, effective November 1, 2023.&nbsp; Mr. McCannell has offered to make himself available as time allows to support the Company in any future requests related to his former position and / or transition efforts, and we thank him for his years of service to the Company and wish him success in his future endeavors. Management intends to work with the Board of Directors, in due course, to create a selection committee for a new CFO.</p>



<p>“Even under these most difficulty circumstances, the team is working to resolve the current challenges that we are facing as an organization.&nbsp; Further, we believe that the public markets for small and micro-cap markets have greatly suffered under the current market conditions, which may include naked and short selling that has occurred across North America.&nbsp; It is the Company’s belief that it has been the victim of these manipulative trading practices, negatively impacting the Company and our shareholders.&nbsp; We believe that this process has greatly affected the Company’s share price contributing to the Company’s inability to raise the necessary funds to proceed with normal operations, including the regulatory requirements for the Company’s listing on the CSE and compensating its management, employees, and other partners.&nbsp; However, we remain resolved, to the best of our ability, to work to right the ship and continue to move forward,” said David Lucatch, CEO Liquid Avatar Technologies. </p>



<p>The Company continues to dedicate efforts to Aftermath Islands and its complementary programs including Lost Kingdom of T’Sara (LKoT), its play to earn (P2E) platform.&nbsp; In its first year, LKoT users generated over 9.2 million Resource Pack NFTs.&nbsp; The Aftermath Islands metaverse platform has continued to operate in Beta having achieved approximately US$3 Million in gross sales, and subject to further funding by Aftermath Islands, the Company expects Aftermath Islands to continue to develop the platform.</p>



<p>As part of the AIM Creator program (originally Meta Hero Project) Meta Karaoke, an online AI powered Avatar performance platform, was acquired by Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited, as originally announced on August 3, 2022, from Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited, a related party of the Company.&nbsp; Further to this agreement, given the current economic and changing market conditions, Aftermath Islands has not fulfilled its agreed upon obligations to pay the appropriate fees for program sales under the terms of the agreement as well as to continue to fund the further development of the program.&nbsp; &nbsp;The parties have agreed that rather than terminating the agreement, the matter will be settled by transferring back up to 80% ownership of the Meta Karaoke program, which is currently in a development stage, to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited and Oasis Digital Studios will retain a combined initial minority equity interest in the new entity of approximately 20%.&nbsp; Pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”), the transfer back to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited constitutes a “related party transaction”.&nbsp; The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101, specifically: (i) the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.5(b), as the Company’s Common Shares are not listed on a market specified in MI 61-101, and (ii) the minority shareholder approval requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the assets being transferred back do not exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101).&nbsp; A material change report will not be filed by the Company as the transfer does not constitute a material change.</p>

  <p>Thousands of customers have tested or deployed Microsoft Entra ID Governance since it launched on July 1, 2023, seeing the value in governing the identities of their workforce. Many of those customers have asked about extending this governance to the identities of their business guests—contractors, partners, and external collaborators—to more fully follow least privilege access principles while still enabling seamless collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that we're helping organizations to more easily manage this situation by creating a new ID Governance license for business guests. This license will operate on a monthly active usage (MAU) model. Customers will be able to acquire licenses matching their anticipated business guest MAU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help our customers expand least privilege access to their business guests, ID Governance for business guest licenses will be priced at $0.75 per MAU, and we anticipate making them available in spring 2024. In the interim, organizations that govern the identities of their employees with ID Governance can govern the identities of their business guests for no additional cost.&nbsp;Existing Azure AD External ID customers are grandfathered to continue using the subset of identity governance features that are included in Entra ID P1 and P2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why govern the identities of business guests?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business guests are external collaborators who need access to an organization’s resources and applications for a specific purpose and duration. Examples of business guests include contractors, consultants, vendors, or partners. Business guests pose unique challenges for identity governance, as they often have dynamic and unpredictable access needs, and they may not follow internal policies and standards. Without proper governance, business guests can introduce access risks, such as over-privileged accounts, orphaned accounts, or unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Governance helps address these challenges by enabling you to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Define and enforce access policies for business guests, such as requiring sponsorship, approval, and attestation.&nbsp; 
 Automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of business guest accounts, based on their project or contract duration.&nbsp; 
 Monitor and audit the access activities and behaviors of business guests and detect and remediate any anomalies or violations.&nbsp; 
 Provide a method for internal sponsors to review and approve their requests.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this step, our customers can ensure that all identities in their organization are governed.&nbsp;Thank you for partnering with us to help protect your digital estates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This challenge was set to provide insights into a pressing geographic location in Africa, Marsabit, Kenya. The ecological well-being of Marsabit has hung in a delicate equilibrium in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>Climate fluctuations and human undertakings sway the volatility of the general climate in Marsabit, Kenya. This challenge was designed to challenge participants in making accurate, dependable forecasts that could have a profound impact on risk mitigation, insurance pricing, and crop prediction in the region. Data scientists participating in this challenge had the potential to steer the adoption of sustainable practices within the region, as well as have their model and insights shared with decision-makers tackling this&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Ocean was fortunate to host this data challenge in collaboration with <a href="https://shamba.network/">Shamba Network</a>, a leader in monitoring and reporting verification leveraging blockchain technology. Shamba fueled this competition with relevant data sets to conduct our assessment. The data sets provided included:</p>  eVIIRS-NDVI Historical data  Dynamic GeoAPI&nbsp;data  geoJSON coordinates of Marsabit county in&nbsp;Kenya  <p>We received a basket of in-depth reports about this subject. After thorough grading and review by an evaluation committee of experts, we awarded three winners to be compensated for their efforts. The winning reports are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Nicolas Landry ($2500&nbsp;prize) <p>Nicolas’ report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59</a></p><p>A highlight of this report is Nicolas’ fantastic demonstration of walking readers through the NDVI historical data. As&nbsp;follows:</p><p>“This is in the form of 808&nbsp;.tif images. Each contains 912 by 882 pixels, which have a value between 0 and 255, corresponding to the NDVI value at each&nbsp;point.</p><p>The file name gives us an indication of the year the data is from; for example, ea1207_COG.tif is the 7th&nbsp;.tif picture of 2012. We have the tif starting from this one, ea1207_COG, to ea2316_COG, and then six of them are in the form ea2317m_COG and seem to be negatives/acquired through another&nbsp;process.</p><p>Except for 2012, which starts at 07, and 2023, which stops at 16 or 23m, for each year, we have 72&nbsp;.tif pictures that contain the NDVI value on each&nbsp;point.</p><p>From this 0 to 255 pixel value, it is easy to get the NDVI value at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>You want first to convert the pixel values of each&nbsp;.tif file using the&nbsp;formula:</p><p>NDVI = Pixel value-100100</p><p>The dynamic GeoAPI data asset (for the last 1 month, with 10 days lag) of eVIIRS-NDVI for Marsabit county of Kenya (updated).”</p><p>Nicolas had the highest accuracy metrics overall, which indicated the model created in this report was the best fit. However, one thing that stood out to the scoring committee from a qualitative point of view is that Nicolas’ model only predicted 5 days in advance (i.e., one data point since the data has a 5-day granularity.)</p><p>For this and a stellar presentation layout, Nicolas has been awarded 1st place for this data challenge.</p> 2nd place — Andrey Bessalov ($1500&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540</a></p><p>Andrey’s model predicted a season in advance, differentiating this report from other contestants. This seasonal prediction is longer term, hence more useful for taking action (e.g., providing anticipatory aid). So, Andrey’s model had lower accuracy than the winning report (MAE of 0.027 vs. 0.01), but it’s more useful given its longer time&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>Andrey’s preprocessing of the data for time series analysis, particularly testing and handling of stationarity, was a more rigorous approach relative to other reports submitted in this challenge. This could be down to the fact that Andrey used SARIMA while other podium finishing reports used linear regression, and the latter model is not as affected by stationarity in the data as the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Pulled from Andrey’s report, the image below shows the average NDVI values with the addition of peak points highlighted as green and orange (max and min), calculated using the scipy.signal.find_peaks() function.</p><p>We see a clear seasonal structure of the graph with different amplitudes of fluctuations. We can also see that the frequency of fluctuations varies slightly from season to season, but in general, the spread of these values is&nbsp;small.</p><p>We have two seasons per&nbsp;year:</p><p>First season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Feb&nbsp;25  Reaches peak value on May 12 (76 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Aug 22 (178 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Second season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Aug&nbsp;22  Reaches peak value on Nov 29 (99 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Feb 25 (187 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Andrey used more sophisticated models (SARIMA and XGBOOST), while alternative reports only used regression models. While sophisticated models are only sometimes better than simpler ones, our scoring committee thought Andrey explored models more commonly used in time series modeling. This report was also able to show the difference in performance between the two different types of models and thus had a more comprehensive analytical process. Based on these highlights, second place has been awarded to Andrey’s&nbsp;report.</p> 3rd place — Mint ($1000&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4</a></p><p>Mint was awarded a 3rd place finish amongst the participants in this data challenge. Mint’s report provided great detail and insights into the transformation &amp; feature creation portion of this challenge. The two-legged task of data transformation and feature creation included the following scoring sections:</p>  Transformation &amp; Imputation: Address any missing values, outliers, or skewed distributions in the dataset. Justify your chosen methodologies.  Feature Creation: Generate new features that enhance the model’s predictive capability. This could include calculating rolling averages, seasonality components, or other relevant&nbsp;metrics.  <p>To showcase this terrific showcase of data science skills, we can see below from Mint’s report that details Time-Related Feature Engineering:</p><p>In the realm of time-related feature engineering, the goal is often to encapsulate the inherent cycles and periodicities within the data. However, simply throwing raw Ordinal time-related features in the mix is unlikely to yield optimal results. Why? Because These raw features do not inherently understand the cyclical nature of time. For example, a raw month feature would treat December and January as vastly different, not recognizing the seamless transition between the end of one year and the start of the&nbsp;next.</p><p>The image above shows&nbsp;us:</p><p>● Ordinal Features: The chart highlights the limitations of using raw ordinal time-related features, which fail to capture the cyclical nature of time. For example, the transition from December to January appears as a discontinuity.</p><p>● Trigonometric Features: Sine and cosine transformations are depicted to capture the cyclic behavior of time, peaking, and troughing in line with natural cycles. However, they may not capture month-specific nuances effectively.</p><p>● Periodic Spline-Based Features: The graph illustrates the power of using splines, which allow the model to focus on specific months. Using the “periodic” extrapolation parameter ensures a smooth transition between December and January, effectively tackling the discontinuity issue.</p><p>Mint’s ability to visualize the data provided, offer insights &amp; takeaways from the issue, and present these findings in business-ready format were key characteristics that awarded this report a podium&nbsp;finish.</p> Summary <p>This challenge showed a great experiment testing machine learning tactics applied to a real-world issue &amp; a changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>Can other regions globally benefit from predictive analytics from a data challenge with Ocean Protocol?</p><p>Reach out to us in our discord <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">#data-science-hub</a> channel: <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4</a></p><p>To see past, current, and future data challenges sponsored by Ocean, please visit <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges</a>.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Jürgen Schulze</a></p><p>The side effects of (re)generative AI impacting cyber security</p>
<p>Professionally paranoids can't but look at ChatGPT and its siblings from a risk perspective. Well, at least initially. We tend to think in risk vectors, threat actors and alike. Leaving all innovative benefits of the technology aside, there are sensitive elements that require attention. This is how we currently deal with this kind of innovation: Impulse driven …</p>
<p>In a first "impulse", we try to fit what we see into the simple equation where risk equals probability times damage. As a result, we get nervous as, looking at ChatGPT and its siblings, we can do the math neither on probability nor on the potential damage that the use of this technology could bear for us. The deeper we drill, the more questions we get. Scientifically sound answers drip through the tickers only at a slow pace since many of those require research time prior to assessing the effects. And that does not happen over night.</p>
<p>In a second "impulse", we focus on the obvious: the elements, that we are familiar with and which resonate the most in public perception. I.e. those clickbaits which constantly make headlines. This can be the result of a first, publicly prominent traumatic experience in adopting a new technology. It can also be intelligent marketing where our expectations are repetitively framed in order to overshadow those risks, that are not within the "cozy" technology coloured framework of the cyber community.</p>
<p>In a third "impulse", we call for regulation and put the responsibility on the shoulders of the lawmakers as we're lacking all means of dealing with what we can't combat in the very moment. Interestingly enough, that typically does not lead to short term solutions but to a reputation disaster of the cyber community where the classic perception of us hindering innovation is taking over the public discourse. Regulation, on top, is perceived as evil. Even more than the targets of the regulatory efforts. Whoever they are.</p>
<p>In a fourth "impulse", and in absence of any progress in dealing with the tangible and intangible risks, we'll blame what will inevitably go wrong, to those who are putting this new technology to the practice and, in absence of protective measures, awareness and training, unavoidably hit wrong buttons on the way. I call that the "Lieschen Mueller-effect". The blame goes to the weakest link in the chain.</p>
<p>After all those impulses, we'll realize that we wasted time, efforts and money fighting the genie who is irreversibly out of the bottle rather than understanding the various risk factors, what they entail, their interdependence and which experts to consult, in dealing with those and, ultimately, mitigating their impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5394">In our workshop</a>, I'll share with you some of my findings of my book and invite you to jointly revisit a selection of those factors that detrimentally impact our cyber security infrastructure such as:&nbsp;Trust, Credibility, Identity, Authenticity, Context, Value, Bias, Control, Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Convenience, Liability, Ethics, Integrity.</p>
<p>We'll go beyond the obvious and get a better understanding on how to consciously and responsibly put new technology to action. All of that while increasing the security awareness around the use of (re)gen AI.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>I recently had the privilege to spend some time with Kumar and Pallavi to dive into the heart of the <a href="https://www.bhutanndi.com/">Bhutan National Digital Identity (NDI)</a> Project, a pioneering initiative that stands as a testament to Bhutan’s leadership in digital trust.</p>
<p>The origins of Bhutan’s digital program were particularly fascinating for two primary reasons. Firstly, it stemmed from the necessity to empower citizens, especially those in rural areas, with access to essential financial and governmental services. A question of citizen empowerment.. Secondly, the Bhutanese leadership consciously prioritized privacy as a fundamental right for its people. What stands out in this narrative is the clear identification of needs that were not dictated by a technology-first approach. Instead, it was the requirements of empowerment and privacy that naturally led to the adoption of a digital solution, encompassing digital wallets and credentials within privacy-centric frameworks.</p>
<p>This project is not just a technological leap forward but a holistic approach that intertwines the legal, business, and technological threads to weave a robust digital identity framework. I chose to approach our discussion through the lenses of business, legal, and technology, with a deliberate focus on legal aspects first. Why? Because the legal framework is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice of digital identity is built. It’s the underpinning that ensures the rights, privacy, and trust of citizens are not just considered but enshrined.</p>
<p>From there, we transitioned to the business perspective—how this digital identity initiative could catalyze growth, inclusion, and opportunity for all stakeholders. And finally, we touched on technology, the enabler, yet intentionally saved for last. In the grand scheme of things, technology is the tool, not the master; it’s the least important aspect when it comes to the values and impact on the citizens’ lives.</p>
 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Kumar, Pallavi and myself in this podcast include:<br>
<br><br>
</p> 
 
 
 
 Background on the Bhutan National Digital Identity (NDI) Project&nbsp; 
<p>Project Goals and Context – What were the overall goals of the Bhutan NDI project, and how do they relate to the specific context and needs of Bhutan? Seeking to understand the project’s objectives and their alignment with the country’s unique circumstances, particularly in terms of accessibility for rural populations.</p>
<p>Financial Inclusion and Digital Identity – How does focusing on financial inclusion as a starting point influence the approach to digital identity in Bhutan? Exploring the decision to prioritize financial inclusion and how this focus shaped the development of the digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Decentralized Architecture Decision – What research and considerations led to the choice of a decentralized architecture for Bhutan’s digital identity program? Delving into the rationale behind opting for a decentralized system over centralized models like Singapore’s SingPass.</p>
 The Legal Lens 
<p>Legal Framework and Privacy – How is privacy integrated into Bhutan’s legislation, and what legal adjustments were made to accommodate digital identity? Discussing the legal groundwork that enables digital identity in Bhutan and the importance of privacy in this context.</p>
<p>Legislative Process Duration and Challenges – What was the timeline and were there any significant challenges in developing the National Digital Identity Act? Understanding the duration and obstacles encountered while establishing the legal framework for the digital identity system.</p>
<p>Governance and Public-Private Partnership – What does the governance body for the NDI look like, and how does the public-private partnership model function? Examining the structure and evolution of the governance body overseeing the NDI and the role of public-private collaboration.</p>
 The Business&nbsp; Lens 
<p>Business Strategy and Ecosystem Growth – How were use cases developed, and what strategies were employed to grow the ecosystem and foster public-private partnerships? Investigating the process of identifying use cases and the methods used to expand the digital identity ecosystem through stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p>Voluntary Participation – Is participation in the digital ID system optional for Bhutanese citizens? Clarifying whether the digital ID system complements existing identity methods and if it’s mandatory or optional for citizens.</p>
<p>Use Case Categorization – How are use cases categorized and prioritized within the digital identity framework? Seeking insight into the criteria and methodology used to classify and sequence the implementation of various use cases.</p>
<p>Foundational Identity Credential – What does the foundational identity credential look like, and what government records form its basis? Inquiring about the nature of the foundational identity credential and its relationship to existing government-issued IDs.</p>
<p>Private Sector Collaboration – What challenges were faced in educating and gaining buy-in from the private sector for the new digital identity infrastructure? Discussing the efforts to engage the private sector, the educational process involved, and any resistance or obstacles encountered.</p>
<p>Private Sector as Credential Issuers – Are there concerns from the private sector about the risks associated with becoming credential issuers? Addressing the potential hesitations or perceived risks that private sector entities might have regarding issuing digital credentials.</p>
 The Technology&nbsp; Lens 
<p>Technology and Wallet Infrastructure – Why was a decision made to develop a specific wallet for Bhutan’s NDI instead of using existing wallet infrastructures like Apple or Google Wallet? Exploring the reasons behind creating a dedicated wallet for the Bhutan NDI and the considerations involved in this choice.</p>
<p>International Standards and Compatibility – How were international standards considered in the development of Bhutan’s digital identity infrastructure to accommodate foreigners? Understanding the role of international standards in ensuring the digital identity system is compatible with the needs of visitors and expatriates.</p>

<p>Small businesses face special challenges in managing their employee onboarding and offboarding processes with limited resources. Without a fully staffed IT or HR department, there’s often just one person covering “operations” for the whole organization. And in some companies, someone with a totally unrelated job ends up running these functions.</p>
<p>We’re like that, actually. <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">As a startup</a>, YeshID has a small staff. In addition to my founder duties, I’m the one to handle IT employee onboarding and offboarding for our team. And that’s the way we want it for now — we’re keeping overhead low so we can concentrate on building the best product. But that doesn’t mean we want to skimp on laying a good foundation for tomorrow.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, efficiency and simplicity are so important. It’s not just about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-non-technical-guide-how-to-streamline-employee-onboarding-in-google-workspace/">providing an email address for new employees</a>. You have to add them to the correct organizations and groups in your Google Workspace; keep track of who has permissions for what applications; track the number and cost of app and software licenses, keep up with which teams own which services, and the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology can help you streamline, templatize, and automate your user onboarding and offboarding procedures. In this post, I’ll talk about what to look for in a tool.</p>
 User-friendly IT onboarding and offboarding 
<p>The first thing you should consider when evaluating an onboarding solution is its user-friendliness. You need a tool that is easy for both administrators (aka you) and users to navigate. The last thing you want on your already overloaded calendar is extensive training for a complicated system. Look for a solution with an intuitive interface and a straightforward setup process.</p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of a user-friendly onboarding solution is its ability to templatize and automate repetitive tasks. Look for a solution that offers customizable templates, task assignments, and email notifications. This not only saves time but also minimizes the chances of errors. You’ll also want to make sure the tool lets your employees request access to the apps they need — and that access is routed to the appropriate approver.</p>
 A secure and compliant employee onboarding and offboarding tool 
<p>Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Look for features like passwordless encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Ensure that the onboarding solution aligns with these requirements. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs.</p>
 New employee onboarding and offboarding that grows with you 
<p>Your business may be small today, but tomorrow’s looking bright! Consider whether the onboarding solution can grow with you. It should be able to accommodate a growing number of users without significant disruptions. Scalability ensures that you won’t outgrow your onboarding tool as your business expands. And with the right tools, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Beware the SSO tax</a> on this one though. Some access management solutions require you to advance your engineering practices far beyond what most small- to medium-sized businesses need. Don’t settle for a solution that requires you to jump over unnecessary hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
 Cost-effective IT onboarding solutions 
<p>Until someone invents the money tree, it’s essential to consider the overall cost of the tool in relation to the value it provides. This includes licensing fees, implementation costs, and ongoing maintenance. Make sure you’re getting the features and support you need without breaking your budget. A cost-effective solution should offer a good balance between functionality and affordability.</p>
<p>The flip side of this one is to make sure you’re not signing up for a solution that you’ll have to grow into fast. Many of the options in this space are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
 The best onboarding and offboarding for small businesses 
<p>Identity and access management in the 21st century means digital onboarding, provisioning of the hundred-and-one software apps your org uses, plus traditional hardware setup. It’s become complex (and often frustrating) for both managers and employees. Finding the right onboarding solution for your small business can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your onboarding and offboarding processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 
 Templatize and schedule onboarding and offboarding tasks to set up a repeatable process for ease and speed. 
 Assign application administrator(s) then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper owners. 
 Track provisioning/de-provisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. 
 Empower employees to initiate requests for new application access that are automatically routed to the proper application administrator. 
 And because it’s in beta, YeshID Onboard is free (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">yes, like free free</a>) for the first 100 companies to sign up (must be in Google Workspace and have 50-250 employees). 
 
<p>Start streamlining your onboarding and offboarding processes without the need for budget approval or credit card information. You’ll also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. Take something off your never-ending to-do list and <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">sign up today</a>.</p>

<p>Holochain is a framework that can augment the powers of blockchains by offering control, trust, and transparency in a local, private network — while also being able to reference a specific transaction, action, or other data on a public blockchain. </p><p>In a Holochain application every action is validated and has a cryptographically signed provenance. This validation does not require consensus, making it hyper scalable. It does this by using a mix of technologies from BitTorrent, git, and GNUPG. </p><p>The Fractal Tribute game is a Holochain application designed to address several technical challenges that groups and applications often encounter when looking for ways to deliver NFT content that is both dynamic and decentralized. It also addresses the challenge of bridging state across decentralized systems, in this case from Holochain to an EVM blockchain. Those technical challenges are solved in Fractal Tribute which enables permissionless minting of dynamic content, facilitates the distribution of raised funds based on player activity, all whilst ensuring compatibility with existing NFT metadata consumers, like OpenSea.</p> Permissionless Minting of Content <p>Although there is growing popularity for entirely on-chain NFTs, for the most part NFT content is stored somewhere off-chain for reasons of scalability. It is prohibitively expensive to store content on a blockchain. So, the usual approaches to this would be to either store the content on a network like IPFS or Arweave, or put it behind a centralized API. The former is obviously the preferable option, however if you’d like the content to be dynamic you’re still left with a problem as both IPFS and Arweave only store static assets.&nbsp;</p><p>This problem is solved in Fractal Tribute. Players are able to create artwork with each other in a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Holochain app, then permissionlessly mint it on-chain. The solution involves creating a unique ID for each NFT that combines the content and your wallet address (ID = hash(content + wallet)). This ID is generated within the EVM smart contract and a matching reference is created on the Holochain app. Because it is partly generated from the wallet doing the minting, it makes it impossible for anyone else to create the same ID. A binding between your Holochain agent and EVM wallet is established, ensuring that only you can mint NFTs for your content on both networks.</p> Making the Game Compatible with OpenSea <p>To ensure that content from the Holochain app can be seamlessly integrated with platforms like OpenSea, the project utilizes Holo gateways. These gateways are hosted on Holo, a distributed hosting platform for Holochain apps, and can request content for a specific token ID from the app and generate the necessary metadata in JSON format.</p><p>Going forward, this approach has the potential to be applied in various scenarios where tokenization of events or assets on a peer-to-peer Holochain network is desirable, including identity solutions for private Holochain networks, audits, or backing for real-world assets on-chain.</p> Distribution of Funds <p>The challenge is to fairly distribute funds raised in the minting of the limited open edition NFTs based on a percentage of contribution to the artwork produced in the game. So far, the only link between Holochain and the NFT contract is by ID. The blockchain has no awareness of player contributions in the Holochain app. To address this, a "game steward" concept is introduced. This steward, a participant in the Holochain app, calculates each participant's contributions at the end of the game and signs the percentage claim of the fund pool with their EVM private key. The smart contract on the EVM side only accepts data signed by the game steward, allowing individuals to make their claims. While this system depends on the honesty of the steward, the transparency of the process and the ability to hold the steward accountable mitigate risks.The result? All players of the game will receive a percentage of the sale of any NFT minted during the game.</p> New Utility <p>Three primary technical challenges have limited the ability of NFTs to be both dynamic and decentralized in the current ecosystem. These can be solved by bridging between a Holochain app and an EVM. The NFT is effectively minted on both networks by the binding of a Holochain agent and an EVM wallet that results in a single NFT ID. This demonstration provides significant, new utility to the NFT space and broader Web3 ecosystem.</p>

<p>Demands by residents for contactless services have accelerated the need for digital government services, but rampant identity fraud is impeding digital transformation and costing taxpayers millions. Stopping fraud means blocking synthetic and stolen identities during the application process and securing resident accounts from phishing and social engineering attacks aimed at account takeover.. At 1Kosmos, we’ve made it our mission to fortify digital identities and empower both government agencies and citizens for a secure and seamless digital future.</p>
 The Power of Credential Service Providers (CSPs) 
<p>A Credential Service Provider (CSP) conducts identity verification during enrollment and subsequently validates identity during each access attempt. This streamlines the allocation of limited resources for organizations, allowing them to efficiently provide online services to eligible individuals. By expediting identity verification procedures and ensuring the security and convenience users anticipate, agencies expedite the delivery of accessible services to genuine residents.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos CSP managed service offers a contemporary, user-friendly approach to self-service identity verification (e.g., IAL2) and authentication (e.g., AAL2) that works seamlessly on any device, at any time, with a remarkable accuracy rate exceeding 99%. Equipped with an identity-backed, reusable credential, residents gain effortless access to multiple websites, applications, and services. They also gain control over and securely manage the sharing of their personal information, simplifying both privacy and compliance management.</p>
<p>Leveraging a IAL2 certified Full <a>CSP</a> enables organizations to sidestep the constant arms race of security challenges. With 1Kosmos CSP managed services, the burden of staying ahead of the latest security threats, relationships with bureaus, and deep fake mitigation is shouldered by us. Government agencies and organizations can focus on delivering efficient online services to legitimate residents, confident in the knowledge that their security needs are expertly managed.</p>
 The Role of 1Kosmos in Strengthening Digital Identities 
<p>1Kosmos BlockID has emerged as a true game-changer in the realm of <a>identity verification</a> and authentication. Our platform matches users’ real biometrics with their government issued IDs to prove their identities each time they access government services. Through its intuitive, user-friendly interface, residents can seamlessly access various sites, applications, and services with a reusable, secure credential in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By automating manual identity and credential verification processes, our platform guarantees a secure, rules-based workflow that significantly minimizes errors. With its adherence to the rigorous NIST 800-63-3 standards and verifiable data registries, government agencies can conduct stringent Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) verification, issuing digitally signed Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credentials. This process lays the foundation for a secure digital environment, fostering a relationship of trust between citizens and the government.</p>
<p>In the face of increasing threats like phishing and cyber-attacks, 1Kosmos BlockID further enhances security measures through its support for biometric passwordless multi-factor authentication, leveraging a flexible offering of phishing-resistant authenticators to suit many different types of users. Our flexible identity proofing mechanism allows for adaptable levels of identity assertion, catering to the evolving needs of both government agencies and customers. With a comprehensive suite of identification methods, including device biometrics and LiveID, we ensure that every access request is met with the appropriate balance of security and convenience.</p>
 1Kosmos Digital Wallet: The Ultimate Secure Platform 
<p>Moreover, 1Kosmos BlockID’s digital wallet serves as the ultimate secure platform, enabling users to verify their identities in a private and convenient manner. With the assurance that the digital wallet remains securely in the hands of the rightful user, government agencies can streamline management across multiple online services seamlessly. The platform supports an unlimited number of personas or accounts, binding user biometrics via the IAL2 workflow to FIDO2 certified credentials, effectively eliminating the need for usernames or passwords. This advancement empowers users and governments alike, facilitating a smooth transition to a more comprehensive array of online services and offerings.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we take immense pride in being at the forefront of digital identity and security solutions. Our mission is to empower government agencies to navigate the challenges of the digital era with unwavering confidence. Join us in shaping a future where digital identity remains secure, and the trust between citizens and their governments is the cornerstone of a thriving digital society. With 1Kosmos, the future of digital identity is not just a distant dream, but a reality that is within reach. For more information, please watch our recent <a>on-demand webinar</a>.</p>

 An economic stroke of genius or a death knell to a thriving community? IDnow investigates how the Brazilian gambling community feels about the upcoming regulations. 



 



<p>While Brazilian gambling operators eagerly await the approval of online gambling regulations, and the resulting new revenue streams, Brazilian players have rather mixed feelings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;July 2023, an <a href="https://igamingbrazil.com/legislacao/2023/07/26/regulamentacao-das-apostas-esportivas-6-em-cada-10-brasileiros-acreditam-que-sera-positiva/">opinion poll on upcoming Brazilian gambling regulation</a> revealed that only 64% of Brazilians&nbsp;thought that regulating sports betting in Brazil would have a positive impact on the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The top benefit of the regulation, according to 45% of respondents, was that the regulation would help reduce fraud. Other benefits mentioned were more security for bettors, and transparency of information offered by bookmakers, at 40% and 39% respectively. Around half of respondents said they would continue to bet with the same regularity as before, but 31% believed that they would bet less because of the regulation.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on players? 



<p>While there are clear economic opportunities for Brazilian operators and the government, there are also concerns in the betting community that the new rules, which would require operators to have an office in Brazil, could drive international operators away, which in turn would affect sponsorship opportunities in, for example, the Brazilian football league. An incredible <a href="https://www.gamesbras.com/english-version/2023/3/30/betting-sites-dominate-brazilian-serie-and-sponsoring-39-teams-36411.html">39 out of 40 football teams</a> in the nation’s top two leagues are sponsored by international betting sites. One of the possible consequences of the regulation is a withdrawal of sponsorship, which would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12brzcq/clubes_se_posicionam_sobre_regulamenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_das/">negatively affect the competitiveness of Brazilian clubs.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players are also showing their opposition to the way in which they will be taxed. As the proposals aim to only tax&nbsp;profits, and not factor in a player’s history of losses, players are pointing out that as most gamblers lose money most of the time, the few times they will win, they will be taxed, which they believe is unfair. The <a href="https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vida-e-cidadania/como-sites-apostas-esportivas-contornam-lei-antijogo-pais/">rate payable is 30% (withheld by operators),</a> and players must declare winnings when filing income tax.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, some Brazilian players believe that some of the higher spending and professional bettors will simply utilize VPN services to continue playing on international sites.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on operators? 



<p>One of Brazilian operator’s chief objections to the new regulation is the cost (BR$30 million) of a Brazilian gambling license (read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazliian gambling license structure here</a>), which they say is too much, especially when compared to other markets, such as <a href="https://brazilian.report/tech/2021/09/03/online-gambling-disabilities-venture-capital/">Malta (5%), Greece (5%) and the United Kingdom (15%),</a> which all arguably offer more attractive regulatory environments. However, the UK is itself going through considerable changes to its regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the plans being undertaken by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">‘From government paper to UKGC Plans: What’s next for the UK’s gambling sector.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many operators and players are also understandably wary as to where exactly the 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue tax will be generated. Many players have expressed concerns that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12q8yd8/apostas_esportivas_ganhador_ter%C3%A1_de_pagar_30_de/?rdt=33846">operators may opt for extra fees, such as account maintenance fees and withdrawal fees</a>.</p>



 A nation ready to risk it all. 



<p>It’s clear to see that&nbsp;while the general population, and of course, the Brazilian gambling industry is in favor of regulating sports betting, due to the anticipated positive impact on the country’s economy, the view from the Brazilian betting community is mostly negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is widespread fear that new restrictions could affect the competitiveness of the sector, resulting in fewer active operators, a deterioration in odds, the appearance of additional fees on platforms and even a decline in the quality of national football. Of course, it could also result in players simply deciding to flee to foreign platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as the Brazilian government expects&nbsp;to receive between BR$6 billion to BR$12 billion per year when the regulated market is operational, it appears to be a risk it’s prepared to take.</p>



 Play on. 



<p>Identity proofing and fraud protection are two areas that will become paramount in the new era of Brazilian gambling.</p>



<p>With IDnow, you can rest assured that our highly configurable platform works across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">including gambling</a>. Our advanced identity proofing features like Proof of Address, Cadastro de Pessoa Física (CPF) validation, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> checks ensures Brazilian gambling operators can offer a safer and more secure gaming experience.

The second step is to leverage the built-in ForgeRock relationship model so that your data is arranged in a way that best supports your specific business needs. Read the details of steps one and two <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/grow-your-business-identity-data">here</a>. And now let's explore the third step.</p>

 Step 3: Scale Your Operations 

<p>Connecting your data silos and designing the desired relationships among different types of identity data lays a strong foundation for a converged identity and access management (IAM) platform. This concept can hold all of your identities in a single system while catering to the unique needs of different identity populations: customers, brands, partners, suppliers, employees, and devices. However, the benefits of bringing everything together under one roof can also introduce new complexity issues if you don't have a scalable way for your IT staff to manage ongoing operations and maintenance.</p>

<p>The identity management capabilities of the ForgeRock Identity Cloud include a feature known as the Organization Model, or Org Model for short. The Org Model is what helps you bring everything together to operationalize your identity data in a way that scales across your IT teams. The Org Model is an out-of-the-box identity object that has pre-defined relationships with other identity objects, such as users, roles, and applications. It empowers you to quickly create a hierarchy of "organizations," each with their own unique identity and attributes that support the tailored experiences you need to deliver for different populations of identities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The easiest way to understand the Org Model is to imagine the organizational chart of any large company. Visualize interconnected boxes arranged in a top-down hierarchy. The CEO at the top maintains overall control and responsibility for the company, but also delegates specific responsibilities to leaders in finance, HR, legal, marketing, and other functional areas. Those leaders have specific autonomy to define the boxes in their organizations and the people within them. In the same way, our Org Model empowers you to define any kind of hierarchical identity structure that represents the reality of your business. And just like the company's organizational structure, our identity Org Model enables delegation so that the IT administrators that are closest to a given identity population can be put in charge of managing the organization, the users in it, and all the granular permissions and customizations required by that group of identities. This is the first half of how you scale your identity management operations.</p>

<p>With the ability to implement a scalable span of control through delegated administration, the Org Model is similar to how a company's organizational structure scales as it grows and changes over time. Let's look at one more analogy to understand the second half of scaling your identity management operations: inheritance.</p>

<p>Imagine an organization with many franchises around the country or even the world. Whether the franchise is a fast food chain, or an automotive dealership, certain policies and multi-brand experiences need to remain consistent. Other facets of the business need to be flexible to accommodate different supply chains, partners, and local government policies. This is why inheritance capabilities are so important. With the ForgeRock Org Model, changes made to the top-level organization, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-Orgs without requiring administrative intervention. And where required, separate organizational structures can maintain distinct policies, all subject to the requirements of the business.</p>

<p>Take the example of an automotive manufacturer looking to manage all of its independent dealerships and you giving them the flexibility to manage their business while maintaining a certain level of central visibility and control. The top CEO box in the manufacturer's Org Model gives the company this level of control in their world of digital identity. Next, the company creates Level 2 boxes, or "Orgs," for each of their defined regions in the U.S. This gives regional managers a level of control over the dealerships in their territory. The Level 2 boxes are connected and roll up to the Level 1 CEO box, just as in a company's organizational chart</p>

<p>At the third level, new Org boxes are created, which also have their own unique identity, relationships in the identity hierarchy, and the ability to have custom attributes. These Orgs are created to represent each dealership. And the owner of each dealership is given the authority (delegation) to manage certain aspects of the user experience. These could be different multifactor authentication (MFA) enrollment choices, for example. Then there's the inheritance factor, which dictates certain configuration consistencies across the entirety of the organization–maybe in this case a password length and complexity policy.</p>

 Using Identity Data to Drive the Runtime User Experience 

<p>Now that your identity data is organized according to your business needs and you have a scalable process for managing the maintenance and dynamic changes that are the reality of your business, it's time to put the data to work on the front lines.</p>

<p>This is where identity data meets access orchestration. With the right data at your disposal and an access management system with dynamic orchestration capabilities, each user's experience can be tailored to their specific needs. In one moment, a customer of yours enters their account name and, based on the data retrieved and fed into the orchestration workflow, this customer experiences a low-friction, passwordless login that is personalized. At the very same moment, one of your suppliers enters their account name into a different application and receives a tailored MFA experience based on the security negotiated between your company and the supplier's company. For this supplier, union rules prevent management from requiring their users to authenticate on their personal mobile phones. So based on your identity data, including this supplier's Org Model affiliation, the user receives a sign-in link by email. When the user clicks on the link from the computer, the user signs in with a passwordless experience that doesn't require the use of a phone.</p>

 We sit down with the Head of Compliance at Hero to discuss money laundering trends, Russians and real estate, and how companies can protect their business and customers from fraud. 



 



 What are some of the new trends you have seen in money laundering in 2023? 



<p>In 2023, the landscape of money laundering has shifted significantly, with the emergence of new methods and the adaptation of old ones. One of the most striking trends is the increasing use of cryptocurrencies. The anonymity provided by these currencies allows scammers to transfer significant funds without detection. In 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/crypto-fraud-in-2023-how-can-security-teams-fight/">hackers stole $4.3 billion</a>&nbsp;worth of cryptocurrency, marking a 37% increase from 2021. Most of these scams were carried out through social media, highlighting the need for stricter regulation in this area.</p>



<p>Furthermore, real estate remains a favored sector for money laundering. The high value of properties and the ability to transact in cash make it an attractive tool. For instance, in February 2022, Transparency International revealed that Russians linked to corruption charges had invested&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/uk-money-laundering-stats-russia-suspicious-wealth">£1.5 billion in the UK real estate market</a>. This trend underscores the importance of implementing stricter regulations to monitor and regulate real estate transactions.</p>



 Is there a noticeable difference in the money laundering techniques deployed in different countries, for example in France, compared to the UK? 



<p>While the basic techniques of money laundering are universal, each country has its nuances based on its regulation, economy, and culture. In France, for instance, the regulation is quite stringent, with bodies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/glossaire/acpr/">Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution&nbsp;(ACPR)</a>&nbsp;closely monitoring financial activities. This might push criminals to adopt more sophisticated methods or use intermediaries to launder money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, with a broader financial market and a significant presence of international finance, techniques might be more varied, ranging from shell companies to complex real estate transactions. Moreover, Brexit might have created new opportunities for money launderers due to changes in information-sharing and oversight agreements.</p>



 In France, the regulatory landscape for identity verification has changed dramatically with the introduction of PVID. Do you think PVID, and other government-approved Trust frameworks make a difference in rates of fraud and money laundering? How do you see PVID changing in the coming years? 



<p>The PVID is a tangible example of how regulation can adapt to the modern challenges of identity verification. By combining document verification with facial recognition, it provides an added layer of security, thereby reducing the risk of identity theft. This has a direct impact on fraud and money laundering rates, as it’s more challenging for criminals to deceive this system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as with any technology, it’s crucial to remain vigilant and adapt to new methods that criminals might develop to bypass these measures. In the future, I anticipate PVID to incorporate newer technologies and verification methods as they become available, while strengthening existing protocols.</p>



 What role does technology play in the proliferation of fraud and money laundering? Are there any new uses that are particular causes for concern for you? 



<p>Technology has always been a double-edged sword when it comes to fraud and money laundering. On one hand, it provides innovative tools to enhance fraud detection and prevention like advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, which can help pinpoint suspicious transaction patterns that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, technology also gives fraudsters new means to impersonate or deceive individuals. Deepfakes, for instance, can be used to fraudulently open accounts or extort money. Moreover, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, criminals have found new ways to launder money outside of traditional financial systems.</p>



 Besides adhering to regulation, what else can companies do to protect their business and customers from fraud? 



<p>Beyond mere regulatory compliance, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to protect their operations and clients. This involves investing in cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analytics, to detect and prevent fraud in real-time. Utilizing public and private databases can also assist in verifying the authenticity of clients and transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, data pooling among financial institutions can provide a holistic view of suspicious activities. Lastly, continuous training of employees on the latest fraud techniques and prevention best practices is paramount. Companies must also foster a culture of compliance, where every employee understands their role in fraud prevention.</p>



 What regulations/obligations should different sectors, including the crypto, gambling and financial sectors, expect in the coming years? What changes would you like to see implemented? 



<p>The rapid evolution of technology and financial markets means that regulation must adapt accordingly. In the cryptocurrency sector, we can expect increased regulation, especially in countries that have yet to adopt robust regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This might include stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the gambling sector, regulation might focus more on preventing gambling addiction and ensuring operators aren’t taking advantage of vulnerable individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the traditional financial sector, data pooling and increased use of artificial intelligence might be encouraged to detect and prevent fraud and money laundering.</p>



 Are there different types of fraud risks that a traditional financial service needs to be aware of compared to a fintech? 



<p>Fintechs and traditional financial institutions face unique challenges when it comes to fraud. Fintechs, especially in their early stages, might have limited resources and feel pressure to quickly onboard clients, potentially making them less vigilant. It’s a delicate balance between risk exposure and the need for growth. However, fintechs also have the advantage of being agile and can quickly adopt new technologies to combat fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, large financial institutions, while having significant resources for staffing, tools, and training, have to deal with massive transaction and onboarding volumes. This can make detecting individual fraudulent transactions more challenging. However, the future looks promising with the prospect of data pooling among financial institutions and increased use of AI for real-time fraud detection.</p>

<p>Fractal Tribute is a collaborative art game built on Holochain and inspired by r/place.&nbsp;</p><p>In this real time game, players make “moves” by placing pixels on a shared canvas, building upon all previous moves, and thus coordinating to draw new patterns and art. Each player is limited in the number of pixels they can place at one time, requiring them to work with other players to shape the canvas into particular designs. It’s a game of community building, artistic expression, and collaborative play.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can also take snapshots of the collaborative art after they make their moves. These snapshots are simultaneously minted as limited open edition NFTs on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in this case, using the Polygon network.</p> The Tech Stack <p>The game is built on the Holochain application framework, which manages app networking, data validity, and databasing in a peer-to-peer system without need for a central server. The application runs locally on players computers and is networked between them for collaboration.</p><p>When users sign into the game, they are required to bind an ERC-20 wallet to their instance of Fractal Tribute. It is this binding between Holochain private keys and the crypto wallet private keys that enables full validation of both the art itself and the NFT.&nbsp;</p><p>The Holo hosting network is used as a gateway to the Fractal Tribute application so that anyone can fetch validated content directly from the peer-to-peer game using HTTPS. These always-on nodes provide an easy, low-friction way for players and non-players to view NFT payloads — allowing a marketplace like OpenSea to make them available for purchase.&nbsp;</p> Why Connect Holochain and Blockchain? <p>Fractal Tribute was built as a demonstration of the possibilities opened by combining Holochain and Blockchain. But it is just one possible arrangement of application rules and smart contracts.</p><p>In Fractal Tribute:&nbsp;</p>  Only the original creator of the asset can mint the NFT.&nbsp;  Holochain lets you audit an accountable history of all interactions with the underlying asset. This ensures data provenance.&nbsp;  Storage of the NFT asset is distributed.  Blockchain validates the token in a public space, Holochain validates the underlying asset created in a private application.  A single, shared NFT ID referenceable in both spaces.  <p>Essentially Holochain enables unforgeable NFTs because owners can prove ownership of the NFT on a blockchain, and they can trace back to the digital asset and confirm that the NFT was minted by the creator and owner of the underlying asset.</p><p>When an artist takes a snapshot, they create an immutable bundle of actions that is cryptographically signed within the app directly. Because every move or brushstroke is signed with a private key, every artist involved in the game can audit who did what and when.&nbsp;</p><p>The snapshot is simultaneously minted as a limited open edition NFT on the Polygon network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of a URL that points to the artwork on a centralized server, which may be taken down or otherwise controlled by someone with admin privileges, NFT payloads created in Fractal Tribute are held in the distributed Holochain application where they were created, which is then bridged by a gateway node running on the distributed Holo hosting network for public visibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain’s data storage isn’t just decentralized, it’s distributed. This means that as a player you will always hold a verifiable copy of your own data, at the same time as it is backed up across the network. With accountable histories, data hashing, and distributed storage, Holochain provides a high level of security in comparison to IPFS and traditional client-server models.</p> What’s Next? <p>Fractal Tribute is a proof of concept, showing the ways that blockchain wallets and Holochain agents can be bound together and what possibilities that binding enables. The interaction between a fully distributed application for collaborative art and an NFT marketplace built on blockchain is just one possible arrangement where we can see the multiplier effects of these technologies working together.&nbsp;</p><p>How will this pattern be used? We see the possibility for creator economies not based around centralized platforms, we see value creation which doesn’t require consensus, we see games where players control their identity and data, we see new ways to create trust and provenance on the web.&nbsp;</p><p>What possibilities do you see?</p>

  <p>In today's digital landscape, the threat of malicious bots and botnets looms large over the retail industry. Manipulated by cybercriminals, these devices and networks can wreak havoc on your e-commerce platform and disrupt your customers' experience.</p>

<p>Bots and botnets are able to vigilantly monitor your inventory for must-have items, pretend to be customers, and swiftly buy up your inventory (before your actual customers have a chance to) — often reselling the items at inflated prices on third-party websites.</p>

<p>Botnets are everywhere, and this type of activity happens all the time. This practice not only impacts your sales, but it also creates a negative customer experience for customers who are eager to buy the latest and greatest item, only to find that it is already sold out. Retailers are not only left to deal with frustrated customers, but often also find themselves processing numerous returns if the bad actors fail to resell the items. The only people who benefit from this trend are the cybercriminals.</p>

 The Crucial Role Digital Identity Plays In Combating Botnets 

<p>The key to fighting back against bots and botnets is to quickly identify and authenticate those behind online activities. For example, retailers must quickly discern whether their products are being purchased by a legitimate, loyal customer who has been eagerly waiting for a new product release — or by an impersonal, automated bot from the darknet.</p>

<p>To do this, you need the ability to examine contextual identity information and use it to make informed decisions. At the same time, rather than burdening your legitimate customers with onerous authentication steps, you need to make sure the process is invisible. This involves striking a careful balance between customer experience and security.</p>

 Beating the Bots With Identity and Access Management (IAM) 

<p>ForgeRock's enterprise-grade digital identity platform enables you to identify and stop bots and botnets without driving away your real customers. With <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Authentication</a>, you can use AI-driven threat detection, plus a range of environmental, contextual, and behavioral factors, to make authentication and authorization decisions in real time — unmasking the bots. Intelligent Access also adapts login and checkout journeys to make them more challenging and complicated when there's a suspected bot. Adversely, legitimate, authenticated customers are able to check out without any hurdles whatsoever.</p>

<p>Don't let retail bots and botnets ruin your customers' experiences or your bottom line. Get an in-depth examination of how a retail bot works and how you can leverage ForgeRock to defend against bots today and as they evolve in the future by reading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/block-bots-keep-your-customers-coming-back">Block the Bots to Keep Your Customers Coming Back</a>.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>HYPR is expanding its original mission to take a more comprehensive approach to Identity Assurance. We have introduced two cutting-edge products, HYPR Adapt and HYPR Affirm that round out the HYPR platform.</p> 
<p>We grew from a small team around a table to a multi-team organization with a range of talented specialists. Arriving at this milestone after many lessons learnt, we took a pause and looked at what worked over the last 5 years, and how we could apply them going forward.</p> 
 Exciting New Changes  
<p>As part of these changes, we are excited to announce that <a href="mailto:baljeet.sandhu@hypr.com">Baljeet Sandhu</a>, formerly our Chief Architect has been promoted to CTO. Baljeet joined us several years ago and his contributions have been invaluable to the business around too many areas to count. Robert Panebianco, is promoted to the chief architect position after many great years of service here at HYPR. Rob has been our resident cryptography expert and has done amazing things in our efforts to build a highly scalable and secure SaaS platform.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="mailto:shaun.gerner@hypr.com">Shaun Gerner</a>, who was one of our first engineering hires and first mobile engineer many years ago has been promoted to VP of Engineering. He is now responsible for running the various feature teams at HYPR who have been working with Shaun shoulder to shoulder to deliver the amazing products our customers use today.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We’re also happy to announce that Sal Rizzari is now our official VP of Infrastructure. Sal’s ability to organize a team to automate and deploy HYPR at scale has been a force multiplier for our development teams as well as our customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Our Engineering Philosophy&nbsp;  
 Solving a Problem&nbsp;  
<p>Building software is, at its core, an exercise in solving a problem for your customers; understanding the things that matter to them. As we grow we want to preserve HYPR’s traditional cycle of working with customers, delivering the next iteration, listening and refining.</p> 
<p>With this in mind, we organized around delivery-oriented feature teams. Each team includes the complete set of specialists needed to deliver the solution — developers, QA, Product and DevOps. The team takes on a customer problem and owns solutioning through delivery. They build, own and operate. It's a close group which relies on each member operating with a high context and owning their role in the team delivery. Working with a high context and problem solving mindset is fun!</p> 
 Iterating Fast  
<p>We believe that software is a process of continuous refinement and ideation. This can only happen if we move forward quickly, in small steps. We love showing our early work to feature partners and gathering feedback. Some of our best ideas have in fact, come from our customers! However, this needs to be balanced with the stability needs of a critical platform like HYPR. We facilitate this by releasing all of our features in alpha, beta and GA cycles. The expectations and guardrails in each of these are well-defined internally. Most of the iteration happens in alpha and starts tapering off as we approach GA. At GA, change control and release compatibility guidelines kick in.</p> 
 Using the Best Tools  
<p>The best available tools are necessary to enable our teams. HYPR’s tech stack uses proven platforms, like JDK, .Net and Node. We upgrade aggressively and are on the latest stable within a few months of release. Being techies at heart, we continuously watch and experiment with a wide variety of new tech. Native images for Java, Flutter for mobile UIs, WebAssembly in browsers, are just a few of the things we evaluated in 2023. Experimentation usually starts on non-critical utilities and moves gradually to core if proven successful.&nbsp;</p> 
 Baking Security In  
<p>We take a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-security-company-with-a-security-first-approach">security-first approach</a>, baking it into the design at all stages. Security design is vetted by our in-house experts. During build, automated checks in our CI pipeline continuously run static and dynamic analysis. Additionally, separate scans continuously look for CVE vulnerabilities in our libraries. We take CVEs seriously. A CVE trip will break the build at HYPR. During the testing phase, our in-house experts try to compromise the solution. The findings are reviewed with the feature team. But we don’t stop there — we invite even deeper scrutiny through our public HackerOne program.&nbsp;</p> 
 Automation Everywhere  
<p>Running a successful SaaS platform needs fast testing feedback and consistency in deployments. HYPR got this right early on. We treat our test automation code with the same standards as our production code and it lives alongside in code repositories. Highly recommend it! Our DevOps team brings similar discipline to the job. Manual configuration is for experiments only. For everything else there is Infra As Code (IAC).</p> 
 Doing More With Less  
<p>At HYPR we have always taken a pragmatic approach to building software. We choose good tools and keep the number of frameworks limited. We endeavor to apply these uniformly across teams. This gives us an advantage of being able to move people between teams and get up to speed quickly. On a new team, engineers can focus on the difference in product; the tech is already familiar.</p> 
 Our Team and the Work Ahead  
<p>HYPR aims to be the best place for engineers to work. We highly value all team members and are committed to individual empowerment aligned around not just our engineering philosophy but shared values of transparency, collaboration, impact and adaptability. I am extremely excited for our engineering voyage ahead.</p>

<p>With more and more countries implementing the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">FATF Travel Rule</a>, it has become crucial to be prepared and choose <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-ultimate-explainer-on-the-travel-rule-solution#:~:text=Shyft%20Veriscope%3A%20A%20Seamless%20%26%20Privacy,data%20retention%20features%20stand%20out.">a Travel Rule Solution</a> that can meet all your needs. But that is easier said than done, as there are several Travel Rule Solutions available in the market today, each with its specific set of features and functionalities.</p><p>In this analysis, we will juxtapose Veriscope’s features against other notable solutions in the market to provide a clearer picture of where each stands in addressing the challenges and needs of VASPs concerning Travel Rule compliance.</p> Decentralization <p>While Veriscope, Sygna, and TRUST all champion a decentralized approach, it’s Veriscope’s commitment to decentralization that truly stands out. By ensuring that its operations aren’t tied to a single point, Veriscope minimizes vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity.</p><p>This decentralized foundation, when combined with its other robust features, positions Veriscope as a holistic solution in a decentralized ecosystem.</p> No Centralized Storage of&nbsp;PII <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, VerifyVasp, TRP, TransactID, and Trust, places a high emphasis on user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>After all, in a world where data is the new gold, the decentralized storage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) becomes pivotal. And by ensuring PII isn’t stored centrally, Veriscope greatly reduces the risks of data breaches, guaranteeing users a safer environment for their&nbsp;data.</p> Open Source <p>Veriscope and TransactID have embraced the open-source model, a testament to their commitment to transparency and innovation.</p><p>This makes a big difference, as open-source platforms invite collective intelligence, allowing a community of developers to contribute, detect vulnerabilities, and enhance the system. It also ensures the platform remains up-to-date and robust against evolving&nbsp;threats.</p> Automatic Counterparty VASP Discovery <p>Veriscope and TRUST take user experience up a notch with their automatic counterparty VASP discovery feature.</p><p>This automation simplifies processes, reducing the need for manual lookups. For businesses and individuals, this means faster, more efficient transactions without the hassle of manual interventions.</p> Secure P2P PII Transmission <p>Among the available Travel Rule Solutions, Veriscope, VerifyVasp, and TransactID prioritize the secure transmission of PII between peers. This is vital in ensuring that personal data remains confidential during transit and is not vulnerable to malicious interceptions or unauthorized access.</p> Robust Counterparty Due Diligence <p>Both Veriscope and TRUST excel in performing thorough due diligence on counterparties. This rigorous process ensures that interactions are made with verified entities, minimizing the risks of fraud and enhancing the overall security of transactions.</p> Pay-as-you-go Model <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers a pay-as-you-go model, a feature that is both cost-effective and flexible. Instead of being tied down to long-term commitments, VASPs have the flexibility to pay for only what they use, making it an economical choice.</p> Interoperability <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, NotaBene, Sygna, and TRISA, emphasizes interoperability.</p><p>In an industry where systems need to communicate and integrate seamlessly, this feature ensures that Veriscope can work in tandem with various other platforms, ensuring flexibility and broader usability.</p> Historic Transaction Lookback <p>Veriscope’s historic transaction lookback feature is the only one of its kind among the Travel Rule Solutions.</p><p>This is how it works: when VASPs integrate with the Veriscope network, they are not only positioned to receive current but also historical Travel Rule requests. This ensures that VASPs maintain continuous compliance, regardless of when their partnering VASPs began complying with the FATF Travel Rule or their location globally.</p><p>As such, it confirms transactions right from the beginning and provides VASPs with the opportunity to produce any required records afterward, ensuring everyone adheres to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> User Signing (Non-Custodial Wallet Signing): <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers user signing for non-custodial wallets. This feature positions Veriscope as the definitive solution for Travel Rule compliance.</p> Address Proofs (Custodial Wallets): <p>Veriscope stands out with its address proofs for custodial wallets. This feature confirms that VASPs truly control the crypto addresses they claim, ensuring accurate data exchange for Travel Rule compliance. It shows that Veriscope emphasizes both user security and operational efficiency.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The ultimate choice isn’t about simply selecting the Travel Rule Solution with the most features, but rather, one that aligns with specific VASP needs — whether it’s decentralization, secure PII storage, or flexible payment models. As this analysis has highlighted, understanding each solution’s nuances can guide VASPs toward making informed decisions.</p><p>The right Travel Rule solution will allow VASPs to satisfy regulatory obligations while operating effectively within their unique constraints. With the regulatory landscape continuing to evolve, taking the time now to thoroughly assess and identify the optimal Travel Rule solution will establish a strong foundation for success in the approaching compliant future.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Confused over which crypto regulations are applicable in the UK? Read on to discover all about the Travel Rule, MiCA, and the UK’s proposed regulatory regime. 



 



<p>The release of the UK government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">‘Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets: Response to the consultation and call for evidence’ </a> signifies yet another significant step on the UK’s road toward crypto regulation.</p>



<p>In February 2023, in perhaps the clearest sign to date that the UK government was finally taking the challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry seriously, HM Treasury released a consultation paper on the proposed regulatory regime, which is billed by many as the UK’s answer to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>.</p>



<p>The 77-page document featured information on the current regulatory landscape for cryptoassets, definitions of different types of cryptoassets, and geographic scope of cryptoasset activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as more general guidelines regarding cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, the paper set out a proposed policy approach to bringing cryptoasset activities into the UK regulatory perimeter.</p>



 Call for evidence on UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime. 



<p>From February to the end of April 2023, the public and private sector, and those inside and outside Parliament were invited to provide feedback on the proposed policies and legislations. IDnow’s crypto regulatory experts, Rayissa Armata and Jason Tucker-Feltham pored over the consultation paper, and along with 130 other respondents and institutions, provided detailed feedback and analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2023 <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">HM Treasury published its response to the consultation</a>. In the foreword, Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The learnings gathered from our engagement have been invaluable for further informing our approach. With the future regulatory framework now taking clear shape and the Financial Services and Markets Act now passed, the UK is the obvious choice for starting and scaling a crypto asset business.</p>Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>While the vast majority (80%) of respondents were positive about the proposals, 10% had mixed feedback, and 10% were “largely critical” about the proposals. The main objections were from those who fundamentally disagreed with bringing cryptoassets within the financial services’ regulatory perimeter. Objections fell into three camps: crypto should be banned; crypto should treated in line with gambling regulation; crypto should be regulated on assets, not activities.</p>



 Feedback on UK’s proposed crypto regulations. 



<p>Feedback was collected from a mixture of industry associations, crypto native firms and FinTechs, legal and consulting firms, traditional financial services, and members of public and academia. Twenty themes and topics were identified that need to be addressed:</p>


 
 
 
 1. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) &amp; utility tokens 
 

<p>Clarify proposed treatment of NFTs and utility tokens – especially on what constitutes a financial services use case.</p>

 
 
 
 2. Geographic scope 
 

<p>Give further consideration to the treatment of overseas firms, including making clear the applicability (or not) of the Overseas Persons Exclusion (OPE), reverse solicitation, and intra-group exemptions.</p>

 
 
 
 3. Phase 1 vs phase 2 
 

<p>Delineate phase 1 and phase 2 activities in more detail, and give further consideration to potential challenges for firms and consumers.</p>

 
 
 
 4. Wholesale vs retail 
 

<p>Make stronger distinctions between services provided to professional / sophisticated investors versus retail consumers (e.g. lending, venue disclosures).</p>

 
 
 
 5. Timelines 
 

<p>Provide more clarity on timelines for phase 1 and phase 2, and seek to accelerate the overall implementation programme.</p>

 
 
 
 6. Security tokens 
 

<p>Make clear the proposed treatment of security tokens, and ensure overlapping regimes are avoided (e.g. through an explicit carve-out).</p>

 
 
 
 7. Token scope 
 

<p>Ensure cryptoasset definition used in secondary legislation is not too broad (e.g. make sure it excludes e-money, loyalty schemes, in-game money),</p>

 
 
 
 8. Staking 
 

<p>Provide clarity on the definition and future treatment of staking and consider accelerating legislation process. Consider carve-out from the scope of the collective investment scheme (CIS) regime.</p>

 
 
 
 9. Disclosures liability 
 

<p>Ensure liability framework for disclosures is proportionate –especially for tokens without an identifiable issuer.</p>

 
 
 
 10. Market abuse (cross-venue) 
 

<p>Consider a phased implementation approach toward market abuse surveillance obligations, recognizing issues associated with cross-venue information sharing.</p>

 
 
 
 11. FSMA authorization process 
 

<p>Streamline authorization process – in particular, consider appropriate transition pathways for firms registered with the FCA under its AML regime and/or already authorised under Part 4A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).</p>

 
 
 
 12. Custody scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated cryptoasset custody activities, especially with regards to self-hosted wallets and third-party arrangements.</p>

 
 
 
 13. Investment advice 
 

<p>Reconsider sequencing of cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management activities, and ensure these are included in the perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 14. SMEs 
 

<p>Take steps to minimize barriers to entry for smaller firms – e.g. through careful design of prudential requirements and issuance requirements.</p>

 
 
 
 15. Cross-border enforcement 
 

<p>Clarify how cross-border enforcement can work in practice to ensure fair and level playing field for UK-regulated firms.</p>

 
 
 
 16. Permissionless blockchains 
 

<p>Ensure the regulatory framework appropriately reflects the risks associated with permissionless (public) vs permissioned (private) blockchains.</p>

 
 
 
 17. Trading platform scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated trading platform activities, e.g. with regards to airdrops and decentralized exchanges.</p>

 
 
 
 18. Banning crypto 
 

<p>Ban certain cryptoassets from retail consumer use – or treat them akin to gambling rather than bringing them into the financial services regulatory perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 19. Transitional disclosure arrangements 
 

<p>Consider transitional disclosure arrangements for well-established tokens (e.g. Bitcoin) to differentiate them from recently issued tokens.</p>

 
 
 
 20. International coordination on DeFi 
 

<p>Avoid front-running international work on DeFi by imposing a prescriptive domestic framework.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>In light of the above, HM Treasury has pledged it will be setting out ‘modifications’ to the original proposals to provide further clarity on key areas of interest. The government’s aim is for secondary legislation to be laid in 2024, subject to Parliamentary time.</p>



<p>“It is important that the regime’s credibility be seen as robust rather than light touch, so I welcome the decision by the UK government to take the feedback from invested parties very seriously,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>A balanced and well thought out regulatory framework will likely lay the foundations in support of the UK becoming a major global crypto hub.&nbsp;The latest developments are music to the ears of traditional financial institutions, as clear rules for conducting crypto business in and out of the UK provides a level of certainty not yet demonstrated by the jurisdiction.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</blockquote>



 What should crypto firms do while they await crypto regulations?&nbsp; 



<p>While firms await rules outlined in the UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime, crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK must register with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>, and therefore comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (including the FATF guideline amendments). Only firms with appropriate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20means%20“Know%20Your%20Customer,KYC%20ebook%20for%20more%20insights">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.</p>



<p>At the beginning of 2023, out of 300 applications to the FCA, only 41 had become registered. FCA spokesperson, Charles Randell, Chair of the FCA and PSR said that more than 80% of crypto firms that had begun the process to become registered had either withdrawn their applications or been rejected. The most common reasons for not passing were that they did not meet the required AML standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the UK no longer being legally required to follow the rules outlined in the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> (5AMLD), the UK did decide to transpose the cryptocurrency regulation criteria from 5AMLD and 6AMLD into domestic legislation.&nbsp;Other relevant rules include the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps22-10-strengthening-our-financial-promotion-rules-high-risk-investments-firms-approving-financial-promotions">Financial Promotions Regime</a>, which is currently under consultation, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/2a647zxame68p5gagy3uo/devil-is-in-the-detail-for-uk-stablecoin-plans">Financial Services and Markets Bill</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-protect-access-to-cash-announced-in-queens-speech">,</a>&nbsp;which includes stablecoin regulation. </p>



 What is the UK’s ‘Travel Rule’?&nbsp; 



<p>From September 1, 2023, crypto firms operating in the UK will be required to store, verify, and&nbsp;share all information regarding crypto transfers, as per <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">the ‘Travel Rule’</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although well established among traditional financial service providers, the Travel Rule was extended to incorporate crypto activities in the revised Transfer of Funds regulation, which alongside MiCA, was officially officially published in the European Official Journal on June 9, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a>, regarded as the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, recently acknowledged the challenges associated with setting adoption and enforcement timelines across different juristictions and regions. Each FATF member state is currently madating travel rule compliance.</p>



<p>In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined what it expects from firms:&nbsp;</p>



  Take all reasonable steps and exercise all due diligence to comply with the Travel Rule.&nbsp;  



  Assume responsiblity for complying with the Travel Rule, even when using third-party suppliers.&nbsp;  



  Comply with the Travel Rule when sending or receiving a crypto to a firm in any jurisdiction that has implemented the Travel Rule.&nbsp;  



  Regularly review the implementation status of the Travel Rule in other jurisdictions and adapt business processes as appropriate.&nbsp;  



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				  In a world of scammers attempting to separate people from their hard-earned money, the next step in security is to be able to automatically verify who you are talking to before you tell them anything.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>As of 2022, Forbes reports that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/banking-trends-and-statistics/#:~:text=The%20tides%20have%20shifted%2C%20and,prefer%20to%20bank%20in%20person.">78% of American adults</a> prefer to do their banking digitally through an app or a website. It’s not hard to see why: it’s a quick and easy way to manage your money. Unfortunately, it also provides a new way for bad actors to try to gain access to accounts by pretending to be your bank, usually through text or email. This technique, sometimes known as <a href="https://www.bancosantander.es/en/glosario/spoofing#:~:text=This%20technique%20involves%20sending%20an,or%20any%20other%20criminal%20act.">bank spoofing,</a> can be very convincing, with scammers able to edit the messages to look like they are coming from a legitimate source.</p>
<p>While most consumers will not respond to a message out of nowhere, a small percentage will respond by providing their personal information to sort out whatever problem they’ve been told is happening with their account. The result is devastating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks have numerous ways to verify their customers online, but customers have no way to verify their banks.</p>
<p>Currently, if a customer tries to access their bank account online they will need to provide their account name and password, and hopefully either some sort of multifactor authentication tied to their phone or a set of security questions. This provides a degree of security and confidence that only the correct person gets access to the account.</p>
<p>But, if the direction of interaction is reversed, and a customer receives a communication from their bank, they have three options:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Independently verify the message by logging in to their bank portal or showing up in person. (This requires additional time and energy, resulting in poor customer experience.) 
 Ignore it, assuming it is a scam. (It’s never good to have customers dismiss messages by default, particularly if the message is legitimate and urgent.) 
 Do what the message says. (Risk being scammed.) 
 
<p>So how do we tackle this problem?</p>
<p>The answer would seem to be: give banks a way to prove who they are to the customers. But our current systems simply aren’t set up for that. Would we give banks a username and password for them to use when getting in touch with a customer? That leaves the customer needing to remember two passwords, and what if the customer forgets that password? Then we’re back where we started with just having to trust the bank’s outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity offers a simpler and much more effective way for customers and banks to mutually authenticate each other before exchanging any information. It allows both parties to cryptographically verify that they are who they say they are and to do so automatically and before sharing any data.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>This ability is impossible to spoof and by connecting customers and banks this way, not only can you eliminate the need for passwords and MFA, which can be lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, the customer can verify that they are indeed interacting with the bank.</p>
<p>According to BioCatch, scams now account for <a href="https://www.biocatch.com/resources/white-paper/digital-banking-fraud-trends-apac-2023">54% of cybercrime</a> across the APAC region, with a 200% surge in voice scams from 2022 to 2023. There is an inherent lack of certainty in knowing who we are communicating with online, which is enabling these criminals. Fraud&nbsp; losses across banks amounted to <a href="https://seon.io/resources/global-banking-fraud-index/#h-costs-of-fraud">$1.6 billion</a> in 2022. Adopting these new systems will save financial institutions real money, improve your customer’s experience, confidence, and retention, and save time and energy combating fraud.</p>
<p>This communications channel can be used for so much more than verification. Once the connection is established, you can be confident in who is on the other end, enabling secure messaging between parties (from both sides the bank can send the customer updates, and the customer can ask questions or send their own messages back), banking functionality such as payments or transfers can be accessed through APIs, and much more.</p>

<p>As society becomes more reliant on technology, the protection of confidential data increases. One innovative way organizations are keeping information safe is through fingerprint biometrics. In this article, we will explore the science of fingerprint biometrics and highlight its potential for security. We will analyze how security biometrics can be utilized and how this technology shapes our present and future security landscapes.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Fingerprint Uniqueness: The patterns of an individual’s fingerprints are uniquely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. They serve as an effective and dependable identification method. 
 Scanner Diversity: Different fingerprint scanners (optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, and thermal) address diverse security requirements. These scanners differ in cost, accuracy, durability, and spoofing resistance. 
 Biometrics Future: Despite the powerful security advantages of fingerprint biometrics, issues like potential data theft and privacy violations demand continuous technological evolution and robust legal safeguards. Future prospects for the field include 3D fingerprint imaging, AI integration, and advanced anti-spoofing techniques. 
 
 What Are Fingerprint Biometrics? 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics is the systematic study and application of unique physical attributes inherent in an individual’s fingerprints. Representing a more dependable identification method than traditional passwords or identity cards, fingerprint biometrics eliminates the issues of misplacement, forgetfulness, or theft. The distinctive nature of each person’s fingerprint ensures a robust barrier against unauthorized access to secure data.</p>
 The Science of Uniqueness: Fingerprints Origins 
<p>Fingerprints are nature’s signature of a person’s identity. Using fingerprints as a biometric identification tool dates back to ancient Babylon and has roots in our evolutionary biology. The friction ridges on our fingertips that comprise these prints have been crucial to human survival, helping us grip and touch objects.</p>
 Genetics and Environmental Factors: The Roots of Fingerprint Uniqueness 
<p>Fingerprints are formed during the embryonic stage and remain unaltered throughout an individual’s life. No two individuals, not even identical twins, share the same fingerprint. The basis for this uniqueness can be traced back to the genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of fingerprints.</p>
<p>Aspects of fingerprints that are analyzed include:</p>
 
 Patterns: The general pattern or type of fingerprint (arch, loop, or whorl) is inherited through genetics. 
 Minutiae: The precise details of the ridges, known as minutiae, are influenced by random and unpredictable factors such as pressure, blood flow, and position in the womb during development. 
 Ridges: Each ridge in a fingerprint contains several minutiae points, which can be bifurcations (where one ridge splits into two) or ridge endings. 
 
<p>The distribution and layout of minutiae points vary in every individual, contributing to the specific characteristics of each fingerprint. It is these characteristics that biometric systems analyze when comparing and matching fingerprints.</p>
 Behind the Screen: How Fingerprint Biometrics Work 
<p>Fingerprint recognition is achieved through three steps.</p>
 
 A fingerprint scanner captures the fingerprint, converting the physical pattern into a digital format. 
 The automated recognition system then processes this image to extract distinctive features, forming a unique pattern-matching template. 
 Finally, the facial recognition system matches this template against stored identification or identity verification templates. 
 
<p>Depending on the exact type of fingerprint scanner a business uses, the scanner may use optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, or thermal technologies. Each fingerprint technology has its strengths and weaknesses and will vary in cost, accuracy, and durability.</p>
<p>While the efficacy of biometric scanners is unquestionable, questions about their safety often arise. Potential challenges of fingerprint and facial recognition systems include false acceptance or rejection and biometric data theft.</p>
<p>Although rare, false acceptance of biometric technology can lead to unauthorized access, while false rejection can deny access to legitimate users. Furthermore, if biometric data is compromised, the repercussions can be severe, given that fingerprints cannot be changed, unlike passwords.</p>
<p>However, continuous technological advancements aim to mitigate these risks. Enhanced encryption techniques, anti-spoofing measures, identity verification, and continuous authentication are ways technology addresses these concerns. Together, these enhancements can improve the reliability and security of fingerprint biometrics.</p>
 In-depth Look at Fingerprint Scanners: Optical vs. Capacitive vs. Ultrasonic vs. Thermal 
<p>There are various types of fingerprint scanners, each with strengths and weaknesses.</p>
 Optical scanners 
<p>Optical scanners are the most traditional type. They take a digital fingerprint picture using a light source and a photodiode (a device that turns light into electrical current). Optical scanners are simple to use but can be easily fooled with a good-quality fingerprint image.</p>
 Capacitive scanners 
<p>Commonly found in smartphones, capacitive scanners use electrical current to sense and map the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint. They offer higher resolution and security than optical scanners but can be sensitive to temperature and electrostatic discharge.</p>
 Ultrasonic scanners 
<p>Ultrasonic scanners are considered more secure than optical and capacitive scanners. They use high-frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal layer of the skin. This allows them to capture both the surface and sub-surface features of the skin. This information helps form a 3D image of the fingerprint and makes the scanner less prone to spoofing.</p>
 Thermal scanners 
<p>This type of scanner is the least common of the four. Thermal scanners detect minutiae based on the temperature differences of the contact surface. However, their high costs and sensitivity to ambient temperature make them less popular choices.</p>
 Protecting Biometric Identities: Emerging Methods 
<p>As different biometric authentication technologies become more prevalent, safeguarding these identifiers from data breaches has become increasingly crucial. Biometric data, once compromised, cannot be reset or altered like a traditional password, making its protection paramount.</p>
<p>One of the most cost-effective methods for protecting biometric identities is liveness detection. This technology helps differentiate between a live biometric sample from a synthetic or forged one. These systems can differentiate between a live finger and a spoof by analyzing properties of live skin, such as sweat pores and micro-texture.</p>
<p>By detecting bodily responses or using AI to analyze input data for anomalies, liveness detection can add another layer of security to our biometric identification systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized storage methods, such as blockchain technology, are another avenue for safeguarding biometric data. Instead of storing the data in a central database, it’s dispersed across multiple nodes. These numerous locations make it nearly impossible for hackers to access the entire dataset. While this technology is promising, it’s still nascent and faces scalability and energy efficiency issues.</p>
 Potential Issues with Fingerprint Biometrics and Solutions 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics has its challenges; a common issue users face is the quality of the scanned fingerprint. Poor-quality images can deny legitimate users access to facilities, databases, or other secure locations.</p>
<p>Factors that can affect a person’s fingerprint quality include:</p>
 
 A person’s age 
 Substances on an individual’s hand 
 Skin conditions like dermatitis 
 Manual labor 
 
<p>Furthermore, some systems can be fooled by artificial fingerprints made from various materials like silicone or gelatin, a practice known as spoofing.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication, which requires more than one form of identification, is an increasingly used method to enhance security.</p>
 Securing Biometric Data: Ethical and Legal Considerations 
<p>While biometric authentication offers many significant benefits, it presents unprecedented privacy and data security challenges. Biometric data, unlike other forms of personal data, is intimately tied to our physical bodies. This makes its theft or misuse potentially more invasive and damaging.</p>
<p>The legal landscape for biometric data is still evolving. In many jurisdictions, existing privacy laws may not be sufficient to cover biometric data. This leaves gaps in protection. Stricter regulations and law enforcement may be necessary to ensure that all biometric information is collected, stored, and used in a manner that respects individual privacy.</p>
<p>Biometric data security isn’t just about preventing unauthorized access to biometric identifiers. It also involves ensuring that the biometric data, once collected, isn’t used for purposes beyond what was initially agreed. This could include selling the data to third parties or using it for surveillance.</p>
 Fingerprint Biometrics in Action: Real-world Applications and Impact 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics extends beyond personal devices and is a cornerstone of modern security across various sectors.</p>
<p>Fingerprints provide irrefutable evidence for law enforcement and forensics teams by helping identify and track suspects. Moreover, businesses and institutions leverage fingerprint biometrics for physical access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter certain premises.</p>
<p>The advent of smartphones equipped with fingerprint sensors has furthered the customer experience and fortified personal device security. Users can unlock their phones, authenticate payments, and secure apps by simply touching a sensor. This biometric authentication offers convenient access control and security while remaining cost effective.</p>
<p>Smart ID cards incorporating fingerprint biometrics are increasingly used in various sectors</p>
 
 Not surprisingly, government and military operations make frequent use of this type of biometric security. 
 However, an automated fingerprint identification system can also be employed in the healthcare industry to allow individuals to gain access to restricted areas. 
 Employees in the education sector can use fingerprint biometrics to enter schools and universities. 
 The corporate world can use this technology to prevent identity theft. 
 Financial systems also integrate fingerprint biometrics, adding a layer of protection over transactions and access to financial services. It helps reduce fraud and ensure customer trust, making it a valuable tool in banking and financial security. 
 
<p>As these real-world case studies illustrate successful implementations of fingerprint identification and other security biometrics. These include visa applications and the distribution of government benefits. Whether securing a company’s computer systems and premises or identifying criminals, fingerprint biometrics have proven their value and substantially impacted security.</p>
 Beyond the Horizon: Future Trends and Innovations in Fingerprint Biometrics 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics, like all technologies, continues to evolve. Several trends and innovations promise to enhance the capabilities and applicability of this technology.</p>
<p>The most recent advancements include 3D fingerprint imaging, which provides a more detailed fingerprint representation that enhances accuracy. Anti-spoofing techniques are also being developed to combat attempts at tricking fingerprint sensors with fake digital fingerprints too.</p>
<p>Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offers immense possibilities. These technologies can help improve voice recognition algorithms, making them more highly accurate and adaptable.</p>
<p>Despite these advancements, it’s essential to acknowledge that striking a balance between security and privacy with fingerprint technologies remains challenging. As biometric techniques evolve, unfortunately, so will privacy concerns.</p>
 Diversifying Biometric Security: Face and Iris Recognition 
<p>While fingerprints are common biometric security, they aren’t the only biometric technology method available. For instance, facial recognition technology and iris scanning add more layers of protection.</p>
 Facial recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology uses machine learning algorithms to identify individuals based on their facial features. This technology has seen an increase in use in recent years, especially in surveillance systems and mobile devices. Despite concerns about privacy and misuse, facial recognition is undeniably a powerful tool in biometrics and homeland security.</p>
 Iris scanning 
<p>Another form of biometric identification is iris scanning. This technique scans a person’s irises using infrared technology and analyzes their individual patterns. Iris scans offer a higher level of security due to the iris’s complex structure, which remains stable throughout an individual’s life. However, it can be more expensive and more complicated to implement than other forms of biometrics.</p>
<p>Integrating these methods with fingerprint biometrics can create a multi-modal biometric system, providing businesses with businesses more reliable and robust security.</p>

 Towards radical transparency — between liveability, affordability, and polycrisis <p>This 2nd blogpost of the series marks the next milestone in the collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB), to increase transparency regarding the largest urban landowners in four European cities (see: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/urban-land-ownership-mapping-towards-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-1-72ff315fefff?source=collection_tagged---------0----------------------------">Blog 1</a> explaining the project purpose). This study mapped land ownership in Copenhagen (as of August, 2023) aiming to reveal the largest land owners, patterns in management of land, and resulting power dynamics in city space production.</p><p>Through these findings, we also suggest initial ways forward with regards to city space production and ownership transparency. We would love to hear your&nbsp;views.</p> Summary (short&nbsp;read) <p>Transparency is a cross-cutting human rights principle, which helps to strengthen decision-making to enable better outcomes for people. <a href="http://ihrb.org">IHRB </a>is partnering with <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> to identify the largest owners of urban land in four European cities, as part of its project <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and the Future</a>. This recognizes that knowledge of who owns space within a city is one important step (in tandem with many others) to strengthen decision-making, as well as social and environmental outcomes.</p><p>Copenhagen is known for its high quality of living, deeply rooted culture of public welfare and participation, resistance to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/blackstone-rebellion-how-one-country-worlds-biggest-commercial-landlord-denmark">speculative foreign investments</a> as well as rich urban planning and architectural scene: it is often held up as an example of equitable space production and a “liveable” city. However, in the recent decades, the d<a href="https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/architectures-dismantling-and-restructuring">ismantling and restructuring of the Danish Welfare State</a> and private-led urban development patterns have contributed to Copenhagen’s high levels of unaffordability, as well as spatial disparity and <a href="https://www.justiceinitiative.org/voices/q-and-a-my-fight-to-save-my-home-under-denmarks-harsh-ghetto-plan">discrimination</a>. Across Danish cities, the housing cost overburden (reflecting housing cost as a share in disposable income) is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">second highest</a> in Europe (see also the <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/26">Right to Dwell — Un-liveability Trends, KADK&nbsp;2018</a>).</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">Housing in Europe: Housing cost overburden: cities or rural area - Compare your country</a></p><blockquote>→ Data transparency and accessibility in Copenhagen set an example for other cities, as this information is relatively easy to access. However, from our research it is clear that, in contexts such as this, the understanding of the wider city political dynamics, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the static accessible ownership data registers.</blockquote><p>One might therefore want to call for an additional set of tools to increase the transparency and accountability for decision-making. Tools which unlock greater insights into areas such&nbsp;as:</p>  the reasons for value appreciation of land and properties (e.g. through public infrastructure development — see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">A Smart Commons</a>);  real estate transactions; and;  their main beneficiaries.  <p>As this might sound complex… the data, at least for Copenhagen, is largely&nbsp;there.</p><p>Accessibility to static <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/706756/bpfg/bbr/bygning/856a5e15-195a-4570-b387-68ef85bcf408">datasets</a> (or <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/map/706756/bpfg">map</a> interfaces — as the Little Mermaid fortunately resting on the municipal soil) sets a good ground for basic analysis of who owns what, which is still an impossible task in most&nbsp;cities.</p><p>However, extending the sensing infrastructures (civic and public) might render a possibility of updating the predominantly debt-driven land-value capture model → (see: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/cities/land-value-capture.htm">OECD</a>, 2022 &amp; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cities+for+free&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_deDE1034DE1034&amp;oq=cities+for+free&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MggIARAAGBYYHjIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMgoIBBAAGIYDGIoFMgYIBRBFGD3SAQgyMzgxajBqOagCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#">Cities for Free</a>) to better serve the greater public and environmental good in the long-term.</p> The blog that follows&nbsp;shares: <blockquote>1.

Nordhavn) <a href="https://nrep.com/project/tingbjerg/">Tinbjerg development</a>, and the “last plot of land for a new district development” — <a href="https://jernbanebyen.dk/">Jernbanebyen</a>  The largest (affordable) housing associations — <a href="https://www.fsb.dk/">FSB</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sab-bolig.dk/">SAB</a>  Other municipalities to coordinate a city-region planning approach (see: <a href="http://danishbusinessauthority.dk/sites/default/files/fp-eng_31_13052015.pdf">Fingerplan</a>)  <p>Note: further landowners can be easily identified based on available data&nbsp;sets.</p> 3 case studies (long&nbsp;read) <p>In <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, we often aim to design portfolios of strategic interventions as well as institutional capacities for democratization of common resources or civic &amp; environmental good. Analogously, yet in contrast, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">IHRB</a>, we looked at the set of policies, interventions &amp; approaches that have defined urban land management in Copenhagen. Through this approach we can point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities required to update the way city space is produced in Copenhagen.</p><p>The purpose was not merely to complain or point fingers but to point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities necessary to update the way city space of Copenhagen is produced.</p> C1. Nordhavn — From bankruptcy to the “most liveable city” &amp; Potentials for land-value-capture reform for greater&nbsp;good <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nordhavnen,+Copenhagen,+Denmark/@55.7095562,12.5927454,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x465252ec082254f1:0x35a2bc73d420cc00!8m2!3d55.7125788!4d12.5927038!16s%2Fm%2F04dzg37?entry=ttu">Nordhavn</a> — the upscale neighbourhood in the northern part of the city is a flagship project of the City &amp; Port corporation.</p> C2. Lynetteholmen — New Municipal Land, Mega Projects &amp; Potentials for City-Region Coordination Capacity <p>To further understand the reasons behind the push for developments described by many as risky, environmentally, and socially questionable one needs to zoom out and look at the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area as a whole, which includes 34 municipalities.</p><p>The famous Finger Plan once aimed to ensure the ecological diversity and functionality of the landscape by incorporated green belts with green wedges for recreational and environmental purposes, as well as a strategy for metropolitan expansion along 5 fingers in multiple municipalities. T he plan has been recognized as one of Europe’s best examples of far-sighted and long-term sustainable urban planning.</p><p>In 2015, the responsibility for the FP was handed over from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, indicating economic growth as the main function of spatial planning&nbsp;. Apart from the city population growth and political pressures rooted in economic agendas, the green wedges and the structure of the Finger Plan have been challenged by the administrative division of power and interests of the neighbouring municipalities.</p><p>An emblematic example of the regional competition, rather than coordination in the Copenhagen Region can be another island development — Avedøre Holme, promoted by the Hvidovre Municipality, as Europe’s largest business district.</p> C3. Tingbjerg — Non-profit Land, Socio-economic Indicators &amp; Potentials for New Definition of Liveability Fig. top right. Snapshot from <a href="https://tingbjerghusene.dk/find-bolig/">Tingbjerg Husene website</a> — offering purchase of private houses on a former non-profit land in between existing buildings in the area listed as “<a href="https://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/agenda/74024d70-9be0-4c3e-9c23-88b3b59bca03/2001eab6-4fc1-46aa-8300-b9488900dfc9-bilag-10.pdf">hard Ghetto</a>” (when the term was still in use) where the amount of non-profit housing needs to be reduced to 40% by executive order. Conclusion <p>Some of the key reflections include:</p>  One of the key insights from studying land ownership in Copenhagen — a place where data transparency and availability is exemplar, is that understanding the processes, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the accessible ownership data registers.  Despite some of the aforementioned trends, Copenhagen still remains a city with large amounts of land owned by the municipality and non-profit associations. This provides lots of scope for change in face of unaffordability and future cascading crises incl. the need for climate adaptation. Here, an update to the land-value capture model where climate risks are accounted for might be of&nbsp;value.  The celebrated land-value capture model with multiplicity of its sub-mechanisms (infrastructure levy, developer obligations etc.) needs to be analyzed in its nuance. There are multiple forms of capturing value uplift and some might contribute to progressing unaffordability. For example unbalanced sale (by e.g. provision of affordable housing in the same area) of land to the highest bidder to repay infrastructure loans is still based on economic principles inadequate for the ultra-long term planning horizons cities need to look at in face of the cost of living crisis and climate adaptation necessities (see DML’s upcoming report with the Scottish Land Commission (link upcoming)).  - The attempt of fixing spatial segregation issues with neoliberal means (via the sale of non-profit land, or commodification of non-profit housing) has proven to achieve the opposite, exacerbating city-scale spatial inequalities. Dissolution of the vulnerable neighbourhoods with the goal to create a “<a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/usc">blended city</a>” in the context of decreasing affordability indicators (Fig 1. are going down) may contribute to a) pushing the “problem” to other locations b) contributing to other forms of spatial segregation and c) nimbyism.  Recognition of lack of institutional capacities to host alternative city and <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/92">housing development models</a>. The dominant debt-driven logic of the city and its infrastructure development which privileges premium price housing units is not only caused by the widely presumed single-mindedness of politicians or greed of developers. How the wider systemic context is structured sets a fertile pre-condition for this pattern: the financing sector, insurance, education and skills within municipalities or capacities to imagine alternative futures are just some of&nbsp;them.  European, and global mobilization for sustainable, affordable and liveable cities. Copenhagen is a great city and one could argue if it became more inclusive and more affordable in the current globalized context, it would face even harsher population increases which eventually would prevent affordability.  Lack of a long-term perspective — the greatness of Copenhagen is dictated not by the upscale starchitecture developments. It is the welfare state heydays stemming commons: the bikes, the open libraries with baby worlds, the work-life balance, the time to enjoy the good quality public spaces, the scale of the city, access to water, or Christiania neighbourhood in the middle of the&nbsp;city.  <p>Finally, several complex questions which require further consideration came out of this initial investigation:</p><p>In addition to relatively transparent ownership &amp; transaction <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/100060818/sfe">databases</a>:</p>  How can we increase political, societal sensing and sense-making capacities that allow us to foresee the socio-economic futures of the city based on ongoing developments e.g. on models such as land-value capture?  <p>Responding to findings around Almene boliger / Tingbjerg</p>  What institutional infrastructures can be built to make citizens resilient to gradual institutional changes that may undermine their democratic mandate? (referring to Almene&nbsp;boliger)  <p>Reflecting on the dominance of land value capture&nbsp;logic</p>  What other types of more equitable <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/92">development models can be employed</a>, if the neoliberal paradigm is a contributor rather than a cure to socio-economic urban issues (incl. spatial segregation)&nbsp;?  How can local and national policy, regulation, spatial planning &amp; institutional capacities efficiently support and create favourable context for these alternative models to be efficiently deployed?  <p>Some ways forward to explore — context specific (broked down&nbsp;above)</p>  Radical, dynamic land-value uplif transparency  Capacity for new modes of governance of whole city-region land governance  Capacity to sense policy and econmic activity effects on socio-economic indicators  <p>Further, basing on DML, UNDP collaboration “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58727b5a9de4bbf0b38db631/t/5f12f01c4eab05002211f4a0/1595076643699/ExO+A+Way+Forward_System+Transformation+v07+2.pdf">A way Forward</a>”:</p>  New national statistical offices (<a href="https://pat-kane-xcjl.squarespace.com/s/ExO-A-Way-Forward_System-Transformation-v07-2.pdf">see p.&nbsp;32</a>)  New, and radically trasparent digital infrastructures that enable “<a href="https://nowthenmagazine.com/articles/verbs-not-nouns-how-language-can-shape-alternate-worldviews-giyu-tjauvaljian-yu-chieh-wu">noun to verb</a>” planning.

 The Unified Investor App is Coming… 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we’re thrilled to introduce the new white-label&nbsp;Unified Investor App, an all-in-one platform for&nbsp;issuers&nbsp;to provide their investors with a seamless experience to explore, subscribe, and manage digital securities.</p>
<p>In addition,&nbsp;distributors&nbsp;(including broker-dealers, marketplaces, exchanges, etc) can leverage this app as well to streamline operations with a fully digital experience. Distributors will now be able to effectively offer more capabilities and features for their clients to expand reach and easily handle a high volume of activities.</p>
<p>We’ve integrated the entire investor experience into one streamlined web application without needing to go to different links with all needed integrations (e.g., e-signing and liveness KYC solutions, etc.).&nbsp;Investors can now do everything with their digital securities in one place, from onboarding, searching for suitable investment opportunities, and managing their portfolio; thereby, merging the three.</p>
 The Three Features That are Consolidating: 
<p>Discover tokenized securities:&nbsp;The Invest section consists of opportunities that are available to eligible users directly on your platform.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Qualifying/subscribing:&nbsp;This part of the investor process pertains to KYC/AML checks, document signing, and payments.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			<p>Manage and trade tokenized securities:&nbsp;A dashboard for the investors to visually organize and see in real-time their portfolio, and to conduct peer-to-peer transfers, as well as to access secondary solutions such as Billboard and exchanges.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 This consolidation offers several advantages: 
 
 All-in-one UX:&nbsp;A complete and fully digital dashboard simplifying the investor’s journey. It leverages the blockchain infrastructure to make actions possible directly on the buy-side: get qualified, find opportunities, invest, redeem, trade, access asset data, etc. 
 Easier access to liquidity:&nbsp;Investors can access liquidity solutions such as centralized exchanges that issuers authorized,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--erKLTEKUWtOo_kuIOhCTreB70d4vEcyXFIWVkhInQ6fpqku7RQ6HNNNTzvl-FPtXkFZ9g">T-REX billboard</a>&nbsp;(our white-label secondary market solution for digital securities), or even DeFi protocols. 
 Secure and scalable: The cloud-based platform doesn’t require any maintenance from the operator. It is secure and scalable thanks to Tokeny’s scalable infrastructure. 
 
 How do Issuers and Distributors Benefit? 
<p>Beyond elevating the investor experience, our white-label enterprise platform significantly benefits issuers and distributors alike.</p>
<p>Issuers:&nbsp;From the issuer’s perspective, the platform seamlessly integrates the entire investor journey to reduce investors’ drop rate due to redundant processes and attract more digital-first investors, from onboarding to transferability options.</p>
<p>Distributors: The Unified Investor App is white-label, offering these distributors the opportunity to provide a branded all-in-one distribution platform to their investors. They can list carefully curated digital securities, enabling their audience to subscribe.

<p>Many crypto wallets are out on the market, but they don't all have the same capabilities. They may be specific to a particular ecosystem or lack dapp functionality. But what if there were a way to expand a wallet's abilities to surpass these limitations? </p><p>The Filecoin network has only a few native wallet clients. How can we increase the adoption of the Filecoin network so developers and users can access the ecosystem while also integrating the benefits of the EVM? <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">Metamask's Snaps</a> are one way to add custom functionality to a widely used wallet.</p> Understanding Filecoin Wallet Addresses <p>First, for clarity, let's review some <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/wallet-stack/">wallet terminology</a>. Wallets can contain multiple accounts. Each account has an address. Think of it like a bank account with a checking account number. </p><p>Getting more technical, wallets have Secret Recovery Phrases. Accounts are derived from SRPs, creating private keys that control the account. Addresses are public and are tied to the transactions executed over the blockchain.</p><p>Filecoin has five types of addresses. The ones we'll focus on are F1 and F4. F1 is the Filecoin native address for transactions done solely over the Filecoin network. F4 is the FEVM address. FEVM, or the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine, allows developers to port any existing EVM-based smart contracts straight onto the FVM. The F4 address is a translation layer to the EVM ecosystem. &nbsp;</p><p>EVM-compatible wallets support native Ethereum addresses (Ox) and F4 addresses. But what if you want to send Filecoin from a native F1 address to an F4 or Ox address to take advantage of the FEVM ecosystem? And what if that same wallet could support native FIL transactions?</p> Introducing Filsnap <p>Filsnap is a MetaMask plugin, or <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">snap</a>, that adds support for Filecoin native accounts and functionality. MetaMask only supports the EVM ecosystem, so Fission's plugin enables users to utilize MetaMask as a Filecoin wallet.</p><p>Filecoin native wallet: Filsnap can send transactions and receive assets using F1 addresses.</p><p>F1 to F4: Say a person has a wallet supporting only Filecoin native F1 addresses. The user could send their assets to Filsnap and, from there, send assets to F4 addresses. The same goes for exchanges like Coinbase, which doesn't support F4 addresses yet. </p><p>F4 to F1: Say a user wants to withdraw yield from a liquidity pool and put it in cold storage. They can send assets from an F4 address in the Filsnap wallet to the cold wallet that supports F1 addresses via a FilForwarder smart contract. This contract translates from FEVM to native.</p> The Filsnap Library <p>Although Filecoin JS libraries were already available, we chose not to reuse them for a few reasons. First, MetaMask is constantly changing, and we wanted to ensure the code was as up-to-date as possible. Second, the existing libraries are big and weighed down by many dependencies. A lightweight wallet client is preferred for a better user experience when working with the blockchain. Third, because we take security so seriously, we had all of the cryptography dependencies in our library independently audited for peace of mind.</p><p>The new <a href="https://github.com/hugomrdias/iso-repo/tree/main/packages/iso-filecoin">Filecoin JavaScript Library - iso-filecoin</a> is the foundation for three packages - Filsnap, Filsnap Adapter, and Filsnap Adapter React. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/snap">Filsnap</a> is the snap installed in the MetaMask extension. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter">Filsnap Adapter</a> enables developers to interact with Filsnap from a dapp. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter-react">Filsnap Adapter React</a> includes React-specific hooks for dapp integration. &nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, there are few native Filecoin wallets, and the existing ones don't expose their functionality to dapps. Filsnap, however, has an API for transactions on the native layer, enabling developers to build apps with native Filecoin functionality! </p> The Filsnap Demo <p>The Filsnap demo supports Filecoin native and FEVM transactions using either Filsnap for native or Metamask for EVM. As mentioned above, it's a great way to manage your assets despite the current technical limitations in wallets and exchanges. <a href="https://filecointldr.io/article/guide-how-to-transfer-fil-from-coinbase-to-a-metamask-wallet-0x">It used to be much more complicated</a>, but now you can do it all in the Filsnap demo app.</p><p>Another benefit of using the Filsnap demo app is security through verifiability. Anyone can verify the snap installed in Metamask through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/filsnap/v/0.3.2#user-content-provenance">NPM Provenance</a> and the app code using <a href="https://bafybeihevfatvsypn35ywbloc4vrjpjpk5akhqv7yi4d7mrahzaaatcmp4.ipfs.dweb.link/">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/actions/runs/5984204522/attempts/1#summary-16235152758">GitHub</a>.</p>Release Information: https://filsnap.fission.app/<p>Every app release and git tag is published to IPFS using <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/cli/working-with-apps">Fission apps</a> and can be cloned/forked from <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap">GitHub</a> if a user wishes to self-host or verify integrity using content addressing.</p> Getting Started <p>The Filsnap package has been audited, and the <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">MetaMask Snaps are now in open beta</a>.</p><p>The Fission team, lead by Hugo Dias, implemented the audited Filsnap as part of a contract with Protocol Labs. As part of this process, Hugo also wrote and open sourced the isomorphic filecoin utilities, which is now the recommended way to work with native Filecoin accounts and supporting cryptography.</p>  Isomorphic Filecoin abstractions for RPC, signatures, address, token and wallet <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/filecoin">https://github.com/fission-codes/filecoin</a>   API Docs <a href="https://fission-codes.github.io/filecoin/">https://fission-codes.github.io/filecoin/</a>  NPM <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso-filecoin">https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso-filecoin</a>  <p>Please get in touch if you'd like to support long term maintenance of core open source Filecoin utilities.</p><p>Try the <a href="https://filsnap.fission.app/">Filsnap demo</a> today, and let us know what you think!

 Project Polaris: Navigating Offline Payments with CBDC — A High-Level Design&nbsp;Guide <p>We are excited to introduce the “Project Polaris: Navigating Offline Payments with CBDC — A High-Level Design Guide,” the fourth installment in the groundbreaking Project Polaris series by the BIS Innovation Hub. This report is a culmination of collaboration, research, and expertise, and it offers a profound exploration into the intricate world of offline payments with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). SWN Global has been an active participant in this endeavor, joining forces with prominent organizations like BitMint, Crunchfish, FIS Global, M10 Networks, Giesecke+Devrient, Google, IBM, and IDEMIA to contribute to this comprehensive guide.</p><p>Key Highlights:</p><p>Complexity of Offline Payments: Designing offline payments with CBDC is a complex challenge, marked by intricate trade-offs and unique requirements for each central bank. The report acknowledges that some challenges are not easily resolved, given the diversity of central banks’&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Deepening Knowledge: Building on the foundational insights provided by the earlier handbook, the guide’s primary goal is to deepen the understanding of central banks regarding the underlying technology of offline payments with&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>Workshop Insights: The report draws on the knowledge and wisdom gathered through a series of workshops conducted between May and September 2023. These workshops, in collaboration with 12 solution vendors and 6 observing central banks, reinforced and expanded upon the conclusions of the earlier handbook.</p><p>Key Conclusions: The guide reinforces the importance of offline payments with CBDC for central banks and underlines the need to consider design choices that encompass the entire solution. It acknowledges the presence of trade-offs between various requirements and suggests that an iterative approach to design is essential.</p><p>Evolving Solutions: Recognizing that solutions for offline payments with CBDC are still in an evolutionary phase, the guide notes that very few are production-ready or operating at scale in live environments. However, it highlights the existence of several mature&nbsp;pilots.</p><p>Collaboration and Innovation: Central banks are positioned to be driving forces for collaboration and innovation in the CBDC ecosystem. The report encourages central banks to engage with solution vendors and other potential participants in the CBDC landscape.</p><p>Comprehensive Coverage: The guide provides in-depth coverage of the current solution and technology landscape, outlines the critical design choices that shape offline solutions, and offers practical examples for central banks to tailor their designs to their unique needs. It touches on essential aspects, including resilience, inclusion, privacy, risk management, device security, and&nbsp;limits.</p><p>The insights and knowledge contained within this guide extend beyond offline payments and can also be applied to address issues related to identity, payments with commercial bank money, wallets, and infrastructure for regulated stablecoins.</p><p>Our company is proud to have actively participated in the deep dive event that led to the creation of this report, alongside distinguished partners such as BitMint, Crunchfish, FIS Global, M10 Networks, Giesecke+Devrient, Google, IBM, and IDEMIA.

 Discover all about the darkest form of identity theft, and how to protect your company from the threat of ghosting fraudsters. 



 



<p>Have you ever been ghosted or a victim of ‘ghosting fraud’?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While ‘ghosting’ is widely known as the sudden and random disappearance of a potential suitor, the term ‘ghosting fraud’ refers to something far darker.&nbsp;Ghosting fraud describes the theft and fraudulent use of a deceased person’s personal information.</p>



<p>One of the most notorious cases of ghosting fraud happened in 2016 in Florida, US. Two fraudsters managed to hack into a computer system, and access the records of the deceased to collect names, addresses, birth dates, and social security numbers, which they used to commit tax fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By filing multiple fake tax returns, the two scammers received fraudulent refund checks worth millions. This was all at the expense of the IRS, which had no idea that these identities were fraudulent, or even that these people were deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s unknown how many identities the fraudsters stole, they were ordered to pay back over <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/two-broward-residents-sentenced-12-and-11-years-prison-stolen-identity-tax-fraud-scheme">$1.26 million</a>, and sentenced to 11 and 12 years respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s shocking, this isn’t the only story of its kind. In fact, as the cost of living rises, ghosting fraud is becoming increasingly common.</p>



 What is ghosting fraud? 



<p>Ghosting fraud is the term used to describe a form of identity theft, where perpetrators impersonate a deceased person for financial gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraudsters will use a deceased individual’s name, address, and other confidential information to open up new lines of credit, take out loans, or, as the example above, request tax refunds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghosting fraud is made possible thanks to vulnerabilities and failures in internal controls, record keeping and monitoring systems, as well as lags in system updates. In the UK, for example, relatives have up to <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/">twelve months</a> to register a death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s worse though, is that in some regions, credit unions and lenders won’t know of a customer’s death unless they receive a dedicated phone call from a relative. Of course, this is not often a priority for grieving family members. Lenders have been known to keep lines of credit open – and charge interest – for years without an official death notification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s not necessarily the individuals of the deceased that should be most concerned, but businesses. Unlike <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, ghosting fraud doesn’t hinge on social engineering, but rather knowledge of the customer.</p>



<p>More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the different types of ghosting fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Within the realm of ghosting fraud, there are three common scams to be aware of:</p>



 Credit fraud. 



<p>Credit fraud in this context can work in two separate ways. The first involves someone close to the deceased, who has physical access to their credit accounts. Here, the perpetrator simply starts using the credit cards of the deceased without notifying the provider of their death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, credit fraud can happen when external scammers get hold of the details of the deceased. By accessing information such as their name, date of birth and social security number, the fraudster has all the information they need to apply for new accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, approximately <a href="https://business.time.com/2012/04/24/grave-robbing-2-5-million-dead-people-get-their-identities-stolen-every-year/">800,000 cases of ghosting fraud</a> happen every year for the purposes of opening new lines of credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies that should be most concerned about credit fraud are credit providers, such as credit card companies or lenders. Without specific identity checks in place or a tool to flag suspicious signals, these financial institutions stand to lose the most from ghosting fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Tax fraud. 



<p>Ghosting fraud can also affect tax authorities on a global scale. Here, criminals get hold of deceased individuals’ details, and file false tax statements in order to generate refund checks.</p>



<p>Tax fraud with ‘ghost details’ primarily affects the tax authority in the country it is happening. This year, the IRS identified approximately <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/irs-flagged-more-than-1-million-tax-returns-for-identity-fraud-in-2023.html">12,617 cases of identity theft tax fraud</a> in the US, leading to refunds of over $6.3 billion. And unfortunately, it’s highly likely that this is only the tip of the iceberg, with a high proportion of cases still undiscovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Workplace data breach. 



<p>It might not be your first thought when someone says ghosting fraud, but workplace data breaches are also high risk when an employee dies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One famous data breach at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/technology/twitter-hack-bill-gates-elon-musk.html">Twitter in 2020</a>, for example, led to over $800,000 in losses and a drop in the share price. It happened because fraudsters convinced employees that they were part of the security team, and needed to verify the identity of the workers by getting their passwords when the company moved to remote work. The fraudsters then began tweeting links to cryptocurrency scams from high-profile and celebrity accounts, generating hundreds of thousands in profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same vein, scammers can use the log-in details of deceased employees if their accounts have not been shut down by their employers.</p>



<p>Alongside the threat of huge financial consequences, falling victim to ghosting fraud might also result in reputational damage, and make it hard for businesses to attract new customers.</p>



<p>Large corporations can’t rely on death notifications from family members or on third party log-in software. Instead, continuous monitoring is key in preventing fraudulent access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the key fraud challenges for companies? 



<p>While the vast majority of ghosting fraudsters are seasoned scammers, others might be family members looking to exploit their relative’s death. This makes the fraud even harder to fight against.</p>



<p>A major challenge for some businesses is that sophisticated fraudsters can easily bypass outdated identification methods, such as only requiring details like date of birth and social security numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should be a key concern for organizations, and they should prioritize updating their identity verification services to reflect the threat of ghosting fraud, among other types of scams, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/money-laundering-threat-online-casinos/">money laundering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 How to detect and prevent ghosting fraud. 



<p>While death registers may be still stuck in the stone ages, that does not mean your organization needs to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrust the detection and prevention of ghosting fraud to a dedicated fraud prevention and identity verification platform like IDnow.</p>



<p>Our six-pronged approach to data checks involves:</p>



  A derogatory financial score<br>  Property data<br>  Vulnerability data<br>  Application data<br>  Geo-affordability&nbsp;<br>  And all-important mortality data: to ensure that the applicant is not deceased, and is therefore who they say they are  



<p>Alongside mortality data, IDnow conducts <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> for a comprehensive overview of who your customers are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ongoing monitoring, through <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/strong-customer-authentication">Strong Customer Authentication</a>, allows our clients to comply with regulatory requirements. Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">identity verification services</a> combine <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/biometric-checks-at-the-airport-ready-to-board/">biometric information</a> (such as face ID or a fingerprint) and possessions (such as a code sent to their mobile phone) alongside knowledge, for better validity in customer identity checks.&nbsp;</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 18th October to 30th&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this issue, we’ll explore the US stance on cryptocurrency mixers, the UK’s new legislation on illicit crypto, Taiwan’s initial steps into crypto regulation, and Turkey’s progress on the crypto front. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Major Global Crypto Regulatory Developments Unveiled <p>The US: As regulatory scrutiny tightens, FinCEN is eyeing increased transparency measures for crypto “mixers.”</p><p>The UK: Meanwhile, the UK has given royal assent to a bill that arms law enforcement with the power to seize crypto linked to crime. Introduced last September, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill addresses a spectrum of crimes and enables asset seizure without a formal conviction.</p><p>Taiwan: Amidst global regulatory shifts, Taiwan steps into the crypto regulatory arena with a bill presented to the Legislative Yuan. This draft legislation seeks to define operational standards and emphasizes industry affiliations. Notably, it flags potential divergences between crypto derivatives and traditional finance, hinting at tailored regulations down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>Turkey: Positioned between Europe and Asia, Turkey is charting its regulatory course. Their recent Presidential Annual Program hints at a structured crypto framework by 2024, encompassing clear legal definitions and tax guidelines, though details are still under&nbsp;wraps.</p><p>Now, with this global panorama in view, let’s delve deeper into a couple of these significant shifts and explore their broader implications for the crypto ecosystem.</p> UK Passes Law to Seize Illicit Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK’s new Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill addresses cryptocurrencies linked to illicit activities like money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorism, and cybercrimes.</p><p>One of the key provisions of the bill permits swift recovery of crime-associated crypto assets without conviction. Lawmakers expect this would enhance the capability of law enforcement agencies for quicker and more impactful asset seizures.</p><p>On the upside, this bolsters security and trust in the UK’s cryptocurrency landscape, aiming to shield consumers, appeal to institutional investors, and align with international norms. Conversely, these measures could risk overreach, infringing on individual rights, and potentially stifle innovation. There’s also the concern of unintentional asset seizures from innocent individuals, posing legal and reputational issues.</p> FinCEN Proposes New Regulation for Crypto&nbsp;Mixers <p>The US Department of the Treasury’s financial crimes unit is considering the designation of crypto mixers as a primary concern for money laundering, given their potential use by malicious actors like cybercriminals and terror&nbsp;groups.</p><p>If greenlit, financial firms would be mandated to report suspicious mixer-related transactions, possibly leading to further restrictions in their dealings with these mixers. This comes after US sanctions on mixers like Tornado Cash and Blender and increasing concerns over illegal crypto&nbsp;use.</p><a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1715427363045982413?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The proposed rule, which will be open to public feedback for 90 days, is part of FinCEN’s efforts in the crypto market&nbsp;domain.</p><p>While this initiative aims to highlight potentially dubious transactions, it might inadvertently affect legitimate users who prioritize privacy. Additionally, the increasing scrutiny might elevate operational costs for financial entities and challenge the intrinsic privacy values of the crypto&nbsp;sphere.</p> Reminder: Shape DeFi’s Future with the Shyft Network&nbsp;Survey! <p>Your opinion matters in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

<p>On November 29, 2022, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-kms-external-key-store-xks/">announced</a> the eXternal Key Store (XKS) capability for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a>. It allows customers who have a regulatory need to store and control their encryption keys on-premises or outside of the AWS cloud to do so through AWS KMS. As a result, customers can use their existing hardware security module (HSM) infrastructure to effectively store and manage their AWS KMS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide">Customer Managed Keys</a> (CMKs) on-premises or at any location of their choice.</p>
<p>Customers are therefore able to easily encrypt data with externally managed keys with their applications and more than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration">100 AWS services</a>.</p>
<p>In a previous blog titled <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/12/ownership-control-and-possession-a-new-aws-feature-for-key-management-with-the-cloud/">Ownership, Control, and Possession – A New AWS Feature For Key Management with the Cloud,</a> we focused on AWS KMS XKS integration with the Entrust enterprise key and secrets management solution KeyControl. In this blog, we’ll provide more detail relating to the AWS KMS XKS integration directly with an Entrust nShield HSM.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When data is encrypted for a customer within AWS, a unique data encryption key is generated, which is then encrypted with a CMK following a scheme known as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping">envelope encryption</a>. XKS enables this CMK to be protected and managed externally, such as within a tamper resistant and FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or FIPS 140-3 Level 31 certified HSM.</p>
<p>Instead of storing and managing the CMKs entirely within AWS KMS, with XKS they are additionally encrypted by an external key which resides and remains entirely outside the AWS cloud and under the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#xks-how-it-works">sole control of the customer organization</a>.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for providing and managing the infrastructure necessary to securely hold and manage such external keys themselves, which does introduce an additional operational burden and some greater risks to availability and performance. However, this can enable cloud use cases for several regulated workloads where encryption keys are required to be directly held by specific organizations and/or in particular geographic jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Controlling access to these externally managed CMKs provides for a customer “break glass” capability so that they can easily control access and use of CMKs supplied to their applications and other AWS services. By disabling or removing access to the externally stored key, data within the cloud can be rendered inaccessible on a temporary or permanent basis.</p>
<p>Customers have two options for building infrastructure to integrate with AWS KMS XKS:</p>
 
 Customers can use an AWS KMS XKS proxy, which is provided as <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-kms-xks-proxy">sample code online</a>. This option uses the Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)#11 interface in order to support any compatible hardware security module. Entrust nShield HSMs integrate with PKCS#11 compatible applications and are already deployed within organizations and enterprises for keeping their cryptographic key material protected on-premises. 
 Several organizations (including Entrust) offer multi-cloud key management systems, that can interface with a number of cloud service providers (CSPs), including AWS, for importing and managing CMKs using a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) approach, as well as enabling usage of CMKs through XKS with the Hold Your Own Key (HYOK) approach. These provide customers with a comprehensive lifecycle management capability and a single platform for consistent operations of multiple key types across an organization. Typically, they also use an HSM for protecting the keys within such system. 
 
<p>Using Entrust nShield HSMs in conjunction with an AWS KMS XKS proxy can be straightforwardly achieved using a suitable configuration file that references the PKCS#11 library, allowing the proxy code to work with any number of nShield Security World AES-256 keys. For increased availability, and to maintain the continued operation of applications and integrated AWS Services dependent on XKS managed CMKs, it is recommended to deploy the AWS KMS XKS proxy and nShield HSMs in multiple locations or geographies.</p>
<p>With either deployment type, internet bandwidth requirements will need to be measured, monitored, and accommodated to ensure that any network bottlenecks introduced using the AWS KMS XKS proxy or key management system do not impede or impact the operation of applications running on AWS.</p>
<p>Not all data classification categories will require external storage of keys, so AWS recommend only using this capability for scenarios where there is a regulatory or compliance need – for example, keep minimal data protected by XKS to meet requirements, but continue using AWS KMS CMKs for the rest of your data.&nbsp;It is important to remember that if an external key is permanently lost or deleted, any ciphertext encrypted under the associated KMS keys will be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>So, if you are already using AWS services and thinking about utilizing their KMS XKS capability or are planning to migrate to the cloud in the near future and are concerned about the impact of the control of your cryptographic keys, consider <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/hsm/products/nshield-hsms">Entrust nShield HSMs</a> in conjunction with AWS KMS XKS.</p>
 
<p>Note 1: nShield <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List">5c</a> and 5s FIPS 140-3 certifications currently FIPS pending (In coordination)</p>

<p>Munich, October 30, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, in collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.iata.org/">IATA</a>) and other industry partners, supported the first integrated digital identity travel experience, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. The demonstration took place on a journey from London Heathrow (LHR) to Rome Fiumicino (FCO) with British Airways.</p>



<p>“Working closely on this project with IATA and the other partners underlines our commitment to a future travel experience that is digital, efficient, and seamless. The integrated journey we demonstrated at the World Passenger Symposium in Chicago paves the way for simpler and more seamless travel experiences,” says Dr Heinrich Grave, Senior Vice President Digital Identity at IDnow.</p>



<p>“Thank you to IDnow for their collaboration in demonstrating the first fully integrated digital identity travel experience, from shopping for flights to arrival. Our goal has always been a future of travel that’s fully digital and secured with biometric identification. Though we’ve had the technology for individual steps, bringing them together has been a challenge. Today, with the support of our partners, we’ve shown it’s achievable. This is a significant stride towards simpler and smoother travel experiences in the future,” says Nick Careen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security.</p>



<p>Key highlights of the digital travel experience include:</p>



  Personalised Offers: Leveraging data, such as loyalty card details stored securely in digital wallets, to curate personalised offers for travellers.  Simplified Orders: Streamlined order generation that eliminates the need for traditional tickets, storing all essential journey details in a verifiable digital credential accessible via a QR code.  Effortless Travel Requirements Check: Pre-journey processes to confirm travel requirements, backed by IATA’s Timatic system.  “Ready to Fly” Simplifying and Securing Check-ins: Enhancing the check-in process by sharing necessary digital documents with the airline, ensuring passengers are ready for their journey.  Contactless Airport Experiences: The potential for a hands-free airport experience, facilitated through biometric gates, from security checks to boarding.  



<p>IDnow supported the project with its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>. The IDnow Wallet is used for storing and presenting digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and Digital Travel Authorizations, such as digital visas. IDnow also provides the remote identity verification solution that is used when the passenger enrolls for digital credentials in the wallet solution.</p>



<p>The LHR-FCO journey serves as a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2023-releases/2023-10-25-02/">“Proof of Concept” incubated in the IATA Innovation Lab</a>. IDnow remains dedicated to such innovative collaborations that aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in the aviation industry.</p>

<p>Shared finance is defined by Forrester Research as: “Any situation in which a person acts as an observer of, partner in, or proxy for another person's finances" (Forrester, 2021). The clearest examples that fit this definition are standard joint checking accounts and shared credit cards, which are extremely common and offered by most if not all financial institutions to their customers. However, in reality, shared finance spans many use cases beyond a typical married couple’s joint finances. Examples include: parent-child finances, financial co-parenting between separated or divorced individuals who share a child, management of accounts for elderly relatives by proxy, roommates pooling funds to share common bills such as rent and utilities, and more. Many of these financial relationships are less clear-cut, grant different levels of access to different users, and their duration may vary from months to years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is value to be found for both customers and financial services organizations in each of these use cases, but this evolving approach to money management also presents a variety of challenges for financial institutions.</p>

<p>"We should hold a protest outside the Mayor's office."</p><p>So began a typical conversation at a political action meeting I attended in 2015. The discussion frequently went one of two ways. One option was disagreement — someone may raise a concern or objection like "Why should we focus on the Mayor's office when we should be trying to reach people in more populated areas?" or "We need to focus on fundraising right now, not action." Such disagreements could cascade into potentially endless debates, consuming our limited meeting time and rarely leading to consensus. Another, and in my opinion worse, option was lack of debate. A few might voice approval, and then someone would declare: "It looks like we have consensus." Over time, I grew wary of that phrase because it was almost always a lie. Rather than reflecting genuine commitment, universal approval, or even general non-opposition, it signified a group of people hesitant to face the potential discord of scenario #1. Consequently, only a few enthusiastic individuals would participate, later resenting those who abstained from a plan "the group" had supposedly endorsed.</p><p>This phenomenon is, in my experience, typical for most groups that lack explicit decision-making systems, and to some extent even those that do. I view coordination issues as central to every aspect of civil life, and its challenges as a major barrier toward prosperity. In the case of grassroots activism, I find it especially disheartening to see so many people willing to freely contribute their time toward helping others, but end up struggling with effective collaboration. The problem of how to make decisions is not new to humanity, and there are a plethora of prescriptions including various forms of despotism, democracy, and consensus. I mention the group above because its chaotic nature illustrates the organizing problem in its purest form, but I have participated in many groups with a range of structures, including traditional corporate hierarchies, Parliamentary Procedure, and Sociocracy, and in every case I have witnessed profound dissatisfaction and conflict over decision-making.</p><p>The core problem lies in balancing cohesion with scale. As more individuals participate in a decision, communication challenges escalate, potential conflicts multiply, and individuals feel their influence wane. This leads larger groups, typically, to either fail or centralize power in the hands of a smaller group of decision-makers. Even with the purest intentions, these decision-makers cannot truly harmonize vast, diverse opinions. Inevitably, they end up enforcing their chosen resolutions rather than fostering genuine consensus. Cohesion, then, arises from coercion, either overtly through force and incentives or subtly via social pressures.</p> Scaling Without Centralized Decision-Making <p>But there are some who believe it is possible to achieve group cohesion without central leadership, even at scale. They hold the dream of entire organizations, nations, and even the whole world working together and solving shared problems horizontally. Advances in internet accessibility have spurred experiments in "e-democracy," such as the citizen-generated legislation tool <a href="https://info.vtaiwan.tw/?ref=blog.holochain.org">vTaiwan</a>, Occupy Movement-inspired <a href="https://www.loomio.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Loomio</a>, and the <a href="https://pol.is/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Polis</a> polling system. Additionally, a growing academic discourse, notably <a href="https://www.ieee-jas.net/en/article/doi/10.1109/JAS.2022.105617?ref=blog.holochain.org">LSGDM</a> ("Large-Scale Group Decision Making") predominantly from Chinese universities, aims to improve collaboration among myriad stakeholders from businesses, state agencies and the public.</p><p>In 2017, I set out to make my own software to address these issues. I envisioned a user-friendly suite of digital tools that could transform any group of like-minded individuals into a cohesive organization without centralized decision-making. I gradually developed a three-part model based on research in game theory and LSGDM, my own experience, and a mediation process called <a href="https://convergentfacilitation.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Convergent Facilitation</a>. I also pulled ideas from scientific research on how birds, ants and even children manage to work together without designated leaders or concrete rules.</p><p>This package consisted of three interoperable tools:</p>  Mobilization Tool: Rooted in the principle of contingent agreement, this feature enables users to propose collective actions or events. With it, anyone can suggest a joint action or event, which other people can agree to on the contingency that every necessary role is filled. This allows group action to grow effortlessly from idea to reality without anyone having to worry about its viability. It can be used in a wide variety of contexts from hosting a party with friends to forming business agreements.  Deliberation Tool: Focused on consensus-building, this tool allows stakeholders to shift focus from outcomes to refining a set of criteria that has maximal support. Using this list, they can evaluate and refine proposals to meet those broadly supported criteria. Use cases have included forming covid policy for a school and deciding how to use a large monetary donation.  Strategy Building Tool: Designed for infinitely detailed and broad strategy mapping, this tool facilitates the construction of intertwined multi-step strategies. Participants can outline their goals as sequential phases within a grander scheme, and also identify shared objectives with others.  <p>All three pieces are designed to be used in conjunction. Deliberations and actions can be linked to goals, and actions can be linked to deliberations.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I had a basic version of each tool, I approached a handful of groups to test them, including activists, Nonprofits, and intentional communities. Several groups used them and offered feedback. I steadily improved and simplified the processes, and as I did so, I began to see their potential to achieve truly decentralized organization.</p> Why Holochain? <p>Despite several successes, a few challenges soon emerged. First, many of these groups wanted their information to be completely secure — that meant heavy encryption and private servers. Second, they had no money to pay for those servers. I did not intend to profit from these tools, but it became difficult to host new instances of my software for every group that was interested. I also realized that if my technology was ever to be used by large groups, that system was untenable.</p><p>That’s one reason I decided to move to Holochain. If I, or an organization I created, owned and controlled the software, it would exist only as long as I could support it. Investing in a structure to support group coordination requires trust, and it would help if that trust didn’t rely on the stability of one person or company. Furthermore, Holochain addressed another problem: with traditional architecture, I would have the power, and in some cases legal responsibility, to monitor and censor users. For a system to provide real liberatory power, it couldn’t be run this way. A platform designed for individuals to organize horizontally requires infrastructure that is also horizontal. With Holochain, the platform can be completely controlled and powered by its users. Moreover, as a designer and developer, I am free to focus my energy on improving the tools, without worrying about bureaucracy or scaling.</p><p>So far, I have developed two of the three tools for Holochain — "Who’s in?” to mobilize people for events or joint actions, and “Converge”, for deliberating and making collective decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>To download and try these apps, visit: <a href="https://dcan.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://dcan.app/</a></p> Who's In?: A Mobilization Tool <p>With Who’s In?, anyone can add suggested actions which can be joined by anyone in your network. They can add necessary roles for an action, and other members can commit to participating if the action gains necessary support.</p><p>Watch the Who's In? demo.</p> Converge: A Deliberation Tool <p>With the Converge app, you can start a new deliberation that anyone else in your network can join. Anyone can add and evaluate criteria, as well as add and evaluate proposals against those criteria. Controversial criteria can be objected to and alternatives can be proposed and accepted.</p><p>Watch the Converge demo.</p> Strategy Building Tool <p>The strategy mapping tool will be released soon. It will allow users to list goals they might share with others, as well as sub-goals and sub-sub-goals, and so on. These goals may then be adopted by other users, creating a unified list of popular goals. This makes it easy to see where there is shared motivation, and find out who might be interested in collaborating on what.</p> Are you in? <p>For as long as humans have existed, they have been forced to reckon with the fact that the bigger their groups, the more powerful they can be, but also the more difficult it is to organize without entrusting that power to a few people. The problem has been tackled from every possible angle, but with the advent of peer-to-peer information technology like Holochain, there is an opportunity for brand new forms of organizing to emerge, allowing humans to coordinate organically as peers. If we can crack this problem, I’m hopeful that we can unleash vast amounts of untapped human potential — and if I’m lucky, I won’t have to attend those lengthy and unproductive activist meetings ever again.</p><p>For anyone interested in learning more, visit the <a href="https://dcan.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DCAN website</a> to download and explore Who's In? and Converge.

<p>No matter how a transaction is made – whether digitally, in-person, for one-time use or a recurring payment – the transaction is often linked to a customer’s payment card. As the issuer and the cardholder’s financial institution, you’re responsible for providing secure payment options while navigating the digital transformation of many traditional banking methods to meet the needs and wants of your customer base.</p>
<p>With Mastercard’s recently launched concept, <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/pay-by-account/">Pay by Account</a>, you can revolutionize the payment process for your customers. This latest digital-first feature, supported by the Entrust Digital Card Solution, allows customers to digitize their bank accounts into their mobile apps. You can now elevate the payment experience directly within your mobile banking application, allowing consumers to make secure payments from their bank accounts, Google Wallet, or Apple Pay at any Mastercard point-of-sale (POS) terminal and display a virtual card for online transactions. Consumers can either pay directly from the bank app in the bank’s proprietary wallet (enabled by Entrust with the NFC Issuer Wallet) or push the digitized bank account to wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay. This enables effortless payments at any Mastercard e-commerce merchant without the necessity of card issuance. In addition, customers can use mobile payment options at any Mastercard POS and have the convenience of using a virtual card for online payments.</p>
<p>With the convenience of this additional digital payment solution, you can simplify the complexities of financial card issuance and the need to rely on a payment card as an intermediary. Pay by Account facilitates the payment process for banks and credit unions, offering the opportunity to facilitate real-time transactions. This is particularly advantageous and compelling for those financial institutions not engaged in card issuance or who are lacking compatibility with tokenization for digital card issuance. Pay by Account offers a game-changing alternative, facilitating quick virtual digital card issuance without disrupting existing card issuance infrastructure. It can also add value to the banking app, transforming it into a payment device across online and in-store purchases. Consumers benefit from a very safe and secure tokenized bank account payment experience, delivered within the banking app. Financial institutions add value to their app and keep customer experience at the core of their relationship with the consumer. With more innovations and opportunities comes more revenue opportunities for financial institutions.</p>
<p>Financial institutions can benefit from a simplified integration through an SDK, delivering the highest level of security. Empowering an end customer to choose their preferred form of payment and enabling direct payments from their bank account not only builds trust but also eliminates potential risks associated with third-party data breaches and fraud. The implementation and maintenance are also streamlined and efficient thanks to Entrust’s expert digital card team, which delivers comprehensive project support.</p>

<p>We were delighted to be joined by John from Source Network for our latest edition of Fission Tech Talks! </p><p>​John spoke about the different components of Source Network, including <a href="https://source.network/defra-db">DefraDB</a>, a p2p database, how Source uses IPFS, and some ideas about interop with UCAN.</p> Decentralized Databases <p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> empowers developers to deploy user-centric decentralized databases. </p><p>John realized that there were problems with the way data is handled today:</p>  Fragmentation - Data is unstructured and scattered across apps, devices, and file management system silos, making it time-consuming and laborious to manage.  Imprisonment - Users are stuck behind walled gardens that don't allow data to move easily across services.  Vulnerability - When all our data is stored in one place, it becomes an attractive target for bad actors.   <p>John realized that a viable solution would require decentralized data that was:</p>  Interoperable - Break down the walled gardens and replace them with open data models.  Controllable - User-owned data is key, as users should be able to move their data property around just like they do their physical property.  Secured - Cryptographic protocols can help secure data, putting users at ease.  <p>With these three characteristics in mind, John created DefraDB or Decentralized Infrastructure Database. What makes DefraDB unique? </p><p><a href="https://source.network/defra-db">DefraDB</a> is:</p>  Deployable anywhere  Uses no SQL  Uses P2P protocols  Uses cryptographic state proofs  Employs CRDTs   Authorization <p>In the authorization world, there are two main paths - access control lists and object capabilities. In 2019, Google published <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/">Zanzibar</a>, a paper explaining how they handle authorization across their many services. It uses access control lists but with relationship-based access control rather than role-based access control.</p><p>First, you write a tuple that includes subject, relation, and object. Then, you check if a permission exists and run an expand call that acts as a reverse lookup over a user set. It operates as a Consistent and Partition-Tolerant System.</p><p>The Zanzibar API is centralized, so Source Network created a decentralized implementation of Zanzibar called Zanzi. The Source Hub trust protocol powers it.</p><p>Now, let's turn to the other type of authorization - object capabilities. With object capabilities, revocation can be challenging when you have to get refreshed tokens after the original ones expire. Therefore, Source Network created Zazu, which is Zanzibar Authorization with UCANs</p><p>The Zanzibar service mints the token rather than the individual, eliminating the interactivity problem. Then it goes back to the traditional UCAN spec the rest of the way down the chain. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about Source Network's DefraDB, Zanzi, or Zazu, please visit <a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a>, join the <a href="https://discord.source.network/">Discord</a>, or explore the <a href="https://github.com/sourcenetwork/defradb">DefraDB</a> repo.</p>

<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
 
 The Emerging Trust Layer: The internet lacks a Trust Layer. At the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, we’re addressing this gap by aligning governance with technology to ensure seamless integration. 
 Trust Registries: They are more than just crucial. They serve as the foundational anchor for digital trust ecosystems, and their importance is increasingly being recognized. 
 Interoperability &amp; Conformance: We have not achieved Interoperability. Achieving genuine interoperability demands a conformance suite that backs up the specification and works in synergy. 
 
<p>We’re grateful to the Hyperledger Foundation for providing a platform to share these insights and to everyone who attended the session.&nbsp;</p>

 Whether rightly or wrongly, crypto mixers have become synonymous with money laundering. What can crypto firms do to protect themselves, their customers, and the crypto community from the growing threat of fraud? 



 



<p>The term “<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0138mrz4&amp;date=today%205-y&amp;geo=GB">cryptocurrency tumbler</a>” (also known as crypto mixer) has seen a 5000% increase in Google searches over the past five years. If search queries are anything to go by, it’s easy to see why: there appears to be confusion over how they work, if they are truly private, and whether they’re even legal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interest in crypto mixers has also appeared to have spread from industry insiders to the wider crypto community, including those looking for ways to hide their blockchain transactions.</p>



<p>No longer a niche subsection of an obscure industry, crypto tumblers pose a legitimate concern for the crypto community, because they are now, rightly or wrongly, heavily associated with money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We investigate the dangers associated with crypto tumblers and how crypto firms can reduce the risks of money laundering, meet regulatory challenges, and prevent fraud.</p>



 What are the threats associated with crypto mixers? 



<p>Far from how they’re currently perceived, crypto tumblers were originally created to offer heightened privacy for legitimate blockchain transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>They work by gathering coins from different users, tumbling them all together, and then spitting them out. The recipient receives the same amount of bitcoins they put in, but not the original coins they originally held. The benefit for users is that mixing obscures these transactions, providing anonymity on the blockchain. Naturally, this privacy tool is also exploited by money launderers.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>There are two main types of crypto mixers:</p>



  Centralized mixers – rely on a third party to complete the mixing<br>  Decentralized mixers – rely on protocols like smart contracts&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Without coin mixing, the transparent nature of the blockchain makes it hard for firms to make truly secure investments, or for high-profile individuals to keep their wealth private. However, with coin mixing, users can operate in a completely confidential nature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These features are also the main reasons why crypto mixers have become synonymous with money laundering. Several fraud cases and cyberattacks over the past few years have shown the part that tumbling plays, and the very real threat it poses to the integrity of a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



 The 3 main problems with crypto mixers. 



<p>The most dangerous threats associated with crypto mixers include money laundering, regulatory risks and fraud.</p>



 Money laundering. 



<p>The largest risk associated with crypto mixers is money laundering, and it’s only growing bigger. In fact, data shows that between 2021 and 2022, crypto laundering <a href="https://www.moneylaundering.com/news/cryptocurrency-laundering-soared-last-year-research-shows/">grew by approximately 70%</a>. There are typically two ways that crypto mixers are used to launder money. The first is through “cleaning” coins gained from illegitimate sources, such as pharming or ransomware attacks. The second is by funding criminal activity with clean coins, as the mixer can obscure and anonymise the transaction end point.</p>



<p>The dangers to crypto firms are clear.</p>



<p>“Firms must be able to verify whether their users and coins have been involved in suspicious transactions or sanctioned mixers. Without this information, exchanges could unknowingly be funding criminal activity, such as online cyberattacks or real-world terrorist financing,” said Jason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChipMixer, a type of crypto mixer that exchanged old coins for new coins, was responsible for laundering over <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/chipmixer-shut-down-after-laundering-over-840-million-in-criminal-proceeds/">$850 million</a>, which could be directly linked to illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;International authorities from Europe and the US were concerned over the mixer for flouting regulations and facilitating money laundering. The founder of the platform even wrote, “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybercriminals-crypto-platform-chipmixer-taken-down-says-europol-2023-03-15/">Money laundering’ is a crime made-up by governments that spy on their citizens</a>”. ChipMixer was officially seized and stopped trading in March 2023.</p>



 



 

 



 Regulatory risks. 



<p>One of the major problems of crypto mixers is the blurred lines in which the crypto community operates – exasperated by the relatively infant stage of crypto regulation compared to traditional financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While firms await rules outlined in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime</a> to come into force (expected in 2024), crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK, for example, must register with the Financial Conduct Authority, and therefore comply with Anti-Money Laundering Directives that capture rules to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Only firms with appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forward-thinking risk managers should ensure their organization meets compliance measures if it is serious about preventing money laundering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is particularly important for attracting high-value customers as exchanges that can demonstrate they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/future-crypto-eu-revolution/">follow regulatory guidelines</a>, and are able to plug operational vulnerabilities, provide reassurance to third parties and customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compliance with regulations not only protects firms from sanctions, but can also attract new customers if they feel satisfied that due diligence has been carried out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">sanctioned TornadoCash</a>, a popular coin mixer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crime? Facilitating suspicious transactions, involving stolen funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the real kicker is that some TornadoCash transactions could be traced and linked to groups in North Korea, a country with international sanctions including:&nbsp;</p>



  Freezing of financial assets<br>  Travel bans<br>  Trading restrictions  



<p>As such, users of this mixer put TornadoCash in direct breach of global regulations, and OFAC deemed it the responsibility of the service provider to maintain compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although industry leaders weren’t in agreement (remember that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/coinbase-coin-backed-motion-to-lift-sanctions-on-tornado-cash-denied">Coinbase lawsuit</a>?) regulators have made it clear that persecuting the service providers, rather than the individuals, is preferential.&nbsp;Plus, due to the incredibly private nature of mixers, it’s virtually impossible to go after the users themselves. Still, someone must be held accountable.</p>



 Fraud. 



<p>The opaque nature of crypto tumblers facilitate a perfectly murky breeding ground for fraudsters to operate. And as the industry continues to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">grow at breakneck speed</a>, fraudsters are evolving at a similar rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto mixers lack the common identity verification tools that financial institutions are required to perform, including:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Know Your Customer</a> checks<br>  Ultimate Beneficial Ownership checks<br>  Real-time authentication for transactions&nbsp;  



<p>In fact, many crypto mixers operate without any kind of user monitoring, which means even users who rely on the services for legitimate reasons could be subject to cyberattacks, as there’s no authentication for the user when they make a transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine a crypto mixer user receives a phishing email and clicks on a malicious link. It’s likely they will be redirected to a fake website and be asked to input their credentials. In a matter of seconds, the fraudster has successfully captured the user’s log-in information. From there, all it takes is for the fraudster to re-type the credentials they’ve just gathered into the real site, launder the user’s coins and disappear with the funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although <a href="https://trustpair.com/white-paper/b2b-payment-fraud-us-2023/">60% of business leaders</a> consider fraud awareness training the best approach for minimizing fraud, it should be paired with other tools in order to create a robust shield.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">Crypto fraud prevention</a> requires both initial customer identity verification, and ongoing transaction monitoring. The doubled-down effort approach not only ensures that the account holder is who they claim to be, but that if any bad actors get into the account during the meantime, they will be blocked from making transactions.</p>



 How to manage risks in crypto? 



<p>Risk assessments should be the first point of call for any business operating in a highly-regulated industry. To help combat the threat of money laundering, crypto firms can implement:</p>



 Wallet screening tools. 



<p>Wallet screening tools are an integral part of maintaining wallet hygiene. They allow exchanges to identify the owners of wallets, as well as the source and destination of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, where crypto mixers are involved, transactions can be obscured and it’s harder to trace the entire transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, it’s important to ensure that any wallet screening tool can identify tainted coins, and that this data is used to inform on the risk factors of wallet owners. By leveraging enhanced wallet screening, exchanges can benefit from full transparency over customer wallets, and reduce their risk of enabling money laundering.</p>



 KYC and identity checks. 



<p>By implementing a robust <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">KYC and identity verification process for your crypto firm</a>, you can rest assured that you know who your customers are, while complying with regulations like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">AML</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-provider-criteria/">PVID</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some KYC and identity verification platforms, however, are simply not fit for purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The wrong KYC platform can really affect user experience and therefore conversion rates</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>“When crypto mixers are involved, digital verification becomes more difficult. This is why IDnow’s identity verification services combine video verification with external database checks, risk factor analysis and behavioral analysis. With global ID specialists on-hand for clarification, our clients benefit from AI models and real human verification,” added Jason.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://identityday.se/">Identity Day</a> event brought together experts and thought leaders from across Sweden, to address the evolving challenges in identity management. John Jellema, VP of Product Management at Ubisecure, evoked important themes with his presentation on the complex nature of identity and the need for more robust identity management practices in the ever-changing landscape of work and technology. Watch John’s presentation or read the session highlights below.</p>
<p></p>
 Navigating Identity Challenges in Virtual Working Environments: 
<p>The session kicked off with a focus on the identity challenges posed by virtual working environments. John posed questions about how these challenges can be audited and how to enable trusted business-to-business interactions. He highlighted the importance of ensuring secure and auditable identity management in our increasingly digital world. John posed the question: “Who am I right now, what am I doing, and what am I representing?” He demonstrated how easily one could impersonate others with similar credentials, emphasising that verifying identity becomes a significant challenge, especially in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>This emphasised the limitations of identity verification – particularly poignant in a room full of identity management professionals. He attested that identity is of low value in such settings, while trust remains high. For example, attendees in the session could see his face and match it to the presenter’s name but had no concrete proof of his true identity. And stressed that this ease of trust does not exist in most online transactions or meetings.</p>
 Identity in the Nordics: 
<p>Delving into the strong identity systems in the Nordic region, John discussed the Finnish Trust Network as an example, and its high level of security. However, he warned that even in regions with robust identity management, fraud and theft are on the rise globally, highlighting that there is still a challenge in securely identifying and protecting transactions.</p>
 Challenges in Identity Management: 
<p>Next, John raised critical questions about the trustworthiness of third-party systems and emphasised the need for trust in identity management. Crucially, he underlined the importance of understanding who you’re dealing with in business transactions and the necessity of reliable identity verification to enable this. While this is possible in direct transactions, supply chains and normal business venture often have many sub and sub-sub contractors who are not directly known; raising the question of overall security in B2B environments.</p>
 The Future of Identity: 
<p>The presentation then touched on the future of identity management, noting the potential of animated or dynamic QR codes and the use of passkeys, and stressing the importance of adopting more secure methods. John predicted that even with animated QR codes and Passkeys, that personal adoption of these new methods was low (even in the audience), therefore focus on NIST compliant passwords (longer is better) coupled with easy-to-use MFA was still essential. The value of B2B Identity Management:</p>
<p>A key takeaway from the presentation is how B2B ID management needs to be as secure and robust as individual ID management.</p>
<p>Whilst strong individual IDs are relatively well-known, such as BankID or the upcoming EU Digital Identity Wallet, organisation IDs are either insufficient or underutilised. Therein lies huge opportunity. As John points out, B2B markets significantly outsize B2C markets. John runs through the reasons why the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is the most appropriate choice to realise such opportunities, as a globally recognised, high assured organisational identity.</p>
<p>Off the back of reliable organisation identity,&nbsp; organisational and individual identities can be linked to enable truly trustworthy B2B interactions – as per Ubisecure’s vision for the future of digital identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of digital identity:</p>
<p>The ability to combine highly assured organisational identities with strongly authenticated individual identities to show who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have to represent them.</p>
</blockquote>
 Identity Challenges in a Fluid Workplace: 
<p>With the shift towards virtual and remote work, the challenges of identifying individuals accurately in virtual meetings is becoming increasingly difficult. Especially with the increasing risk of impersonation through deepfake technology. This raises questions about verifying identity when relying solely on virtual interactions.</p>
<p>John’s presentation at Identity Day 2023 sheds some light on the evolving challenges in identity management, emphasising the need for secure, auditable identity practices in an ever-changing digital world. As technology continues to advance, organisations must address these challenges to maintain trust and security in their operations. The future of identity management will require innovative solutions and a collective effort to stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>

It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF61 is live today, Oct 26. It concludes on Nov 2. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF61   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF61 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Verida and cheqd release mobile wallet credential solution for enterprises<p><a href="http://verida.network">Verida</a>, a leader in self-sovereign identity solutions, has formed a foundational partnership with <a href="http://cheqd.io">cheqd</a>, a leader in privacy-preserving payment and credential networks. This strategic alliance signifies a momentous leap forward in the world of Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential management.</p> Driving Credential Adoption and&nbsp;Privacy <p>Verida and cheqd have collaborated to make Verifiable Credentials mainstream for critical enterprise use cases. Both organisations are working together to simplify the issuance, storage, and sharing of credentials through innovative technology solutions.</p><blockquote>“We have prioritised working with the cheqd team to integrate their technology into the Verida ecosystem,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a>, CEO of&nbsp;Verida.</blockquote><blockquote>“cheqd are world leaders in self-sovereign identity and credentials and have developed an innovative credential payment model that will help unlock mainstream adoption.”</blockquote><p>Verida has integrated the cheqd credential network into the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a>, allowing users to receive, store, and share their credentials. This integration has resulted in a comprehensive, end-to-end solution for issuing self-sovereign credentials via easy-to-use APIs. Credentials are generated by trusted organisations using cheqd’s Credentials as a Service product and are then sent to an end user where the credential is self-custodied in a user’s wallet. The user can then share the credential to be verified by third-party applications.</p><p>Verida’s commitment to privacy ensures that user credentials remain confidential, are stored in a regulatory compliant manner and are never exposed on a public blockchain. The data security is guaranteed by Verida’s <a href="http://verida.network">self-sovereign database network</a>, empowering users to manage and share their Verifiable Credentials securely using their private&nbsp;key.</p><blockquote>“The integration of Verida’s decentralised identity storage wallet with the cheqd network offers a compelling vision of ‘Not your keys, not your identity’. People’s digital selves should be in their control, and this includes being able to store their credentials outside of the control of Big Tech providers,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/banerjeeankur">Ankur Banerjee</a>, CTO and Co-Founder at&nbsp;cheqd.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’re proud of the collaboration and technical excellence of the Verida team in offering users an option that is truly in their control.”</blockquote><p>Verida and cheqd are actively engaged in pilot projects with enterprise customers, assisting them to set up ecosystems with verifiable credentials. This includes layering in cheqd’s approach to <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/credential-payments-are-live-4bf4ea1ff7a8?source=collection_home---2------0-----------------------">Credential Payments</a>, unlocking new business models in traditional finance and other&nbsp;sectors.</p> Seamless Integration and Global&nbsp;Reach <p>This partnership combines the technology and expertise behind Verida and cheqd to create an end-to-end solution for issuing and using private credentials. cheqd provides the infrastructure to anchor <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/dids/create-subject-did#creating-a-subject-did">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-did-linked-resources">DID-Linked Resources</a> to the cheqd ledger, as well as to issue, verify, revoke, and monetize credentials. Verida specialises in <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/network-architecture#verida-wallet">digital wallets</a> for credentials and digital assets, as well as <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-storage">decentralized storage</a> and backup. This unique collaboration allows each party to focus on their respective “levels’’ of the tech stack, providing specialised support across global jurisdictions.</p>Integrating Verida and cheqd provides a comprehensive solution for self-sovereign credentials<p>As part of the collaboration, Verida will support cheqd’s approach to <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/status-lists">Status Lists</a> and <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/did-linked-resources/understanding-dlrs/context#trust-registries">Trust Registries</a> within the Verida Wallet, visually indicating the validity, revocation, or suspension of credentials. This support will pave the way for <a href="https://cheqd.io/blog/credential-payments-are-live/">Credential Payments</a> within the wallet. Simultaneously, cheqd will enhance <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/messaging">Verida’s messaging protocol</a> for transporting credentials between its Credential Service and the Verida Wallet. Cheqd will also assist Verida in further developing messaging protocols to support DIDComm and/or OpenID for Verifiable Credentials.</p>Verida Wallet supports cheqd’s approach to Status Lists and Trust Registries<p>This partnership between Verida and cheqd heralds a new era of secure, user-centric digital credentials, offering transformative solutions for businesses and individuals globally. Together, they are accelerating the adoption of self-sovereign identity and advancing the cause of digital&nbsp;privacy.</p> Developer resources:   <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extensions/cheqd-credential-service">Using cheqd Credential Service with Verida&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Verida Developer Portal</a>  <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/">cheqd Identity&nbsp;Docs</a>   About cheqd <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1FSfwL6pi7rCl6O9G9KwJeD8KZnOA_on2Hew11S8U7GA/edit">cheqd</a> is a privacy-preserving payment and credential network that empowers users and organisations with ownership, portability, and control over their data.

<p>With cryptocurrencies entering the global financial scene, people have found themselves empowered with transactional privacy, something that was pretty much non-existent before.</p><p>Crypto mixers, in particular, have played a crucial role here, as they are specifically designed to obscure transaction trails and protect user identities.</p><p>While these mixers champion individual privacy, they’ve also attracted attention due to potential misuse, as evident from the handling of <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-mixer-criminal-volume-2022/#:~:text=On%20April%2019%2C%202022%2C%20the,the%20same%20time%20in%202021.">nearly 8% of all illicit crypto funds in 2022</a> through&nbsp;mixers.</p><p>However, it’s essential to understand that the core issue isn’t the technology itself but its potential misuse.</p><p>Amidst these concerns, the question arises: How do we champion the cause of individual privacy without giving a free pass to nefarious activities? It’s a delicate equilibrium, one that initiatives like privacy pools are striving to&nbsp;achieve.</p> What are Privacy&nbsp;Pools? <p>Privacy Pools, as conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin and four others, including Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364">in their research paper</a>, can be likened to secure digital lockboxes within the cryptocurrency universe.</p><p>Much like a lockbox that safeguards valuable items, Privacy Pools protect transactional details while going a step further by allowing users to demonstrate the legitimacy of their transactions without unveiling the specifics.</p><p>However, these pools aren’t just about maintaining anonymity. They incorporate a robust system that ensures compliance with regulations. This is achieved by categorizing transactions into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sets, allowing the system to flag potentially illicit activities while preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Good Set vs Bad&nbsp;Set <p>The ‘good’ set includes transactions that comply with legal and regulatory standards, ensuring they are legitimate. Conversely, the ‘bad’ set comprises deposits that might have ties to suspicious activities or illegal&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Now, here’s where it gets even more interesting. When users wish to withdraw their funds from the pool, they can provide proof. However, this proof doesn’t disclose their specific transaction details but verifies that their withdrawal is connected to the ‘good’ deposits.</p><p>If you’re wondering how this system operates, in Privacy Pools, users don’t directly reveal their specific transactions. Instead, they provide a hint by sharing a group of possible transactions, known as the association set, indicating that their specific transaction lies somewhere within&nbsp;it.</p><p>This way, users maintain their privacy by not showcasing their exact transactions but still supplying enough data to affirm the legitimacy of their activities.</p><p>Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure this method maintains both transactional privacy and compliance.</p><p>Moreover, third-party entities, known as Association Set Providers (ASPs), will play a pivotal role in this mechanism by curating these ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sets based on various criteria, maintaining transparency and trust in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So, even when the user’s transaction remains obscured, a robust layer of checks and balances will ensure that everything remains straight and&nbsp;narrow.</p><p>This approach will serve as a bridge between the blockchain’s ethos of privacy and the world’s regulatory necessities, intertwining the two in a harmonious blend of technology and compliance.</p> Advantages and Disadvantages of Privacy&nbsp;Pools <p>The benefits of privacy pools are manifold, especially when considering how, by bolstering transactional privacy, they may pave the way for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Once implemented, users previously cautious of the transparent nature of blockchain transactions could have the option to transact with enhanced privacy, in line with certain regulatory standards. This integration of privacy and certain standards presents opportunities for both individual users and the broader ecosystem.</p><p>However, like any technology, privacy pools present challenges, too. For instance, the complexity of achieving widespread regulatory alignment is evident, with different countries having varied views on crypto regulations.</p><p>Additionally, if not monitored effectively, there is a potential for misuse. Just as with any privacy tool, it can be a double-edged sword: while it can protect legitimate users, it could also shield malicious actors if not adequately overseen.</p> The Logic Behind Privacy&nbsp;Pools <p>Privacy Pools operate on fundamental human motivations: the need for transactional discretion and the drive to steer clear from contentious ties.</p><p>When society clearly categorizes transactions as either clean (“good”) or potentially tainted (“bad”), users with reputable transactions naturally align with the “good” set. This ensures their privacy and keeps them away from any association with dubious activities.</p><p>Conversely, those with questionable transactions find little advantage in the system. Their actions can be linked to a set with suspicious undertones, making it easier to trace and identify.</p> A Balanced&nbsp;Approach <p>As the crypto realm grows, the primary challenge is ensuring user privacy while also acknowledging the technological and regulatory landscape. Privacy pools are central to this&nbsp;effort.</p><p>To unlock the full potential of privacy pools, continuous dialogue between the crypto community, regulators, and other key stakeholders is&nbsp;vital.</p><p>By working together, we can prioritize user privacy through privacy pools, all while addressing any potential regulatory concerns. This collective effort is key for the broader acceptance and success of these technologies in the financial world.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Identity management and authentication are evolving rapidly, especially as the era of traditional passwords is slowly becoming outdated. Sebastian Sandell presented at <a href="https://identityday.se/">Identity Day</a> 2023 in Sweden, with a focus on securely authenticating sub-contractor users and the changing landscape of authentication. Watch the video of Sebastian’s presentation or have a look at the presentation highlights in the blog below.</p>
<p></p>
 The Passwordless Revolution 
<p>The traditional method of password authentication is widely accepted to be inconvenient and insecure. Passwordless authentication methods are on the rise and are poised to replace cumbersome password-based systems. In fact, around 99% of modern devices already support these passwordless methods.</p>
 Navigating the Transition 
<p>While passwordless authentication offers a more secure and user-friendly approach, many organisations are still dependent on passwords for authentication. This raises an important question: how can we ensure the security of these accounts, in a transitioning landscape? The answer lies in establishing strong company policies.</p>
 The Role of Company Policies 
<p>Emphasising the critical role that company policies play in securing user accounts, Sebastian covers how these policies dictate password complexity, length, and update frequency. For example, the presence of lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers may be mandatory. For added security, some companies may require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The importance of checking passwords against breach databases is highlighted.</p>
 Enforcing Policies in a Business Environment 
<p>The complexity arises when these policies must be enforced in a business environment, where subcontractors and partners need access to an organisation’s systems. Sebastian provided a scenario illustrating this challenge involving three distinct user groups:</p>
 
 Internal Users: These are employees who have well-defined accounts in the organisation. They access systems using email and passwords, with the option to enable MFA for additional security. 
 Registered Federated Users: These are users from trusted partner organisations. They have some information in the system and can use their organisation’s identity providers (IdPs) for authentication. Their need for MFA depends on their organisation’s policies. 
 Unregistered Federated Users: These users are even further removed from the organisation’s systems and policies. This group includes subcontractors and third-tier connections about whom we have limited information available. 
 
 Customised Authentication for Unregistered Federated Users 
<p>Unregistered federated users present a unique challenge since they lack a detailed profile in the organisation’s system. This emphasises the need for tailored authentication methods for these users. For instance, they might use their Google credentials if they belong to a Google IdP. Depending on the limited data available, they could employ various One-Time Password (OTP) methods, including SMS OTP and SMTP OTP.</p>
 MFA’s Continued Relevance 
<p>Sebastian underlined that, even as passwordless authentication gains traction, there are scenarios where MFA remains essential. As users move further away from trusted internal users towards unregistered federated users, the risk of unauthorised access and security breaches increases. Therefore, MFA can add an extra layer of security to protect the most critical applications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sebastian’s presentation at Identity Day 2023 sheds light on the evolving landscape of authentication. As organisations transition to passwordless authentication, maintaining security for legacy systems still reliant on passwords is crucial. Company policies, emphasising strong password requirements and MFA, are essential for a smooth transition. The challenge of managing authentication in a business environment with subcontractors necessitates tailored solutions. Security remains paramount, and MFA continues to be relevant, especially for safeguarding critical applications. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="Contact Ubisecure">Contact Ubisecure</a> to discuss securely authenticating your unregistered federated users.</p>

<p>How we prove our identity has undergone revolutionary changes in a world of information. At the center of this transformation is Biometric Authentication. In essence, biometric authentication verifies individuals based on their unique physical or behavioral attributes, such as fingerprints, facial patterns, or voice. Its value in bolstering security and simplifying user experiences cannot be understated.</p>
 Understanding Key Concepts 
<p>As we dive into Biometric Authentication, a foundational understanding of its core concepts is essential. It’s not just about recognizing unique physical or behavioral traits; it’s about the broader context in which these traits play a role in authenticating identities.</p>
<p>The distinction between related terms: Biometric authentication shouldn’t be confused with simple biometric data. While both involve unique human characteristics, the former is about verification, while the latter is merely information.</p>
<p>Foundational concepts: It centers on two phases – enrollment, where the user’s biometric data is first captured and stored, and verification, where the presented data is compared against the stored version to authenticate.</p>
 Technological Foundations 
<p>The efficacy of biometric authentication is deeply intertwined with the technological innovations supporting it. From rudimentary hand measurements to sophisticated AI-driven systems, the journey of biometrics is fascinating and transformative.</p>
<p>Key Technologies: Commonly employed biometrics include fingerprints, facial authentication, iris and retina scanning, voice recognition, and behavioral biometrics like keystroke dynamics.</p>

<p>Biometric authentication systems stand out in this regard, offering quick and accurate authentication methods. By streamlining the authentication process, these systems facilitate faster transactions and enhance overall business efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such rapidity and accuracy can lead to increased user trust, potentially boosting user engagement and, in turn, revenue. Moreover, the minimized friction in user experience can also reduce operational overheads, as there’s less need for manual interventions or repeated authentication attempts. In essence, biometrics modernizes the authentication landscape and fosters a conducive environment for robust business growth.</p>
 High Accuracy 
<p>Biometric systems leverage unique physical traits to recognize individuals swiftly and reliably. This precise recognition has become integral for identity verification across sectors, notably government entities, banks, and financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inherent uniqueness of biometric characteristics, which are challenging to duplicate or steal, positions biometrics as a more secure alternative to traditional methods like passwords. As a result, this technology provides unparalleled accuracy in identifying diverse users, from employees to customers.</p>
 Convenience 
<p>The elements utilized in biometric verification, such as iris patterns, voice modulations, and even DNA, remain primarily consistent, minimizing the risks of damage or abrupt alterations. This ensures that biometric authentication is not only stable but also user-centric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It offers a speedy, user-friendly process that’s tough to counterfeit and doesn’t burn a hole in the pocket. Moreover, given that biometrics tap into inherent features, there’s little to no learning curve for users, making the entire experience smooth and intuitive.</p>
<p>As with any technological advancement, biometric systems, while groundbreaking, come with their set of challenges and risks. It’s crucial to be aware of these to harness biometrics’ full potential.</p>
 Challenges &amp; Risks 
<p>Biometric authentication, while heralded for its revolutionary approach to security, has its challenges. Understanding these challenges equips us for better adoption from potential data alterations to strategic hurdles.</p>
 
 Potential pitfalls: Over-reliance on secondary authentication can be safe. No system is infallible. 
 Human factors: Environmental conditions, injuries, or aging can alter biometric data. 
 Strategic Approaches &amp; Principles: Multimodal biometrics, or using two or more biometric methods, is one strategy being adopted. Also, emphasizing user consent and data transparency is pivotal. 
 
<p>Having gauged both biometrics’ strengths and potential pitfalls, let’s cast our gaze forward. What is the future of biometric authentication, and where is this dynamic field headed?</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>On October 25th, 2023, AWS <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/10/amazon-web-services-to-launch-aws-european-sovereign-cloud">announced </a>their intention to launch AWS European Sovereign Cloud. This is an important announcement which reflects the impact of EU GDPR regulation and the EU recent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf" title="Schrems II judgement">Schrems II judgement</a>.</p>
 What was Announced 
<p>AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be a new, independent cloud for Europe that is designed to help public sector organizations and those in highly regulated industries meet the regulatory data residency and operational requirements. This cloud service will be located and operated within Europe. It will be physically and logically separate from existing AWS Regions, but AWS claims, will provide the same security, availability, and performance of existing AWS Regions. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will launch with its first AWS Region in Germany and will be available to all European customers. </p>
 The Impact of Globalisation 
<p>Globalisation has provided many benefits allowing nation states and organizations to obtain what they need, when they need it from wherever it is cheapest. This has reduced the costs for citizens and businesses alike but has created an increased dependency on ever more extended supply chains. The COVID epidemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions have called this approach into question. The notion of the sovereign cloud needs to be seen in this context.</p>
<p>Cloud sovereignty involves several areas, these include but are not limited to the protection of personal data. It also includes the protection of intellectual property, commercial secrets, as well as other forms of sensitive information. It concerns the influence that service users have over the legal frameworks that bind the service through a say in government. Also, their confidence in service continuity not only in the event of natural disasters but also of geopolitical conflicts.</p>
 The Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used. This can be achieved in several ways through legal, and technical measures as well as physical location. Within Europe there are already <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80900/european-hosted-hybrid-iaas-cloud/">several cloud services</a> that are locally owned and delivered. However, these services find it hard to compete against the level of functionality provided by the global hyperscale cloud services and the economies of scale that they enjoy. Therefore, using purely local providers often involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state sponsored projects. However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyperscale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close. Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Dossier/gaia-x.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control. Google, together with other hyperscale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
 Four Key areas of Sovereignty 
<p>There are four key areas of sovereignty and the announcement by AWS needs to be considered against all of these.</p>
<p> Data sovereignty – the customer should have control over the access to and the use of their data. This is what the technical measures from the EDPB (European Data Protection Board) are intended to enforce. Since many data processing regulations specify this, the customer should also have control over the physical location of their data and administrative access by cloud service administrators. With the exception of the location of administrators, data sovereignty is already supported by all the major IaaS providers although not all customers make full use of the controls provided.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty – this is control over the jurisdiction where the administration of the service and its infrastructure is conducted. AWS have announced that the AWS European Sovereign Cloud infrastructure will be operated independently from existing AWS Regions. To assure independent operation of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, only personnel who are EU residents, located in the EU, will have control of day-to-day operations, including access to data centers, technical support, and customer service. Access to customers’ data is further controlled through the AWS Nitro System which separates the control plane from the data plane and prevents operational access to customers’ data.</p>
<p>Technical Sovereignty – the customer can develop, deploy, move, and manage their workloads with a minimum of disruption. While there is significant openness in application development environments, the AWS cloud is built on a proprietary technical stack, and this makes it hard to move a workload to another cloud. It also makes it hard to manage the hybrid multi-cloud and on-premises IT environment that is now common in most organizations. There is a need for standard interfaces that customers can use to build, deploy, manage, and optimise their workloads independently of the cloud service used. This is still work in progress with VMware, OpenStack, Anthos, and RedHat OpenShift all offering some level of solution to some of the problems.</p>
<p>Sovereign Ownership – the infrastructure used to provide the cloud service is normally owned by the CSP. This means that even if it is located in a given geography its use could be withdrawn by the CSP in the event of geopolitical conflict. Even if it were to be seized by a government the knowledge and external infrastructure required would make it difficult to make it operational.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>The AWS announcement today is a major step that will enable public service and regulated organizations in the EU benefit from the capabilities provided by the AWS Cloud Services. It further illustrates the bargaining power that the EU can exert on service providers from outside of the region. However, it does not mitigate the potential for technical lock in or the geopolitical risks associated with services owned outside of the EU Jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">we announced</a> that our onboarding tool YeshID Onboard is now in beta and that we’re providing it free to the first 100 organizations of 25-250 employees working in Google Workspace to sign up. We’ve onboarded more than 20 companies since we put that message out, and we’re thrilled with the success those teams are experiencing with Onboard. But we’ve also noticed there are some questions around why we would give YeshID Onboard away for free, and that’s what I want to talk about today.</p>
 Ship, learn, improve 
<p>YeshID is a startup. Alex and I founded the company, and now we’re a small team with experience from tech heavy hitters like Meta, Microsoft, OpenDNS/Cisco, and RSA. We’re what you call a seed stage startup: we’re in the initial phase of developing our product and are focused on turning an innovative idea into a viable business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seed startups are known for their potential to bring disruptive solutions to the market. They often challenge the status quo and aim to break into existing industries with new and creative approaches — and that’s just what we’re doing. We’re developing <a href="https://yeshid.com/">a tool that will disrupt the identity and access management world</a> for smaller companies, which right now spans too big (like Okta) or too minimal (like spreadsheets).&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that we’re doing a lot of research, a lot of testing and iterating, and a lot of proving out concepts — and here’s the thing: we can’t do any of that without you. So, we’re giving our product away. Simple as that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will that always be the case? Hopefully not! We are starting a business after all, but rest assured that if you join on a free plan, your plan will stay free, even if we start charging new customers for it.&nbsp;</p>
 Join us 
<p>Onboarding and offboarding are so fundamental to companies of all kinds, yet solutions have either lagged behind business needs or leap-frogged over a whole market size. This feels like the perfect entry point for YeshID and for companies looking to take the next step in their identity and access management journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onboard is purpose-built for small businesses using Google Workspace. We help you knock out the operational tasks that need to get done today while laying a solid foundation for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Save time onboarding and offboarding team members with consolidated user controls 
 Manage application requests and keep track of IT licenses and costs all in one place 
 Skip the login screen and move effortlessly between approved applications 
 
<p>Plus, after you sign up, you’ll also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. And you’ll be helping us learn even more about the small business needs that have been overlooked until now. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Head to our website</a> to learn more. </p>

Together, we’re creating something incredible, which makes achieving our goals even more satisfying. I’m fortunate to have supportive colleagues whom I can rely on. We maintain our smiles, even when facing challenges, and I feel very grateful for my exceptional team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I strive to be passionate about life’s small, everyday joys because these are the things that truly bring happiness. Spending time with my friends and family, being in the company of my beloved animals, and, ideally, immersing myself in nature!</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream? Picture a house filled with cats. Just kidding (or am I? 😄). On a more profound note, my dream is to leave a positive impact on our planet, the place we call home. Whether that impact is big or small, I want to contribute to making our world a better place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>The prospect of playing a significant role in making financial assets more accessible to everyone! Tokenization is evolving rapidly, and we’ll be there every step of the way.</p>

<p>Over the past 18 months, SpruceID has been working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to bring mobile driver's licenses to residents of California. Earlier this fall, the State of California expanded the initial pilot program to allow California residents <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">to download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone through the California DMV mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android devices).</p>Images of the California Mobile Driver's License (mDL) in the California DMV mobile app. Source: <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California DMV Website</a><p>The mobile driver’s license is powered by SpruceID’s SpruceKit components and Credible Platform product. SpruceKit is an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity that enables secure wallet construction, and Credible Platform provides entire credential life cycle management–from issuance and presentations, to updates and revocation. Both are modular solutions that are made to integrate into existing high-assurance environments with security and privacy at the core.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">privacy-first mobile driver's license</a> can be used at participating TSA airport security checkpoints and select retail locations. In the future, the mobile driver’s license can help residents prove their identity online, operate motor vehicles, access health care, secure financial assistance, and verify their age–both in-person and online–while selectively disclosing only the necessary information.&nbsp;</p> Open Source <p>There are three main pillars important to us as we worked with the DMV to scope out a mobile driver's license solution. First, we fundamentally believe in the value of open-source technology as a public good to reduce build costs, prevent vendor lock-in, and provide transparency. Our core components are, therefore, open-source to create an accessible ecosystem for digital identity infrastructure, to demonstrate that open protocols are indeed open with usable production-grade libraries free of proprietary licensing, and to allow civil society to review the function of critical workflows. While SpruceID is indeed a private sector business, our mission to let users control their data across the web can only be realized through ecosystems built on privacy, security, and choice.</p><p>While the program is still in the pilot phase, we are actively collecting and implementing early user feedback. As the program matures, we will first release the base libraries as open-source software, to empower other States, jurisdictions, and the private sector to implement privacy-preserving digital credentials.</p> Interoperability <p>We are committed to interoperability and standards compliance by implementing the ISO standard for mobile driver's license applications (ISO/IEC 18013–5) and W3C Verifiable Credentials. This facilitates compatibility across agencies, across different states, and, in the future, online for various websites and digital services. It also creates an even playing field for technology providers so that digital identity infrastructure is not dominated by only a few large firms.</p><p>Today, a registered driver in California can use their DMV-issued mDL to prove their identity to the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) at select airport security checkpoints using ISO/IEC 18013-5. There are currently twenty-five airports across the United States that accept digital IDs at security checkpoints, including the California mobile driver’s license. </p>The TSA currently accepts mDLs issued by several states and wallet/app providers for TSA PreCheck lanes in participating airports. (Source: <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2023/08/30/transportation-security-administration-seeks-comments-proposed-0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tsa.gov</a>, blue highlighting added by SpruceID)<p>In 2022, the TSA <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/transportation_security_administration_0.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">announced a new budget</a> authorizing an R&amp;D initiative focused on integrating digital identity authentication capabilities at airport checkpoints. They specifically outlined the importance of digital identities, including the increase in the efficiency of security checkpoints for passengers. They also stressed the increase in privacy afforded to travelers by only sharing the required information (name, gender, date of birth, and photo) rather than the entire ID card (which also includes weight, height, home address, and other information).</p><p>In the future, a mobile driver’s license holder may use their smartphone-held ID to digitally prove their identity, which is currently challenging to complete in a high-trust manner with a physical ID card. We recently hosted (and participated in) the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/test-of-mdl-interoperability-organized-by-spruceid-aamva?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ISO 18013-7 Interoperability Event</a> along with the California DMV to test how mobile driver’s licenses can be used online with a variety of mDL verifiers. ISO/IEC 18013-7 is the draft standard for how a mobile driver’s license can be verified in an unattended presentation, such as online. </p> User Experience <p>Finally, we want to ensure increased privacy, security, and convenience for users. Smartphones are increasingly a part of our daily lives, and the convenience of having a mobile driver’s license on a smartphone must be accompanied by a high level of security.&nbsp;</p><p>From a user perspective, we knew it would be critical for Californians to feel their information and activity are safe and private while using a mobile driver’s license. Users of the application are offered more privacy in interactions than using their physical ID counterparts since it allows users to selectively disclose only the required information. For example, at a drinking establishment, you can prove that you are over 21, without exposing your full birth date, your weight, your home address, or other personal details.&nbsp;</p><p>The mobile driver’s license also prevents “issuer phone-home,” where issuers may be notified each time someone verifies a mobile driver’s license digitally. This is prevented by allowing offline verifications that do not permit the issuer to track the mDL holder and where they are presenting their mDL.</p><p>At SpruceID, we firmly believe in empowering citizens through user-controlled identity. In our Digital Identity Knowledge Base, we shared more about our ideology related to privacy and equity in a mobile driver's license solution, in alignment with the EFF, ACLU, and EPIC comments to the Department of Homeland Security’s request for comments. You can read more in our Knowledge Base <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">here</a>.</p><p>Digital identity impacts all of us, and we're collaborating with the California DMV to refine and improve based on the initial feedback from the pilot program.

  <p>We’re excited to share the public preview of delegating Azure role assignment management using conditions. This preview gives you the ability to enable others to assign Azure roles but add restrictions on the roles they can assign and who they can assign roles to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the owner of an Azure subscription, you likely get requests from developers to grant them the ability to assign roles in your subscription. You could assign them the Owner or User Access Administrator role, but those roles grant permission to assign any Azure role (including Owner!), and that’s probably a lot more permission than necessary for that developer’s scenario. You could instead make role assignments for these developers on demand, but that makes you an unnecessary and impractical bottleneck in their workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another common case we hear about is a deployment pipeline that needs to make role assignments as part of the deployment process, for example to grant a virtual machine managed identity access to Azure Storage and other resources. You don’t want to assign the deployment pipeline the Owner or User Access Administrator role because again, it’s a lot more permission than is needed for the scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We created this feature so you can grant permission to create role assignments, but only under specific conditions, such as for specific roles. You can do this in two ways:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Make a role assignment that is constrained using conditions.&nbsp; 
 Use a new built-in role that has built-in conditions.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at each scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to delegate role assignment management using conditions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meet Dara, a developer who needs to enable an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) managed identity to pull images from an Azure Container Registry (ACR). Now, you can assign Dara the Role Based Access Administrator role and add conditions so she can only assign the AcrPull and AcrPush roles and only to service principals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Delegate Azure role assignment management using conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to do this step by step:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: When creating a new role assignment, on the Privileged administrator roles tab select the new Role Based Access Control Administrator role. You could also select any built-in or custom role that includes the Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Select role</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: On the Members tab, select the user you want to delegate the role assignments task to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Select members</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: On the Condition tab, click Add condition to add the condition to the role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Add condition to role assignment&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: On the Add role assignment condition page, specify how you want to constrain the role assignments this user can perform by selecting one of the templates. For example, if you only want to restrict the roles that a user can assign (ex. AcrPull and AcrPush) and the type of principals the user can assign roles to (ex. service principals), select the Constrain roles and principal types template.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Select role template</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5: On the Constrain roles and principal types pane, add the roles you want the user to be able to assign and select to what principal types the user can assign roles to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Select role and principal type&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 6: Save the condition and complete the role assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Review role assignment with conditions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to delegate role assignment management using a new built-in role with built-in conditions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Dara wants to control who can sign into virtual machines using Microsoft Entra ID credentials. To do this, Dara needs to create role assignments for the Virtual Machine User Login or Virtual Machine Administrator Login roles. In the past, you had to grant Dara the Owner or User Access Administrator role so she could make these assignments. Now, you can grant Dara the new Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator role. Then, Dara will only be able to assign the roles needed to manage access to the virtual machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, you can assign Key Vault Data Access Administrator role to trusted users managing key vaults, enabling them to assign only Azure Key Vault-related roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assign the new built-in roles with built-in conditions, start a new role assignment, select the Job function roles tab, and select a role with built-in conditions, such as Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator. Then complete the flow to add a new role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9 Select Key Vault or Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roles with built-in conditions have Data Access Administrator as part of the role name. Also, you can check if a role definition contains a condition. In the Details column, click View, select the JSON tab, and then inspect the condition property. Over time we’ll add more roles with built-in conditions, for the most common scenarios, to make it easy to manage resources and manage access to those resources with simple role assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10: Key Vault Data Access Admin JSON view definition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Next steps 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have several<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/delegate-role-assignments-examples"> examples</a> for you to get started and customize as needed. Delegating Azure role assignments with conditions is supported using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager REST API, PowerShell, and Azure CLI. Try it out and let us know your feedback in the comments or by using the Feedback button on the Access control (IAM) blade in the Azure portal!</p>

<p>We’re betting that your customers are growing increasingly concerned about safeguarding their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> in an increasingly connected digital world. With data breaches and other privacy infringements at an <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/02/another-reason-to-use-mysudo-data-breaches-hit-record-high-in-2021/">all-time high</a>, it’s hard to escape the headlines screaming at consumers to be more proactive about their privacy. What’s more, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer polls</a> all indicate that a growing number of consumers actually want to be proactive about privacy and want brands to step up too.<br><br>Two valuable ways that your customers can guard against <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">scammers</a> are to develop safe browsing habits and use a password manager. For example, you could give your customers this common advice:</p>



 Safe browsing: navigating the digital landscape securely 







<p>a) Keep your software up to date: Regularly updating your operating system, web browser, and security software is an easy way to make sure you have the latest patches and fixes, shielding you from known vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>b) Beware of phishing attempts: Phishing emails and websites are designed to deceive you into revealing sensitive information. Stay vigilant by double-checking email senders, avoiding suspicious links, and refraining from sharing personal data on unverified websites.</p>



<p>c) Use secure connections: Make sure the websites you visit use the HTTPS protocol, particularly when you’re submitting sensitive information such as passwords or payment details. HTTPS encrypts the data transmission, making it significantly more challenging for malicious actors to intercept.</p>



<p>d) Exercise caution with downloads: Only download files or software from trusted sources. Scan files for malware before opening them, since malicious downloads can compromise your data and privacy.</p>



 Password managers: your secure vault for stronger login credentials 







<p>a) Generate strong, unique passwords: Password managers help you create complex passwords that are difficult to crack. You can generate and store unique passwords for each account, eliminating the need to remember them all.</p>



<p>b) Encrypted password storage: Password managers store your login credentials in an encrypted format, so even if the data is compromised, it remains unreadable to unauthorized people.</p>



<p>c) Convenient autofill and synchronization: With a password manager, you can conveniently autofill login forms across devices, eliminating the need to type passwords manually. Synchronization capabilities allow you to access your passwords securely from multiple devices.</p>



<p>d) Two-factor authentication (2FA) integration: Many password managers support 2FA, providing an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step, such as a fingerprint scan or a unique code sent to your mobile device.</p>



<p>Protecting your data privacy requires an active and conscious effort in today’s digital landscape. By embracing safe browsing practices and using a password manager, you take significant steps towards safeguarding your personal information from cyber threats and reclaiming your online privacy.</p>



<p>This is all great advice to give your customers and we highly recommend you do. But what if we told you that you could go the extra mile and easily package a safe browser and VPN into your product mix? You’d make privacy management easier for your customers and build brand loyalty and revenue streams for your bottom line.</p>

<p>For far too many organizations, Identity and Access Management (IAM) has become a study in locking the storm window while leaving the front door wide open. From MGM to Facebook to T-Mobile and beyond, 2023 has found a growing number of security teams forced to chase down data breaches, ransomware attacks, and phishing scams after network access has been granted. Without the architecture to support modern forms of identity verification, we can’t seem to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting compromised logins to infiltrate corporate systems. Here’s why this keeps happening—and how plugging the identity gap in your IAM architecture can stop the insanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 IAM a Mess: Why Your MFA Can’t Keep the MOFOs Out 
<p>Hackproof IAM requires two things: Verifying the identity of a user at enrollment and confirming that it’s this same individual attempting to log into an account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most IAM systems are decades old and lack identity verification. Putting a checkmark to rudimentary identity verification for new users and then issuing weak credentials via email or Post-it note? Good luck with that. Password- and basic multi-factor authentication (MFA)-based IAM can only really ensure the person accessing an account knows the password or OTP. While basic forms of biometric authentication can confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so, it can’t verify that person is who they claim to be. This is especially true for device-based biometrics, hardware tokens, and passkeys that assume but do not verify identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short: That proverbial front door is left wide open to account takeover (ATO)—including growing numbers that lead to <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/resource/ransomware-gangs-take-less-than-a-day-to-breach-microsoft-active-directory-heres-what-to-do">Active Directory (AD)</a> and <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/north-korea-s-kimsuky-doubles-down-on-remote-desktop-control">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</a> breaches. But it doesn’t have to be this way.&nbsp;</p>
 Modernizing IAM: Architecture is Everything 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we long ago recognized what’s needed is a way to verify and authenticate identity online the same way we confirm it in real life—with a valid credential that can’t be vouched for by mere password, OTP, or a static, spoofable biometric. So we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within an architecture that gives IT unmatched identity assurance behind each device used to access systems—while delivering an account registration and authentication experience that is as convenient as its hack proof. This architecture is built on the following five core pillars to fully eliminate the failures of traditional IAMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine-verified Identity</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 1Kosmos architecture employs automated, digitally-verified identity exceeding stringent KYC, KYE, and AML guidelines. Identity verification via government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, certifications, health records, etc.) enables organizations to standardize the onboarding of workers, customers, and citizens to prevent the use of synthetic and stolen identity information at account enrollment—and seamless authentication that’s impervious to account takeover at login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Biometric-based Strong User Authentication</p>
<p>&nbsp;Verified biometrics secured cryptographically with public-private keys vastly outperform passwords in both security and convenience. That’s why we built the first (and only) architecture to support and exceed <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics</a>–, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a> security standards. Passwords are replaced with a secure identity wallet and a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">liveness test</a> to confirm the person attempting to log in is, in fact, the authorized user and not a bot, deep fake, or imposter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity With Privacy by Design</p>
<p>Once biometrics are digitized and stored, they can be stolen. In 1Kosmos BlockID, unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) is prevented through a blockchain-based digital “chain of custody” for identity-related data. Because 1Kosmos is anchored by a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/">Privacy by Design</a> framework, organizations can confidently accelerate user onboarding, protect digital accounts from ATO, combat transaction fraud, and more. Fraudulent access attempts are detected, logged, and blocked automatically. And it’s all done in full compliance with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and other privacy mandates.</p>
<p>A Private, Permissioned Distributed Ledger&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This immutable “chain of custody” provides tamper-evident identity verification and reusable verifiable credentials on demand. This enables the user’s digital identity wallet to securely store a wide range of information—personal details, legal and education credentials, financial accounts, digital health records, etc. With irrefutable proof of identity and an immutable audit log of all updates and access attempts, organizations can focus on building customer loyalty and capture market share from less tech-savvy rivals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reusable Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>High assurance and cryptographically secure storage and sharing establish repeatable, high-trust re-verification across a wide array of use cases. This can range from establishing “inferred” identity based on an email address or device that’s adequate for the intended use, to cross-referencing biometrics with government-issued forms of ID or information from banking, telco, or corporate databases, to the very highest levels of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) mandates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A Foundation for Future-Proof IAM 
<p>This is all just the beginning. In forthcoming posts in this series, we’ll take a closer look at each pillar and its role in enabling and supporting a consistent and secure onboarding and authentication experience into all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In the current digital landscape, the line that differentiates identity management from robust security is fast blurring. Many traditional identity solutions, initially designed to assist small businesses in transitioning identities to the cloud, are now buckling under the challenges posed by advanced enterprise complexities. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, initially conceived to simplify cloud-based identity, serves as a case in point. Its ongoing struggles highlight the pivotal difference between companies constructed mainly for identity management and those forged for identity security from the ground up, like HYPR.</p>  
 Defining an Identity Security Company  
<p>An identity security company goes beyond managing credentials; it embodies the protection of every snippet of information, every user interaction, and every digital echo from mounting threats. Unlike traditional identity companies that prioritize convenience, an identity security company places security as its top priority. Moreover, the focal point isn't solely user authentication, but on safeguarding the entire span of digital actions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Foundational Identity Security Controls  
<p>To genuinely emphasize security in identity management it’s important to embed identity security controls into the very fabric of the organization. These include:</p> 
  
  Phishing-Resistant Authentication Everywhere: It’s paramount to implement authentication methods that are <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">resilient to phishing attacks</a>. Moreover, there should never be a fallback to weaker or more vulnerable authentication techniques.  
  Security Education Across the Entire Business: Ensure a continuous inflow of updates on emerging threats and the latest security best practices. This must apply to everyone across the company, not just people touching the product.&nbsp;  
  Make the Business Allergic to Shared Secrets: When a hacker gets a foothold in an environment, they look for shared secrets such as API keys, tokens, static credentials, and others to try to spread throughout the environment. Eliminate shared secrets wherever possible and when you do have to use them, put tight controls on who has access and how they can be used.&nbsp;  
  Routine Security Audits That Aren’t Routine: Don’t just go for the checklist approach to security audits and compliance. Understand the true intent behind the compliance, regulatory or security obligations so that you are addressing core security needs. This keeps you ahead of the curve and able to implement solutions that mesh with your business objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Make Security Your Company Culture:&nbsp; A security-first mindset starts at the top. Understand that your customers' security needs take priority and reflect this in the choices you make.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Designing a Secure Architecture  
<p>A well-designed secure architecture lays the foundation for a strong and reliable identity security solution. Critical elements include:</p> 
  
  Comprehensive Vulnerability Management: Invest time, effort and money into testing your solution from various angles to eliminate blind spots. Partner with multiple third-parties who are experts in their part of the tech stack. For us at HYPR, that means working with specialized pen testing partners on Mobile, Endpoint, Back-End, and Cloud.  
  Adherence to the Least Privilege Principle: Granting access only to essential resources ensures data integrity.  
  Uninterrupted Monitoring: A 24/7 vigil on all operations is vital to preemptively detect and counteract any potential threats.  
  
 Why Security Cannot Be an Afterthought  
<p>For companies in the identity domain, security must not be just a supplementary feature — it's their bedrock. Even a minor breach can erode trust and have <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">lasting financial implications</a>. As the nature of cyber threats intensifies, a persistent and unwavering focus on security transitions from being an option to an imperative. By prioritizing security from the beginning, identity companies like HYPR ensure robust protection at all points of the digital journey.</p> 
 Guidance for Buyers: Making Informed Choices in Identity Products  
<p>When it comes to choosing an identity product, it's essential to make informed choices. Look for companies with a demonstrated track record in prioritizing security. By taking the time to gather information and ask the right questions, buyers can ensure they make the best choice for their identity security needs.</p> 
  
  Delve Deeper Than Features: The underlying principles, commitments, and practices of a company are often more telling than a mere feature list.  
  Ask for a Threat Model: Your Identity partners should be able to walk you through a comprehensive threat model of their business. If your security and technical folks aren’t happy with it, there’s a major issue.&nbsp;  
  Demand Transparency: Reputable companies will be forthright about their security protocols and will not shy away from sharing audit outcomes.  
  Verify Compliance Credentials: It's vital to ensure the solution aligns with global benchmarks like GDPR, CCPA, and the like. Be sure to check out HYPR’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/trust-center/security-compliance">Compliance and Certifications</a>.  
  Seek Genuine Feedback: Interactions with current clients offer a transparent window into the product’s real-world performance.  
  
<p>To wrap up, as our digital footprints grow and identities become more intertwined with our real-world selves, the distinction between simply managing and truly securing these identities becomes paramount. HYPR, with its foundational emphasis on security, ensures that the complexities of identity management are met with unwavering security measures. While no one can be perfectly secure,&nbsp; our security first approach gives even the largest and most complex businesses in the world the confidence to work with HYPR.</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Whether private or public sector, B2B or B2C, our customers are excited by the power&nbsp; and value of verifiable credential technology. It’s a game-changing way to share and verify data and build seamless processes that deliver a multitude of benefits. From passwordless access to seamless account verification, mobile driver’s licenses to digital travel credentials, device monitoring to data sharing networks, verifiable credentials are driving digital transformation through the ability to trust the source and integrity of any kind of data, deter fraud, and deliver the kind of data protection demanded by regulators.</p>
<p>Healthcare companies are using verifiable credentials to develop more accurate and simple ways for patients to share health records between providers. Financial service companies are using verifiable credentials to power real-time account access verification. And governments are using verifiable credentials to deliver better access to business and public services for millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>None of this requires starting afresh or committing to months or years of complex implementation. Verifiable credential technology can be layered on top of what you already have in a matter of weeks or a few months (making it fast and cost effective to implement and use. It’s also easy and cost effective to scale up to whatever scale you need to achieve.</p>
<p>Benefits of verifiable credentials&nbsp;</p>
<p>In simple terms, verifiable credentials are powered by cryptographic trust and digital signatures. You can prove the source of any data presented from a verifiable credential and that the data hasn’t been tampered with. It’s a brilliant, simple, and (energy) efficient use of distributed ledger technology and new protocols and standards.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means you don’t need to directly integrate different data sources or rely on third parties to manage identity verification. Data issued by a bank can be instantly verified by a retailer with the absolute assurance that it came from the named bank and hasn’t been altered. Instantly actionable data allows you to create new ways of doing business or radically simplify any kind of business interaction or service where high-value information has to be shared and verified (think KYC or mortgage applications or drone flight paths).</p>
<p>The ability to authenticate anyone (and they you) in a secure digital interaction deters fraud and phishing and makes the continuous verification needed for zero-trust security implementations a breeze.</p>
<p>So how do you get started? Indicio Proven™ is our complete product for building what we call a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. It’s based on our award-winning solutions for global enterprises and has everything you need to issue, hold, present, and share verifiable credentials — including a simple way to manage governance!</p>
<p>Instead of developer teams spending months installing new IAM systems, here’s how easy it is to go from an idea to implementation in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Deployment in 3 easy steps</p>
<p>Whether you are a large enterprise with expansive resources or a small team with just a few developers, Indicio Proven™ is designed to be easy to adopt and integrate into your existing systems.</p>
<p>1. Install the Proven™ Issuer software agent on your&nbsp; server and connect it to the data source or service of their choice via standard APIs.</p>
<p>2. Use the&nbsp; Proven™ Issuer agent software to send&nbsp; an invitation URL (often in a QR code) to the person or organization you want to send a verifiable credential to (a “holder”). The verifiable credential contains the holder’s&nbsp; data, in an encrypted format, which is stored in a secure digital wallet app under the holder’s control, usually on their mobile device.</p>
<p>3. The holder can now present the data in their credential to anyone who has the Indicio Proven™ Verifier agent software, which can also be used on a mobile device. The Verifier application can also be connected via APIs to other services or systems to transmit the verified data.</p>
<p>Indicio helps a broad range of companies and organizations — <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">including SITA</a> —to&nbsp; build verifiable credential solutions using the latest open standards and open-source protocols.</p>

  <p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Graph Activity Logs. Have you wondered what applications are doing with the access you've granted them? Have you discovered a compromised user and hoped to find out what operations they have performed? If so, you can now gain full visibility into all HTTP requests accessing your tenant’s resources through the Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Note: We're enabling&nbsp;the feature starting today. Public preview will be available in all public cloud regions within two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>You’re currently able to collect SignIn logs to analyze authentication activity and Audit logs to see changes to important resources. With Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, you can now investigate the complete picture of activity in your tenant – from token request in SignIn logs, to API request activity (reads, writes, and deletes) in Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, to ultimate resource changes in Audit logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Graph Activity Logs include information about the request and client application. Some common use cases include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identifying the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant. 
 Building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs – such as an application enumerating all users; or making probing requests with many 403 errors.  
 Investigating unexpected or unnecessarily privileged assignments of application permissions. 
 Identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications – such as extreme call volumes that exhaust rate-limits for the tenant. 
 
<p><br>To illustrate working with these logs, we can look at some basic LogAnalytics queries:<br><br>Summarize applications and principals that have made requests to change or delete groups in the past day:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)</p>
<p>| where RequestUri contains '/group'</p>
<p>| where RequestMethod != "GET"</p>
<p>| summarize UriCount=dcount(RequestUri) by AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode</p>




<p>&nbsp;<br>To see recent requests that failed due to authorization:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1h)</p>
<p>| where ResponseStatusCode == 401 or ResponseStatusCode == 403</p>
<p>| project AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode, RequestUri, RequestMethod</p>
<p>| limit 1000</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get top 20 app instances by request count:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)</p>
<p>| summarize RequestCount=count() by AppId, IpAddress, UserAgent</p>
<p>| sort by RequestCount</p>
<p>| limit 20</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph Activity Logs are available through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-log-monitoring-integration-options-considerations">Azure Monitor Logs integration of Entra</a>. Administrators can configure the collection and storage destinations of Microsoft Graph Activity Logs through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-azure-monitor-logs">Diagnostic Setting</a> in the Entra Portal. These settings allow you to configure the collection of the logs to a storage destination of your choice. The logs can be stored and queried in an Azure Log Analytics Workspace, archived in Azure Storage Accounts, or exported to other SIEM tools through Azure Event Hubs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For logs collected to a Log Analytics Workspace, you can use the full set of Azure Monitor Logs features, such as a portal query experience, alerting, saved queries, and workbooks.</p>

<p>It seems you can’t go anywhere today without <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-ai">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> creeping into the conversation. Billed by some as being as, or potentially more disruptive than the internet, AI and machine learning (ML) are laying the foundation for the next digital age, whether we’re ready or not.</p>
<p>Bankers are taking note. According to a survey from <a href="https://impact.economist.com/perspectives/financial-services/forging-new-frontiers-advanced-technologies-will-revolutionise-banking">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, 77% of bankers believe that the ability to unlock the value of AI will be the difference between winning and losing banks. And there are many obvious use cases for bankers to up their game with AI including:</p>
 
 Account inquiries – employing chatbots to provide updates on account balances, transaction history, and other account-related information 
 Credit score monitoring – AI-enabled assistance for customers to check their credit ratings and advice on how to improve them 
 Fraud prevention – training AI models to detect fraudulent patterns and behaviors 
 Customer service – deploying chatbots to provide real-time customer care by answering common questions and addressing simple issues 
 Investment guidance – real-time, personalized investment advice leveraging AI to provide targeted assistance based on consumers’ specific preferences and risk tolerance 
 
<p>But it’s not all sunshine and unicorns as they say. AI is also being adopted by cybercriminals of all shapes and sizes at an alarming rate, straining traditional cybersecurity paradigms. AI’s automation prowess is a double threat – increasing the scale of attacks, while also lowering the required skill level and resources to be able to execute attacks. And banks are seeing the impact firsthand. U.S. banks reported a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2023/banks-and-payment-firms-tap-ai-to-combat-fraud-amid-surge-in-sophisticated-financial-crime/">43% increase in fraud attacks</a> year over year, with the average cost of fraud for large financial institutions jumping by 65%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/colum-lyons-expert-comment-the-rise-of-ai-deepfakes-and-how-to-take-back-control/">Deepfakes</a> and <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/three-questions-to-ask-about-synthetic-identities">synthetic identities</a> represent two of the most nefarious challenges to banks and credit unions who are seeking to prevent fraudulent account openings and takeovers while also complying with eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) regulations. An added challenge is to apply an extra layer of security AND improve the customer experience. For account opening this starts with AI-enabled document validation and biometric identity verification using the customer’s mobile phone. This ensures the document is a valid form and instance of the credential, and that the person presenting the identity credential is the owner of that credential. Once verified, the customer provides a digital signature to accept the terms and conditions and presto! – a digital payment credential is issued securely, all in a matter of minutes!</p>
<p>Once the account is opened, AI and ML also play a critical role in helping the financial institution model and detect fraud, plus enhanced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/iam-adaptive-authentication-ds.pdf">risk-based authentication</a> with behavioral biometrics helps identify fraudulent patterns and unauthorized users early.</p>

   What exactly is a ‘personal data&nbsp;store’?  At their very simplest and most basic, you could say that personal data stores are digital equivalents of the filing cabinets which individuals keep at home to store important documents. Only you as an individual have access to the information in your filing cabinet, and you choose what to do with it (for example, taking a document out of your filing

<p>You come into a gathering, and everyone is talking about verifiable credentials. What’s the first thing that comes to mind? You’ll most likely think of certifications, degrees, or anything that belongs to you that can be used to attest that you are who you say you&nbsp;are.</p><p>In the physical world, a credential can be a physical asset one can carry around in their wallet to prove their identity. Credentials can be verified by examining them or by making a call to the issuers of such credentials. For&nbsp;example</p>  A birth certificate issued by a hospital proves when and where you were born and who your parents&nbsp;are  A passport can be issued by the government of a country to prove that you’re a citizen of that&nbsp;country  A certificate issued by the university proves that you have an educational degree  <p>All of these are physical examples of credentials with a human subject, but how does this play out in the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>In the first article in this series, we looked at decentralized identity and why it matters. In this piece, we’ll be delving deeper into verifiable credentials and how they work. First, let’s take a look at some of the problems VCs are trying to&nbsp;solve.</p>  Identity fraud: Verifiable credentials provide a secure and tamper-proof way of sharing personal information, reducing the risk of identity&nbsp;fraud.  Information leakage: Sharing of user data is often done in bulk, leading to leakage of more information than necessary and loss of privacy. Through selective disclosure, verifiable credentials can be used to limit the amount of personal information that is shared while still enabling organizations to verify the information they&nbsp;need.  Data silos: Centralized systems often require individuals to share sensitive information with every organization that needs it, leading to the creation of large honeypots of user data with many organizations, increasing the risk of data breaches.  Walled gardens: Issuers of credentials can impose barriers to verification if they are involved in the verification process. Verifiable credentials are self-certifying and don’t require the involvement of the issuer when being verified.   How VCs&nbsp;work <p>There are three entities you’ll come across quite often while studying verifiable credentials:</p>  The issuer  The holder  The verifier  <p>The entity that issues the credential is known as the issuer; the holder is the subject of the credential; and the verifier is the organization that determines if the credential satisfies the requirements for a VC. Let’s take a look at each of these entities in&nbsp;detail:</p> The Issuer <p>An issuer in a verifiable credentials ecosystem is an entity that creates and issues digital credentials to holders. These issuers can be academic institutions, banks, the government, or corporate bodies.</p><p>For example, a university might be an issuer of a digital diploma to a student named John. The university would be responsible for creating the digital diploma, which would include information such as the student’s name, degree earned, and graduation date.</p><p>The university would then issue the digital diploma to the student, who would be the credential holder. The issuer must prove that they are authorized and competent to issue digital credentials by providing a form of identification and proof of identity, which can be done by providing a digital certificate or signature.</p> The Holder <p>A holder is an individual or entity that holds or possesses a digital credential, such as a diploma, a driver’s license, or a professional certification. The holder can present the credential to a verifier, such as an employer or a government agency, to prove their identity or qualifications.</p><p>John, from our previous example, is a recent graduate from a university. The university is the issuer of John’s diploma. John is the holder of his diploma, meaning he possesses it in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>The holder can also compile the data sent by one or more issuers and create a verifiable presentation.</p> The Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that checks the authenticity of a credential issued to a holder by an issuer. It also checks for other things, like validity and competency.</p><p>In this example, when John applies for a job, the employer, who is the verifier, will ask John to present his diploma to prove that he has completed his degree. The employer uses a set of verifiable credentials protocols to check the authenticity of the credentials. This includes verifying the issuer’s signature, checking that the credential has not been tampered with, and confirming that the information in the credential matches the information that the employer has on file for&nbsp;John.</p><p>Once the employer has verified the credential, they can trust that the information in the credential is accurate and that it was issued by a trusted issuer, which allows the employer to make informed decisions about John’s qualifications for the&nbsp;job.</p> Let’s graphically look at the workflow for verifiable credentials: <p>The issuer signs an identity and sends it to the holder. The holder creates a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier. The verifier checks to know if the data is competent, viable, and authentic. Another possible workflow is that the verifier requests data from the holder, who reaches out to the issuer to send the&nbsp;data.</p><p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, the issuer and holder are required to use decentralized identifiers or DIDs. A decentralized identifier (DID) is a technique to identify something or oneself online without depending on a centralized entity, such as a large corporation or the government. Imagine it as the digital equivalent of your passport or license that you may use to verify your identity&nbsp;online.</p> Deconstructing a Verifiable Credential <p>A subject is typically a person, but it could also be a thing, such as hardware device type, expiration, and issuer, which are properties of the credential proof used to verify the integrity of a credential. A proof is typically expressed as a digital signature, made with the private key of the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Main problems currently experienced in the VC&nbsp;world. <p>According to Cheqd’s deep-dive survey on technical trends in decentralized identity, the top 5 blockers to the adoption of decentralized identity by enterprises</p><p>The fundamental element of SSI is receiving a set of claims and verifiable credentials in your identity wallet and then presenting them to a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>The mechanism that delivers one verifiable credential to a holder’s wallet must be able to connect with a totally separate piece of software that is receiving a verifiable credential or presentation on the end of the verifier in order for SSI to become an interoperable ecosystem.</p><p>Different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials should be compatible, making it easy for credentials to be recognized and accepted across different platforms and organizations.</p><p>However, the various systems currently do not allow for credential interoperability.</p><p>Verifiable credentials are also not as user-friendly as they should be and are difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use, as they require a certain level of technical knowledge and may involve multiple different software and hardware components.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), the W3C Credentials Community Group, and the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) are working to promote the development of open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials. They aim to make SSI systems more user-friendly and to promote interoperability between different SSI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While these organizations are working to solve these problems, they still persist. The complexity of verifiable credentials and the infrastructure required to support them still make them difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use. Additionally, interoperability issues between different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials remain a problem, as do the privacy and security issues that verifiable credentials can&nbsp;pose.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veramo/how-verifiable-credentials-work-2648733abd59">How Verifiable Credentials Work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veramo">Veramo</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>In a recent interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/86c67471-52ae-40ff-b99b-b0c13b52c524">Financial Times</a>, EON chief executive Leon Birnbaum expressed frustration with Germany’s cyber protection of critical infrastructures.If a successful serious cyberattack were to occur, he believes his company, which operates Germany’s largest gas and electricity distribution network, would be “on its own”. Operating power grids in nine European countries including Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic, EON is “constantly” under attack by cybercriminals, some of which are suspected state-backed actors.</p>
<p>Unlike most cybercriminals, the aim of state-backed actors is increasingly not about making money but using data encryption malware attacks to create fear for political purposes. This is what Alexander Klimburg, Senior Fellow at the Hague Center for Strategic Studies calls “ransomwar”. In his opinion, WannaCry and NotPetya were the first major ransomwar attacks launched by governments.</p>
<p>At cyberevolution, Alexander will give a keynote about “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5660">Surviving between the Cyber Frontlines</a>” in which he will address information and cyber warfare and what organizations can do to protect themselves.

<p>In a recent survey conducted by Entrust across 10+ countries, banks, payment companies, and credit unions overwhelmingly reported that flat card technology has accelerated and shifted into overdrive. What may have been originally considered as an “unimpressive” change to the look of traditional embossing, flat cards have evolved into a financial issuance mainstay with astonishing designs and an elegant chic finish. Here we will explore the magnitude of this shift, input drivers, outputs, and future indicators.</p>
<p>Flat Card Adopters</p>
<p>Most interestingly, the survey highlights an astonishing 77% of surveyed financial institutions are actively issuing flat cards today. North America and Europe lead the way as they are typically the first global adopters of innovative technology with large banking headquarters on both continents.</p>
<p>Assuming similar technology adoption rates in this industry, we can expect a proportional upward trend and transition to flat card in the coming years. Even though embossed cards maintain some geographic and niche market presence – for example in Africa and the Middle East – the paradigm shift to flat technology has been further strengthened by significant gains in options for customization and efficiency.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Adoption Drivers</p>
<p>Equally compelling, when asked about the reason organizations choose to move to flat card, 73% of survey respondents identified two key components: enhanced branding opportunities and the modernization of traditional designs. Additionally, 60% cited either reduced cost and/or increased efficiency as the secondary driver, followed by maintaining a competitive advantage, staying relevant in the marketplace, and consumer demand.</p>
<p>When evaluating the factors influencing their decision to adopt flat card technology, respondents were almost evenly split between competitors driving the technology and marketing-driven requests in their go-to-market strategy, with competitors holding a slight edge in this regard. More specifically:</p>
 
 Among project management respondents, 36% attributed adoption to the need to stay competitive, while 26% attributed it to marketing directives. 
 Among those in payment roles, 43% indicated that adoption resulted from marketing department requests, with 30% attributing it to competitive pressure. 
 
<p>An alternative interpretation of the data reveals that internal requests, originating from marketing and operations, drove slightly over half of the adoptions, accounting for 51%, surpassing the influence of external factors such as competition (36%) and customer requests (9%). It is worth mentioning that adoption rates in this context are comparative within the nature of the survey itself and migration to innovative technologies typically includes elevated levels of consumer demand early in the product roadmap process.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Features</p>
<p>As financial institutions and fintechs migrate to flat card, the value proposition continues to become clearer. Customers demand fresh designs, a customizable platform, and the ability to connect with loyalty programs or niche movements like eco-friendly formats. Flat cards are delivering. Period.</p>
<p>When asked about the customizable features and benefits offered by flat cards, respondents cited the following as the most frequently utilized within their issuance arsenal:</p>
 
 Personalization on the card’s back, allowing the entire card front for financial institutions to highlight their brand 
 Vertical card orientation 
 Metallic personalization 
 Enhanced personal account number (PAN) features 
 
<p>Flat Card Technology Outputs</p>
<p>Simply, flat card drives business. Upon adoption of flat cards, 77% of respondents saw an increase in transaction volumes, including 61% of those who experienced a 1%-25% increase, and 15% realizing greater than 25% growth by volume. This is the most compelling evidence for any issuer considering the value proposition of switching to flat cards, making it nearly impossible not to draw significant conclusions about ROI and the decision to switch without delay.</p>
<p>The secondary responses in this same category paint a beautiful picture – flat cards save money. 64% saw machine efficiencies and additional cost savings, while another 40% cited third-party issuance efficiencies.</p>
<p>For anyone needing a reason to immediately evaluate the impact of flat cards on their business and, in turn, customer satisfaction, this is where the undeniable evidence is crystal clear. Banks that have adopted flat card are experiencing higher transaction volumes and lower costs. The icing on the cake? 92% highlight their enhanced capacity for personalized customization. Can it get any better than this?</p>
<p>Flat Card Future Predictors</p>
<p>Can we predict the future of flat card? Not quite. However, our survey respondents are certainly leading us down a favorable path. For those financial institutions who are not currently issuing flat cards, 56% plan to in the next two years, while 35% are exploring options to consider this newer technology.</p>
<p>A final thought on future predictors: 61% of those who have not adopted flat card have invested recently in new issuance systems. Although we do not know exactly what type of equipment or systems, this highlights the simple fact that options exist and machine lifecycles are long. We also know that certain geographies or regions continue to demonstrate some demand for traditional embossed cards – they play a significant role in perceived value and probably will continue to do so for the near future.</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support the flat card movement, bridging the gap between personalization equipment, secure customer interactions, and the latest technology and innovations in high-volume central and instant financial issuance for this technology. Our portfolio of solutions including Entrust Durable Graphics, Drop on Demand, Artista Desktop, Artista VHD, and Sigma DS4 Light Curing Module continue to offer product and platform flexibility built around flat card opportunities.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Did you know that in the United States, 38% of students enter a university with transfers from other universities? This highlights how crucial credit mobility is. However, there exists significant friction in credit mobility today, as I’m sure some readers have experienced in their own lives. Credit mobility is a challenge in itself within the United States, so we can imagine the challenges when considering students transferring from different countries.</p>
<p>What’s notable about the <a href="https://tech.asu.edu/initiatives/trusted-learner-network">Trusted Learner Network (TLN)</a> is that they’ve brought together key stakeholders from higher education institutions. These institutions recognize the business case for issuing user-controlled, portable, interoperable digital credentials, such as diplomas, to facilitate credit mobility and reduce associated costs and friction. They also understand the importance of making learner data more accessible and dynamic, as opposed to the current static nature of such data.</p>
<p>To give you a feel for the discussion, here are a couple of quote from the episode that I thought to be interested and very related one to another.</p>
<p>The first,</p>
<blockquote><p>So I feel like a diploma is extremely valuable, right? It represents the sort of culmination or termination of a set program of study towards a specific subject that is designed to empower the learner with like a both broad and deep understanding of what it is that they study it. It continues to be valuable and also the strongest trust signal that we have going for us in communicating that value. When we take a step back, though, we recognize that that diploma or degree is composed of a series of other credentials that might have individual that likely do have a very high individual value. So the average undergraduate student, when they graduate, they’re going to have taken about 40 courses or about 120 credits, and each of those 40 courses represents the achievement of a set of knowledge, skills, capabilities, and we can dig down perhaps even further to that to embrace things like skills and competencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>And second,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the diploma still have meaning? In the vision and the implementation that we’re working on, it actually is way more meaningful because it says so much more in a way that can actually be, you know, understood both&nbsp;by machines and people than, you know, what just a printed out diploma framed on my wall used to be able to communicate. </p></blockquote>
<p>By collaborating with a broader ecosystem, which includes learners and institutions beyond just higher education, such as employers, the Trusted Learner Network seeks to harness advancements in digital trust, enabling technologies, and ecosystem governance frameworks to transform the learner economy. The potential value unlocked by streamlining credit mobility and enhancing the significance of credentials like diplomas is immense. This leads us to consider other types of learner credentials that individuals might accumulate throughout their learning journey. Personally, I’ve gathered numerous ‘credentials’ post-University. How can we digitize these and present them to the rightful owner alongside more traditional credentials like diplomas?</p>
<p>Listen to this episode to learn more, and hopefully it will spark some great thoughts for you on the possible.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Kate, Andrew and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Impact of freely available online information on higher education – How has the trend of easily accessible online information, such as courses and certificates, influenced the strategies of universities and higher education institutions? 
 Value of diplomas and other credentials in the modern age – With the rise of various credentials and certificates, is the traditional university diploma still as valuable? What other credentials might a learner want to accumulate? 
 Modernizing systems of records and the role of issuers – How are systems of records being modernized to make credentials more mobile and trusted? Who are the potential issuers beyond traditional universities? 
 Value of personal references and incentives for issuers – Is there value in making it easier for individuals, like professors, to provide references or credentials? How do incentives differ for various types of issuers? 
 Importance of governance in the context of digital credentials – With the growing focus on governance over technology, how is the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital credentials being ensured? 
 User experience (UX) and wallet infrastructure for digital credentials – How is the user experience being optimized for digital credential wallets? Where will learner credentials be stored, and how will they be accessed? 
 Role of verifiers in the TLN digital credential ecosystem – How are verifiers being integrated into the network, and how does their role tie into the prioritization of use cases? How will the adoption of digital credentials be spurred among verifiers?

 We sit down with our Vice President of Global Gaming to discuss the upcoming changes to the UK’s gambling sector, the need for continued industry collaboration, and how to safeguard against the undeniable growth of the unlicensed market. 



 



<p>On the surface, there appears to be little in common between the tiny Caribbean island of Curaçao, and the densely populated island of the United Kingdom, but both will be important case studies in the evolution of the online gambling market, according to Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the established <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK gambling market is undergoing a series of changes to its regulatory framework</a> to reflect the digital age, Curacao, a market known for its low barrier to entry and <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/curacao-to-overhaul-regime-with-new-regulator-higher-bar-to-entry/">little to no scrutiny from operators</a>, is also reforming its licensing regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Important endeavors that Roger believes need to be undertaken carefully or run the risk of an exodus of licensed operators and increase in the use of the illegal market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This conundrum is shared across many international jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Ontario, and very soon, France,” explains Roger. “An open and fair environment is no guarantee of success. If we look at Norway, for example, many of the world’s most experienced and trusted operators have pulled out, leaving players with the binary choice of using a monopolized industry, or unlicensed operators.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although a delicate task to complete, offering a regulated gambling environment is key to the sustainable growth of a jurisdiction’s gambling market, and the pivotal third pillar in propping up a safe, secure and protected player environment. A burden of responsibility that any regulator must share with the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my opinion, it is first and foremost the operator’s responsibility to provide a safe and responsible gambling experience, because this is good for the operator’s business model. However, this must be facilitated by a reliable regulatory environment that is proactive in its fight against fraud and the illegal market. So, the regulator needs to be an ally to those licensed operators. This is how the player will become better protected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Roger shares his insights on the likely impact of the now <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/arguments-against-affordability-checks-gambling/">mandatory financial risk checks in the UK</a>, the real reason UK operators are subjected to such high and regular fines, why most operators are looking at <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> completely wrong, and much more.</p>



 The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) has started its first round of consultations. Do you agree with UKGC’s four areas of priority? Do you think there are other more pressing areas that it should have started with?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It was 2018 when the UKGC started to discuss issues around affordability, but back then it was under the umbrella topic of customer interactions, and markers of harm were not the center of focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Financial risk and financial vulnerability is the right topic to prioritize and the most important consultation to undertake, because affordability is the comfort zone for the player and the operator’s business. A gambling platform should be running its business with a business plan that is in line with its risk appetite, and ability to invest and be exposed to financial impact. In online casinos, there can be big losses and big payouts, so it’s important to balance the comfort zone of the operator with the comfort zone of the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, affordability is the customer playing and spending money in a way that is going to be sustainable in the long term for the business and the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the control of marketing and advertising consultation, however, I don’t think it’s detailed enough in terms of what they are trying to achieve. For example, what ‘good’ actually looks like has not been defined. It’s still quite vague, particularly in terms of the coordination and cooperation between the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) </a>from the UKGC, Competition and Markets Authority regulations, Advertising Standards Authority, and The UK Code of Broadcast Advertising requirements. As there are many contradictions between the various rules, I think the first consultation should be around organizing and encouraging those different regulatory bodies to have one set of objectives, ambitions, and rules.&nbsp;</p>



 What effect do you foresee the now mandatory financial risk checks to have on the UK gambling market?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>If the mandatory financial risk checks really end up being as ‘frictionless’ as the UKGC promises, then this is an opportunity to improve the relationship between the player and the operator, because the financial risk check will allow the operator to better know his customer and better tailor their offering; the pace and velocity of the game, and amounts that are going to be offered, either through marketing or the games themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m unaware of any operator that asks players what kind of games they prefer, or whether they’re playing for the thrill or something else. Usually, they will assess this based on the choice of games made by the players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, used correctly, affordability markers of harm and behavioral analysis will enable the operator to increase and improve the granularity of the relationship, or even initiate that relationship between the operator and the players. The other effect is that if it is not as frictionless as is promised, for example, credit checks are not granted to licensed operators, then the immediate effect is going to be a tremendous increase in the illegal market – what is called the black markets – and operators not licensed in the UK and not abiding by the UKGC and LCCP rules are simply going to offer their services illegally to players in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

 Responsible gambling has been a recurring theme for many years and features quite heavily in the UK gambling white paper. What does responsible gambling mean to you, and where should the burden of responsibility lie with regards to providing a safe and responsible gambling experience: with the regulator, the operator, or both?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the history of responsible gambling, the burden to play responsibly has always been on the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original approach was that if the player engages in problem gambling, it is because he decided to not use the tools as provided by the operator. The operator only had the responsibility to inform the players of the tools that were available to limit his activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then the industry started to evolve toward safer gambling, meaning the operator accepted its responsibility to create a proactively safe environment, where they conduct behavioral analysis to identify the variations and deviations of player behavior in activity, and proactively interact with players. This led the UKGC to devise its three-pillar strategy of Identify, Act, and Evaluate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there has been a shift from blaming players for problem gambling to accepting that not all players are necessarily aware of the amount of activity that they are engaging in, or the variations of activity they’ve displayed, and that the operator plays a very important part toward empowering player control through transparency, information sharing, interaction and action, alongside the actions of the player, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this shift really reflects this balancing of the two comfort zones: Who is my player? What is he capable of in terms of the games we are offering? It might be a very rich person that has an extremely high-risk appetite and high affordability, but does that mean he is impervious to harm? Not necessarily. You’ll have some players that have a very low level of affordability, but occasionally they’ll want that thrill. Should we prevent them from having that thrill just because they are not rich? Those are the questions around responsible gambling, affordability and the adequation between the comfort zones. And this is where KYC becomes the compass and blueprint for an operator’s business model: to understand their players, asses the appetite of their players, where you can create fair and transparent promotions that reflect the comfort zone between the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 With most gambling and gaming now taking place online, how important will technology, and in particular KYC and onboarding platforms, be in ensuring a safe and secure gaming experience?&nbsp; 



<p>Operators and regulators need to move away from viewing KYC as a process, or “tick box” exercise, and instead focus on the original purpose of KYC as a founding principle of running a sustainable business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that many operators are either not currently capable or are not effectively using the data they have access to build a single image of who the player is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you ask any operator if they had a single view and a single understanding of who their customer is, very few have a reliable, accurate, single view across their whole estate. So having this information on an industry level is pointless until operators themselves can aggregate this information, which will enable them to switch from the mindset that KYC is a process, to KYC is a business driver.</p>

 In information released since the publication of both the government and UKGC’s plans, Gambling Commission CEO, Andrew Rhodes, has said that the UKGC’s plans set out changes to ensure the UK is the safest and fairest place to gamble in the world. How feasible do you think this will be in a country that received a record-breaking £44.6 million fine in 2022; a 76% increase on 2021? Why do you think UK operators consistently receive such hefty fines?&nbsp; 



<p>There may be a link between the first and second question. If the UK is handing out so many fines, it could indicate that the UK is not a place where licensed operators are operating in a safe and fair way and are therefore heavily penalized for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing many operators in the UK, however, I do not think this is the reason they receive such hefty fines, so there’s a question around what the fines say about the UK’s regulated landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do know, and what we have seen recently, is many operators withdrawing from licensed activity in the UK, which will ultimately leave just the bigger operators offering services. Will it be fair in terms of pricing and the services that players will receive? I’m far from convinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second impact of the large and consistent fines is going to be operators applying for UK licenses with no intention of operating in the UK. Their market and customer base, whether in Asia, in Latin America, or Africa will be attracted by the prestige of the UK license. So, I think the UK gambling market will end up as an oligopoly, or filled with brands that have no intention of operating in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The illegal market will take great pleasure in catering to customers seeking a frictionless gaming experience, and I think this is extremely worrying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC should have regular discussions with the gambling industry to ensure the UK remains an attractive place for operators and investors. If most small and midsize investors in gambling companies are fleeing the UK, this is extremely worrying.</p>



 From established gambling markets like the UK to the tiny Caribbean Island of Curaçao, regulatory authorities are balancing offering competitive and flexible approaches to licensing and taxation with a safe and secure environment that discourages fraud and illegal gambling. What effect do you think Curacao’s stricter requirements have on the online gambling industry, and what lessons can be learned?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the specific case of Curaçao and the redesign of their regulations and implementation of stricter requirements, this will lead to increased blame of players in problem gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of its news licensing structure, Curaçao will request operators to offer better complaints management, meaning they will be responsible for effectively handling complaints by offering more ways for the player to express their discontent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, under the guise of stricter requirements and stricter responsibility, Curaçao regulations are not actually going to empower the player much more by requiring stronger action from operators, but this is a way to grant more direct responsibility for the operators, which today they do not have, so this is certainly progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the player will remain hostage to the goodwill of the operators. I think these stricter requirements have been put in place to adapt to a world where local regulators from each country are more aware of the capabilities of operators in providing a safe playing environment, and how to fulfil their role as offering better interactions with customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something we see in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ontario because they know that players need to be protected, and they know that players are best protected when the whole environment Is cooperating, when the regulator provides a reliable framework, and when the operator is interacting in a way that balances the comfort zone of the player with the comfort zone of the business. In this way, the player is protected via regulations, in terms of requirements of fairness, of marketing, transparency, help that they can receive and obligations from the operators.</p>

  <p>Cloud computing delivers the benefits of accelerated development without the hardware costs. But the dynamic nature of cloud services and the proprietary security features offered by different cloud service providers make it challenging for customers to manage the risks and to be sure they are meeting security and compliance obligations. Most organizations need some&nbsp;form of guardrails and ways to respond to suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>Join cloud security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Uptycs as they discuss the challenges of the shared responsibility model for cloud security and compliance, examine the range of ways available for dealing with the problem, and consider the benefits of cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud-native application protection platform.</p>
<p>Mike Small, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole will describe the major risks in the way organizations use cloud services. He will also explain why cloud services need dynamic rather than static controls, list the tools that aim to manage these risks, and outline what to expect from a CSPM solution.</p>
<p>Andre Rall, Director of Cloud Security at Uptycs will describe the benefits of integrating security insights, of standardizing controls and policies, of taking charge of third-party code and resources, and of removing silos by using a single platform, data model, and user interface.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cloud-security-cspm"></a>

<p>Financial institutions want secure and frictionless onboarding and authentication processes and they’re finally seeing it from <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">decentralized identity</a> (DI) and verifiable credentials (VCs) technology.</p>



<p>While VCs have been a promise of identification and authentication technologies for decades, decentralization being the fabric through which VCs are established and communicated now makes the whole proposition more viable for FIs.</p>



<p>The decentralized nature of DI eliminates the need for a centralized authority to manage and control the identity certification process underlying current onboarding and authentication systems that are complex and costly for FIs, frustrating for consumers, and open to abuse.</p>



<p>In the DI ecosystem, issuing organizations conveniently and securely issue fraud-proof credentials, and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity and validity of those credentials to grant access to services. The customer accepts, stores, and selectively shares their credentials with unprecedented privacy, security and trust.</p>



<p>Early adopters in the financial services industry are using VCs as customer-controlled, open, standardized, portable, and cryptographically protected digital credentials to enable:</p>



 
 Continuous strong authentication of banking customers, whether they are accessing via web, telephone, or mobile 



 More streamlined banking functions, such as real-time loan approval because the applicant carries credentials such as KYC, credit history, employment history in their identity wallet. 
 



<p>The result is drastically reduced KYC and AML costs, vastly enhanced retail and corporate customer experience, and streamlined regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Read <a>Verifiable </a><a>Credentials</a><a> – the Killer Feature of Decentralized Identity</a></p>



<p></p>



 7 more use cases for VCs in banking 



<p>In addition to an FI issuing its own customers with a VC to prove they’re a customer and speed up onboarding and authentication (which some FIs are already achieving in <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">seconds</a> with the technology), DI pioneer <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">Evernym</a> (now Avast) lists 7 other potential use cases:</p>



 
 Enable the customer to use their credential across internal silos of the institution to reduce data lakes and allow them to provide the single view of their information. 



 Maintain a persistent, secure, and unique connection with each customer for all types of sensitive data communications (e.g. sending loan documents). 



 Leverage the credential exchange protocol to prove minimal customer data collection and maintain a verified data trail for regulatory compliance. 



 Leverage the interoperability of VCs to make the FI’s credential useful for consumers anywhere in the world (the “top of wallet” competitive advantage). 



 Leverage the open standards of DI to issue customers with an identity wallet for storing and managing their VCs, or build a wallet into an existing banking app. 



 Support customers’ need to back up and recover their VCs in a “digital safety deposit box” concept. 



 Act as “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Glossary-V2.pdf">guardian</a>” of a customer’s credentials in a similar manner to guarding paper documents or effects in real life.

<p>Identity Governance is a beacon for organizations aiming to maintain regulatory compliance, safeguard operations and boost efficiency. Let’s demystify this term: Identity Governance, tailored for organizations, refers to the systematic management of digital identities, ensuring that users have the correct access rights to resources. The impact on business security and operations is profound, offering protection against potential breaches and enhancing operational workflows.</p>
 Why Do Organizations Need Identity Governance Today? 
<p>With expanding business ventures, collaborations, and a diversified workforce, organizations are navigating an increasingly complex digital ecosystem. This complexity demands a structured approach to managing sensitive data and systems that control user access.</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies worldwide emphasize the importance of data protection, with compliance standards like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)</a> making it mandatory for businesses to protect user data. Being compliant not only safeguards user credentials and shields companies from potential penalties but also elevates their reputation.</p>
<p>Cost efficiency and operational excellence are tightly knit with effective identity governance. Organizations that master this see reduced IT costs, witness streamlined operations and operating costs, and save time and resources.</p>
 Why is Regulatory Compliance Important? 
<p>Regulatory compliance ensures companies adhere to relevant laws, policies, and regulations often designed to protect consumer rights and sensitive data. It’s not just about avoiding penalties or legal consequences; it’s also about establishing trust with your customers.</p>
<p>When an organization is compliant, it demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a high standard of operations and building confidence among stakeholders and customers. Moreover, compliance often brings about best practices that can benefit the company in the long run, from enhancing data security to ensuring organizational integrity.</p>
 Key Components of Identity Governance Suited for Organizations 
<p>While “Identity Governance” might seem vast and intricate, its effectiveness refers to core components tailored for organizations. These components serve as the pillars that uphold a robust identity governance structure.</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management: Tailored to businesses’ hierarchical and functional structures, it ensures that user accounts, access, and privileges are aligned with their roles and updated as these roles change. 
 Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Rooted deeply in the essence of an organization, RBAC ensures that access to digital resources aligns with job roles. It simplifies the process of privileged access by categorizing authorized users based on their responsibilities. 
 Access Review: Regular business audits by security teams should focus on digital identities and access controls. Periodic access reviews ensure that only the necessary personnel have access to particular resources, minimizing potential security risks. 
 Policy and Risk Management: Organizations are no strangers to risks. However, with a structured approach and risk management, potential threats are identified, evaluated, and mitigated before they escalate. 
 
<p>Understanding the integral components of Identity Governance makes it equally vital to discern its advantages. When implemented correctly, these components fuse to deliver profound benefits for any organization.</p>
 How Is IGA Different from IAM? 
<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) are terms often used interchangeably, but crucial differences exist. While IAM focuses on ensuring that the right individuals have access to the appropriate resources at the correct times and for the right reasons, IGA goes further.</p>
<p>IGA deals with the provisioning, managing access, and de-provisioning of identities. It provides a structured framework for policies and processes related to user identity lifecycle management and management, ensuring compliance with business objectives and regulations. In essence, IAM is a subset of IGA, with IGA providing the overarching governance framework.</p>
 Direct Benefits to Organizations Implementing Identity Governance 
<p>As the famous saying in the business world: “What gets measured gets managed.” And when you measure the tangible benefits reaped from implementing identity governance, the picture becomes abundantly clear. Organizations not only safeguard themselves but also position themselves strategically for growth. Implementing Identity Governance isn’t just about ticking off a checklist; it’s about accruing tangible benefits:</p>
 
 Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to standards like GDPR becomes a smoother journey with structured identity governance, which is especially crucial for organizations operating in regions like the EU. 
 Enhanced Data Security: The numbers don’t lie. Organizations that invest in identity governance are less likely to face data breaches, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential. 
 Streamlined Onboarding and Offboarding: Gone are the days when IT teams spent hours setting up profiles for new hires or removing access for those who’ve left. Identity governance can cut down these times significantly. 
 Facilitated Audits: Compliance checks and internal audits become less hassle, thanks to clear documentation and structured access protocols. 
 
<p>While the merits of Identity Governance are undeniable, the path to its flawless execution can be paved with challenges. However, with a systematic approach, organizations can traverse this path seamlessly. Let’s delve into a systematic step-by-step guide for instituting a successful identity governance model.</p>
 Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for Organizations 
<p>Embarking on implementing Identity Governance in an organization’s security posture is akin to building a fortress brick by brick. Each step is crucial, and each phase must be tackled with precision. While the goal is a secure and efficient operational environment, the route necessitates meticulous planning.</p>
 
 Assessing Organizational Needs and Existing Infrastructure: Begin with an internal review. Identify gaps in the current system and ascertain the necessary tools and resources. 
 Setting Up a Cross-Departmental Implementation Team: Identity governance isn’t just an IT issue. Engage representatives from HR, operations, and other relevant departments. 
 Defining Access Roles in Alignment with Job Descriptions: Collaborate with HR to ensure that digital access mirrors job roles, ensuring every employee has the necessary tools and nothing more. 
 Integrating Identity Governance with Existing IT Infrastructure: Seamless integration is key. Ensure that the identity governance solutions align well with current systems, offering smooth transitions and operations. 
 Monitoring and Iterative Improvement: The job still needs to be completed post-implementation. Regularly review and refine the processes to adapt to organizational growth and change. 
 
<p>Every endeavor, no matter how meticulously planned, is full of hurdles. Identity Governance, with all its nuances, comes with its potential challenges. Recognizing these early and being equipped with solutions can make the journey smoother and more rewarding.</p>
 Best Practices Tailored for Organizations 
 
 Engaging Leadership and Stakeholders Early: A top-down approach to implementing identity governance and administration ensures that the importance of identity administration and governance is recognized at all levels. 
 Regular Training and Awareness Sessions for Employees: A system is only as strong as its weakest link. Equip employees with the knowledge to use and appreciate the identity governance structures. 
 Periodic Review of Access Roles and Permissions: Revisit and revise. As organizations evolve, so do roles and requirements. 
 Establishing a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement: Encourage feedback. It highlights potential gaps and fosters a culture of collective responsibility. 
 
 Common Misconceptions about Identity Governance 
<p>As we delve deeper into the digital realm, Identity Governance has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring security and efficiency within organizations. Yet, like many emerging disciplines, it’s shrouded in a mix of misunderstandings and half-truths. It’s essential to address these misconceptions to harness their potential truly.</p>
 
 Access Requests are Fundamental to Identity Verification: Contrary to the belief that access requests are mere formalities, they are pivotal in ensuring that only verified identities gain access to specific resources, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential breaches. 
 Identity Authentication Surpasses Password Management: While password management is vital, the emphasis should be on advanced identity authentication mechanisms that ensure secure and appropriate access, such as multi-factor authentication and biometric verification, which provide a more robust security posture. 
 All Access Control is Equal: It’s essential to understand that various access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control, access certifications, and access lifecycle management, serve distinct purposes and are crucial in managing different aspects of identity authentication and authorization. 
 Entitlement Management is Just ‘Jargon’: Far from being mere jargon, entitlement management is crucial in defining and controlling the rights and privileges of authenticated identities, ensuring that users have the appropriate access levels in accordance with their roles and responsibilities. 
 IGA Solutions are a ‘One Size Fits All’: It is a misconception that all identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions are universally applicable. Selecting and customizing IGA solutions that align with an organization’s specific needs and identity authentication requirements is imperative for effective identity management. 
 Managing User Accounts is an IT-only Responsibility: Managing user accounts and identities should not be siloed within IT departments. Effective identity governance and authentication management require collaborative efforts across various departments, ensuring that identity verifications, access controls, and user privileges are consistently aligned with organizational roles and policies. 
 
<p>Having highlighted the overarching significance of Identity Governance, it’s time to address some widespread myths. Believing these misconceptions could set organizations off course. By clearing the fog around them, we can ensure a more informed and practical approach to managing digital identities.</p>
 Potential Challenges for Organizations and Solutions 
<p>Every transformative initiative confronts its fair share of roadblocks, and Identity Governance is no exception. However, being forewarned is forearmed. By anticipating potential setbacks, organizations can develop strategies to overcome them, ensuring a smoother path to successful implementation.</p>
 
 Navigating the Complexity of Role Definitions: While initially challenging, collaborating with department heads on-premises can simplify role management and definitions. 
 Ensuring User Compliance Without Sacrificing Efficiency: Invest in user-friendly access management solutions to verify user and access privileges and provide ample training to ensure employees are comfortable with the new systems. 
 Adapting to Evolving Regulations: Stay informed. Review global compliance requirements and standards regularly and adjust policies and manual processes accordingly. 
 Addressing Resistance and Ensuring Organizational Buy-In: Highlight the benefits and provide channels for addressing concerns.<br>
Successfully implementing and navigating the challenges of Identity Governance is still ongoing. The digital sphere is continuously evolving, and to stay ahead of the curve, organizations need to remain informed and adapt accordingly. Let’s explore how to stay updated in this ever-changing world of Identity Governance. 
 
 Is Identity Governance Necessary Regardless of Regulatory Compliance Obligations? 
<p>While every company is subject to some form of regulatory compliance, the level of scrutiny and the specific standards applicable can vary significantly depending on the industry, region, and other factors. Regardless of the perceived level of regulatory obligation, the inherent risks within the digital landscape and the advantages of streamlined operations underscore the importance of identity governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a robust identity governance framework serves to proactively mitigate internal and external threats, simplify IT operations, enhance audit readiness, and ensure that employees have precise access to the resources necessary for their roles, thereby reducing the potential for human error. As companies evolve and expand, having a structured identity governance framework in place facilitates smoother transitions and integrations, maintaining a strong security posture in an ever-changing regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Stay Updated: The Evolving World of Identity Governance 
<p>The pace of technological advancement today is unparalleled. A static approach to Identity Governance can leave organizations vulnerable in such a dynamic environment. Staying updated is not just about keeping threats at bay but also about harnessing new opportunities and innovations.</p>
 
 Staying Abreast of Regulatory Changes: Subscribe to updates from regulatory bodies and consider periodic consultations with legal teams. 
 Leveraging Industry Forums and Communities: Discuss, attend seminars, and participate in webinars. 
 Continuous Training and Skill Upgradation for Teams: Consider annual or biannual training sessions to ensure the identity security team remains at the forefront of identity governance best practices. 
 
<p>With the strategies to remain updated and proactive, organizations can truly reap the lasting benefits of Identity Governance. As we conclude our exploration, it’s evident that Identity Governance is not just a fleeting trend but a foundational pillar for an organization.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Earlier this month, HYPR announced our unified Identity Assurance solution, developed to secure the entire modern identity lifecycle. HYPR Identity Assurance brings together the strongest passwordless authentication, comprehensive risk assessment and enhanced identity verification to continuously detect, prevent, and eliminate identity-related risks. That’s a lot of words to describe a simple concept — organizations can now ensure that an individual is who they claim to be at all times.</p> 
 Identity Assurance In the Spotlight  
<p>What does this mean in practice? We had the opportunity to demonstrate at this week’s FIDO Authenticate conference. As one of the pioneers of FIDO authentication and a long time Alliance board member, the annual Authenticate conference was a natural venue to publicly show the power of Identity Assurance.</p> 
 Modern Passkey-Based Authentication  
<p>Given the setting, most folks there were well-acquainted with our leading FIDO <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless multi-factor authentication</a> solution HYPR Authenticate, the backbone of our Identity Assurance platform. Industry experts, security pundits and regulatory agencies all agree that phishing-resistant authentication is no longer optional and must underlie any comprehensive identity security strategy. HYPR Authenticate provides regulatory compliant, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">device-bound passkeys</a> and also works with synced passkeys.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance Platform</p> 
 Real-time Risk Assessment and Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Newer on the block, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> analyzes risk signals and telemetry from numerous sources, including user behavior, mobile, endpoint and browser signals, as well as changes in the overall threat landscape, and automatically takes action to prevent a breach. This includes enforcing step-up authentication or re-verification, as well as sharing risk data with SIEM, SOAR and other enterprise systems for additional protective actions.</p> 
 The Big Reveal: Enhanced Identity Verification  
<p>The undoubted star of the show, however, was our revolutionary new identity verification system, HYPR Affirm. Purpose-built to meet the unique needs of workforce employee identity verification, HYPR Affirm addresses the major identity security issues, such as help desk fraud, that have dominated <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">recent cybersecurity headlines</a>. HYPR Affirm leverages AI-powered chat, video, face recognition, liveness detection and other cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and secure method of confirming employee identities without ever using a password. It goes beyond traditional point-in-time verification by utilizing AI-driven analysis to proactively and automatically prompt reverification at critical moments defined by high-impact events or times of elevated risk from new threat vectors or detection of suspicious behavior.</p> 
 More Than the Sum of Its Parts  
<p>While each HYPR solution provides critical capabilities to build a robust identity security strategy, the real magic lies in how they work together. The integrated Identity Assurance platform closes persistent identity security gaps and automates previously manual processes. It does away with disconnected, point-in-time approaches and provides dynamic and continuous identity and authentication security. It’s the industry’s only offering where risky behavior can trigger step-up authentication not only to authentication but also to enforcing automatic identity reverification.</p> 
 Why Identity Assurance, Why Now?  
<p>In this era of everywhere, always-on connectivity and generative-AI attacks, identity trust is an imperative. Yet organizations often rely on a patchwork of siloed identity systems, outdated authentication methods, manual and disjointed identity verification techniques and incomplete, reactive identity risk response.</p> 
<p>The fallout from these fragmented and insecure practices is all too evident. Deepfake imposters are driving a new style of fraud and identity-based cyber attacks are paralyzing businesses for weeks if not longer. Recent <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">HYPR research</a> shows that authentication-attributed breaches alone cost organizations an average of $2.95M per year. The issue goes beyond breaches however, affecting employee and customer satisfaction, productivity and a business’s ability to scale and evolve.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance takes a proactive approach that addresses all stages of the user journey or identity lifecycle, starting at day zero. It unites disparate identity and security systems, integrating with and scaling across them. With HYPR, organizations ensure identities can be trusted at all times, while eliminating friction points and improving user experience.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance delivers the lowest friction user experience with strongest authentication, automated identity verification and behavior-based risk assessment</p> 
 A New Look to Match Our Expanded Purpose  
<p>Those of you that pay attention to such things may have noticed that HYPR unveiled a new logo along with our Identity Assurance solution. HYPR has moved from “The Passwordless Company” to “The Identity Assurance Company” and we wanted our brand to reflect this strategic shift. We feel our new bold yet approachable logo embodies strength, trust and confidence with a modern sensibility. As such, it aptly represents our comprehensive, unified and dynamic approach to identity security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here’s a few thoughts I recorded earlier on our expanded Identity Assurance mission:</p>

 Stakers can claim DF59 rewards. DF60 runs Oct 19 — Oct 26,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 59 (DF59) has completed. 150K OCEAN was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Sep Oct 12, 2023 and ended 12:01am Oct 19. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF60 is live today, Oct 19. It concludes on Oct 27. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF60   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF60 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>It appears that Australia has killed off “digital identity”. Australia’s <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">proposed Digital ID legislation</a> is actually not about digital identity — it’s about proving you have been identified.</p>
<p>What’s the big deal? <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-goal-is-identification-not-an-identity/">Identity and identification are different things</a>. Identification is about establishing enough facts about someone in a specific context that you can deal with them; identity is bigger, more amorphous, and <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/on-sovereignty/">usually more personal</a>.</p>
<p>So I am delighted that the term “digital identity” is no longer used in the draft <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-09/Exposure%20draft%20of%20the%20Digital%20ID%20Bill%202023_0.pdf">Digital ID Bill 2023</a> (PDF) or explanatory materials. This is a significant shift in framing, and it will <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/lets-forget-about-identity/">simplify what has been a very tricky problem space</a>.</p>
<p>We can reform identification without disrupting identity. We can make identification <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-if-we-could-make-data-useless-to-thieves/">resilient against fraud</a> in the wake of data breaches, without introducing any novel new “digital identity”. The concept of digital ID is closer to mundane functional identifiers and does not affect the cherished sense of personal identity we have in the analog world.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill heralds a uniform approach in Australia to digital and data governance across open banking, open data, and digital ID.</p>
<p>We are seeing a transition from plaintext identification to device-assisted identification. Instead of presenting weak plaintext copies of ID numbers or whole ID documents, the proposed Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will enable individuals to use digital ID as a proxy for their existing verified analog IDs.</p>
<p>The previous government’s legislation was going to be called “Trusted Digital Identity”. The new draft bill drops that flowery wording. But we wonder where this leaves the existing <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif">Trusted Digital Identity Framework</a> (TDIF)?</p>
<p>TDIF was based on a centralised identity exchange architecture. This is fine for the government single sign-on systems, myGov and myGovID, but this architecture is <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/collected-submissions-on-au-digital-identity-system/">a poor fit for decentralised verifiable credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Now the AGDIS anticipates a raft of Digital ID Data Standards to be developed, providing an opportunity to rethink the centralised exchange. The new Digital ID Regulator can also reconsider the state of the art in authentication and authorisation technologies.</p>
<p>We look forward to the Australian digital ID system making good use of verifiable credentials, phishing resistant mobile technology, and data signing.</p>
<p>Lockstep’s <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/dvp/">Data Verification Platform</a> is a scheme to rationalise and organise data flows between data originators such as government and the risk owners who rely on accurate data to guide decisions. Join us in conversation.</p>

  <p>Hello friends,  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have received feedback from you—our customers—about the need to have user level language localization. We understand that users would like to receive notifications that have their text adapted to their local language, customs, and standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have added logic to check multiple places for language information to make the best possible choice for what language we should send an email in, and these changes are now generally available for Privileged Identity Management, Access Reviews and Entitlement Management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new approach is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Diagram showing how the logic works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
 The system checks the Entra user settings:&nbsp;
 
 An Entra ID user updates their language settings via myprofile.microsoft.com or via myaccount.microsoft.com. If they don't have the permissions to update, an admin updates their preferred language.&nbsp; 
 The system will then check if the Entra ID user object has a preferred language set to determine the locale to be used.&nbsp; 
 
 
 If there are no user settings, we will check whether the user has a mailbox and has a set preferred language on that mailbox. If both checks are true, the system uses the preferred language set in their mailbox settings. This will only work for users with a mailbox.&nbsp; 
 If none of the above are set, the system will fall back to the tenant's preferred language concatenated with the tenant's country letter code (fr-FR or en-US).&nbsp;
 
 If a tenant has a preferred language set and no country code, the system will use the tenant's preferred language to find the closest available locale to the one passed, from the localized templates. if fr-CA is missing, the fallback locale is fr-FR. &nbsp; 
 
 
 If they don’t have all the above, the system will default to en-us.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Figure 3: Screenshot of email in Spanish



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, when a new guest requests an access package in MyAccess, their preferred language will be stamped based on the MyAccess browser language at request time. This will enable new guests to receive email communication in a language they understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is currently only available for the features mentioned above, we will be announcing more features are enrolling to have this logic in the upcoming quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 De Hypotheker  
 "Door brondata in te zetten realiseerden de adviseurs een tijdsbesparing van 30% tijdens de oriëntatiefase."&nbsp;  
 Bij hypotheekadvies worden vaak veel privé documenten gebruikt van een klant. Voor De Hypotheker is het van essentieel belang dat de data van klanten goed beveiligd is, én dat de klantdata actueel is. Het originele proces bevat vaak veel papierwerk.

 De Hypotheker  
<p>"Door brondata in te zetten realiseerden de adviseurs een tijdsbesparing van 30% tijdens de oriëntatiefase."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bij hypotheekadvies worden vaak veel privé documenten gebruikt van een klant. Voor De Hypotheker is het van essentieel belang dat de data van klanten goed beveiligd is, én dat de klantdata actueel is. Het originele proces bevat vaak veel papierwerk. </p> 
<p>Om marktleider te blijven en hun klanten goed te kunnen bedienen wilde ze hun proces optimaliseren: de service verbeteren, versnellen en digitaliseren. Vanuit Ockto mochten we De Hypotheker assisteren in deze digitale transformatie. Pieter Dijckmeester (Manager Proposities) en Erik Coehorst &amp; Niki de Boer (beiden Propositiemanager Digital Customer Journey) vertellen over de uitdagingen die ze hadden, waarom ze voor Ockto kozen én wat de samenwerking ze tot nu toe heeft opgeleverd. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I can imagine that some of the readers might look at the title and wonder: what do these three terms even have in common? Well, I must confess that the last one I’ve made up (or should I say “invented”?) recently – and I will explain it later. But the former two are, in fact, connected in more than one way.</p>
<p>Although Generative AI has been with us for quite some time in various forms (remember deepfakes, for example?), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), the new-generation large language models, have literally taken the world by storm. After people saw what ChatGPT can do, they immediately decided they wanted these capabilities in every application, for every industry, and on every occasion. Unfortunately, after a period of initial uncontrolled hype, it became clear that most organizations simply cannot afford to let their employees post sensitive information, like intellectual property, financial records, or customer data into every online chatbot – you don’t need to be a compliance expert to understand the consequences.</p>
<p>So, while governments are working on future legislation to regulate AI usage in general, organizations are scrambling to define security and compliance policies to prevent uncontrolled leakage of their business data into generative AI systems. But how to reconcile the two completely opposite trends and make GenAI usage safe and controlled? Well, there are multiple potential approaches…</p>
<p>The most obvious one is “building your own ChatGPT” – creating, training, and operating a new isolated instance of a large language model (LLM) with all its training and operational data strongly protected. However, only large enterprises with enough skills and budgets can afford such an endeavor. Also, training a general-purpose AI model requires years of hard work and enormous amounts of data from a multitude of sources. Some of those sources, having experienced ChatGPT’s effect on their future job security, are no longer interested in collaborating with AI researchers…</p>
<p>An alternative, more savvy approach is fine-tuning an existing AI model – instead of starting from scratch, you only need to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific domain with your own, much smaller set of data. This is a much more resource-efficient way to get your own LLM, but it still requires a lot of work and skills and is much less flexible in terms of supported use cases. Of course, an even more efficient approach is to use a much leaner specialized model instead of a general-purpose one: for example, a model only trained to perform a specific subset of generative tasks.</p>
<p>What does it all have to do with databases though, and why is everyone suddenly talking about vectors? Well, it turns out that there is an innovative technique for adapting existing LLMs to your specific tasks or even your private, highly sensitive information called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of teaching (sorry, fine-tuning) a model with your custom data and essentially forcing it to memorize it entirely, you just augment each request with a set of additional information that can help its reasoning. It could be a set of documents containing fresh information about recent events or simply some organization’s sensitive data.</p>
<p>RAG not only provides responses much better tailored to the user’s prompts and thus dramatically improves the efficiency of the conversation, but also ensures that the augmenting content remains private and is not shared with other parties. And here comes the twist: to implement RAG you need to be able to quickly produce a set of documents relevant for a certain prompt and to accomplish that, you need a vector database!</p>
<p>Vectors themselves are simply sequences of numbers. While we’re more used to two- or three-dimensional vectors that encode points in space, vectors used for AI applications are usually much longer – with hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Various machine learning algorithms use vectors to store mathematical representations of their inputs. Documents, images, audio files, or any other things processed by an AI model can be stored as vectors called embeddings and by calculating a distance between vectors it is possible to determine similarity between their original objects.</p>
<p>If your model is working with text documents, for example, its embeddings can be used to find the most semantically similar documents just by sorting them by distance. And this is precisely what we need to quickly determine which relevant documents to feed to an LLM when we are crafting a RAG request! And thus, vector databases – solutions that can store data in vector format and perform efficient indexing and searching on it – became a critical part of every AI strategy almost overnight…</p>
<p>Recently I attended <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloudworld/">Oracle CloudWorld</a>, the company’s flagship yearly event where it makes its most important announcements and presents the latest innovations in its products. Do I need to tell you what was the hottest topic this year? From Larry Ellison proclaiming Generative AI the most important technology ever to announcing a strategic partnership with Cohere, an enterprise AI platform vendor, to promising to integrate AI assistants into every business application – “GenAI” dominated the entire event.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, were the announcements that not just Oracle Database but MySQL Heatwave are getting native support for vectors. Of course, it is possible to use a separate specialized database for performing vector operations, but keeping all kinds of data in the same database enables not just faster performance with fewer transformations needed but ensures that sensitive data never leaves your secure perimeter.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-integrated-vector-database-augments-generative-ai-2023-09-19/">AI Vector Search</a>, it is now possible to combine multiple data models including vectors in a single SQL query without any additional effort for developers. MySQL Heatwave’s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-mysql-heatwave-vector-store-generative-ai-2023-09-20/">Vector Store</a> goes even further by providing a complete Generative AI and machine learning stack with embeddings created, stored, and processed directly within the database.&nbsp; On top of this foundation, Oracle provides high-level developer features like generating SQL statements or even entire applications with the APEX platform using natural language prompts. But more importantly for our topic at hand, you can now have an entire stack for implementing RAG-powered business applications, while ensuring that your sensitive data is always protected with multiple layers of database security controls.</p>
<p>OK, and finally, we can talk a bit about AI agility. Again, I just basically made this term up to illustrate the problem developers of AI-powered applications are already facing, even if not many realize it yet. You might be familiar with the notion of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">cryptographic agility</a>, which concerns an organization’s ability to quickly replace outdated cryptographic primitives throughout its entire IT infrastructure, should a particular encryption or hashing method be deemed not strong enough, for example, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">against quantum algorithms</a>. This should be possible without significant downtime, application refactoring, or other business continuity issues.</p>
<p>Working with AI models and with vector data poses the same challenge. Embeddings produced by a certain ML model are completely proprietary and not compatible with any other model. When an organization wants, say, to upgrade its e-commerce recommendation engine with a more modern and sophisticated model that can produce better recommendations, it has to consider the effort of updating this vector data for its entire catalog, potentially across multiple data stores, cloud services, and third-party integrations. Exchanging data with suppliers will be challenging as well, since they can be using other even more incompatible embedding solutions.</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to address this problem? Perhaps by implementing industry-specific standards? Or by introducing additional layers of abstraction into data and application architectures? To be honest, I have no idea! But perhaps other experts have, and you have an opportunity to meet them at our upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution conference</a>, which takes place in less than a month in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
