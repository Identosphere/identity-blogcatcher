<p>Cloud is transforming the way life sciences organizations are doing business. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">Cloud computing</a> offers the potential to redefine and personalize customer relationships, transform and optimize operations, improve governance and transparency, and expand business agility and capability.</p>



<p>Leading life science companies are leveraging cloud for innovation around operational, revenue and business models. According to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/9DEWAJVZ">report on mapping the cloud maturity curve</a> from the <a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/">EIU</a>, 48% of industry executives said cloud has improved data access, analysis and utilization, 45% say cloud has sped up delivery of new IT services and capabilities, and 44% say cloud has expanded sales channels across digital avenues.<br><br>In 2017, <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2019-04/AHAEHRUseDataBrief.pdf">94% of hospitals</a> used electronic clinical data from their EHR. This digitalization and need to share medical data are driving the demand for precision medical technologies. Leading life sciences companies are discovering the power of cloud in enabling analytics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, shrinking innovation cycles, and standardizing processes across global operations, among other benefits.<br><br>Life sciences organizations are developing science/research/commercial clouds to automate mundane tasks associated with each of the areas, such as logging, monitoring, auditing, patching, and integration with an existing toolset, to name a few.<br><br>By providing virtually unlimited compute/storage and pay-as-you-go pricing models, and by being armed with advanced analytics and AI, global scale, and fast innovation, cloud is leveling the technical stage for newcomers and redefining the way disruptors can enter the market.</p>



 The role of AWS and cloud security in life sciences 



<p>However, with greater power comes great responsibility. With the growth in usage of digital technology and cloud in the life sciences industry, digital information is more readily available and at a greater risk for exploitation. According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM’s Cost of a data breach 2022</a> report, 83% of organizations studied have had more than one data breach, and 60% of these breaches caused organizations to pass price increases on to clients. Of these breaches, 45% were cloud-based, costing USD 10.10M on an average, per breach. With an <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/82-healthcare-organizations-have-experienced-iot-focused-cyber-attack-survey-finds">average of 10 to 15 connected medical devices</a> per patient bed in US hospitals, compromised customer data is a top concern for security executives, given the rise in cyberattacks (39%), followed by patient safety (20%) and stolen intellectual property (12%) as top threat vectors.<br><br>Most life sciences companies are raising their security posture with AWS infrastructure and services. From global pharma companies like <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005047/en/Gilead-and-AWS-Collaborate-on-Development-and-Delivery-of-New-Medicines-for-Patients">Gilead</a>, <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/aws-helps-pfizer-accelerate-drug-development-and-clinical">Pfizer</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/roche-advances-personalized-healthcare-using-multi-modal-data-on-aws/">Roche</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/moderna-therapeutics/">Moderna</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/astrazeneca-video-case-study/">AstraZeneca</a> to innovative startups like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/relay-therapeutics/">Relay Therapeutics</a>, life sciences organizations of all sizes and disciplines leverage AWS to transform every stage of their value chain.</p>



<p>With access to the largest secure global infrastructure, life sciences organizations are increasingly relying on AWS to enhance data liquidity, optimize for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/delivering-value-through-operational-excellence">operational excellence</a>, personalize customer engagement and raise the bar on security and compliance.</p>



<p>Overall foundational pillars of the AWS security framework include the following:</p>



 
 Compliance: AWS provides a range of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/">compliance certifications and attestations</a> that are relevant to the life sciences industry, including HIPAA, HITRUST and GxP. Organizations like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/innovators/moderna/">Moderna </a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haAMd9BazuM">Bristol Myers Squibb</a> have chosen AWS to run their regulated workloads. 



 Infrastructure protection: Leveraging its advanced techniques and sheer scale,AWS provides strong mechanisms to protect against infrastructure- and application-layer DDOS attacks. 



 Data protection and privacy: Each AWS customer maintains ownership of their own data. AWS offers clients control over AWS services and geographical locations used to store/process data and encryption options for data in transit/at rest (including those who have access to their AWS accounts), with easy grants, management and revocation. 



 Identity and access management (IAM): AWS IAM enables clients to manage user access to AWS services and resources by using role-based access controls, multi-factor authentication and other security features. 



 Logging and monitoring: AWS provides a range of logging and monitoring services—including Amazon CloudTrail, AWS Config and Amazon CloudWatch—that enable clients to monitor and audit their AWS environments for security events and compliance. 



 Network security: AWS offers many network security features—including Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)—that enable clients to create isolated virtual networks within the AWS cloud and security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) that allow clients to control traffic to and from their resources. 



 Incident response: AWS has a variety of incident response services and tools—including AWS Security Hub, AWS Incident Detection and Response and AWS Trusted Advisor—that enable clients to quickly respond to and remediate security incidents. 
 



<p>Additionally, AWS security services and solutions are focused on delivering key strategic benefits critical to helping you implement your organization’s optimal security posture, as described <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">here</a>.</p>



 AWS Shared Responsibility Model 



<p>When it comes to security, AWS follows a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/">Shared Responsibility Model</a> between the customer and AWS.</p>



<p>AWS is responsible for the operation, management and control of the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the AWS services operate. The customer is responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches to the guest operating system) and associated application software, as well as the configuration of the AWS-provided security group firewall and other security-related features.<br><br>While this model greatly helps with the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved with running a secure, global operation, the customer is still responsible for application security, leveraging proper mechanisms/services for identification, detection, alerting and remediation of security incidents when leveraging AWS as their cloud hyperscaler. With the ever-evolving threat vectors, new AWS security services, evolving organizational security policies/skills and changing compliance regimes, maintaining a cutting-edge security posture on AWS can sometimes pose a difficult challenge for many life science clients.</p>



 Forging the secure path on AWS with IBM Consulting 



<p>While AWS is focused on providing clients with world-class security services and solutions aimed at strengthening organizational security posture, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">IBM Co</a>nsulting is focused on helping clients leverage these building blocks and guiding businesses on their AWS journey, keeping their needs as the north star. IBM is working with clients to help create the optimal cloud security posture, leveraging a combination of AWS offerings and other security tools available in the market, in line with IBM Consulting’s broad experience and customers’ organizational security policies.<br><br>IBM is a Premier Consulting Partner for AWS, with over 19,000 AWS-certified professionals across the globe, 16 service validations and 15 AWS competencies. IBM is also the launch partner for the <a href="https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E000001IlLnmIAF/IBM">AWS Security Competency</a> across all newly announced security categories, becoming the fastest Global GSI to secure more AWS competencies and certifications among Top-16 AWS Premier GSIs within 18 months.</p>



<p>At re:Invent 2022, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/announcing-the-2022-regional-and-global-aws-partners-of-the-year/">IBM Consulting was awarded the Global Innovation Partner of the Year and the GSI Partner of the Year for Latin America</a>, cementing clients’ and AWS trust in IBM Consulting as a trusted partner of choice when it comes to AWS. IBM is also a Level 1 MSSP Competency Partner, Premier Consulting Partner, Advanced Technology Competency Partner and ISV Accelerate Partner for AWS. Whether clients are moving to AWS Cloud or already operating AWS Cloud, IBM Security offers a comprehensive combination of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/aws/security">solutions and expert services</a> around AWS to help develop, implement, and scale a security strategy, eliminate roadblocks, and accelerate time to market.<br><br>When it comes to migration to AWS, IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/XYQLQG8D">Secure AWS Foundation (SAF)</a>, a cornerstone of the cloud platform, embeds a secure-by-design cloud strategy early in the migration plan, helping keep the business confident in cloud migration while establishing security as a cloud enabler, not an inhibitor. SAF defines and deploys an optimal security architecture, using industry-focused, pre-built patterns and templates that meet compliance needs and establish secure landing zones. The solution automates security enforcement, ensuring that when new workloads spin up, they adhere to enterprise security policies. SAF delivers many benefits, including accelerating deployment from months to weeks, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/XYQLQG8D">reducing security deployment costs by 75% and speeding cloud migration by 40%</a>.<br><br>For example, when a major distributor of healthcare products and services (with a presence in 32 countries and serving more than one million clients across the globe) approached IBM Consulting to transform their threat management process and optimize it across their expanded AWS hybrid environment, IBM Security Consulting deployed and delivered a hybrid security solution—comprised of technologies like <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/security/blogs/mike-sanders1/2021/07/13/case-story-aws-x-force-threat-management-qradar">IBM X-Force Threat Management with QRadar on AWS</a>, Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty and others—to deliver 75% faster time to threat detection and remediation.</p>



<p>IBM Security Consulting practice helped the customer solve the following challenges:</p>



 
 Lack of adequately skilled in-house security staff 



 Compliance with data protection regulations 



 The need to secure a remote workforce due to the pandemic 



 Improved security support for rapid M&amp;A cycles, contributing to infrastructure complexity 
 



<p>IBM was able to help deliver tangible organizational benefits, including a 50% increase in coverage of security incidents in the cloud, reduced customer complexity and cost to operationalize cybersecurity threat management, and reduced risk across the IT landscape.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/aws">IBM Consulting Services for AWS Cloud</a> is working closely with AWS and leveraging AWS AI ML services to help clients maintain a secure posture. For example, Amazon Comprehend Medical can help detect Personal Health Information (PHI) in a body of text, which can be used to redact application logs, discharge summaries, contact center agent notes and other patient-related data sources. Amazon Textract can be leveraged to extract printed text, handwriting and data from any document or image and then passed into Amazon Comprehend Medical for redaction. Amazon Macie, a machine learning-enabled data security service, can be leveraged to protect your sensitive data by running targeted scans against sensitive data stored on Amazon S3.<br><br>Given the rise of AI, ChatGPT and Web3.0, over the next several years, we anticipate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> will play a major role in augmenting security engineers’ capabilities, helping them to create more secure architectures and applications in the cloud. In this hybrid, increasingly complex environment, AWS services like Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Detective, Amazon CodeGuru and Amazon Macie will continue to lay the groundwork for integration of security and machine learning, helping clients with intelligent recommendations at scale.</p>



<p>The business value of partnering with IBM Consulting and AWS</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023</a> highlights and quantifies the threats and business value of not partnering with IBM and AWS on security and threat concerns. Some of the benefits of deploying IBM and AWS security approaches and assets include the following:</p>



 
 Reduced risk of data breaches: According to a <a href="https://www.ponemon.org/research/ponemon-library/security/the-state-of-breach-and-attack-simulation-and-the-need-for-continuous-security-validation-a-study-of-us-and-uk-organizations.html">report by the Ponemon Institute</a>, AWS clients that implemented security automation and orchestration experienced a 52% reduction in the likelihood of data breaches, resulting in an average cost savings of $1.5 million. 



 Faster time to compliance: Clients in regulated industries like the life sciences industry can leverage IBM Consulting’s experience and AWS compliance certifications and attestations (e.g., GxP) along with AWS security services like AWS Config, AWS Artifact and AWS CloudFormation to accelerate their compliance efforts and reduce the time and cost of achieving and maintaining compliance. 



 Improved incident response: IBM Consulting can combine the best-of-breed solutions—AWS-native or others—to improve incident responses. IBM Consulting has helped AWS clients leverage AWS security services like AWS Security Hub, AWS Incident Response and Amazon GuardDuty to quickly detect and respond to security incidents, reducing the time and cost of incident response and minimizing the impact of security breaches. 



 Cost savings: By leveraging the automation that IBM Consulting has built, tried and tested, clients can expect to reduce operating costs when IBM is managing their security environment. Working together with AWS, IBM Consulting can help leverage AWS security services, reduce the need for expensive security hardware and software, and reduce the cost of security personnel and security operations. 



 Improved agility and scalability: AWS security services are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, enabling clients to quickly adapt to changing security requirements and scale their security infrastructure to meet the needs of their growing business. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>As evidenced above, cloud security is quickly becoming one of the hot areas where several industries—including life sciences—are increasingly focused. The new model of direct patient engagement that leverages various digital channels, the explosion in available digital data collected through smart devices and IoT-enabled medical devices, and the increased interoperability between pharma, payor and provider brings in unforeseen security challenges, making life sciences companies a ripe target for unexpected security attacks.</p>



<p>While AWS focuses on the security of the cloud, IBM Consulting is dedicated to improving clients’ AWS cloud security posture by leveraging its vast experience, AWS technical expertise and industry-best practices to keep its clients ahead of the security curve.</p>

                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in May 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We started Tokeny with the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to effortlessly purchase and trade financial products they are eligible for. With our&nbsp;network-agnostic tokenization platform, supporting multi-chains,&nbsp;we enable enterprises to turn this belief into a tangible reality.</p>
<p>Any type of asset can be easily and compliantly represented on-chain using our platform&nbsp;with the freedom for the issuer to select their preferred blockchain network.&nbsp;We cater to institutions seeking to tokenize assets, empowering them to benefit from direct securities distribution, automated subscription processes, and diverse liquidity solutions (<a href="https://tokeny.com/dvd-transfers/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">DvD transfer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/new-feature/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">CEX feature</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">Billboard</a>, etc.), regardless of the underlying blockchain network.</p>
<p>Our T-REX tokenization platform acts as a&nbsp;data aggregator&nbsp;that harmoniously aggregates relevant information from blockchains, ensuring data on the platform is always synchronized with the selected blockchains. With a user-friendly interface, it facilitates efficient&nbsp;smart contract management, streamlines operations, and enables ERC3643 token trading. Moreover, it provides seamless&nbsp;connectivity&nbsp;to both external platforms and the DINO distribution network, covering centralized and decentralized trading platforms within the same blockchain network that the securities were issued.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>In the realm of digital securities, the <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 token standard</a> brings compliance and control by only allowing transfers when both the investor rules (via ONCHAINID, digital identity smart contracts) and offering rules are met. While this standard is open-source, its implementation is considerably more intricate compared to the permissionless token standard ERC20.&nbsp;Building a functional platform from scratch demands a significant amount of time, resources, and expertise.</p>
<p>With an extensive track record spanning 6 years, our team of 20 experienced developers has built an end-to-end platform covering the entire lifecycle of ERC3643 tokens. Our value proposition revolves around&nbsp;expediting time-to-market for institutions to increase their market share with proven solutions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our SaaS platform and API are&nbsp;technically capable of supporting all EVM blockchains, which constitute a dominant share of on-chain activities (94% as per DefiLlama, a DeFi data aggregator). Our solutions have been meticulously optimized for three prominent networks: Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Notably, the presence of key multi-chain components, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">indexer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/gas-tank-on-polygon/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">gas tank</a>&nbsp;smart contracts, allows us to efficiently add new EVM networks to our platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, issuers have the flexibility to&nbsp;move digital securities from one chain to another as well as<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">&nbsp;upgrade their smart contracts</a>&nbsp;via our solutions. This dynamic future-proof solution allows issuers to confidently begin asset tokenization in response to any evolving circumstances. By providing a catalyst for tokenization adoption, we ensure a secure and reliable foundation for issuers to embrace this transformative trend.</p>

 How on-chain KYC and the Lightning Network will take the industry to the next level. 



 



<p>The future of crypto within the European Union (EU) is a complex and ever-evolving topic. The good news is that the EU is finally setting some ground rules for the crypto market. The bad news is that it has taken, and is likely to take, a long time to implement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, there has been a growing sense of urgency to create a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, partly due to the increasing popularity of crypto assets, as well as concerns about their potential to be used for illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the year, I have been traveling around Europe, attending events and meeting with industry insiders and thought leaders, and one thing’s for sure: the crypto market is certainly moving in the right direction. Of course, there’s always been buzz – both positive and negative – surrounding the industry, but what with upcoming regulatory frameworks like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regime</a>, there appears to be more confidence and excitement from operators, regulators and consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two recent developments, in particular, have really captivated the imagination of the industry: on-chain KYC and the Lightning Network. In fact, I recently moderated a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-on-chain-kyc-lightning-network/"> fascinating roundtable discussion</a> on how they’re both set to revolutionize the market. Before we delve into these topics, it’s important to know what decentralized finance (DeFi) is, and why I think it is crucial to the development of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



 Centralization is a risk. Why DeFi is the way to go. 



<p>There has been a lot of talk about the ‘perils’ of DeFi, with many assuming the recent failure of the likes of<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/"> FTX</a> could indicate the technology doesn’t really work. But, I think the opposite is true, and that the recent events have just emphasized that we actually need DeFi, and cannot be dependent on certain authorities. Centralization is actually a risk in itself. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Events such as the failure of FTX spark innovation and improvements, as well as regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi refers to a set of financial applications and platforms built on blockchain technology that aim to provide open, permissionless, and inclusive financial services. Unlike traditional centralized financial systems such as banks, DeFi eliminates intermediaries and enables direct peer-to-peer transactions and interactions through smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is DeFi integral to the future of crypto?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralization: DeFi operates on blockchain networks, which are decentralized and distributed across multiple computers or nodes. This decentralized nature eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, enabling users to have more control over their funds and financial activities.</p>



<p>Accessibility: DeFi platforms are generally open to anyone with an internet connection, allowing individuals from around the world, including the unbanked or under banked, to access financial services. This inclusivity promotes financial empowerment and can provide opportunities for economic growth in underserved regions. By removing barriers like geographical limitations, high fees, and strict regulations, DeFi can empower individuals to take control of their finances, access capital, and participate in global markets.</p>



<p>Transparency: DeFi operates on public blockchains, making all transactions and activities transparent and auditable. This transparency can help build trust among users as they can independently verify and audit the underlying code, smart contracts, and transactions.</p>



<p>Another important reason why DeFi is the future, is programmability. The technology utilizes smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts automate financial processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and enabling the creation of innovative financial products like decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and more.</p>



<p>DeFi offers various opportunities for users to earn yields on their crypto assets. Activities like liquidity provision, staking, lending, and yield farming enable individuals to earn passive income on their holdings, potentially outperforming returns from traditional financial instruments.</p>



<p>While DeFi has gained significant attention and adoption, it’s important to note that the space is still evolving, and there are significant risks involved, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, regulatory challenges, and market volatility. However, many believe that with further development, innovation, and user education, DeFi has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by offering more accessible, efficient, and inclusive financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn more about the role of KYC in a decentralized world in our blog, ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/decentralized-finance-defi-kyc-contradiction/">Can Defi and KYC ever peacefully co-exist?’.</a></p>



 



 
 
 

 
 
 



 Why is MiCA so important? 



<p> Amidst the ongoing development and regulatory considerations surrounding DeFi, it is worth examining recent regulations in the crypto space within the EU. One notable example is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA regulation</a>, which was approved by the European Parliament in April 2023. This ground-breaking regulation marks the world’s first comprehensive framework specifically tailored to crypto assets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MiCA introduces a range of requirements for crypto businesses to adhere to, including:&nbsp;</p>



  Registration with national authorities<br>  Compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CTF) regulations&nbsp;<br>  Provision of clear information to consumers about the risks of crypto assets&nbsp;  



<p>MiCA provides legal clarity by defining and categorizing different types of crypto assets and activities within the EU. It sets out clear rules and definitions for crypto assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins, which helps reduce ambiguity and promotes regulatory certainty for businesses and investors operating within the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also introduces a licensing framework for crypto service providers. Businesses such as crypto firms, wallet providers, and custodians must obtain authorization from competent authorities within the EU. This authorization requirement aims to enhance consumer protection and ensure compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF)</a> regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to safeguard the interests of investors, MiCA requires issuers of certain crypto assets to provide comprehensive and accurate information. MiCA also aims to promote market integrity and stability by setting standards for the operation of crypto exchanges and trading platforms. It includes provisions for orderly trading, transparency of prices, and measures to prevent market abuse and insider trading. These measures contribute to building trust and confidence in the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While MiCA is undoubtedly an important step toward regulating crypto in the EU, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK is still debating how to move forward</a>. However, it’s important to remember that MiCA is not a complete solution to the EU’s crypto problem, as it doesn’t address on-chain KYC. &nbsp;</p>



 What is on-chain KYC? &nbsp; 



<p>On-chain KYC refers to the process of verifying the identity of a crypto user by analysing their on-chain activity. This can be done by looking at things like the addresses they use, the transactions they make, and the tokens they hold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a valuable tool for law enforcement and regulators, as it can help them to identify and investigate suspicious activity, as well as track down criminals who use crypto to launder money or finance terrorism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On-chain KYC is necessary to protect businesses and consumers, while preventing crime. If your crypto platform doesn’t cover on-chain KYC, then how well do you really <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On-chain KYC is set to revolutionize DeFi and this cannot be ignored. Now let’s discuss the Lightning Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is the Lightning Network important to the future of crypto?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol that runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows for faster and cheaper payments and is becoming increasingly popular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol is very important as it addresses one of the biggest challenges of Bitcoin: scalability. Although Bitcoin is a very secure and decentralized network, it is also very slow and expensive to use. The Lightning Network solves this problem by allowing for off-chain payments.&nbsp;</p>



 How does the Lightning Network actually work? 



<p>The Lightning Network operates through the use of payment channels, where two participants open a payment channel by creating a multi-signature transaction on the underlying blockchain. This transaction serves as the funding transaction for the channel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lightning Network allows participants to route payments through a network of interconnected payment channels. This routing capability makes it a scalable solution. Participants can, at any point, close a payment channel and settle the final state on the underlying blockchain. The final settlement transaction reflects the net result of all the off-chain transactions that occurred within the channel. By ultimately settling on the&nbsp; blockchain, participants ensure the security and immutability of the transactions.&nbsp;</p>



 What is driving the development of the crypto industry?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralization, security and transparency are driving the evolution of the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leading blockchain protocols are decentralized and are not subject to government control or control from financial institutions. This makes them an attractive proposition to people concerned about privacy and censorship. Cryptocurrencies are secured by cryptography, which makes them difficult to hack, and a more secure store of value than traditional fiat currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, most blockchains are transparent, meaning all crypto transactions are recorded on a public ledger. This is not the case with traditional financial systems.&nbsp;</p>



 Challenges and opportunities in the DACH region.&nbsp; 



<p>Although they each have their specific challenges, Germany, Austria and Switzerland are great markets for crypto businesses to enter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key challenges are the lack of regulation, as the crypto industry is still in its early stages there. Their comparatively high taxes can also make the markets a less attractive proposition to investors. And while there is a growing community of people who are aware of crypto, vast swathes of the general public in those countries don’t fully understand the topic, let alone want to be involved. However, this presents a great opportunity to both educate people about the benefits of crypto, while attracting new users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The German government is considering a more innovative regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, which could create a more favourable environment for crypto companies. A strong talent pool can be helpful in developing new products and services, and the DACH region has an abundance of skilled developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at the future of crypto, I am reassured by the state of play in Europe. Yes, there are a number of challenges, but there are also a number of opportunities. The future of crypto in Europe will likely depend on how the industry addresses these challenges and capitalizes on the opportunities arising from DeFi, on-chain KYC, and the Lightning Network to create a safe, transparent, decentralized and trustworthy environment for customers.</p>

<p>When it comes to driving large technology transformation on Cloud, leveraging&nbsp;existing investments, and optimizing open innovation within the larger ecosystem with a hybrid cloud platform, IBM Consulting™ offers several learnings to help organizations address the architecture and technology challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider large financial services organization going through core banking modernization. The core banking application landscape involves multiple applications (both legacy and custom off-the-shelf) that are integrated and surfaced across multiple customer experiences, including mobile. The goal of modernizing such a large application landscape is to deliver a nimble micro services architecture while also providing a robust application delivery mechanism that leverages the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes. &nbsp;</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/redhat%20">Learn what IBM Consulting and Red Hat can do for your enterprise</a>



<p>As referenced in the architecture challenge section of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/mastering-hybrid-cloud">Mastering hybrid cloud IBV report</a>, a single integrated hybrid cloud platform and application architecture is the chassis on which the applications can be mounted and managed, leading to dramatic improvement in software application development and production. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One proven approach is adopting <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/aws">Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA)</a> as a turnkey application development platform managed by both Red Hat and AWS. This platform manages underlying application resources and other functions (such as scalability) so that enterprises can focus on cloud-native application development or application modernization—instead of managing the complexity of the underlying application platform. A Telco customer reported that “developers can now concentrate more on their application logic and their business logic, and they can just develop applications. Our prime focus really is to develop software quickly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantages of leveraging ROSA reach across industries. In the Travel and Transportation industry there was an unprecedented demand for post-pandemic leisure travel, which resulted in huge growth in the number of airline passengers, hotel reservations and related services such as car rentals. Similar use cases in other industries include integrated member experience in Healthcare, smart asset performance and security in Energy &amp; Utilities, connected vehicle services in Automotive, operations and process optimization as part of industry 4.0 in Manufacturing, and customer relationship management and customer service automation in Financial Services. A&nbsp; financial services customer reported “uptime and performance increased 25–30% with Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated versus a self-managed and self-supported Kubernetes application platform.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For these customers, adopting digital transformation tends to drive cultural change within application lifecycle management, skills and operating model changes, change management and center of excellence—which drives cloud-ready architecture patterns and education. A sustainable transformation aligns with the consistent application platform driving productivity benefits within an elastic, agile and resilient application environment. These tenets are the foundation for ROSA’s target operating model, which IBM Consulting optimizes across customer engagements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/economic-impact-of-cloud-service-analyst-material">Total Economic Impact™ report</a> found that this approach led to a 50% improvement in operational efficiency, a 20% increase in recaptured developer time and a 70% reduction in the development cycle. An <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/enterprise-accelerate-agility-cloud-services">IDC report</a> also found that with Red Hat OpenShift cloud services, it is possible to develop features 30-40% more quickly and with a 25% reduction in costs, compared with a public cloud provider container offering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Industry use cases and core application modernization engagements demonstrate the benefits of adopting the ROSA application platform, including the ability to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Optimize operational costs given the underlying application platform management is fully managed by Red Hat SREs and AWS&nbsp; 



 Increase revenue-generating capabilities with new business application features that can be delivered in an accelerated release cycle, improving time to value&nbsp; 



 Lower risks of application delivery with compliance, upgrades, security and availability needs, given the platform stability and fewer vulnerabilities of the application platform&nbsp; 



 Innovate continuously with faster dev cycles and lower validation costs, with the consistency of the application platform&nbsp; 



 Manage talent focused on higher value activities of application development, skills portability, and employee retention (driving cloud native innovation, reduced development environment standup cycle, platform optimization and standardized toolsets)&nbsp;

<p>Fission co-founder and CTO <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a> shares how UCANs simplify authorization while keeping it decentralized and preserving user agency.</p><p>When we think about authorization, an image of a central authority determining what a person is and is not allowed to do comes to mind. In technology, this translates to authorization servers checking a list to see if the person has the correct permissions to access a service.</p><p>Even on the decentralized web, this still occurs. For example, if a user is on a machine that isn't running an IPFS node, or the IPFS node they are trying to access is asleep, the only way they can access the namespace that that IPFS node is managing is to log in through some other mechanism. The same goes for many edge apps or dapps. They create a point of centralization, even in a mostly distributed system.</p><p>But what if we got rid of the authorization server entirely? What if the user acted as their own auth server? Then we would have decentralized auth. This is where UCAN comes in.</p> Capabilities <p>There are two ways to handle authorization - access control lists and capabilities. </p><p>Access Control Lists are designed for when users are sharing a terminal. Think of a shared computer register where each sales associate logs in and out of the machine to tie their transactions to their individual profile. </p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateful Auth - There is a user, a gatekeeper, and a service. The gatekeeper determines if the user can access the service according to the list.  Pro - There are three clear stages in the process.  Con - Neither the user nor the service is in control. They have no agency, and all the data is centralized in one list.  <p>Capabilities are designed for networking.</p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateless Auth - There is a user who has an address (pointer) to the service they are trying to access and a cryptographic token that says that they can access the service.  Pro - The user and service are in control.  Pro - All the required info is in the token. We can make copies of the token, share those copies with others, and revoke access to copies if we choose. Access can also be set to expire after a certain timeframe has elapsed.    UCANs vs DIDs - DID you know UCAN have both? <p>How are UCAN tokens different from DIDs?</p>  DIDs are building blocks inside of UCANs!   DIDs say who you are. They give you a public key, and you can prove you're allowed to sign (AuthN - authentication)  UCANs say what you can do (AuthZ - authorization)   The UCAN Token <p>The UCAN comprises three main components: The JWT Header, the Payload (which includes the issuer / a DID - and proofs / CIDs), and the Signature (which must match the DID in the issuer).</p><p>The proofs demonstrate what capabilities the user has access to. The capabilities include a resource (for example, a path to a document), read or write access, and other extensible fields, like an email address.</p><p>The best part, we can delegate authority without sharing keys, making the process much more secure!</p> What UCAN do with UCANs <p>Authorized Data Retrieval - When you make your files shareable, UCAN ensures no unauthorized users can request them. In other words, unless you have a valid UCAN, you can't download a content address.</p><p>Apps - UCANs are used to delegate write access in <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>, and WNFS, in turn, is used in many different apps like FxFotos and Fission Drive to manage files.</p><p>Authorized Channels - If you'd like to set up a group chat or gossip with specific peers, you will want a way for folks to prove that they are allowed to be in that channel so they can be admitted. Giving peers a shared capability provides them with that proof. </p><p>Decentralized Compute - We're using UCANs in <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a> to power distributed pipelines and collaborative processes.</p> IPFS Thing 2023 Presentation <p>Watch Brooklyn's full presentation below:</p><p><a href="https://noti.st/expede/Ykh5xH/ucan-decentralize-auth#sSWVwVc">Brooklyn's Presentation Slides</a></p><p>If you'd like to learn more, UCAN visit the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">GitHub working group</a>, check out the UCAN validator on the <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">community site</a>, or even play a fun <a href="https://ucan.lol/">adventure game</a> to see UCANs in action!</p>

 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History 
 Online Purchases 
 Email Communication 
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
 
 Social Media Posts 
<p>Any content shared on social media platforms, including photos, videos, comments, and likes, contributes to a person's digital footprint. These posts can provide insights into their interests, opinions, and activities.</p>
 Web Browsing History 
<p>Every website visited and the search queries made leave a digital trace in the form of browsing history. It can include information about the types of websites visited, articles read, products searched for, and online services used.</p>
 Online Purchases 
<p>When making online purchases, individuals leave a digital footprint through transaction records. This can include payment information, shipping addresses, and product preferences. This data can be collected and analyzed to understand consumer behavior and tailor personalized advertisements.</p>
 Email Communication 
<p>Emails sent and received, including attachments, provide a digital trail of personal and professional conversations. The content of these emails can reveal information about relationships, affiliations, and communication patterns.</p>
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
<p>The creation and maintenance of online profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, dating websites, or gaming communities contribute to a person's digital footprint. These profiles often contain personal information, employment history, educational background, and connections. And they form a digital representation of an individual's identity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that digital footprints can have implications for privacy, security, and reputation management. The data accumulated over time can be used for various purposes, including targeted advertising, data analysis, and even potential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s vital that individuals take extra caution when browsing the internet, especially when sharing private information. Even websites that appear trustworthy may be at risk of data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
 How Online Identity Works 
<p>On a daily basis, individuals rely on their online identities to access various applications. Certain websites play a pivotal role in everyday work, communication, and education. However, there are also online domains that serve as sources of entertainment or offer delightful distractions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples in which people make use of their online identities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Media 
 Online Gaming 
 Professional Networks 
 Online Communities and Forums 
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
 
<p>Now, let's take a moment to briefly discuss them.</p>
 Social Media 
<p>On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, online identity is built through the creation of profiles. This may also include sharing personal information, posting content, and engaging with others. For example, a person's online identity on Instagram might include their username, profile picture, bio, and the photos or videos they share.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Gaming 
<p>In the realm of online gaming, players often create unique usernames, avatars, and profiles that represent their gaming persona. Their online identity in this context is influenced by their gaming achievements, playstyle, interactions with other players, and reputation within the gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Networks 
<p>Platforms like LinkedIn focus on professional networking and career development. Online identity on LinkedIn is shaped by an individual's professional experience. This can include work experience, education, skills, recommendations, and professional achievements. It allows professionals to establish their expertise, connect with colleagues, and showcase their qualifications.</p>
 Online Communities and Forums 
<p>Though online communities and forums centered around specific interests or hobbies, individuals have the opportunity to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge. Online identity within these communities is built based on the content contributed, expertise demonstrated, and the respect gained from other community members.&nbsp;</p>
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
<p>When engaging in online shopping, individuals create accounts and profiles on e-commerce platforms. Online identity in this context involves personal information, purchase history, reviews, and ratings given to products or sellers. It influences the trustworthiness and credibility of an individual as a buyer or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each of these contexts, online identity is constructed through the information individuals share, their online activities, and the interactions they have with others. It plays a role in shaping how others perceive them and how they navigate various online spaces.</p>
 The Benefits of Having an Online Identity 
<p>Because the wide majority of the world has already adopted modern technology, having an online identity has become a necessity. However, there are a multitude of benefits which come with having an online identity, namely:</p>
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
 Professional Opportunities 
 Networking and Collaboration 
 Personal Branding 
 Access to Resources and Information 
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
<p>Having an online identity allows individuals to extend their reach beyond physical boundaries. It provides a platform to share ideas, expertise, and creativity with a global audience. And this may potentially lead to increased influence and impact.</p>
 Professional Opportunities 
<p>An online identity can open doors to various professional opportunities. It allows individuals to showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a digital resume, making it easier for others to discover and connect with them.</p>
 Networking and Collaboration 
<p>An online identity facilitates networking and collaboration by connecting individuals with like-minded people, professionals in their field, or communities of interest. It provides a platform to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, fostering valuable connections and relationships.</p>
 Personal Branding 
<p>Online identity enables individuals to shape and manage their personal brand effectively. They can curate their online presence to reflect their values, expertise, and unique qualities. This branding can help individuals stand out, establish credibility, and create a positive perception among peers, potential clients, or collaborators.</p>
 Access to Resources and Information 
<p>Having an online identity grants individuals access to a vast array of resources, information, and opportunities available on the internet. It allows them to tap into online communities, educational platforms, industry-specific websites, and research databases. This empowers them to stay informed, learn, and grow in their personal and professional pursuits.</p>
 Online Identity Risks and Challenges 
<p>As with any innovation, having an online identity does not come without risks. It’s important for people to be aware of these negative aspects and to take precautions to avoid becoming victims. Even more, it’s equally important to spread awareness and educate as many people as possible about these matters.</p>
<p>If proper security measures would be in place, the following situations could be prevented:</p>
 
 Identity Theft 
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
 Online Reputation Damage 
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
 
 Identity Theft 
<p>Online <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> occurs when someone gains unauthorized access to personal information and uses it for fraudulent purposes. For example, a hacker might gain access to an individual's online banking account and use their identity to make unauthorized transactions or steal funds.</p>
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
<p>Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity. For example, a person may receive an email appearing to be from their bank, asking them to click on a link and provide login credentials. Hackers may use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.</p>
 Online Reputation Damage 
<p>In the digital age, a person's online reputation can have significant consequences. Negative or inappropriate content shared online, whether by oneself or others, can harm one's personal or professional reputation. For instance, a controversial tweet or a compromising photo shared online without consent can damage an individual's reputation and have long-lasting consequences.</p>
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> occur when sensitive information is accessed, stolen, or exposed due to security vulnerabilities in online systems. This can lead to the compromise of personal information, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, or financial data. An example is when a major retail company experiences a breach, resulting in the theft of customer credit card information from their database.</p>
<p>These risks and challenges highlight the importance of maintaining strong online security practices, being cautious with personal information sharing, and being vigilant about potential threats to online identity.</p>

<p>IBM Consulting has established a Center of Excellence for generative AI. It stands alongside IBM Consulting’s existing global AI and Automation practice, which includes 21,000 data and AI consultants who have conducted over 40,000 enterprise client engagements. The Center of Excellence (CoE) already has more than 1,000 consultants with specialized <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> expertise that are engaging with a global set of clients to drive productivity in IT operations and core business processes like HR or marketing, elevate their customer experiences and create new business models. Our CoE is ready to help accelerate our clients’ business transformations with enterprise-grade AI, including the newly announced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM watsonx</a>, as well as technology from our ecosystem of business partners.</p>



<p>The CoE is off to a fast start. In 2023 alone, IBM Consulting has interacted with more than 100 clients and completed dozens of engagements infusing generative AI alongside classical machine learning AI strategies. Examples include delivering AI-generated spoken sports commentary to millions of fans at <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-03-28-IBM-Brings-Generative-AI-Commentary-and-Hole-by-Hole-Player-Predictions-to-the-Masters-Digital-Experience">The Masters</a>, combining generative AI with IBM Watson® to verify the discovery of new applications of <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-25-Combining-Generative-AI-with-IBM-Watson,-Mitsui-Chemicals-Starts-Verifying-New-Application-Discovery-for-Agility-and-Accuracy">Mitsui Chemicals</a> products and applying generative AI in the customer relationship process at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/bouygues-telecom">Bouygues Telecom</a>. In our early work applying foundation models, IBM Consulting has seen some clients experience up to 70% acceleration in time-to-value with foundation models, as compared to traditional AI approaches.</p>



<p>Generative AI has progressed quickly beyond experimentation; businesses are embracing it to improve customer service, seize new market opportunities and more. IDC1 estimates the AI Services market will grow from approximately $36 billion USD in 2023 to approximately $65 billion USD in 2026. At the same time, there are reasonable concerns about how to mitigate bias, manage data security, and factor in precision and risk. Our years of AI experience show us that getting to enterprise AI at scale requires a composable, multi-model strategy and a human-centric, principled approach.</p>



<p>A recent IBM Institute for Business Value survey2 found surveyed executives report their organizations are using generative AI in finance (34%), HR (41%), supply chain (45%), marketing and sales (40%), customer service (57%), and IT services and technology (63%). Generative AI can help automate routine tasks so workers can focus on higher value activities, augmenting staff with innovative capabilities like creative content and code creation, content summarization and search. Executives reported they expect nearly half (48%) of the staff in their organization will use generative AI to augment their daily tasks in the next year.</p>



 Proven methods and a culture of AI innovation 



<p>The CoE will use the full generative AI technology stack, including foundation models and 50+ domain-specific classical machine learning accelerators aimed at helping clients improve productivity and foster innovation. We will also use IBM’s proprietary&nbsp; AI “advisor” toolkit in IBM Consulting to improve our internal operations and client delivery. In addition, the CoE will develop new solutions and assets with clients and partners, leveraging the pipeline of generative AI innovations from IBM Research.</p>



<p>With IBM Garage for Generative AI, IBM consultants apply a proven, collaborative method to help clients fast-track innovation in the emerging category of foundation models for generative AI. That includes rapid use case ideation and prioritization, an open, multi-model approach to selecting architectures and training and fine tuning and scaling models to unique business needs.</p>



 IBM Consulting and watsonx 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM watsonx</a>3, our next generation platform for AI and data, is designed to enable enterprises to scale and accelerate the impact of the most advanced AI with trusted data. In the same way that we established our successful Hybrid Cloud services business built on the Red Hat® OpenShift® platform, IBM Consulting intends to be the leading consulting services provider for watsonx. IBM Consulting plans to build a watsonx-focused practice to serve clients with deep expertise in the full generative AI technology stack like foundation models, AIOps, DataOps and AI governance mechanisms, while we also scale our consulting business with partners.</p>



 An open ecosystem approach to AI 



<p>IBM Consulting takes an open and collaborative approach to plan, build, implement and operate generative AI solutions that embrace multiple models on multiple clouds from industry leaders. An open ecosystem approach helps our clients define the right models and the right architecture to deliver the best outcomes. IBM Consulting has unique skills in IBM technology but also works closely with a diverse AI partner ecosystem, including Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, open source technologies and more, to help ensure clients benefit from the technology solution that best meets their needs.</p>



<p>Recent research2 from the IBM Institute for Business Value shows that 79% of executives say their organization is challenged with ensuring their AI models are responsible, secure, and free from discrimination and bias. The new CoE builds on IBM Consulting’s decades of industry and domain experience helping some of the largest organizations in the world transform their mission-critical processes. Our consultants have developed deep skills in applying an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-consulting-brings-a-valuable-and-responsible-approach-to-ai/">ethically responsible approach to AI</a> and working alongside AI to deliver business value. Our capabilities are recognized in the industry; IBM was just named a Leader in the <a href="https://idcdocserv.com/US49647023e_IBM">IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Services 2023 Vendor Assessment</a> (doc #US49647023, May 2023) for the second time.</p>

<p>If you’re an IT professional—from the C-suite to a hands-on practitioner—you know the pressure your <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-operations">IT operations (ITOps)</a> are under. You’re responsible for optimizing spend, operational efficiency and incorporating new and innovative technologies. But are your tools slowing you down?</p>



<p>Coined by research firm Gartner, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/aiops">AIOps</a> is artificial intelligence for IT operations. It is the application of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> capabilities (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> models) to automate and streamline operational workflows.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we will examine traditional IT operation problems through the lens of data-driven automation and the benefits of AIOps. It’s a powerful way to address critical issues like sub-optimal application performance and poor customer experiences, boost metrics like MTTR and address IT team skill issues for greater resiliency.</p>



<p>We’ll show you how AI-powered solutions can help your IT staff move from a “break-fix” approach to one that’s more predictive and proactive, designed to address dynamic challenges, deliver faster problem remediation, provide bottom-line benefits to your organization and help you achieve digital transformation.</p>



 1. From performance blind spots to more observability and better collaboration 



<p>The proliferation of cloud services, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">containers</a> and hybrid cloud environments can leave traditional IT operations teams struggling to monitor and manage potential issues within these complex environments. The result is blind spots, false alarms and delays in identifying and resolving issues. And every second counts—a recent IDC survey found that a single hour of downtime costs an average of USD 250K or more when a revenue-generating production service is impacted.<br><br>With AIOps, you have the benefit of observability tools that deliver near real-time data granularity and cardinality for all application stakeholders. Better visibility, communication and transparency means teams can pinpoint problems in a more nimble and responsive fashion. For example, as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/enento-group">Enento Group</a> modernized existing, on-premises systems, it used <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> to monitor all of its applications in one place. This approach allowed them to meet SLAs and achieve 99.99% availability.<br><br>Today’s complex, diverse networks also benefit from AIOps and real-time performance monitoring. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/bt-business">BT Business</a> enabled a new level of visibility and consolidated the number of monitoring systems by 80%. This enabled simpler integration and offered a major reduction in software licensing costs.</p>



 2. From “no human can keep up” to faster MTTR 



<p>On average, organizations are using <a href="https://resources.mulesoft.com/ty-report-connectivity-benchmark.html#loaded">1,000+ applications</a> across hybrid cloud environments. We’re also drowning in data, yet <a href="https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagates-rethink-data-report-reveals-that-68-percent-of-data-available-to-businesses-goes-unleveraged-pr-master/">less than a third</a> of enterprise data is even used. Traditional IT infrastructures can’t keep up with analyzing all the information, which means it’s difficult—if not impossible—to understand opportunities for improvement and innovation.<br><br>The benefit of AIOps is that you have the tools to cut through IT noise while correlating operations data from multiple IT environments. This means you can use anomaly detection, perform root cause analysis and propose solutions faster and more accurately than humanly possible. IT teams can shift from fixing to deploying and deliver greater value to the business. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/exavault-inc">ExaVault</a> chose an observability solution for instant visibility into application performance issues and reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR) by 56.6% as a result.</p>



 3. From overspending to cost optimization 



<p>Too often, the traditional ITOps approach to managing applications is to overspend in the cloud to avoid performance risks. No wonder organizations say 32% of their cloud spend was wasted in 2022. But these days, every penny counts, and this wasted spend has environmental implications, too.<br><br>The benefit of AIOps is the ability to optimize cloud costs by using software—not human intervention —to make critical decisions. Applications get exactly the resources they need, when they need them—continuously and automatically. For example, in just 10 months, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/providence/">Providence</a> safely migrated a significant portion of its workloads to Azure and achieved more than USD 2 million in savings through optimization actions—all while assuring application performance, even during peak demand.</p>



 4. From a negative environmental impact to more sustainable IT 



<p>Data centers account for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks">1-1.5% of global electricity use</a>. As we mentioned above, it’s not uncommon for IT teams to over-allocate resources to mitigate application performance risks. Yet that traditional approach costs both the business and the environment, and customers are watching how seriously you take commitments to ESG. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://wickedbionic.com/blog/marketing-to-eco-conscious-millennials-dos-and-donts">Nielsen</a>, 75% of Millennials will change their buying habits to favor environmentally-friendly products.</p>



<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sustainability">sustainability</a>, AIOps tools enable you to implement the FinOps cloud financial management discipline and automatically optimize your cloud and data center environments. That, in turn, lessens the amount of energy used, reducing waste produced by idle machines. For example, since shifting to AIOps, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/blueit">BlueIT</a> reduced waste across their clients’ environments. After executing resourcing recommendations powered by artificial intelligence, one customer achieved a 10% reduction in memory and CPU over-allocation.</p>



 5. From staff concerns (and IT fire drills) to a more productive workforce 



<p>Finding, keeping and training the right IT staff is a top concern. Because of automation and new technologies, it’s estimated that 50% of all employees will need to upskill or reskill by 2025. Traditional ITOps rely too much on individual, human intervention, manual efforts (like chasing down bugs) or on institutional knowledge of what’s worked in the past.<br><br>The benefit of AIOps is that it allows employees to use tools that continuously learn, so knowledge doesn’t leave when someone retires. AI-powered proactive incident management helps identify false positives and prioritize the most urgent alerts. That gives IT teams the power to address potential issues before they lead to slow-downs, outages or poor customer experiences.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/electrolux">Electrolux</a> accelerated IT-issue resolution from three weeks to just an hour via faster mean time to detect (MTTD) and saved more than 1,000 hours per year by automating repair tasks.</p>



<p>As our systems continue growing in complexity, IT challenges (and the pressures you’ll face) certainly won’t decrease. But by up-leveling your IT operations with AIOps solutions (and the AIOps benefits that come with them), you’ll have the automation, powered by artificial intelligence, to create IT that can respond in seconds for less downtime, better application performance, lower operational costs and greater success with digital transformation.</p>

           <p>PHARMACEUTICAL SKIN CARE, AN EVER EVOLVING INDUSTRY</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical skin care industry is constantly evolving, driven by a growing demand for effective and personalized products. As consumers become more aware of the importance of skincare and the impact it has on their overall well-being, there is an increasing need for innovative solutions that cater to individual needs. In this digital age, UNISOT, a leading technology company, is transforming the skin care industry through its cutting-edge solutions, offering unparalleled benefits to both manufacturers and consumers.</p>
<p>STREAMLINING SUPPLY CHAINS</p>
<p>One of the key challenges in the skin care industry is managing complex supply chains effectively. UNISOT’S public blockchain-based supply chain platform provides a transparent and secure network that enables seamless collaboration and traceability from ingredient sourcing to product distribution. By leveraging a <a href="https://unisot.com/digital-product-passport/">Digital Product Passport</a>, manufacturers can track the origin, quality and authenticity of each ingredient, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of counterfeit products. This not only enhances consumer trust but also enables companies to maintain high-quality standards.</p>
<p>ENHANCING PRODUCT SAFETY AND EFFICACY</p>
<p>Product safety and efficacy are of utmost importance in the skin care industry. By integrating public blockchain technology into the testing and validation processes, manufacturers can securely record and track product data, including test results and certifications. This not only streamlines compliance procedures but also helps identify any potential issues or recalls promptly, safeguarding consumer health and strengthening brand reputation.</p>
      <p>REAL-TIME FEEDBACK AND CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT</p>
<p>UNISOT’s solutions empower manufacturers to engage with their customers in real-time, fostering a stronger bond between brands and consumers. Through innovative technologies like smart packaging and connected devices, manufacturers can gather valuable data on product usage, customer feedback, and preferences. This data can be utilized to improve existing products, develop new formulations, and adapt marketing strategies to meet evolving customer needs. By actively involving consumers in the product development process, manufacturers can build a loyal customer base and drive brand advocacy.</p>
<p>SUSTAINABLY AND ECO-FRIENDLY PRACTICES</p>
<p>The skin care industry is increasingly focused on sustainability and eco-friendly practices. Our solutions support companies in adopting greener initiatives throughout the supply chain. By providing end-to-end traceability, manufacturers can ensure responsible sourcing of ingredients and monitor the environmental impact of their operations. Additionally, enabling streamlined inventory management, reducing waste and minimizing the carbon footprint associated with excess production and transportation.</p>

   I was thrilled to get the news from one of our teammates at Ping that we had achieved FAPI 2.0 certification and were one of the first companies to do so.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 I’ve been involved in identity standards for a long time—from the old SAML interop testing days to OAuth to OpenID Connect and now FAPI. It is great to see open standards continuing to grow and thrive.

 Stakers can claim DF38 rewards. DF39 runs May 25 — Apr 01,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 39 is here&nbsp;(DF39).</p><p>DF39 is the 11th week of DF Main, the final phase of DF. This week, users can earn rewards up to 150K OCEAN. In DF Main, weekly rewards will grow to 1M+&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>The article <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“Ocean Data Farming Main is Here”</a> has the full details of DF Main. In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards stakers with OCEAN who allocate voting power to curate data assets with high&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">DF&nbsp;dapp</a>.</p><p>DF38 counting started 12:01am May 18, 2023 and ended 12:01am May 25.

Click “Claim”, sign the tx, and collect your&nbsp;rewards  <p>Rewards accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF39&nbsp;Overview <p>DF39 is part of DF Main, phase 1. This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%.

<p>To put it simply, don’t tie yourself to proprietary technology when technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Plus, there’s the risk of not being able to interoperate with other identity and data ecosystems unless you go down the path of costly and complex direct integrations. With open source you own your solution and can develop on it as you see fit. You also benefit from the innovation generated by a vibrant open-source community. Community-developed code tends to be more resilient code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make use of decentralization technology</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology allows people to hold their own data and share it in a way that the authenticity and integrity of the data can be verified without having to check in with or create a direct integration with the issuer of the information. This means that a vital record can be immediately trusted and easily shared across different systems. Sharing records through a peer-to-peer encrypted channel further enhances privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide verification methods for partners and stakeholders</p>
<p>When it comes to vital records, digital copies will only be as useful in proportion to their adoption and verification. To have a successful solution businesses and organizations must be able to easily recognize and verify a vital digital record as an acceptable document.</p>
<p>More partners and stakeholders also bring their own points of view, priorities, and use cases; they may have ideas for adoption and use cases that you haven’t thought of yet!</p>
<p>Start somewhere</p>
<p>You need to make something. Excitement over an idea can spread easily, but progress cant happen until you have a prototype or proof of concept. Even if it’s not perfect, it drives feedback from stakeholders, customers, or partners.</p>
 Don’t 
<p>Get locked into a proprietary solution</p>
<p>Even if it’s a solution from a big name there’s alway the risk of loss of support or costly upgrades. Open-source code provides longevity—it’s something you can fully own, develop on as you see fit, or draw on new features being added to the codebase by other users. This is why governments are increasingly requiring open-source solutions in RFPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait for the perfect solution</p>
<p>Several states have already implemented virtual driver’s licenses. The technology is mature and has already been deployed by many governments. As the technology evolves incremental changes are possible to keep your solution up to date.</p>
<p>Build a siloed solution</p>
<p>Interoperability is important to creating a vital record that is widely recognized. Building and testing your solutions with other compatible solutions guarantees your records will be easily verifiable.</p>
<p>A key takeaway here is that this technology is not difficult to integrate into current systems. All this data is already available in government databases. The addition of verifiable credentials allows people to better manage their own documents and have an extra layer of security and verification.</p>
<p>The effort to move vital records from paper file cabinets to digital wallets or files is both nuanced and exciting to the team here at Indicio.

<p>Anonyome Labs’ CTO and Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley recently gave Australian students studying advanced topics in security 7 insights into how&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;(DI) is rapidly solving the global&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He gave the lecture at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">The University of Queensland</a>, a leading provider of education in cyber security, cryptography and blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley’s lecture explored how DI is the new approach to identity management on the internet and&nbsp;the biggest privacy breakthrough of the next decade.&nbsp;</p>



 Dr Ashley’s 7 insights were: 



 
 We need to improve privacy in the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">surveillance economy</a>. Data breaches have eroded consumer trust in organizations that collect and store their personal data and users urgently need to regain control. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">Decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;enables selective disclosure around digital proof of identity, and we’re already seeing rapid uptake of this in government uses such as licenses and everyday applications such as gym memberships. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">Verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;(VCs) have quickly become the “killer feature” of DI because they’re making selective disclosure of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">PII</a>&nbsp;possible and will drive DI’s&nbsp;ubiquity across the internet in the next decade.&nbsp; 



 The rise and rise of VCs has led to the widespread need for the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>, a massive growth area. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;is the anchor of&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in decentralized systems, and therefore DI is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp; 



 DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">standards</a>&nbsp;are rapidly evolving to drive interoperability of DI solutions across the internet.&nbsp;

<p>#BendNotBreak</p><p>This is the final blog in a 4-part series where we have been exploring the emerging work that we are undertaking in partnership with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a>. The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. We are heartened by the response that this blog series has generated so far and we will incorporate the insights into our future thinking and work. If you have any thoughts or reflections on this final blog (or on blogs <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">one</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36">two</a> or <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">three</a>) then please share them to progress this critical just transition conversation.</p> Part 4 (of 4): Network building: strategies to support and amplify the network of innovative organisations operating within Europe’s built environment  Boldly inviting a more regenerative and inclusive future to be discovered <blockquote>“It is exceptionally easy to become adjusted to catastrophe” — Adrienne&nbsp;Buller</blockquote><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">Blog 3</a> of this series, we highlighted some inspiring examples of actors innovating in the social and ecological spaces of Europe’s transition. These sparks of fierce hope must be celebrated and bolstered, but we must also challenge ourselves to recognise and lean into the strategic gaps between them. If we want to move from lifeboats and beautiful exceptions to enduring social and spatial justice, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.</p>Mapping the density of alternative housing and land models in&nbsp;Europe<p>The gaps and inadequacies in the more intangible aspects of our political economy, have been surfacing with increasing frequency across many aspects of our work. Despite this initiative being focused on the specific context of Europe’s built environment, some institutional and social intelligence gaps are pervasive across all sectors. In our recent conversations we have started to think about these insufficiencies in terms of three strategic themes, as summarised below:</p><p>(1) A new cultural&nbsp;logic</p><p>In our view the current cultural logic for how we share and use assets and spaces in our cities is outdated and unjust. In the future, how can we think about creating a new Use Justice Economy, to unlock fundamentally different ways of coexisting in Europe’s built environment? The melting pot of our physical constraints and social thermodynamics is forging a new political landscape that we are ill equipped to navigate. We must therefore begin constructing the inclusive, everyday politics for a post-abundant yet just society. This will require designing and testing new generative public engagement processes, together with facilitating the R&amp;D that will be needed to support and evolve&nbsp;them.</p><p>(2) An interconnected understanding of civic&nbsp;value</p><p>The dominant economic theory of value is stifling appropriate adaptation and mitigation responses. Outdated accounting frameworks are no longer capable of capturing and presenting the intangible value of buildings and land (for example, the reduced levels of depression that are associated with co-housing models). They also ignore many of the associated risks and liabilities (such as the negative shared impacts on air quality of privately owned buildings continuing to be heated using fossil fuels). In reality, there are entire classes of assets that are missing from our investment and scenario plans; why for example are intangible public assets like preventative health still considered as a cost rather than an investment in governmental budgets? It is becoming apparent that the accounting, legal and investment frameworks of a just future are missing, whilst the existing versions will become increasingly obsolete as the constraint pressures escalate.</p><p>(3) Next generation institutions</p><p>As we have been writing these blogs a constant nagging question is the yes but…..How will many of the pathways we are suggesting be given the legitimacy and teeth to be impactful at the city, regional or country level? There is a clear need for an entire suite of next generation institutions; agile, multidisciplinary governance and decision-making vehicles, capable of building strategies and responses for the years of transition and beyond. Examples might include city land trusts (to collectively own and regulate the real estate prices), public-city banks (to receive and allocate funding on behalf of residents) or carbon and material city guardians (to measure and regulate the use of limited resources).</p> People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw&nbsp;stones <p>It is very easy to sit behind a screen, talking and writing about the opportunities and challenges of a just transition. We might leave our comfort zone at times, sharing our models for feedback and inviting others to critique and improve our thinking, but the consequences of our actions are limited. Yet what would our response be if we were actually held to account? If Dark Matter Labs was somehow granted carte blanche over EU decision making for a day, what policies or interventions would we introduce? Let’s suppose we had a large endowment; how would we allocate those funds and why? Or, if we were asked to play an orchestration role in coordinating the transition landscape, how would we&nbsp;proceed?</p><p>In reality, any strategy is restricted by the quality of the inputs that shape it. If we had the required resources and authority, we would therefore seek to rapidly increase the number and diversity of people who are able to interact with the problem space. Many people have an intuition of what could and probably should be happening, but having the time or resources to engage deeply with such ideas is a privilege reserved for the minority. We are well aware that writing blogs such as this one, is a well-intentioned yet wholly inadequate contribution towards democratising the response dialogues. In our view, socialising the constraints and implied response strategies, together with actively engaging citizens from across Europe in their design, is an absolute priority. If we had the agency we would co-create a playbook for the future, a kind of break glass in case of emergency set of policies, designed by the citizens of Europe for our shared&nbsp;futures.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@isawred?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">iSawRed</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> The evolving funding landscape: opening a space for collaborative dialogue <p>From a funding standpoint, our instinct is that any collectively intelligent strategic response could (and in fact should) include varied and co-existing approaches. If we start from a constraints frame and fan out towards an ecosystem of desired outcomes, there is the potential to build coherence across the system without limiting the scope of imaginative possibility. It seems likely that there are areas of interest, geographical points of focus, or thematic investments that can be interwoven to support the overall transition. Or, perhaps by collating narratives, ideas, case studies and conversations we could encourage new connections to form that are beyond our current perception. It feels important that we move beyond conversations about distributed power, to open space for aspects such as the equity and inclusivity of who is included (and / or centred). In our experience, there is a delicate balance between the desire to be regenerative by design and the constrictive arrogance that can be contained within that aspiration. This is an interesting point of tension that we aim to respect without surrendering our agency or accountability.</p><p>Encouragingly, we have recently observed an increasing appetite amongst funders to discuss and coordinate their strategies. This is an exciting and emerging area of our wider work and is explored in depth in our BeyondTheRules publications (for example in this <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/grantmaking-beyondtherules-8dfc752df3da">grantmaking provocation)</a>. At this point however, it is important to acknowledge that all the funders we interact with, already have deeply thoughtful and considered strategies in place. The following four groupings are therefore solely offered as prompts for discussion and reflection:</p><p>(1) Horizontal knowledge networks</p><p>How can we think about building the deep expertise needed to reimagine core components of the built environment? An example would be Community Land Trusts which have the potential to fundamentally change the unjust economic logic of land speculation. Encouragingly, the <a href="https://www.clteurope.org/">European CLT Network</a> will launch in June 2023 (with support from <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> and <a href="https://world-habitat.org/">World Habitat</a>) with the aim of scaling and deepening the impact of the CLT model across Europe. Despite this potential many challenges remain; for example, what kind of legislative changes will be needed across different geographies to support their wider uptake? How can we ensure they are not co-opted or exploited in the future? Will we need new accounting methodologies to represent their holistic&nbsp;value?</p><p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/">Young Foundation</a> partnered with the <a href="https://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/">Community Land Trust Network</a> to bring together a group of researchers, to highlight barriers and opportunities in relation to diversity and inclusion in the CLT movement¹. A similar idea would be to analyse international best practice to identify existing and potential future pathway gaps. For example, a strong collaboration might be between the <a href="https://groundedsolutions.org/strengthening-neighborhoods/community-land-trusts">Grounded Solutions Network in the US</a>, <a href="https://www.communitylandscotland.org.uk/">Community Land Scotland</a> and a university research&nbsp;team.</p><p>(2) Moving from new economic demonstrators to full system demonstrators</p><p>System demonstrators intersect at multiple levels of the system; from mapping available land to designing new forms of finance or advocacy, thus shifting the boundaries of political possibility. If we think about eliminating vacant space in cities, what kind of actors would be needed to create viable operational models? How could they be replicated (or adapted) for varied geographies and contexts? How can we ensure robust knowledge sharing is built into their blueprint?</p><p>We conceive a system demonstrator to represent four intersecting elements:</p>  The physical, tangible demonstration of a new way of organising. For example, innovative multipurpose space use in a central district;  The system innovations that service it, such as holistic (multi-value) business plans and care agreements (as opposed to transactional contracts);  The market making infrastructure that will enable scaling (e.g.<a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/publications/public-common-partnerships-building-new-circuits-of-collective-ownership"> public-commons institutions</a> or inclusive planning&nbsp;laws);  The cultural conversations that are necessary to expand the Overton window and shift market dynamics.  <p>The coordination of these different threads is nuanced and complex. The space for creative divergence needs to be balanced with supportive, committed orchestration to drive the overall mission forwards. This is a critical area of collective capability which we believe will only be realised via deeply rooted place-based experimentation, combined with the development of technical tools and institutional reforms. Laudes currently supports some specific demonstrator projects, for example the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-collaborate-with-laudes-foundation-to-advance-madrid-and-milan-sustainable-urban-approach-across-europe-2/">EU Cinco collaboration</a> which is showcasing projects for bio based and circular construction in Madrid and Milan. In the future, could we think about connecting demonstrators relating to different scales and contexts, to systemically amplify alternative visions and cultural attractors?</p><p>(3) Coordination / orchestration hubs</p><p>There is a vital requirement for actors who can play system facilitation roles in the built environment. Developing system capabilities is deep, complex work (with infinite unfolding directions and feedback loops) and thus requires reimagining our networks of governance. How can we begin designing and testing new types of highly agile institutions and equitable decision-making processes for this sector? For example, could cities with strong administrative innovation capacity (e.g. <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/innovation/">Amsterdam’s Innovation Unit</a> or <a href="https://www.stadtwohnen-chemnitz.de/arbeitsbereiche/">Chemnitz</a> in Germany) be facilitated to support hubs in emerging locations (e.g. <a href="https://ekyl.ee/en/">EKUL</a> in Estonia or <a href="https://restartukraine.io/">Restart Ukraine</a>)? Similar existing examples are the <a href="https://urbact.eu/who-we-are">EU EUBACT</a> that supports cities to coordinate and share knowledge and the <a href="https://www.alt-bau.eu/en/">ALT/BAU Transfer Network</a> that connects cities to activate unused and decaying housing&nbsp;stock.</p><p>(4) Distributed communities of practice and geographical hubs</p><p>Is there an opportunity to focus on core organisations who are centred on the inclusivity of ownership (e.g., CLTs, cooperative housing, other shared equity models) and support them to make the pathways for their operations (e.g, materials, governance, legals) and scaling (e.g, publicity, finance, policy) both more inclusive and regenerative? An example could be to look at the inclusivity of materials used in retrofitting and whether nature-based solutions could (a) improve the outcomes for low income groups in hot countries by reducing the costs of cooling (b) make the buildings more sustainable through carbon capture. Or, a cooperative housing network such as <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a> could potentially collaborate with an organisation in the same region (such as <a href="https://fundacjabrda.org/en/">Brda </a>in Poland) to improve the equitable and regenerative elements of their material procurement processes. In some cases this network could be enabled across contexts as a type of distributed community of practice. In others, a geographical capability hub might be more effective. In both cases the goal would be to strengthen or create the support pathways needed, for inclusive and regenerative scaling of the anchor&nbsp;model.</p><p>Alternatively, organisations who are creating these pathways could be supported individually, on the assumption that they will be needed for the future development and scaling of any collaborative housing models (including those that do not exist yet). These foundational pathway organisations could be conceptually clustered by theme; for example to address specific constraints (e.g. dematerialisation), or by leverage points in the system such as inclusive financing models.</p>Tracing potential networks of coherent collaboration The end comes before the beginning and the beginning comes after the&nbsp;end <p>At times during this project, looking for organisations who are working at the intersection of economic, ownership and governance issues, whilst concurrently striving for social inclusiveness and a regenerative future for Europe’s built environment, has felt like looking for a needle in a haystack. This is strangely reassuring! If the responses needed were clear and neatly packaged, we would most likely have missed the point. We are living through a complex, epoch-making moment that demands a planetary level of collective intelligence. In many respects, our understanding of the scale of Europe’s just transition challenge is only beginning to crystallise as we conclude this 4-part blog&nbsp;series.</p><p>We are grateful and honoured to be part of this community and look forward to continuing the conversation. Some immediate steps to move this work forwards are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  We will write a follow-up blog to respond to challenges, thoughts and suggestions that we have received in response to this initial blog&nbsp;series;  If you have an innovative model or idea that requires funding to scale or develop, then Laudes invite you to contact Laudes Foundation via this <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/contact">contact page</a> and address the enquiry to Alice Haugh in the Built Environment team;  Laudes is supporting a group of organisations to develop a collective theory of change to scale up the principles of collaborative housing across Europe: <a href="https://sostrecivic.coop/">Sostre Civic</a>, <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a>, <a href="https://www.urbamonde.org/?lang=en">UrbaMonde</a> and <a href="https://urbanlabtorino.it/projects/netco/?lang=en">NETCO</a>. This initiative is led by <a href="https://www.odsupport.eu/">ODS</a> and they will be attending the <a href="https://socialhousingfestival.eu/">International Social Housing Festival in Barcelona</a> (7–9th June) and <a href="https://urban-future.org/">Urban Future Festival in Stuttgart</a> (21–23rd of June). If this area of innovation appeals to you and is geographically practical then it could be a good opportunity to connect to this new&nbsp;network.  <p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs), Aleksander Nowak (Aleks@darkmatterlabs), Vlad Afanasiev (vlad@darkmatterlabs) and Indy Johar (indy@darkmatterlabs).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/peer-research-network/projects/diversity-and-inclusion-in-community-land-trusts/">https://www.youngfoundation.org/peer-research-network/projects/diversity-and-inclusion-in-community-land-trusts/</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-part-4-89c7683bd2c7">Laudes x Dark Matter Labs: A just transition of Europe’s built environment (Part 4)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Have you been involved with acquiring a software product for your company? If you have, you know that finding and purchasing a solution that meets your specific enterprise needs can be a challenging process. We understand the difficulty that buyers face when trying to match vendor capabilities with business requirements. After reviewing multiple vendor solutions, product web pages, and data sheets, they all start to sound the same. And videos often focus more on the muzak and narration than on educating the viewer on a specific point. Free trial accounts provide rudimentary access to the product that does not give the user the ability to explore more complex use cases.</p>

 Better Understanding Leads to Better Decisions 

<p>Today we introduce the ForgeRock Experience Center. The Experience Center provides an interactive environment that lets users and administrators get a more immersive experience with the various aspects of our Platform, right from the website. Each experience leads the user through an educational journey that combines hands-on interaction with the ForgeRock user interface, including contextual explanations using text and video.</p>

    
<p>The ForgeRock Experience Center debuts with a library of experiences to illustrate important capabilities of the ForgeRock platform:</p>

<p>We are excited to announce the availability of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/">Kubernetes version 1.27</a> for your clusters that are running in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</a>. This is our 22nd release of Kubernetes. With our Kubernetes service, you can easily <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update">upgrade your clusters</a> without the need for deep Kubernetes knowledge. When you deploy new clusters, the default Kubernetes version remains 1.25 (soon to be 1.26); you can also choose to immediately deploy version 1.27. Learn more about deploying clusters <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers/cs_tutorials.html">here</a>.</p>



 Kubernetes version 1.27 



<p>In addition to all the great <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/">Kubernetes features provided in this release</a>, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service version 1.27 also includes numerous component updates. See the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#cs_versions_available">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service version 1.27 changelog</a> for details.</p>



 Kubernetes support and updates 



<p>IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service now supports the latest versions of Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.27. Clusters that are running Kubernetes version 1.23 or earlier are <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#release_lifecycle">unsupported</a>.&nbsp;Clusters running version 1.24 are now <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#release_lifecycle">deprecated</a> with <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#cs_versions_available">end of support tentatively scheduled for September 6, 2023</a>.

 We sit down with Martin Lycka, SVP for American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain to discuss Brazil’s upcoming gaming regulations, advice for operators, and the importance of integrity in the emerging LATAM market.&nbsp; 



 



 There is a great disparity in global gambling regulations, in terms of scope and severity, how do you compare the European regulatory landscape with emerging markets like LATAM?&nbsp; 



<p>Europe, at the risk of stating the obvious, is way ahead Latin America (LATAM) in terms of gambling regulation. However, despite a few false dawns, Brazil is firmly on the path to regulating sports betting in a near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Columbia is a great example of a very successful LATAM regulatory regime, which has drawn a lot of inspiration from gaming regulation in Spain. I think this is partly because of similarities in language and culture. It’s also worth bearing in mind that although individual jurisdictions are different and follow different kinds of sports and markets, we are talking about sports betting, so basic product mechanics will always be the same to reflect requirements in regulation.&nbsp;</p>



 Which other LATAM countries are currently in the process of regulating the industry?&nbsp; 



<p>Most Latin American countries have already regulated the land-based sector in one way or another, so it really comes down to regulating their online space. Some Argentinian provinces have regulated online gambling, and, like Canada, appear to be taking it province by province. Peru and Chile are also looking into potentially regulating online gambling and I’m hopeful it will happen in the foreseeable future, but as they’re both facing a political crisis, this is unlikely to happen any time soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Peru passed legislation that would permit the regulation of the online gambling sector last year, recent riots have again stalled any developments. In Chile, President Gabriel Boric has stated that he’s keen on revamping the Chilean constitution, but that process failed, and as a result, he’s in the process of picking up the pieces and pondering what to do next.</p>

 Brazil is on the cusp of regulation – when is Brazil’s gaming regulation likely to be passed?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The regulation will go to the Congress as a legislative bill, with constitutional urgency. This means that the Congress will have to debate and vote on it in the next 3-6 months. So, if the bill is approved, it’s likely the regulated market will launch in early 2024. As the bill is at an extremely high level, it authorizes the authorities to kick off the licensing process. There will be an uncapped number of licenses, an open licensing system, which provides for additional taxation measures. Regulation is likely to cover the process of instituting licensing, payment processing, and the requirement for internet service providers to block the internet connection for operators who choose not to become regulated.&nbsp;</p>



 What is your advice to operators based in, or targeting the Brazilian market? How should they prepare for upcoming regulation? 



<p>It should by no means come as a surprise. Brazilian sports betting regulations have been debated since 2018, when the government was authorized by Congress to regulate sports betting. My advice to operators is to keep a close eye on proceedings and start getting themselves ready. In the absence of the final iterations of regulations, however, it’s still advisable to exercise caution until regulations are passed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s very likely that the regulation will require operators to incorporate an entity in Brazil. I would not expect an obligation to locate the actual premises on the ground, as that could effectively kill the industry, but operators should be prepared to provide the Brazilian authorities with access to the data of Brazilian customers in one way or another. This could be remote, or by means of having a data server on the ground. Regarding customer verification, I believe this will be linked to their CPF identification number (a tax number attributed by the Brazilian Federal Revenue to Brazilians and foreigners who pay taxes in Brazil). There is also likely to be a focus on sports integrity, and on responsible gambling, not only because of recent match-fixing scandals that have <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivjvb-2_z-AhUUa8AKHfvsCo0QxfQBKAB6BAgHEAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2023%2F05%2F11%2Ffootball%2Fbrazil-soccer-match-fixing-investigation-spt-intl%2Findex.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ChG0c4DUmxIfpfi26tQr9">marred Brazilian football</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government and regulator have reviewed existing regulations in other countries, so it’s also likely to take inspiration from those.&nbsp;</p>



 There’s a lot of talk about Responsible Gambling in the<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/"> UK government’s gambling white paper</a>, and it’s likely to feature heavily in Brazilian regulations. What does Responsible Gambling mean to you? How do you interpret it?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gambling is critical to the long-term sustainability of this industry. I’ve been personally working very closely with the regulator on responsible gambling standards and fully in intend to continue to do so. When the Brazilian market is finally regulated, that will provide both the operators and authorities with tools to more efficiently address the kinds of match-fixing scandals that we have seen recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The onus is on us as an industry to protect our customers, and, of course, help our customers to help themselves. That still gets sort of underestimated. If customers are beyond the point of being able to do that, that’s where we need to step up even more. The more individual care we can provide problem gamblers the better. Because what works for one person may not work for the other. Just like on the consumer side or promotional side of things: what may not be of interest to you, may be of interest to someone else, and vice-versa. This underscores the need to individualize and personalize care. That’s what I would love to see in the years to come throughout Latin America.&nbsp;</p>



 In a tangible sense, what would these kinds of measures look like? 



<p>In my view, it’s a combination of three critical pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Education. We need to find even more efficient ways of educating everyone involved, which goes well beyond our customers. It’s the public at large, including key decision makers, which is why Entain has launched programs here in the States (and in other countries), with the likes of the NFL, MLS, and most recently with the NHL alumni. I’ve also worked with retired athletes such as Charles Oakley and Jayson Williams to serve as responsible gambling ambassadors to convey even more efficient messages about responsible gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prevention. We need to provide our customers with tools to help themselves, and if they cannot do that anymore, we need to step in, take over control of the gambling platform – we call them interceptors. Or even just by giving customers a ring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third pillar is to put customers on a firm path toward healing; a firm treatment path. Again, the onus is on us, the industry.&nbsp;</p>

 Regarding the Canadian gaming sector, do you think it’s only a matter of time before other provinces follow Ontario and open the market to private operators?&nbsp; 



<p>Yes, it is the short answer to that, I expect Alberta to follow suit very soon, and then British Columbia, but I’m not going to speculate as to the timetable. I think if other provinces choose to go down the Ontario route, it would be the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">most sensible thing to do</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why do you think some countries, for example Canada and Argentina, favor such a province-by-province approach to implementing nationwide regulations?&nbsp; 



<p>It’s a constitutional and legacy issue in both instances. In Canada, for example, back in 85 or 86, the federal government devolved competencies to regulate all forms of gambling, not just online gambling, to individual provinces. That is the setup, which is like the US. New Jersey, where I am based, recently won a very hard-fought for victory to regulate sports betting and online gaming, and it’s the same in Canada.</p>

<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today, we’ll hear some new ideas about open finance, open banking and definitely a bit more.</p>
<p>For that, we have our special guest today who is Michelle Beyo. She is the CEO and Founder of FINAVATOR, an award-winning payments and future of finance consultancy. She’s also a strategic adviser to FinTech’s, a Money 20/20 Rise Up alumni, a Global Council Member of Women in Payments, the Membership Chair at Canadian Prepaid Providers Organisation, a Payment Advisor at the National Crowdfunding and FinTech Association of Canada and a Board Member at Open Banking Initiative Canada.</p>
<p>Michelle started for FINAVATOR as she is passionate about payments and financial inclusion. She has 20 years of extensive industry experience, driving innovation across the retail and payments industry. Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>Michelle Beyo: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. I’m really happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Michelle: Happy to be here as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, Michelle, let’s talk about digital identity. I want to start hearing a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I’m happy to share a little bit. I actually spent 20 years in the corporate space. Six years in telco and eight years in online shopping affiliate marketing. Ran Alaska, Lufthansa, Delta, United online shopping mall platforms. I really got to understand the relationship between customer and loyalty infrastructure.</p>
<p>And then I moved into the payment space. Working for the largest prepaid company globally, called InComm, out of their international office for 30 countries. And was running sales and marketing, launched their B2B division, got to see what was happening in innovation across these 30 other countries, including Singapore, Australia, UK. Helped launch WeChat in North America at 711 through the Gift Card rail, QR payment system. And truly realised – a little fearful that my kids were going to end up with Asian banking. Due to the advancements, and how far beyond where we are in North America, that Asia basically was from a banking infrastructure set in 2017.</p>
<p>And I took a leap into the startup world focused on blockchain digital identity at a startup as a Chief Client Officer in 2018. And after a year with them and helping with Bahama digital ID infrastructure and helping consent on blockchain. I actually won Money 20/20 Rise Up. Where they picked out of 500 women, 30 women to come into the Vegas largest payments conference in the world and have a separate accelerated track.</p>
<p>And as soon as I found out that I had won one of this coveted 30 spots, I quit my job at the startup and started FINAVATOR. Which is actually now four years ago in July. And starting this consultancy, did not have any consultancy experience. But did have all of my background, which I felt was touching the future of finance from telco infrastructure to affiliate marketing, online shopping. The move to digital prepaid payment infrastructures, how they were backing all new challenger bank infrastructure, BaaS infrastructure, and then digital ID.</p>
<p>So FINAVATOR truly became my ability to try and help banks, credit unions, FinTechs and corporations move to the future of finance. And really have enjoyed my journey out on my own.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely quite interesting, because you have been involved in several industries that are pretty different itself. So many are, yeah, oriented to interacting with the customer. So, understanding how the customer – what the customer needs, etc. And then just in the last year, you came to identity. So now you have this amazing experience and you’re doing your own consultancy.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, you have been working on a lot of payments and that is leading you to the future of finance. So, the topics we’d like to start addressing today are open banking and open finance. So, if you can give us what are these two terms in a nutshell, what would you say?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. I think, at its simplest point – open banking, which started in the UK in 2017. Is a safe and secure way to share data in an ecosystem. So, thinking of back to my telco days, when I started. You would sign up to one provider for three years, and you couldn’t leave. If you left, there was a penalty, and your number was owned by that telco. So, if you went to a different telco because they had a better service, you’d basically lose your identity, which was your phone number. And have to send an email to all of your friends with your new number. And they would have to reprogram your phone number in their phones.</p>
<p>There was something called Open Telco. Or at least number portability, that was mandated in Canada and many other countries around 2015. And this allowed to empower the consumer to officially own their phone number. So, if I left one telco to go to another, I didn’t have to lose my identity, which I had built for, let’s say, 10 years. As this phone number represents myself. So, I was able to port it to a competitor to get better service.</p>
<p>So, to me, open banking is that same concept of having a safe and secure way to port my data. From one bank to another bank, from one bank to a FinTech, from a bank to a wealth advisor. So really just giving me the freedom that – the information that is mine, that defines me, can be utilised to help me get a better loan. Help me get a better rate, help me get the service that is customised to myself. Based on the data that happens to live with my current bank.</p>
<p>So open banking was a regulated movement that started in the UK to force the CMA 9, which is the nine biggest banks in the UK, to create an API that was standardised. To allow for safe and secure data sharing, that was all based on consumer consent. As well as create competition, by allowing FinTechs or third-party providers to hit a certain bar of the certification to be allowed in the system.</p>
<p>So, let’s say Revolut. If you were a Lloyds customer, and you wanted to go to Revolut. And you wanted Revolut to have these five pieces of data to offer you a different product that maybe had better pricing. You were able to do that through consent through the Revolut app. And that data was then able to safely port from Lloyds to Revolut.</p>
<p>And the biggest point, I think on all of this is – in open banking there is a right to delete your data. So that data can then be deleted and to me, this is creating less data in the world. And having more control over it as a consumer. As well as empowering new services, new offerings, new companies to help serve the underserved and help serve the current market in a better, more efficient way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And I like your analogy. You started talking analogy also in telecommunication in the mobile, consumer mobile networks. The mobile number portability, which is something I think at this point, I’m not sure it’s everywhere in the world. But I think it’s by large in many countries, it’s available and it’s something that today we take for granted. But it was very painful, not long ago, it was very painful as you have described.</p>
<p>So just the idea of having a similar easiness in translated to the to the banks sounds like a dream for the ones who still have not experienced. I have not experienced something like that yet. Yeah, so definitely it sounds like a great thing to keep it spreading. And you have summarised saying that this open banking is in a nutshell is securely sharing data of the consumers. So, one consumer can move from one bank to another, or even a FinTech as you mentioned so.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, and I think the evolution of that is open finance. Which I would say is a hot topic in today’s market. The UK is moving to PSD 3, which is bringing them to open finance. Australia started with open data as a concept through a Consumer Data Right for all citizens across five industries. Which I think is the most concise vision across all countries. So, they started with open banking, moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, and then they’re going to land in open data. And it’s all centred around a Consumer Data Right across all data.</p>
<p>Very empowering vision coming out of Australia, that many countries are just starting with open finance. Turkey, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, just moved to open finance. So just to describe it – it really is, instead of just being banking, FinTech, third-party payments data or bank account data. It’s broadening the spectrum to the insurance, wealth, mortgages. Kind of more of a holistic view of anything that touches your finances. So, it’s really expanding to allow you to port your data from multiple different aspects of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, the key here in open finance is that you do similar – let’s say portability. We use it, we use the same word between different services. Not necessarily financial services, but as you said, that touch some financial data, correct?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yes. So if you want to use some data from your Lloyds account to help you get a faster, cheaper, better mortgage that’s more customised to you. Maybe that mortgage provider is not a bank, but they’re a licensed mortgage provider that has certified in the system. Then you’d be able to facilitate that data sharing, same example to a wealth provider or an insurance provider.</p>
<p>Oscar: Alright. And besides that, benefits of the portability that we can, I can even visualise on my mind. What are the other benefits that there are for both the consumers and for businesses?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I would say one of the biggest ones is – when you think of FinTechs trying to get certain aspects of data. And not having to get data they don’t need – so only getting the five pieces of data, with clear consent from the customer. And the customer not having to screen scrape this data out of their account without their knowledge.</p>
<p>So, a lot of screen scraping issues are when open banking first came to fruition in the UK. It’s largely because 1 million UK citizens were screen scraping. Which is a service that is being utilised where it looks like you’re logging into your bank. You’re putting in your passcode, and then it’s giving access to that FinTech to look at your overarching account and scrape the whole data. To only grab the five pieces they need to push it into the system.</p>
<p>So, what this does is [A] it’s unsecure. [B] the customer has no idea they’re breaching their bank agreement by using the service. And then the FinTech ends up with all this data that they don’t need, or want. Have to store it safely and securely, when they only needed the five pieces.</p>
<p>So, when you get to an open banking system, they request the five pieces, they get the five pieces in a safe, secure type of API. And then, therefore, they’re able to delete those five pieces of data, because the way that it was coded into the system, if so requested by the customer. So, it’s a data management system, all based on consent.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds pretty good absolutely. Because imagine that all my data that is on my bank is passed to the – let’s say insurance. And then the insurance has the duty to delete whatever they don’t need as well, sounds terrible. Because you know, the less data that is transferred, the less data that is stored somewhere, the lower the risk of so many data breaches that are happening nowadays.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, on the data breach point, I always like to bring up unfortunately Marriott because they had 7.1 million data breach occurrences at one time, and it was an internal issue. They were like layering in some accounting, or loyalty system and it was an internal data breach. And this was back I think in 2018. They didn’t compensate any of the users. But think about anytime you check into a hotel. At this point, they asked for your driver’s license or your passport, plus your credit card. The amount of data a hotel has on you is pretty concerning, considering they don’t have the data security standards that you would have at a bank.</p>
<p>So, if we can get to a world – getting to your digital identity questions. Where a QR check in doesn’t actually have them store any of my data, but just validate I am who I say I am. So that they don’t need to actually hold my actual passport image with all of my sensitive data. In a non-secure, I don’t want to say non-secure, but not highly secure infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Another good example, obviously, the hotels. They will benefit, both the businesses and the consumers would benefit with open finance. And yes, I start – while you explain this idea, I was, OK, some of the data passes from one, let’s say from the bank to the insurance company. But just a minimum should be passing, so that – also thinking from the identity point of view. I’m imagining the federation, right? So, at this point, what is on your view the role of identity on this paradigm that you just described?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think it’s quite paramount as a base layer to most systems. Because if you can authenticate you are who you say you are, that’s the most important part of any one transaction. Especially a transaction that has to do with your data or has to do with your finances. So, I think it’s quite crucial that we find a way that authenticates ourselves. Especially with AI, and all of this machine learning infrastructure, cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that we are the only entity that is Michelle Beyo and that I can then surely authenticate myself? Before I do a data share from one bank to the other, or before I do a financial transaction. And we’re going to have to layer up from our six-digit code being sent to a phone text to authenticate yourself. As we move forward in the future of finance. So, I think digital identity is crucial. And has to be put into a system, in a way that ensures that there’s only one identity for any one person.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. There has to be some level of strong authentication, that that is a must. And as you have mentioned a bit earlier also, always with a consent, inevitably, data sharing transactions.</p>
<p>Now, moving into what are the standards to also understand – without going into too much detail. You mentioned that this started in UK and in UK, there more implementations. This is really happening in real, but what are the main standards that are making this possible? Or are going to make this even more possible if we think of open finance?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So you know, what’s interesting is – as you look at the world at the moment, and you look at open banking, open finance. Not all countries have a digital identity infrastructure. So, what that does is makes the open banking infrastructure more complex, harder to authenticate. And I think even more than open banking –&nbsp; real-time rail infrastructure needs the authentication. Digital identity for any type of fraud reduction of authenticating you are who you say you are, and it’s going to an entity who is authenticated. So that we can remove the scams out of the system.</p>
<p>I’d say the best digital identity infrastructure is probably the Indian-based UPI. It was government issued; it was a mass amount of people. And it was done very early on, on a global scale. It’s not the exact model that probably should be utilised for other countries. But they have definitely – through their digital identity framework, have been able to even. There’s homeless people in India with QR codes and a bank account due to their digital identity infrastructure. And when you pass them in the streets or you pass a tiny shop selling something, they have QR-based payment infrastructure that is largely attached to their digital identity. Which creates a more financial inclusive infrastructure.</p>
<p>In Australia, they have a digital identity framework but it’s not as widespread to the same degree as India. The UK is still working on their digital identity infrastructure. So not every country has lined up, open banking, digital identity and real-time rail. But these are three very crucial aspects to the future of finance because the authentication from digital ID is a safety point. The real-time rail is the fast and secure movement of the funds. And the open banking is the safe, consent-driven data sharing aspect. So, once you have all three of them, you’re really setting yourself up to be facilitating the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned one term that maybe is not so familiar, at least for me, you mentioned real, real-time rail. What is that exactly?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, they’re real-time rail is an instant payment system, sometimes called that. And the first one ever created was in Switzerland, actually, in 1989, 66 countries have faster payment systems. The UK launched quite a long time ago. But the US just launched their FedNow, that is what it’s called in the US. Which is their real-time instant payment rail, just this year. And Canada hasn’t launched theirs just yet. So, there’s many countries who have this payment infrastructure. When you look at the US last year, or Canada, still, it takes three days, three to five days for bank payments to clear and that’s just the older infrastructure of payment settlement.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK. Perfect. Yes, indeed, you have emphasised that all these components needed in, of course, the authentic the national digital identification is a key point. You are correct, not many countries in the world have something, I will say, suitable enough for doing this open finance. I was – in terms also of authentication that reminded me that, for instance, the FinTechs has been for a while. And not long ago the authentication was just username and password, nothing else. So, of course, now, most of the FinTechs have something better than that. But yeah, I can see something that it takes time. All this component takes time to come together to make possible some of these use cases.</p>
<p>So, if you can tell us some of these success stories, now seeing from the perspective of use cases. Let’s say success stories from, if you can, from different part of the world also to illustrate it better.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, so if we’re talking digital identity, I think Scandinavia has done probably one of the best jobs. I think Estonia was one of the first. The other really crucial part of digital identity is you can’t have CBDC, or digital currency in a very safe and secure way without a digital identity framework. So, I think there’s some great examples down that front.</p>
<p>When we’re talking open finance, open banking, the countries I’m most impressed by, obviously, is Australia. They are a country that has five major banks. They are kind of an oligopoly in the sense that those five banks hold quite a bit of the customer base. But they took an initiative past open banking, past open finance, to embed a consumer data rights to every citizen across five different industries with a roadmap to start with open banking. Moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, land with open data, which is really future proofing their country, for the future of the ecosystem. A digital ecosystem, which every business is now turning into a digital business.</p>
<p>So, they’re going to have a really great base layer of understanding that the customer owns the data, the customer is able to port the data, and the customer is able to delete the data. So, by creating a data right infrastructure, and then porting it across multiple industries. I think they’re going to have incredible innovation and eyes are definitely on them as they’re enabling this ecosystem. That really is kind of the future of any one country’s vision of how do you enable digitisation of an economy.</p>
<p>The other country that I’m pretty impressed by is Brazil. In the sense that in the middle of the pandemic, they made their first move to open banking. They made a 12-month mandate that they were going to hit an open banking live ecosystem within 12 months. And open access to their Central Bank of Brazil. And therefore, by opening the access to registered TTPs, which are Third-Party Providers. Companies, like Pix, were able to create a FinTech that reduced the cost of sending money and took the underbanked, underserved in Brazil, and gave them a digital bank with faster, more affordable payments. And I don’t have the exact number. But I believe they’re past 7 million customers and doing billions of transactions on a daily basis. And I believe they reduced the cost something like by 40%, by being able to have direct access to the central bank and fall directly in line with the open banking system.</p>
<p>And after 12 months of being enabled to an open banking system, they immediately started working on an open finance system, and are launching that within 12 months. So, I think the alignment, the passion, and the execution out of the Brazilian market is pretty impressive. And just the pure enablement of new FinTechs that are more affordable services. And finding ways to serve the underbanked, underserved, they’ve done a phenomenal job.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds like that – it sounds definitely amazing. Among all these, well, existing use cases and what comes in the future for open banking and open finance, what are some potential privacy issues that you could tell us?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think every system has to be truly based in a liability model. This liability model has to be extremely clear to everybody within the system. There has to be protection on that liability model. And I think it’s just ensuring that the certification system that allows for third parties to come into the system is robust, is reviewed, that these parties that have been certified inclusive of banks are always looked at to ensure that they’re continued to be certified to have access to the system.</p>
<p>But I do foresee in the future that customers are going to choose to have some type of insurance on their data. That they so choose, just like you have insurance on your travel, or insurance on your health, like actual data privacy insurance.</p>
<p>Because – think of the Marriott issue, or gosh, there’s data breaches every day of the week, and none of the data breaches have to do with open banking, open finance, they’re internal data breaches or external data breaches, or hacks. That there’s no real repercussion to the customer, like, or to the actual party who has had this data breach. There might be a fine, but there’s no settlement to the actual end user whose data has been potentially put on the dark web or given to different parties.</p>
<p>There’s got to the point where, if we have enough of a safe and secure data sharing infrastructure, we should be able to insure our data and be safe and secure. And if it’s breached, have some type of offset. But we have to get to a much safer secure infrastructure of how data is shared in the first place.</p>
<p>So, I just truly see that open banking, open finance is creating the pipes for the water to go through and be able to turn them on and turn them off. And we just don’t have those pipes today in every country. And I think it’s just super important for the next layer of the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. Now, if we look at the future, what kind of use cases or what open finance can do in the future? Something that we are not seeing today.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So, in some countries, they started to enable dashboards, like holistic dashboards of your financial health. So, in these dashboards due to open banking, you would be able to see what your mortgage is. And then it would be able to AI predict what other offerings you should potentially layer in. To add to this product, or tell you that your current mortgage is not serving you. And that there’s three or four other offerings that would be a better mortgage based on your current finances, or the market. And then they’d be able to offer you three different companies that you might want to look into.</p>
<p>So, what this service can then do is you can actually put in your loans – this dashboard would be personalised, just for you to see kind of your financial health. It would help people have an ability to plan better, understand their finances a little bit better. From that perspective, I think it’s going to also create a whole bunch of things we haven’t even thought of, new services, new opportunities, and new ways to ensure you’re saving for your retirement.</p>
<p>Just kind of like round up did in the sense of, you know, if you’re paying for coffee, and it’s $1.50, rounding it up, or if it’s $1.40, rounding it up to $1.50 and then putting that in your pension plan or putting that into a robo-advisor. So that you’re earning money by saving without knowing it, or without feeling it, kind of perspective. So, I think just like the Internet has changed so many ways of what we are doing, and made our lives easier, in many ways. I do think that open finance, layered in with a digital identity can truly help us plan better, execute, have better offerings, save money, and really just be able to plan better for our future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sounds definitely a lot to expect for the future what open finance will bring us. So, Michelle, last question for you, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think what they should write is that innovation is driven by ideas. And that there’s an opportunity, especially now that the world has gone digital, to listen in to panels, topics that interests you, but you don’t have all the details on, similar to this podcast.</p>
<p>There’s panels happening in Australia on open finance, or Brazil, that you could listen into. You don’t actually have to travel to these conferences. But you can truly grasp the innovation that’s happening in other countries. And then think about how you can create something for your citizens, for your company. To pivot and start moving towards the future of finance, by learning from other countries who are already there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, I couldn’t agree more. And that’s really one, learning more about these interesting topics that are going to impact us mostly positively in today, in the future is also one reason why we invited you. So, thank you. Thanks a lot for being with us and this was really fascinating conversation with you, Michelle. If people would like to follow the conversation with you, or know more about what you’re doing, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, definitely to follow me on LinkedIn. Simply find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellebeyo/">Michelle Beyo</a>, follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/finavator/">FINAVATOR</a> on LinkedIn and <a href="http://www.michellebeyo.com/">Michelle Beyo</a> as well as reaching out to us on our website at <a href="http://www.finavator.com/">finavator.com</a>.</p>

<p>Saint Malo/La Ciotat/Munich, May 24, 2023 – <a href="https://www.cabinet-louis-reynaud.eu/index.php/clr-labs-3/">CLR Labs</a>, a European laboratory dedicated to the evaluation of biometric and security technologies, and <a href="https://www.lsti-certification.fr/en/">LSTI</a>, a conformity assessment body (CAB) specializing in cybersecurity and data protection, are pleased to officially launch their ISO/IEC 30107 conformity assessment scheme, which enables them to evaluate any product or service using biometric technologies. IDnow, one of the leading European identity proofing platform providers, obtains the first LSTI ISO/IEC 30107 certificate for its VideoIdent solution.</p>



<p>The first European certification scheme for biometric technologies</p>



<p>Published in 2017, the ISO/IEC 30107 standard defines safety measures and presentation attack tests on remote identity proofing systems, in order to protect them and prevent these attacks. The conformity certificate is issued by LSTI, based on CLR Labs’ evaluation work – &nbsp;which involves both presentation attacks and biometric data injection tests, such as facial recognition attacks based on deep-fake technology. Until now, the only certification scheme available was from the United States. In Europe, only compliance projects have been carried out so far.</p>



<p>Therefore, this collaborative initiative is unique in Europe, as it defines a guaranteed level of performance assessment of presentation attack detection given by biometric technologies, acknowledged by the cyber industry. </p>



<p>A partnership between two major names from the cyber assessment and evaluation industry</p>



<p>Together, LSTI and CLR Labs designed a common assessment scheme which can be applied to multiple products and services, such as enrolment stations or kits, border automatic doors, biometric readers, entry-exit systems, digital wallets, Trust Service Providers, and any other biometric tech products.</p>



<p>This conformity assessment scheme allows the European cyber ecosystem to acquire the necessary capabilities to evaluate and certify biometric products including presentation attack detection, with a made in Europe label, thus ensuring the promotion of European excellence in cybersecurity.</p>



<p>The first product certified ISO/IEC 30107 according to this scheme</p>



<p>In this European framework, it is the leading identity proofing platform provider IDnow, who becomes the first company to obtain an ISO/IEC 30107 certificate for its VideoIdent product. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">IDnow VideoIdent is an expert-assisted video identity verification product</a> that is facilitated by trained agents in conjunction with backend AI controls. </p>



<p>The VideoIdent process validates the user’s face biometrics and performs liveness checks to detect and prevent presentation attacks. The ISO 30107 evaluation certifies that IDnow VideoIdent meets such strict requirements on biometric identification. LSTI has assessed the level of VideoIdent as “substantial”.</p>

<p>“This certificate is the result of the successful partnership between CLR Labs and LSTI, but also of the amazing conformity upgrade work done by IDnow on their product VideoIdent”, says Armelle Trotin, CEO of LSTI group.</p>



<p>“We were thrilled when we saw the first certificate emitted by LSTI, as building an ISO/IEC 30107 conformity certification scheme in Europe was one of our goals since the creation of our lab”, declares Stéfane Mouille, CLR Labs Director.</p>



<p>“We are excited to have received the certification for the international ISO/IEC 30107 standard. With the support of LSTI and CLR, we were able to successfully test the strength of our VideoIdent presentation attack detection during the biometric capture step of the remote identity verification process. This certification raises the bar for our fraud prevention measures even further and marks an important step for our company in becoming the leading digital identity provider in Europe,” says Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow.</p>

  The EU’s new MiCA regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer losses, representing a major shift towards increased protection and transparency in the&nbsp;sector.  MiCA regulation introduces significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges while promising enhanced user protection, potentially boosting confidence and cryptocurrency adoption.  The MiCA regulation could set a global precedent for cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing the delicate balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation in the rapidly advancing field of cryptocurrencies.  <p>Europe’s ascent as the “World’s biggest cryptocurrency economy” is underscored by several telling statistics. In 2020 alone, the continent <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/09/29/europe-is-now-the-world-s-cryptocurrency-capital#:~:text=Europe%20is%20now%20the%20world's%20biggest%20cryptocurrency%20economy%2C%20with%20the,blockchain%20data%20firm%20Chainalysis%20found.">received over 870 billion Euros in crypto</a>. Moreover, the Central, Northern, and Western Europe regions accounted for a quarter of the global cryptocurrency activity.</p><p>Significantly, between July 2020 and June 2021, transfers from large institutional investors mushroomed from 1.2 billion Euros to 39.6 billion Euros, highlighting the escalating crypto activities in the region and setting the stage for imminent regulatory interventions.</p><p>In response to this burgeoning crypto economy and a series of high-profile incidents leading to significant customer losses, the European Union has enacted a sweeping set of regulations. The newly introduced Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p><p>This fundamental shift in the handling of digital assets is aimed at providing a protective shield for investors. By imposing higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity on exchanges, the rules promise to enhance protection and reliability for customers.</p><p>Beyond Europe, these pioneering regulations could act as a blueprint for the global crypto industry, stimulating broader acceptance of such rules while presenting significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges.</p><p>As the EU navigates this new terrain, the balancing act between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation could shape the future of the crypto industry worldwide.</p> EU’s Landmark Crypto&nbsp;Rules <p>On 16th May 2023, the European Union adopted a regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), initiating a continent-level legal framework for the crypto industry for the first time. The regulatory framework would apply to crypto assets, asset issuers, and crypto-asset service providers.</p><p>The provisions on assets issuers and e-money tokens will apply from 12 months after entry into force, expected to be spring 2024. Other provisions of MiCA will apply from 18 months after entry into force (i.e., in the second half of&nbsp;2024).</p> Significance of the&nbsp;Rules <p>The rules will hold providers liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. All 27 EU member states need to comply with these rules from 2024&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Under these new rules, providers mean utility token issuers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins, providers of trading venues, and wallet services.</p><p>The aim behind introducing the regulations is to safeguard investor assets, maintain stability in the system, and allow the sector to become more attractive for its trustworthiness and innovation.</p> A Brief History of the EU Cryptocurrency Regulations <p>The attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies do not start with the introduction of MiCA. While the EU presented the MiCA proposal in September 2020, regulatory attempts toward crypto have been prevalent since&nbsp;2013.</p>  2013: The first official statements and analysis on virtual currencies came from the European Banking Authority.  2014: The EBA identified more than seventy risks arising from virtual currencies for all possible sorts of market participants. The EBA also suggested measures to deal with governance, capital requirements, and segregation of client accounts.  2016: The European Central Bank analyzed virtual currency schemes and acknowledged the potential advantages of virtual currencies despite an overall negative assessment.  2017: The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a report on Distributed Ledger Technology and its application to Securities markets.  Early 2018: The European Parliament commissioned two reports. One was on virtual currencies and Central banks’ monetary policy. The second was on the fight against the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.  Late 2018: The Financial Stability Board released a paper on the crypto assets market and its financial stability implications.  2019: The International Monetary Fund singled out supervisory and regulatory elements to assist policymakers.  2020: It was only on 24th September that the European Commission introduced the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal as part of a larger digital finance&nbsp;package.  2021: On 24th November 2021, the council adopted its negotiating mandate on&nbsp;MiCA.  2022: On 31st March, the tripartite co-legislative discussions started. The discussions ended with a provisional agreement struck on June 30th,&nbsp;2022.  2024: By July 2024, stablecoin-related provisions will come into&nbsp;effect.  2025: By this year, the remaining provisions of MiCA, other than those related to the issuance of asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens, are anticipated to come into&nbsp;effect.  <p>The rules discussed in this article are seen as the formal adoption of the regulation.</p> What led to These new Regulations? <p>The need for crypto regulations, chronicled in the timeline above, has always been there in the Europe market. Yet, a few incidents in the global crypto market made it all the more necessary and relevant.</p><p>One of the most prominent of these incidents was the collapse of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Not only did it impact the European crypto market, but it also sent shockwaves at a global level as the founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fortune depleted from nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/how-did-crypto-firm-ftx-collapse">US$16 bn to zero</a> within&nbsp;days.</p><p>Another incident that made people aware of the potential risks of volatility in the crypto market was the collapse of stablecoin Terra. Within a week in 2022, the stablecoin Terra and its sister token Luna collapsed, wiping out as high as nearly half a trillion USD from the crypto&nbsp;markets.</p> The New Regulations Details <p>One has to remember that nearly all of these funds lost in the incidents cited above were customer assets, either in the form of investments or deposits. In a bid to prevent such losses, the new rules hold crypto-asset service providers liable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Crypto Exchange Liable for Customer&nbsp;Losses <p>The rules want the issuers of asset-referenced tokens to have an adequate custody policy for their reserve assets to prevent loss and preserve the value of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The crypto-asset service providers should also be held liable for losses incurred from incidents relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Such incidents might include cyber attacks, theft, or malfunctions.</p><p>Service providers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens, and e-money tokens will also be held liable for the information they have offered in a crypto-asset white&nbsp;paper.</p> In Focus: Traceability of Crypto Assets and Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Apart from holding exchanges liable for customer losses, other key components of the regulation deal with the traceability of crypto assets, consumer protection, etc. For instance, the rules want to ensure that crypto assets stay traceable.</p><p>The council also wants its rules to create adequate arrangements for “enhanced consumer protection” and “safeguards against market manipulation and financial crime.”</p><p>The EU also wants crypto providers to share their energy consumption details. Moreover, all providers will need to have a license to issue, trade, and safeguard crypto assets, tokenized assets, and stablecoins.</p> Crypto Licensing and Non-compliance Penalties <p>Crypto service providers operating without a license will have to go through inclusion in an ESMA (European Securities and Market Authority) public registry. In this registry, these unlicensed providers will document their non-compliance.</p> Implications for Exchanges <p>The most radical step is that exchanges will be held liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. Also, in ensuring traceability, the exchanges need to ensure that they have a mechanism to trace crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>MiCA traceability requirement is not a new concept, however, as it is similar to how banks keep a trace of money transfers.</p><p>But it cannot be denied that traceability in crypto assets is a double-edged sword. While it enhances security and regulatory compliance, it also raises critical concerns about user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Although exchanges have no option but to implement traceability, as MiCA makes it mandatory, they must ensure meticulous data governance and robust encryption methods to protect user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Transparency about these practices is crucial, with users having the right to know what data is collected, its use, and protective measures in place. It is paramount to strike a balance between security, regulation, and privacy in this ever-evolving cryptocurrency space.</p><p>In case of suspicious transactions, exchanges should ensure they have appropriate blocking mechanisms in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Besides these, the exchanges will also have to declare their energy consumption details and apply for operating licenses.</p> Potential Crypto Exchange Challenges <p>Putting up a robust compliance process could always be challenging. The exchanges will have to ensure zero scopes of technological vulnerability. Additionally, they need to ensure that operations are at par with what has been committed in the whitepapers.</p> Compliance Strategies for Crypto Exchanges <p>To cope with several compliant requirements enforced under MiCA, exchanges have no options but to make operational adjustments. For instance, the rules necessitate enhanced monitoring of exchanges’ source and destination addresses.</p><p>Adhering to FATF regulations could no doubt contribute to a robust and streamlined compliance process. However, exchanges will require a Travel Rule Solution, such as Shyft Veriscope, to comply with the FATF Travel Rule requirements while protecting their customers’ user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>More on Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Implications for Customers <p>The rules do not apply to P2P transfers. However, transactions above 1,000 Euros from self-hosted wallets come under their purview as and when they connect to wallets hosted by crypto asset service providers.</p> Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Authorities insist that these rules seek to reduce opportunities for intrusion into the system. Hence, hacks, breaches, and data security concerns — all could be reduced if these sets of rules are properly followed.</p> Impact on Crypto Consumer Confidence and&nbsp;Behavior <p>Enhanced consumer protection and transparency in the system would increase the sector’s attractiveness. It will improve credibility and trust, potentially resulting in improved traction and adoption of crypto in the&nbsp;country.</p> Impact on the Global Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Regulation of crypto asset exchanges would involve collecting and transferring data between different jurisdictions.</p><p>In many cases, one party would be a jurisdiction outside Europe. However, successfully completing the transaction would require exchanges in that jurisdiction to stay compliant with European regulations.</p> Global Influence of EU Crypto Regulations <p>With the EU getting its house in order, other parts of the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, will have to keep up with the EU regulations.</p><p>Other countries in the European region, such as Switzerland and the UK, known for their happening local crypto scene, will be impacted as well, despite not being a member of the 27-nation bloc.</p> Switzerland <p>In Switzerland’s case, given the intricate web of business relationships with the EU, Swiss crypto companies must check if MiCA or another EU rule, MiFID II, affects them, especially when dealing with certain tokens like securities.</p><p>Also, MiCA brings unique rules for “stablecoins,” requiring issuers to have an EU-based office and a special&nbsp;license.</p><p>These changes demand Swiss crypto businesses to quickly understand MiCA’s impact and determine which services they can offer from Switzerland to EU countries and what tokens need a special document, the “crypto asset whitepaper,” to be recognized in the&nbsp;EU.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p>The UK has decided on a phased regulatory approach. It might start with stablecoins and then continue with unbacked crypto assets. This strategy is set to interplay with the European Union’s Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Even though the UK is no longer an EU member, the ripple effects of MiCA regulations can’t be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>With MiCA creating a unified framework for crypto assets across the EU, UK-based companies offering crypto services in the EU will need to adapt. Compliance with MiCA, regardless of the UK’s local regulations, will become essential for firms looking to operate within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>On the flip side, the far-reaching and comprehensive nature of MiCA may influence the UK’s phased regulatory approach. It could also serve as a potential blueprint for UK regulators, particularly when moving towards unbacked crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Asia <p>The new framework could potentially reconfigure cross-border digital asset transactions involving EU, Middle East, and Asian entities. Given the substantial number of Asian and Middle Eastern businesses and individuals engaged in crypto-related activities within the EU, the MiCA regulations could potentially impact asset flows, particularly those dealing with certain crypto assets subject to more stringent MiCA requirements.</p><p>Moreover, the increased regulatory oversight under MiCA may instigate a realignment of crypto asset flows, potentially diverting some towards jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. Crypto businesses or investors looking for a more flexible regulatory environment might consider migrating their operations or investments to territories with more lax&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The Middle East and parts of Asia, which have been comparatively less stringent in their approach to crypto regulation, could become attractive destinations for such shifts. However, this could also lead to a double-edged sword scenario where the increase in crypto activities could prompt these regions to establish more robust regulatory frameworks, echoing the rigorous standards of the EU’s&nbsp;MiCA.</p> United States <p>Major US crypto businesses, like Genesis, Gemini, and Bittrex, have had legal troubles, making others in the industry worry about the future. Big player Coinbase is now asking for clear rules for crypto companies, pushing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make a decision.</p><p>In contrast, the EU has been working hard to create rules that protect customers and promote new ideas in the crypto industry. Their rulebook, MiCA, provides clear instructions for companies working with crypto. This not only helps protect people using these services but also builds trust in crypto businesses. It even encourages more use of the technologies behind crypto, like blockchain.</p><p>Other countries, including the US, may look to MiCA as an example when making their rules. While the US is currently dealing with different rules from different bodies, it could learn from the EU’s clear and practical approach. It’s crucial for the US to find a balanced and flexible way to manage crypto, promoting new ideas while ensuring companies follow the&nbsp;rules.</p> The Potential Impact of MiCA Regulations on DeFi Protocols <p>The new MiCA regulations have sparked questions within the crypto community, particularly about their impact on DeFi protocols. The language of the regulations is complex, causing some debate about whether they even apply to DeFi. Some reports suggest they&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>Despite this, it’s wise for funds looking to invest in decentralized finance and DeFi protocols to prepare for compliance. Even if certain decentralized activities seem unaffected by the rules, the broad scope of the regulations could still touch various aspects of DeFi operations.</p> Frequently Asked Questions: Fast Check on Everything MiCA  Q1: What is the new MiCA regulation introduced by the&nbsp;EU? <p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is a new set of rules introduced by the European Union to regulate crypto assets, their issuers, and service providers. A vital component of this regulation is that it holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Q2: Why has the EU introduced this regulation now? <p>The introduction of this regulation comes in response to the growing prevalence and influence of cryptocurrencies within the European economy, as well as several high-profile incidents that have led to significant customer losses. The intent is to protect investors and provide a more stable and trustworthy framework for the operation of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> Q3: What are the implications of these regulations for crypto exchanges? <p>Crypto exchanges will now be held to higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity. They will be directly accountable for any customer losses, which means they will need to ensure robust security measures and operational protocols are in&nbsp;place.</p> Q4: How will these regulations impact customers? <p>Customers stand to benefit from enhanced protection and greater reliability in the crypto sector. These regulations aim to reduce the risk of losses due to incidents like hacks, breaches, and data security concerns.</p> Q5: Do these regulations have any implications outside of the&nbsp;EU? <p>Yes, these regulations could potentially shape the global crypto industry. They could act as a blueprint for other significant players like the United States and the United Kingdom, stimulating broader acceptance of such&nbsp;rules.</p> Q6: What challenges can crypto exchanges expect as a result of these regulations? <p>Compliance with these regulations will be a significant challenge for crypto exchanges. They will need to ensure they have zero technological vulnerabilities and that their operations are in line with commitments made in their whitepapers. They will also need to apply for operating licenses and declare their energy consumption details.</p> Q7: How will these regulations impact the future of the crypto industry? <p>The regulations represent a significant step in the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. By striking a balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation, these rules could shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry not just in the EU but worldwide.</p> Looking Ahead: The Future of EU and Global Crypto Regulation <p>As the landscape of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, the trajectory of these new regulations remains to be fully discerned. If judiciously implemented and navigated with an understanding of their subtleties, these rules could potentially set a regulatory precedent for the rest of the world to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>The task ahead for the EU is multifold: it must diligently safeguard investor interests and curb potential misuse of funds. At the same time, it carries the responsibility to ensure that regulatory frameworks do not stifle innovation but instead foster growth in this rapidly advancing, technology-driven field of cryptocurrencies. The delicate balance between regulation and innovation will define the future of the crypto industry not just in Europe but globally.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency-5c0778bb11c1">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protocol Engineer Philipp Krüger gave a presentation on WNFS, or Webnative File System, at IPFS Thing 2023 in Brussels, Belgium. In his presentation, he gave a comprehensive yet approachable breakdown of how we constructed our versioned and encrypted file system built on top of IPFS.</p><p>When Fission set out to create an encrypted file system that would respect user agency, it needed to meet three criteria: </p>  Users would be able to take their data with them anywhere and control who had access to it  It would be available both online and offline, ensuring access no matter the user's level of connectivity  It could be shared on different devices and types of apps (for example, you could share your data on a music app on your mobile phone and a photo app on your desktop)  <p>Developers are used to running a server to hold user data when publishing an app online. During the prototyping process, dummy data is often stored in the browser. We realized that if we made the browser capable of running production data, it would ensure the data was local-first and private (because the data would never have to leave the device itself).</p> Our Frenemy, The Browser <p>So we began working with the browser to make this a reality. The first step was working with the WebCrypto API, which makes non-extractable key pairs possible. In addition, we wanted to ensure revocability, so we created asymmetric key pairs per app/device. </p> Access Control <p>Once decrypted, data is readable in the hostile browser environment. Therefore, we needed to give not just access control but fine-grained access control. We go by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">Principle of Least Authority (POLA)</a> to ensure the user only shares what they want to share.</p><p>To do this, we encrypt all of the files. However, all those keys can be difficult to manage, so we use the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-the-skip-ratchet/">skip ratchet</a> (our CTO Brooklyn's invention!) to organize them. This also gives us temporal and snapshot access control. </p>Source: Philipp KrügerSource: Philipp Krüger Data Persistence and Key Recovery <p>The browser may delete local storage, so data persistence and key recovery are two important considerations. </p><p>We use IPFS to persist encrypted data outside of the browser. IPFS also has a garbage collection feature, so to be absolutely sure that data is not deleted, the user may want to store their data on a machine they keep online (i.e., their own personal node) or utilize a pinning service. Fission does not run a pinning service, but we currently persist all user file systems for free.</p><p>Key recovery can be handled by linking a device with more reliable permanent storage for your secret keys (this can be done using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE</a> protocol). Another option is to download a recovery kit from the dashboard app (or, in the future, from any app that supports something like it).</p> Concurrent Writes <p>A file system should have concurrent writes so editing can occur offline and multiple authorized users can edit without issue. We achieve this using a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p><p>But what if two valid writes need to be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? WNFS will merge them both by creating a directory that has both changes while also linking back to the previous data (using CRDTs) so nothing gets deleted. Then we leave it up to each app developer to determine how they want to query the history in the API and figure out how to do app-specific merges.</p>Source: Philipp Krüger Privacy &amp; Security <p>Previously we explained that it is important for users to have fine-grained access control because it supports user agency and resolves the issue of decrypted data in the browser. </p><p>When the user does share data with someone else, whether it's an individual or an app, this action should reveal as little metadata as possible. That's why we verify valid writes without read access (using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>), scramble the file hierarchy, create a flat namespace (using the CRDT structure), and split files into chunks so no one can distinguish file size.</p> Getting Started <p>The Rust 🦀 implementation of WNFS (<a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/rs-wnfs">rs-wnfs</a>) is available now.</p><p>You can also join our <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">working group</a> and attend the monthly community calls or view the <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmaps/issues/2?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmaps%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">project's roadmap</a> to track our progress, get involved, and learn about upcoming features.</p>

               <p>Consumer trends and why fashion industries are changing their brand position</p>
<p>There’s been a huge shift in the way consumers demand Transparency when it comes to ethical sourced and sustainable fashion. It’s fascinating to see that more people are paving the way to more openness and demanding more eco-friendly manufactured clothing. Fast and wasteful fashion is no more! </p>
<p>When increasingly more people are changing the way they consume and behave, the fashion industry has to advance as well. Therefore we see a shift in how production is changing back to locally produced goods, true sustainability, more focus on fairly paid workers and distributed companies. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
          <p>The devastating impact on our environment </p>
<p>The use of toxic dyes, pesticides, the tremendous waste of natural resources, farming, harvesting, processing, manufacturing and the transportation for mass production all over the world is really having a devastating impact. The extravagant usage and waste of water that is needed for production is completely irresponsible.</p>
<p>The UNISOT SaaS solution can therefore be used to prove and provide honest information, that guarantees that the company is preventing waste and unethical practices, thus enabling customers to make even more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         <p>Smart Digital Twins in Blockchain, Web3 and Federated Learning in Fashion </p>
<p>Due to the intrinsic nature of public blockchain technology supply chains will become more transparent. This brings about a whole new level of incentives for companies and how they will do business.</p>
<p>With public blockchain technology we can create a link between the physical object and a digital one: a smart digital twin is created. This link is used to create a Digital Product Passport to state the origin of the actual product; blocking any attempts of counterfeit or diversion. Each action in the supply chain is recorded and due to the distributed nature of public blockchain technology no stored data can be altered, destroyed or diverted. Furthermore, UNISOT’s Smart Digital Twins functionality enables full product life cycle history feedback.</p>
<p>All kinds of exciting technologies are slipping into fashion industry, and garment companies are progressively changing into tech companies. &nbsp;UNISOT applications combined with IoT technologies, Web3 and Federated Learning can make a big change in how the Fashion Industry goes forward – in real time – for each node in the supply chain.</p>
 Let´s change the fashion industry together

Key points: 
<br> 
<br> 
  
  Most fentanyl trafficked into the United States is manufactured using precursors imported from Chinese suppliers.<br><br>  
  Elliptic researchers received offers from more than 90 China-based companies to supply fentanyl precursors, 90% of which accepted cryptocurrency payments. Many mentioned that they have shipped the same chemicals to Mexico.<br><br>  
  Many of these businesses were also willing to supply fentanyl itself, despite this being banned in China since 2019.<br><br>  
  Elliptic’s blockchain analysis shows that the cryptocurrency wallets used by these companies have received thousands of payments, totaling just over $27 million, and that the number of transactions has increased by 450% year-on-year. $27 million would purchase enough precursor to produce fentanyl pills with a street value of approximately $54 billion.<br><br>  
  Analysis of blockchain transactions also shows that a known fentanyl trafficker paid tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin to one of these suppliers.&nbsp;<br><br>  
  
Fentanyl overdoses are now the leading cause of death for those aged 18-45 in the United States. Cheaper to produce than heroin and 50 times more potent, this synthetic opioid has fueled an epidemic over the past decade, as well as becoming a huge source of profits for international drug cartels. 
<br> 
<p><br>For many years, China was the main source of illicit fentanyl. But in 2019 following intense diplomatic pressure from the US, the Chinese government regulated the drug – effectively banning its export.</p> 
<p>However, far from stemming the tide, illicit fentanyl imports into the US have soared. That’s because Mexican drug cartels have stepped in to fill the void and seize the market – manufacturing their own fentanyl using precursors (chemical ingredients) imported from China.&nbsp;<br><br>The US government has placed increasing emphasis on disrupting the financial activity of fentanyl traffickers and their supply networks. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strengthened-approach-to-crack-down-on-illicit-fentanyl-supply-chains/">fact sheet</a> published on April 11th, the White House indicated that it intends to “expand its efforts to disrupt the illicit financial activities that fund these criminals by increasing accountability measures, including financial sanctions”.&nbsp;<br><br>Three days later, on April 14th, the US Department of the Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1413">sanctioned</a> several individuals and businesses in China for supplying precursor chemicals to drug cartels in Mexico for the production of fentanyl intended for the US market. The sanctions also listed cryptocurrency wallets used by these businesses to receive payments.&nbsp;<br><br>The Elliptic research team identified more than 90 China-based chemical companies that were willing to supply fentanyl precursors, and that are offering cryptocurrency as a payment method.</p> 
<p>Our researchers received offers to supply large quantities of one particular fentanyl precursor. This chemical is not used in the manufacture of any other products, and is a controlled substance in most countries. However, it remains unregulated in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every day, people encounter multiple obstacles while traveling to their intended destinations. Sitting in traffic, waiting for the bus to arrive 15 minutes later than scheduled, driving around for 30 minutes to find a parking spot—the modern world is full of inconveniences due to underlying inefficiencies in our transportation systems.</p>



<p>However, stalled cars and harried people waiting for public transportation aren’t just an individual nuisance. A less-than-optimal transportation infrastructure affects the economy, hastens environmental impact and lowers the overall quality of living. Making transportation work quicker and for more people keeps city planners up at night.</p>



<p>The good news is that new technologies and approaches to transportation management systems allow us to start addressing these inconveniences and make other downstream transportation improvements. The solution is smart transportation.</p>



<p>The rise of interconnected technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), electric vehicles, geolocation and mobile technology have made it possible to orchestrate how people and goods flow from one place to another, especially in densely-packed urban areas.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future">Several global cities</a>, including London, Paris, Amsterdam and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/business/ibm-takes-smarter-cities-concept-to-rio-de-janeiro.html">Rio De Janeiro</a>, have invested in smart transportation as a key component of their smart-city initiatives. There are now universities that study smart transportation use cases (e.g., <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/cee/prospective/graduate-degree/masters/ms-concentrations/smart-transportation-mobility.html">Carnegie Mellon</a>, <a href="https://c2smart.engineering.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, <a href="https://catalog.njit.edu/graduate/newark-college-engineering/civil-environmental/intelligent-transportation-systems-cert/">NJIT</a> and many more). The whole world, it seems, is fixated on solving transportation issues and increasing mobility because it produces so many benefits for citizens and the economy.</p>



 The rise of smart cities 



<p>Many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/22/songdo-south-korea-world-first-smart-city-in-pictures">cities</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uncovering-the-early-history-of-big-data-in-1974-los-an-1712551686">claim</a> <a href="https://citymonitor.ai/community/how-london-became-first-smart-city-back-1854-2447">to be</a> the first “smart city” in the world. While one can debate what exactly turns a mere city into a smart one, there’s no denying that the rise of the Internet and mobile technology has generated widespread interest in building the next generation of smart cities.</p>



<p>Every time a city improves upon its existing structures to incorporate more data-driven or connected technologies, it becomes more intelligent. Examples of smart-city enhancements beyond smart transportation include sensors to monitor air quality and temperature fluctuations, IoT technology in public buildings to conserve energy and data-driven waste pick-up management. But the crown jewel of any smart city is how smart transportation can revolutionize how cities operate and how people move within them.</p>



 A smart transportation overview 



<p>Also known as smart mobility, the rise of ubiquitous data collection and automation has led local governments to embrace smart transportation. It is made possible by the fact that virtually every citizen and commuter has a smartphone that can transmit and receive messages and data.</p>



<p>In addition, it’s never been easier and cheaper to create public Wi-Fi networks, creating many new opportunities for governments can implement smart transportation initiatives.</p>



<p>Smart transportation usually includes public-private partnerships that can positively affect several issues with transportation, such as pollution deriving from car emissions, congestion and the importance of public transportation to the needy and elderly.</p>



<p>Several smart transportation solutions have existed for some time—for example, a city department of transportation providing real-time arrival data of buses and trains, electronic toll collection, bike sharing, dynamic pricing on cars entering the city and public transportation smart cards. But several disparate technologies do not make an intelligent transportation system. It requires a comprehensive strategy and multiple smart technologies working in tandem.</p>



<p>Smart transportation helps better allocate resources so cities can do more with less and avoid unnecessary energy consumption and resource costs.</p>



<p>Cities and states prioritizing smart transportation provide a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/transportation-equity.html">more inclusive and equitable</a> living experience for all of their citizens.</p>



 Smart transportation benefits governments and citizens alike 



<p>The following are some examples of smart transportation and how they can benefit a city:</p>



 Parking 



<p>Every driver has had the experience of searching for parking for 30 minutes or more, convinced that every open spot is filled right before they get to it. It’s a vexing problem that has an obvious solution: adding sensors to parking spots. That way, drivers can find an open spot ahead of time and use their smartphones and/or dashboard consoles to go directly to the spot, instead of aimlessly wandering.</p>



 Intelligent transportation networks 



<p>Many local and national transportation departments are now broadcasting real-time mass transit schedule updates and maintenance interruptions through centralized control systems. Citizens and commuters can access this information on their smartphones, tablets and computers through applications, social media or browsers, but that should just be table stakes.</p>



<p>The next generation of smart transportation systems will be able to communicate when parts on trains or buses are likely to fail, allowing operators to take fleet vehicles out of service to fix them before they break down with passengers on board. Investing in transportation networks also includes the building of high-speed rails that can transport more people from destination to destination, ameliorating traffic and the environmental impact of individuals driving cars.</p>



 Better traffic management 



<p>Traffic congestion results from many separate issues, such as vehicle accidents, rigid traffic grids, poor weather, population growth and substandard infrastructure. While each has a fix (of varying levels of complexity), smart transportation can address them all:</p>



 
 Vehicle accidents: Connected vehicles with sensors can prevent accidents from occurring, often before the driver even knows something bad is about to happen. 



 Traffic control: Historically, traffic lights changed based on pre-determined time windows regardless of any unforeseen impacts. While the time windows for traffic signals to change may differ during different times of day (e.g., to account for rush hour on a busy street), they rarely change based on the specific flow of traffic. In the rare major metropolitan areas where traffic light times can change based on that data, it’s usually done manually by human intervention. The future of traffic management involves smart traffic lights connected to real-time traffic flow data that incorporates <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> that can change lights at intersections based on thousands of variables. 



 Real-time information on road conditions and accidents: Like traffic, road conditions can create bottlenecks in travel patterns. While map applications accessible on smartphones increasingly provide real-time updates on traffic conditions, they’re often provided by citizen reporting. Public-private partnerships can boost this information by investing in <a href="https://www.govtech.com/fs/5-tech-tools-governments-can-use-to-alleviate-traffic-troubles.html">vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)</a> and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology so that every car provides information automatically, identifying issues before they create traffic jams. 
 



 Smart public transportation 



<p>How many job seekers have lost out on the job of their dreams because of backed-up or stalled trains? How quickly do printed schedules on the bus stop become irrelevant every day? In every city, thousands to millions of people depend on public transportation daily; they are lifelines to the elderly, frontline workers and people with disabilities. It makes a world of difference when cities can connect those critical vehicles to a smart grid to ensure that citizens have real-time information about when bus services and other forms of public transit will pick them up and take them where they need to go.</p>



 Support for electric vehicles 



<p>Leaders who want to make their cities hospitable and attract electric car drivers must install electric charging stations in high-traffic areas, where drivers can stop for a bit and walk around or get some food while the car charges. Not only does that provide a service to the driver, but it also helps area businesses capture some new business. The important thing to remember about smart transportation is you’re also building for the future. While autonomous vehicles are not ready for mass deployment yet, many expect they will become a reality in the future. So any meaningful smart transportation plans have plans for future proofing as vehicle technologies expand how we can move around without human intervention.</p>



 IBM Maximo is helping advance the journey to smart transportation 



<p>Virtually every major city has incorporated some smart transportation technologies into their overall offering to citizens and commuters, but now is the time to establish a holistic smart transportation strategy that helps people get to their destination quicker, more safely and with less environmental impact. As the hybrid work movement enables more employees to work in a city of their choosing, the local governments that offer a truly smart city with a comprehensive smart transportation system will be able to attract more residents at the expense of those cities that fail to adapt.</p>



<p>The good news is that solutions now exist to help governments create a more comprehensive smart transportation framework that uses a full suite of solutions for operations, maintenance, monitoring, quality and reliability. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo</a> helps metro services serving 4.7 billion riders, 73% of the busiest airports and 75% of the largest automotive companies transform the intelligence of their systems to improve customer satisfaction and increase efficiency.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine">IBM Cloud Code Engine</a> is a fully managed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing">serverless</a> platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, microservices, event-driven functions or batch jobs. Code Engine even builds container images for you from your source code.</p>



<p>All these workloads can seamlessly work together because they are all hosted within the same Kubernetes infrastructure. The Code Engine experience is designed so that you could focus on writing code and not worry about the infrastructure that is needed to host it.</p>



 Prerequisites 



 
 Appropriate permissions to use the IBM Cloud Code Engine service. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-iam">See here for how to manage these.</a> 



 An application running on IBM Cloud Code Engine. You can deploy the test application from <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-getting-started#app-hello">here</a>. 



 Access to modify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> of a public domain/hostname. If you own a domain or purchased one, you will most likely have access to manage DNS for that domain. In the example, we have used <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis">IBM Cloud Internet Services</a> that support CNAME flattening feature to enable us to use root domain. 



 A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0">SSL</a> certificate signed by a public certificate authority. 
 



<p>In this example, the test application is deployed on IBM Cloud Code Engine. The original hostname looks something similar to this https://application-27.zx67dfvbl7l.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/. We’ll expose this application using two custom domains:</p>



 
 https://example.org 



 https://codeengine.example.org 
 



 Step-by-step instructions 



<p>Refer this <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-domain-mappings">document</a> and the below steps to create the TLS certificates for both domains and use them to expose this test application. You can use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt CA</a> as an example to request TLS certificates for these custom domains. However, you can also use a TLS certificate from any of the public certificate authorities.</p>



<p>We’ll follow these steps to accomplish our goals:</p>



 
 Generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request">CSR</a> for TLS certificate and get it signed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">CA</a>. 



 Add your domain to Code Engine application UI. 



 Create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME</a> record in DNS for your domain name. 
 



 1. Generate CSR for TLS certificate and get it signed from CA 



 
  
<p>To generate a valid signed TLS certificate from Let’s Encrypt CA, you can use the Certbot client to generate the CSR and get it signed from CA. First, you need to install the Certbot using <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&amp;os=ubuntufocal">these instructions</a>.</p>



<p>Use the following command to start the process for the certificate generation:</p>



 <code>certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email contact@example.org --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --domain codeengine.example.org

certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email contact@example.org --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --domain example.org</code> 
  



<p>Then, it should ask you for the domain ownership verification step:</p>



 <code>root@jumpbox:~# certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email contact@example.org --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --domain codeengine.example.org
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for codeengine.example.org

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.codeengine.example.org

with the following value:

Fq2wbN9mUSfnWZkGXyaEgVaOm-_9RB4cv4zJEp44Sbg

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.codeengine.example.org.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Press Enter to Continue</code> 



<p>Let’s add the verification TXT records for both domains in the DNS as per the below:</p>



 <code>codeengine.example.org	TXT	Fq2wbN9mUSfnWZkGXyaEgVaOm-_9RB4cv4zJEp44Sbg

example.org		TXT	DfjSDFFDbN9vccdSDnjnkSNSNKx-_9vccdSDnZvccdSDn</code> 



<p>Now, you need to create a TXT record with the above value in your domain’s DNS servers. The DNS servers for your domain might have been provided by your domain registrar or these can be hosted somewhere else. After you add this DNS record, you can verify it using <code>dig</code> or <code>nslookup</code>:</p>



 <code>% dig txt _acme-challenge.codeengine.example.org. +short
"Fq2wbN9mUSfnWZkGXyaEgVaOm-_9RB4cv4zJEp44Sbg"</code> 



<p>After you press Enter or Return, you should see something like the following:</p>



 <code>Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:        /etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2023-07-20.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:
 * Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
 * Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
</code> 



<p>You got two files:</p>



 <code><code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/fullchain.pem</code></code> 



 
 This is your TLS certificate with full root-ca chain certificates. The contents should be something like this: 
 



 <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFNDCCBBygAwIBAgISBOLyU
------
------
------
cRQJMEhg76fsO3txE+FiYruq9RUWhiF1myv4Q6W+CyBFC
Dfvp7OOGAN6dEOM4+qR9sdjoSYKEBpsr6GtPAQw4dy753ec5
-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code> 



<p><code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/privkey.pem</code></p>



 
 This is the private key for your TLS certificate. The content of the private key file should be something like the following: 
 



 <code>-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvwIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEF
------
------
------
BAZQ4dZS/TXFRMQcgNL3nWGk42YSOYAjqJNceX6rQMSoxDiCdb6e+
+pT6jcKsENz88M3dpNQNi1OSUQ==
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
</code> 



 2. Add your domain to Code Engine application UI 



<p>Since you have TLS certificate and key available, you can now proceed to add the custom domain to the IBM Cloud Code Engine application from the IBM Cloud console.</p>



 
 Go <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects/">here</a> and follow Projects &gt; Your project name &gt; Applications &gt; Application name &gt; Domain mappings tab 



 Select the application for which you want to use a custom domain. 



 Select Domain mappings from the top bar menu. 



 Here, you need to click on the blue button named Create under the section titled Custom domain mappings. 



 A new setup wizard should open like the screenshot above. You need to paste the contents from the file fullchain.pem in the text box titled Certificate chain and file privkey.pem to the text box titled Private key. 



 Under the section titled Domain name and target application, type the actual custom domain hostname:
 
 Domain name: Type “example.org” in this editable text field. 



 CNAME Target: Pref-filled text should be there, which we need to create a CNAME record for this domain name. 
 
 
 



 <code>example.org			CNAME	custom.zx67dfvbl7l.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud

codeengine.example.org	CNAME	custom. zx67dfvbl7l.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
</code> 



 3. Create a CNAME record in DNS for your domain name 
 



<p>This is an important step. Let’s create a CNAME record in your domain’s DNS servers pointing to the value from the CNAME target box.</p>



<p>After you have created the CNAME record, proceed by selecting the Create button to finish creating the custom domain name mapping. This should take few minutes to be fully activated in the system.</p>



<p>If you want to use your root domain (example.org) instead of a subdomain like codeengine.example.org, you may want to use the CNAME flattening feature of IBM Cloud Internet Services. For more details refer to the links below.</p>

 <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started">Getting started with IBM Cloud Internet Services</a> 
 



<p>If everything goes fine, you should be able to access your application using your custom domain:</p>



 <code>% curl -k https://example.org 
Hello World from:
. ___  __  ____  ____
./ __)/  \(    \(  __)
( (__(  O )) D ( ) _)

<p>GDPR and VASPs: Lessons Learned from Meta’s Historic Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of the recent historic 1.2 billion euro fine levied against Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) worldwide should take heed. The unprecedented penalty, the highest ever under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sends a strong message about the EU’s commitment to data protection and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Facebook’s Record Fine Sends a Strong Signal to VASPs: EU Regulations and Compliance are Crucial</p></blockquote><p>Reason Behind Facebook’s Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta’s predicament stemmed from its systemic transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) since 16 July 2020. The GDPR requires an adequate level of protection for data transferred outside the EU, and Meta’s data handling practices were deemed non-compliant, leading to the severe fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Aspects of GDPR&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GDPR is a comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting the data and privacy of EU citizens. Key principles that organizations should adhere to include:&nbsp;</p>



  Data Minimization: Processing only the necessary amount of data for a specific purpose.&nbsp; 



 Purpose Limitation: Ensuring that data is only used for a clearly stated and legitimate purpose.&nbsp; 



 Accuracy: Maintaining up-to-date and correct data, and promptly correcting or deleting any inaccuracies.&nbsp; 
   Storage Limitation: Storing data for no longer than necessary and in a way that permits identification of data subjects.&nbsp; 
 <p>Beyond MiCA: Other Regulatory Considerations for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the recent MiCA regulation is an important consideration for VASPs planning to operate in the EU, it isn’t the only regulatory framework they need to abide by. GDPR compliance is equally crucial, and overlooking this can lead to serious penalties, as seen in Meta’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR Essentials for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay compliant with GDPR, VASPs should:&nbsp;</p>



  Understand and apply GDPR principles in their data handling practices.&nbsp; 



 Keep track of where and how they store and transfer data.&nbsp; 



 Implement security measures to protect data.&nbsp; 
   Be transparent with users about data collection, use, and storage.&nbsp; 



 Choosing the Right Partners for GDPR Compliance&nbsp; 
 <p>A critical part of maintaining GDPR compliance is choosing the right partners. When it comes to data protection and storage, partnering with companies that understand the complexities of GDPR and have a robust data security infrastructure is essential. Coinfirm, an EU-based firm, ticks all these boxes. Coinfirm’s servers are located within the EU, ensuring GDPR compliance and providing VASPs with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinfirm, Your Partner in Compliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The substantial fine against Meta serves as a warning signal to VASPs: data protection isn’t just a legal requirement, it’s an integral part of responsible business practices. While the regulatory landscape may seem daunting, Coinfirm is here to help. As a GDPR-compliant partner, Coinfirm is not only equipped to provide clear, actionable<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics services, but also to guide VASPs through the complexities of operating within the EU. With Coinfirm, VASPs can confidently navigate the intricacies of GDPR, safeguarding their operations while respecting user privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>Whether or not you know the term, you know the experience of using a Progressive Web App (PWA): it’s the slick experience that enables you to install a web experience to your native device and enjoy the speed of use of a website with the tight system integration of a native app. They allow for experiences like recreating <a href="https://app.starbucks.com/">Starbucks’ native app in web</a>, or for creating a <a href="https://www.tigren.com/blog/uber-pwa">highly 2G-optmized experience</a> like what Uber created for some of their customers. PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. </p><p>In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.</p> What changes in a DWA? <p>The basic client-server model that PWAs use is and has been the presumed standard for decades now. Users expect to open up their PWA, a client, that routinely makes API calls to a 3rd party service, the server, where all their data is stored and the business logic of the app lives. For example, a basic ToDo app PDA would provide you a UI to interface with all your action items by calling the API service that accesses those items; fundamentally the data and API layers live outside of the user’s control and ownership.</p><p>In DWAs, users own their own data and, as a result, their apps no longer need an API service because apps connect directly to the data source. This shift leads to virtually no UI/UX change, but triggers a radical change in app architecture because developers are now directly interfacing with a user’s data store instead of with app-owned server storage via API. </p><p>In DWAs, app data is stored in <a>Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)</a>, which are user-owned and redundant data stores capable of transmitting data that provide strong promises of privacy and guaranteed ownership. DWNs can be permissioned publicly or privately related to the querying decentralized identifier (DID) using <a>permissions</a> and<a> protocols</a> to allow select access to all the data stored in them. </p><p>Going back to our ToDo app example, a user would be able to store all of their todo items and app data on their own DWN rather than on a specific 3rd party’s servers, and all the app would do is focus on creating a presentation layer and additional features around the app’s concept. </p> Upgrading to DWAs <p>If you want to migrate a PWA to a DWA, the only thing you’ll need to do is make sure that whatever data you were originally storing remotely and transmitting via API calls is now stored on the user’s DWN and is accessed <a>using CRUD operations</a> on the user’s DWN. For example, your ToDo app may have previously made an API call to write a new item to your list, but now you’d replace that API call with:</p>   <code>// Write a plain text record to the in-memory DWN<br><br>const myRecord = await web5.dwn.records.create(myDid.id, {<br> author: myDid.id,<br> data: todoItem,<br> message: {<br>     dataFormat: 'text/plain',<br> },<br>});<br></code>     <p>You might expect this section on how to migrate your PWA to a DWA to drag on, but that’s really it! Regardless of your front-end frameworks, you can easily turn your app into a DWA using our <a>web5.js library </a>with minimal code changes. So long as your application treats the user’s DWN as its data storage and allows the user to own their own data, your PWA is now a DWA.</p> Benefits of a DWA <p>Even though replacing all your API calls with DWA calls may be relatively easy work, convincing your users to get on board with Web5 and DWNs may be a challenge. So what’s in it for you and them when you build a DWA?</p>  User ownership of data - users don’t have to worry about a server outage or be fearful of a company shutting down and losing all their data.  Data portability - because users are storing their own data in PWAs, they no longer need to be tied to a single service. Imagine, for example, a world with a decentralized Spotify and Tidal. If a Spotify user were to decide to leave the platform and migrate to Tidal, they’d own all their own playlist data and could therefore then give playlist access to Tidal so that all their data migrates seamlessly.   Reduced operational overhead - you no longer need to maintain a massive array of databases, clusters, and other infrastructure to host your simple PWA. Instead, a user can visit your DWA, plug in their DWN, and get to work.   What’s Next? <p>If you’d like to try upgrading your PWA to a DWA or building your own from the ground-up, you can use our <a>web5.js library</a> to interface with DWNs and DIDs. Additionally, you can find support on your developer journey by <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">joining our Discord</a> channel or by <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js">engaging in our GitHub page</a>.</p>

This detailed information can help lenders calculate income faster and more precisely to improve loan quality, simplify the mortgage process and, most importantly, expand access to credit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Over the last year, we’ve consistently rolled out innovations to ensure our digital tools are improving speed and efficiency, reducing risk and, ultimately, helping us serve our mission by reaching more qualified borrowers. Today’s innovation further automates income assessment by using historical direct deposit pay patterns and current gross income from recent paystubs, which can help more families achieve homeownership.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 9th May to 21st&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, your biweekly dose of crypto regulatory news from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Crypto regulatory developments are often a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns, as we saw during and the last two weeks were no exception.</p><p>The EU cleared the path with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), marking a significant stride in cryptocurrency regulations. Meanwhile, South Korea has been emboldened to take decisive actions amidst political scandals, stepping up their crypto regulation game.</p><p>In the United States, the landscape continues to evolve, shaped by rigorous debates over the clarity of digital asset rules and who holds the reins over “stablecoins.”</p><p>So without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Crypto Regulation Rundown: The Balance Between Safety and Innovation Across EU, US, and South&nbsp;Korea <p>The European Union (EU) is making major strides, unanimously approving a new law known as the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). With MiCA, the EU aims to offer clear guidelines for people in the crypto market, providing a safety net for everyone involved.</p><p>But it’s not all rosy. The demands from crypto wallet providers and exchanges are high and might put a damper on new and creative&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking heat. The issue? They aren’t being clear about their digital asset rules. Leading the protest is the United States Chamber of Commerce and Coinbase, a giant in the crypto world. They worry that this ambiguity could hurt the digital economy and hinder its&nbsp;growth.</p><p>On the other side of the globe, South Korea is taking decisive action. Prompted by some scandals involving cryptocurrencies, they’ve put their stamp of approval on a new crypto regulation bill. This sudden move showcases the urgency for a legal framework around digital asset trading. The heart of this bill is about making things clearer and more responsible in South Korea’s expanding crypto&nbsp;scene.</p><p>Back to the United States, a fascinating debate unfolds around “stablecoins.” The bone of contention here is who should be in control: the states or the federal government? Both sides have distinct views, but there’s a shared understanding that stablecoins are part of our future. And most agree that the U.S. should make the rules so businesses don’t move&nbsp;away.</p><p>Across the globe, the chorus is growing for clear, easy-to-follow rules in the world of cryptocurrency. We need protections for those in the digital asset market, but it’s also vital to encourage fresh ideas and industry growth. How well these new rules can strike this balance will be the key to their&nbsp;success.</p> Decoding the EU’s New Crypto Rules: Mica’s Impact and&nbsp;Insights <p>The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation.</p><p>This development comes after the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, comprised of finance ministers from all EU member states, voted in favor of the MiCA bill and amendments to related regulations and directives.</p><p>Earlier in April, the European Parliament endorsed an unprecedented set of regulations for the crypto industry, adding weight to the MiCA legislation.</p><p>With an overwhelming majority of the members voting in favor, this initiative’s primary aim is to protect consumers from potential risks linked with crypto assets and ensure providers can be held accountable for any loss of investors’ assets. This regulatory effort signifies an important shift in the EU’s approach to crypto asset management and the broader financial industry’s future.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/InbarPreiss/status/1658453533463592962?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>In line with the MiCA approval, the European Parliament greenlighted two additional pieces of legislation, further contributing to the detailed regulatory framework. These supplementary rules aim to regulate the information accompanying fund transfers and certain crypto assets, emphasizing transparency and accountability across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>One key provision of the MiCA regulation is that crypto platforms are now obliged to provide clear and comprehensive information regarding the risks associated with their services.</p><p>Though this is a win for consumers’ trust, the stringent licensing prerequisites for crypto wallet providers and exchanges could impact the pace of innovation and competition.</p><p>Another impactful aspect is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold substantial reserves. This protective measure can safeguard the market from potential shocks but also introduces a cap on the daily transactions of larger stablecoins, which could influence their&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The overall picture painted by these legislative measures is of a cautious yet forward-thinking EU seeking a balanced approach to harnessing the benefits of crypto assets while mitigating associated risks.</p> South Korea Takes Lead in Cryptocurrency Regulations Amid&nbsp;Scandal <p>South Korea’s National Policy Committee took a bold step forward by approving a landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill, the first of its kind in the nation’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>This action is a direct response to a controversy involving a high-profile opposition lawmaker, who has been accused of heavy cryptocurrency speculation. Now consolidated from 19 similar drafts, the bill is headed for the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, where it will face a thorough&nbsp;review.</p><p>According to legislators, this bill aims to protect digital asset investors, thwart unfair cryptocurrency trading, and establish a reliable framework for trading stablecoins. And in a significant move, it empowers the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s premier financial regulator, to oversee cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Although the current bill is primarily centered around investor protection and fair trade, a separate bill focused on the intricacies of initial coin offerings, public disclosures, and market regulations is still under committee review.</p><p>Fueling the swift bipartisan support for the cryptocurrency regulation bill is the scandal involving Representative Kim Nam-kuk, who allegedly dabbled in sizeable speculative investments in various cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The disclosure of his extensive digital asset holdings has sparked a call for increased transparency, compelling both political parties to draft legislation that mandates lawmakers and public officials to disclose their cryptocurrency assets.</p><p>This shift in policy brings South Korea closer to the regulatory standards of the US and EU, where comparable disclosure laws were established in 2018 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>The legislation will undoubtedly profoundly impact the South Korean cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering a host of benefits and presenting certain challenges. Investors stand to gain from improved protection measures, thus fostering a safer environment in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>The law also takes aim at unfair trading practices and establishes a robust structure for trading stablecoins, which could increase public confidence in and participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>However, stricter regulatory oversight may hinder the pace of innovation and deter potential new entrants to the crypto market. On top of that, the new legislation also could infringe on the privacy of lawmakers and public officials who will be obligated to disclose their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-the-regulated-road-ahead">The Shyft Perspective — Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate: the Regulated Road&nbsp;Ahead</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658156397253603334?s=20">Why Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658850243381796868?s=20">What is Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1659578665284321280?s=20">Key Elements of Shyft&nbsp;Network</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Remaining OCEAN tokens will be minted. OCEAN will be fully decentralized and unpausable. It will vest to community over&nbsp;decades <p>Overview article [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/control-over-the-ocean-contract-to-be-revoked-soon-overview-6c5b15be2db">here</a>], technical article [this post]. May 25 update: it’s&nbsp;done:)</p> 1. Summary <p>The OCEAN token contract has 1.41B tokens capped supply. By the end of May 2023, the Ocean core team will mint the remaining 56.518% in the supply. A multisig wallet holds this newly minted OCEAN; Ocean core team members are a minority. All of the newly minted OCEAN is for the community; most will be transferred to smart contracts that vest OCEAN over decades to fund Ocean Data Farming (DF). DF incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume in the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>With this minting done, we are then able to further reduce the OCEAN risk surface by renouncing ownership of the OCEAN token contract. This will make it un-pausable, and fully decentralized &amp; censorship-resistant.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 is an overview of system-level design and implementation phases. Section 3 elaborates on the implementation phases, with emphasis on OCEAN-related actions. The core team has completed the first two phases; the third and fourth is underway. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. Introduction  2.1 High-Level Overview <p>The image below shows the Ocean system-level design with an emphasis on DF funding flows. It overlays DF Main implementation phases.</p>Ocean system design + DF main implementation<p>The Ocean system-level design follows the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>. The green circle in the image is the heart of this loop: teams in Ocean ecosystem do *work* to drive traction to the Ocean ecosystem in terms of DCV [0], protocol revenue, and OCEAN. Protocol revenue loops back to burn OCEAN and to further fund teams. Ocean Data Farming (DF) is the main approach to incentivize / fund the&nbsp;teams.</p><p>The image overlays the five implementation phases of DF Main implementation, shown in colors of the rainbow, red → orange → yellow → green → blue: (A) Vesting &amp; Splitter Contracts, (B) Recycling Multisig, (C ) Actions around OCEAN contract, (D) Security Audit, (E) Remaining Deployments.</p><p>Aside: The implementation phases A-E are orthogonal to DF Main 1–4. Phases A-E are about implementation work, whereas DF Main 1–4 are about OCEAN vesting schedule. We aim to complete all implementation phases A-E during DF Main&nbsp;1.</p> 2.2 Overview: System-Level Design <p>In the system-level design, Ocean Data Farming is the main approach to incentivize / fund the&nbsp;teams.</p><p>For Data Farming, OCEAN flows from top to bottom as&nbsp;follows:</p>  From the initial OCEAN contract (top left), to the 51% multisig [one-time]  From 51% multisig to vesting wallets Vesting 0, Vesting A, Vesting B, Vesting C, Vesting D [one-time]  From vesting wallets to Splitter contract [weekly, over decades]. More precisely, Vesting 0 and Vesting A vest for DF Main 1 [12 mos]; Vesting B for DF Main 2 [6 mos]; Vesting C for DF Main 3 [6 mos]; Vesting D for DF Main 4 [decades].  From Splitter contract to DF addresses DF passive, DF active, and DF future [weekly, over decades].  From DF addresses to Ocean core team, Ocean ecosystem teams.  Work from these teams drives traction in the Data Ecosystem to output protocol revenue, which goes to Community Multisig Wallet, then Rev-Splitter then (i) buyback &amp; burn and (ii) Splitter contract.   2.3 Overview: DF Main Implementation <p>(This section is adapted from “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">DF Main is Here</a>” blog post. We repeat it in order to expand on&nbsp;it.)</p><p>Ratchet Principle. As DF Main involves a huge amount of OCEAN, we take extra precautions and follow the principle <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">“ratchet up value-at-risk over time”</a>. What this means: rather than sending all this OCEAN directly to the vesting contracts, we “buy time” to more thoroughly verify the&nbsp;system</p><p>Implementation over time. We can ratchet up value at risk as we deploy more components, and put OCEAN into them. Here’s the order of operations.</p>  Deploy canary, wire it up. First we will deploy a “canary” vesting contract for DF Main 1, funded with just 1000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Verification. This allows us to test the system live, in production yet with a small amount of funds at risk. At the same time, we will initiate a bug bounty program and security audit for all these components.  Weekly rewards keep rolling. OCEAN payouts for DF29, DF30, etc will be as scheduled for DF main. A tiny amount will come from the “canary” vesting contract, and the rest will be topped up manually by the Ocean core&nbsp;team.  Deploy the rest. Once the verification is complete, then we will deploy the remaining contracts and move the remaining OCEAN accordingly.  <p>Final outcome. In completing the implementation work above, OCEAN vesting will be fully automated and on-chain. Then we will tackle decentralizing DF-main reward calculations, leveraging advances in decentralized compute infrastructure. This will serve the Ocean ecosystem well in the decades that follow, with more transparency, stability, and composability.</p><p>We now elaborate on each of the implementation phases&nbsp;A-E.</p> 3. DF Main Implementation Phases  3.1 Implementation Phase A: Vesting &amp; Splitter contracts <p>This phase implements the red🟥 phase in the image. This phase is complete.</p><p>First, we developed the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol">VestingWalletLinear</a> contract, which inputs tokens and releases those to a target address according to linear vesting schedule (constant every week). We developed the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol">VestingWalletHalving</a> contract, which vests according to a Bitcoin-style exponential schedule. Finally, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/Splitter.sol">Splitter</a> contract, which splits any inbound income to multiple output addresses. We moved those contracts to the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">Ocean contracts repo</a>.</p><p>Then, we did the work to “Deploy canary, wire it&nbsp;up.”</p>  We deployed a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting 0 Wallet. We deployed the Splitter contract. All deployments go to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  We funded it with 1000 OCEAN. It will vest until the end of DF Main 1, with an equal amount every&nbsp;week.  We wired it together with the rest of DF stack, including Gelato for Web3 automation.  It now dispenses through components to DF passive &amp; active rewards addresses. Weekly payouts draw from this plus the main DF payment multisig; the latter being far&nbsp;larger.   3.2 Implementation Phase B: Recycling Multisig <p>This phase implements the orange🟧 phase in the image. This phase is complete.</p><p>Here, we simply deployed the recycling multisig wallet. This multisig — and the others — uses <a href="https://safe.global/">Safe</a> (nee Gnosis Safe). The Appendix has multisig&nbsp;details.</p> 3.3 Implementation Phase C: Actions around OCEAN&nbsp;contract <p>This phase implements the yellow🟨 phase in the image. This phase is in progress.</p><p>The OCEAN token contract has 1.41B tokens capped supply. 796,900,859 OCEAN (56.518%) hasn’t been minted yet. It is earmarked for the Ocean community, as&nbsp;follows.</p>  719,100,000 OCEAN (51%) has always been earmarked for community incentives. Of this amount, 503,370,000 OCEAN (70% of the 51%) is for Data Farming with vesting over decades, held by the respective vesting wallets. 215,730,000 OCEAN (30% of the 51%) is for future community incentives projects, held by the 51% multisig&nbsp;wallet.  77,800,859 OCEAN (5.518%) is other community-earmarked OCEAN that hadn’t yet been minted. This will be managed from the the <a href="https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xD5e6219A79C5CC61b9074331D1B05a6f35c5a48a">OceanDAO community wallet</a> (also multisig).  <p>We (Ocean core team) will the following steps to mint remaining OCEAN for the community, and renounce ownership of the OCEAN token contract, by the end of May 2023.

Wire it up side-by-side with Vesting 0 wallet, via Gelato. Fund it with OCEAN. How much to fund: 150,000 OCEAN / week; this depends on # remaining weeks in DF Main 1. (Up to 7,800,000 OCEAN, if it ran for all of DF Main&nbsp;1).  Wait 1+ months to ensure that Vesting A is ok.&nbsp;Then…  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting B wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 2. Send it 7,800,000 OCEAN, such that it dispenses 300,000 OCEAN / week over 52/2&nbsp;weeks.  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting C wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 3. Send it 15,600,000 OCEAN, such that it dispenses 600,000 OCEAN / week over 52/2&nbsp;weeks.  Deploy a VestingWalletHalving contract as the Vesting D wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 4. Send it 472,170,000 OCEAN [1], which dispenses &gt;1.1M OCEAN / week to start, then decays over time according to its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">halving-based schedule</a>.   4.

Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">@oceanprotocol on Twitter</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> 5. Conclusion <p>The Ocean core team will mint the remaining 56.518% OCEAN tokens and transfer them to a multisig where the core team is a minority.</p><p>All of the newly minted OCEAN is for the community, for Data Farming and more. Most of it vests over&nbsp;decades.</p><p>OCEAN token contract will be un-pausable, fully decentralized &amp; censorship-resistant.</p><p>The core team continues to execute on DF Main implementation phases and related OCEAN actions.

 Remaining OCEAN tokens will be minted. OCEAN will be fully decentralized and unpausable. It will vest to community over&nbsp;decades <p>Overview article [this post], technical article [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/control-over-the-ocean-contract-to-be-revoked-soon-technical-77cb8923171">here</a>]. May 25 update: it’s&nbsp;done:)</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is ready to take the next step in our evolution. Our utmost priority is to nurture the Ocean community and protect holders of the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN token</a>. Just as one cautiously feels their way barefoot across a stone riverbed, we have always worked to take the interests of token holders as our priority — taking cautious steps&nbsp;forward.</p> 2. Need for a Native OCEAN&nbsp;Token <p>In the Ocean whitepaper, we envisioned that a Data Economy could be kicked off through the use of programs and incentives that allow people to join the community and contribute meaningfully. Crypto-tokens represent a novel innovation in giving people a small slice of an emerging protocol. Crypto-tokens also can help to align activities amongst a globally dispersed group of people who want to move an idea forward. When used appropriately, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">tokens can help to sustain and drive the growth of protocols</a>.</p> 3. Tokens Nurture the Ocean Community <p>Over the past six years, we have had many programs such as <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Shipyard</a>, <a href="https://oceanambassadors.community/">Ambassadors</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO Grants</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/challenges">Data Challenges</a> to encourage people to explore the value of data and to try out new business ideas. We learned that many of the programs require significant coordination and overhead to weed out scammers and reward true contributors who are aligned with the mission and values of&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>The objective is to encourage independent, non-correlated activities at scale that are the sign of healthy, sustainable protocol communities. Our goal has always been to set up long-term incentive mechanisms that can outlast the involvement of the founding team and serve the interests of the Ocean community.</p><p>We realized that the most responsible way to encourage participation in the network with the least amount of administrative overhead was to tie incentives to the publishing of data assets and algorithms, and real consumption of assets within the Ocean ecosystem. The blockchain doesn’t lie and the truest form of proof is when people put their tokens behind their convictions. The result of this is Data&nbsp;Farming.</p> 4. Data Farming as a Long-Term Sustainable Incentive Program <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">Data Farming</a> incentivizes both active and passive participation in the Ocean ecosystem. Token holders earn OCEAN passively for <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/veocean">locking</a> up their tokens for a fixed time period. Once their OCEAN is locked, they can then actively <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/datafarming">stake</a> the derivative veOCEAN token on data assets, to help signal quality and earn Data Farming rewards. The Data Farming program is being automated so that the administrative overhead is minimal and manageable as adoption of Ocean technology scales.</p><p>With Data Farming in place and road tested for almost one year, a core piece of the incentive puzzle is now in place. Over the next few years, we will improve and secure the mechanism but after nine months of testing Data Farming and the previous years of gingerly testing out incentive programs, we’re now confident that we can finally mint the remaining OCEAN in the token contract to a multi-signature wallet and revoke any pause or destruct capabilities on the OCEAN token contract. By revoking all rights, OCEAN token holders can rest assured that their holdings are completely safe and will live indefinitely on the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p><p>Find out more&nbsp;here.</p> 5. Crypto as a General-Purpose Technology <p>Our hypothesis is that crypto is a general-purpose technology. Crypto is a 14-year-old general purpose technology kicked off in 2009 with Bitcoin and if our hypothesis is correct, the journey to integrate it into society likely requires another 20&nbsp;years.</p><p>In 2005, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Transformations-General-Purpose-Technologies/dp/019929089X">Dr. Lipsey et al</a> posed the idea that all human progress can be attributed to 30 odd technologies that drive innovation and new products. Generally, these technology innovations are so disruptive and wide-reaching, that it takes at least 30 years to weave itself into the fabric of society and become ubiquitous.</p><p>As a comparison, work on the Internet began in the 1960s but it was only in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web that the internet could begin its rapid rise to ubiquity as a consumer and business essential. Counting forward 30 years from 1989, we land at 2019. Most people can agree that by 2019, the Internet was ubiquitous and inseparable from our modern&nbsp;society.</p><p>For Ocean, the interplay between crypto, data and AI is obvious now with the release of ChatGPT, Bard and other large language models (LLMs), and the rate of innovation could happen faster than expected.</p><p>Our core hypothesis at the founding of Ocean was that, in a world where AI agents are economic agents, the means of exchanging value would be over blockchains, smart contracts and crypto&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>AI agents will use web2 services once web2 services integrate with web3 to allow native blockchain based identity and profiles — and delivery of value will be notarized and orchestrated on blockchains, along with the payments.</p><p>These are the reasons why we <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/909793166416662528">launched</a> Ocean Protocol. To give an incentive structure for AI, data and blockchains to work together beside human agents. This is also the reason why we have a long-term, Bitcoin-like emission schedule of OCEAN to encourage the adoption of Ocean technology over time — because these fundamental business and mindset changes take&nbsp;time.</p> 6. Allocation of OCEAN&nbsp;Tokens <p>The <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">Ocean token contract</a> has a maximum cap of 1.41 billion&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>In 2019, 613.1 million OCEAN was minted with the majority of tokens distributed to token acquirors, the Ocean community via grants and Ocean Protocol Foundation for administrative expenses. The single mint in 2019 represented 43.5% of the total allowable token supply, leaving 797 million OCEAN or 56.5% of the token supply remaining to be&nbsp;minted.</p><p>As of May 2023, 100% of the OCEAN token supply will be minted with the proceeds being deposited into oceanDAO multisignature wallets with seven signees. The signees are made up of core Ocean team members, Ocean community members and founders of other web3 projects, with the core team members being in the minority of signees. The final allocation of all 1.41 billion OCEAN is shown in Diagram 1&nbsp;below:</p>Diagram 1: Allocation of Ocean&nbsp;Tokens<p>When 100% of OCEAN is minted, 807 million OCEAN representing 57.2% of the total supply remains to be distributed for Data Farming and incentive programs according to a multi-decade emission schedule. There is also funding for existing community programs and administrative expenses.</p>Diagram 2: As indicated by the dotted line, 57.2% (807 million) Ocean Tokens remain undistributed as of 5/2023. The rest of the OCEAN tokens have been distributed. 7. Inflation Rate of the OCEAN Token&nbsp;Supply <p>There will be no major injection of OCEAN into the circulating supply at this stage. The number of tokens disbursed will be gradually ratcheted up in lockstep with adoption, so the inflation rate in the OCEAN token supply will be at a level to attract new participants while protecting existing&nbsp;holders.</p><p>The main source of token inflation moving forward occurs as part of the oceanDAO Data Farming program. The emission schedule is modelled on Bitcoin and serves as a long-term, multi-decade program to incentivize passive and active participation in the Ocean ecosystem. Most importantly, Data Farming is designed to be automated with little or no intervention from the core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The Data Farming program has been running for nine (9) months and we have given ourselves an additional 2 years to test and harden Data Farming. If the adoption requires more time or the incentive mechanisms need more time to mature, less OCEAN will be disbursed.</p><p>Assuming the mechanisms work as designed and adoption of Ocean Protocol tools proceeds as planned, the maximum disbursement of Ocean to the curators and network starts in late-2025 and continues for 4 years (Diagram 3). At peak emissions in Year 2, the inflation rate would be 8% — 52 million OCEAN emitted into a total liquid supply of approximately 650 million OCEAN. At the first halvening at Year 6 (Week 330), the emission rate falls to 500,000 OCEAN per week and the resulting the inflation rate drops to&nbsp;3%.</p>Diagram 3: Data Farming Emission&nbsp;Schedule<p>You can find out more about Data Farming and the emission schedule&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">here</a>.</p><p>We believe that crypto-adoption will continue but between now and 2025, there are broader macro-economic headwinds due to existing global disruptions, the ongoing banking crisis and unsustainable national debt loads. In 2 Years, the adoption of AI and web3 technologies could be ripe and align with the ratcheting up of OCEAN token emissions to capitalize on the long-term trend.</p> 8. Valuation of the OCEAN Token Ecosystem <p>With the current circulating supply of OCEAN at 605 million, the value of the network is $200 million assuming today’s price of $0.33/OCEAN.</p><p>With the minting of the remaining 56.5% of the supply to reach maximum cap, the fully diluted value of the Ocean network is $465 million. Meanwhile, the OCEAN token contract is fully decentralized, censorship-resistant and can no longer be paused or destroyed.</p><p>The Ocean core team will notify the main coin portals CoinMarketCap and Coingecko and provide quarterly updates to the token supply so that community members can rely on&nbsp;them.</p><p>AMA. To field questions by the community, the Ocean core team will hold an AMA about the OCEAN actions, on May 25 at 12.30 UTC. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">@oceanprotocol on Twitter</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> 9. Upwards and&nbsp;Onwards <p>Trent and Masha McConaghy <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ascribe-for-nft-archaeologists-17ca5481d206">posed the question</a> 10 years ago on whether digital art could truly be owned, traded and transparently tracked. This exploration led directly to Ocean Protocol - a realization that AI, data and blockchains were naturally suited to unlock immense value and human potential.</p><p>No one can predict the future, but if the past is any indicator, many of our initial hypothesis’ were proven correct with the rise of NFTs, decentralized markets for tokens and an explosion of AI + data startups.</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN token</a> is a fundamental part of the Ocean ecosystem. With this minting of OCEAN tokens and the revocation of all control over the OCEAN token contract, it’s now up to all Ocean community members (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051#">including the core team</a>) to imbue value in the token through real technology advances and real adoption one data scientist and user at a&nbsp;time.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Ping Identity is excited to see our customers, partners, and other IAM leaders at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/events/identiverse.html">Identiverse 2023</a> in Las Vegas from May 26th to June 2nd.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>So, what does the Entertainment Capital of the World and Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) have in common? Las Vegas casinos and CIAM programs both aim to balance security and convenience by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Delivering delightful customer experiences while managing risk</p>
 
 <p>Verifying the identity of customers and authorizing transactions</p>
 
 <p>Profiling and progressively getting to know customers to understand preferences, connect them to services they desire, and provide benefits</p>
 
 <p>Guiding customers on a journey from unknown to loyal</p>
 
 <p>Evaluating behavior to separate the bad actors from the good</p>
 
 <p>Protecting against fraud, counterfeiting, and impersonation</p>
 
 <p>Supporting omnichannel experiences across physical locations (casinos) and digital properties (gambling apps)</p>
 
 <p>Ensuring resiliency across operations</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's digital-first world, we must strongly identify, authenticate, and authorize users in order to boost security and protect our customers. This is true whether you’re an online business or a casino on the strip. Hackers and fraudsters, like casino cheaters, are constantly changing tactics to steal money. We must aggressively and purposefully consider new solutions and different approaches to stay one step ahead and prevent fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat threats, more companies are offering multi-factor authentication (MFA) options to safeguard users. And their customers are noticing! Surveys indicate consumers put more trust in brands that offer additional security measures. To meet this expectation, businesses should build consumer adaptive MFA into digital services and leverage it as an eventual springboard to passwordless. Or, if possible, companies should leapfrog right to passwordless for new and existing customers. We need to use tools like MFA to slow down suspicious users when risk is high and, conversely, speed up trusted customers when risk is low, striking the elusive balance between security and convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "playing with house money" basically means gambling without risk of loss. This is not the case with most digital relationships today. Casinos employ experts to&nbsp; simultaneously profile and surveil their customers to separate good actors from suspected bad actors. Similarly, the latest threat detection tools can evaluate risk signals in real time throughout the user session to determine trust and ensure valid users can transact quickly and easily. That way, your business won’t have to gamble on possible fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the threats that Vegas casinos face are as vast and varied as the digital threats facing businesses today. We all must focus on securing people, businesses, and transactions without sacrificing experience to grow loyalty and revenue. It’s the only way to give our customers extraordinary experiences that keep them coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his keynote speech on the opening day of Identiverse titled <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361523/">Identity Under Attack</a>, Andre Durand, Ping’s Founder &amp; CEO, will discuss how AI is changing cybersecurity. We also invite you to join us at the Founders Party at On the Record inside of Park MGM on June 1st from 7:00–11:00 PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, don’t miss an opportunity to give back at Identiverse with our latest Ping4Good initiative! Summer may have just started, but local charities are gearing up to support families in need by providing them with classroom materials. That’s why Ping Identity is partnering with A Precious Child to provide 3rd-5th grade students school supplies, and all attendees at Identiverse can help! Just stop by the Ping Identity Booth (Booth 1303) to build a bag for kids in need.</p>

<p>When it comes to Zero Trust, the conversation has moved from being a nebulous term several years ago to a well-understood framework with a true north that has broad acceptance across the cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>That said, confusion abounds among C-suite executives and boards. If you walked around the exhibition at the 2023 RSA Conference, you could hear from a networking specialist that Zero Trust is all about IP, and then from an identity vendor that it’s all about credentials. Defining Zero Trust narrowly runs the risk of creating a false sense of security – if you just secure the network or the credentials, you’re done with the Zero Trust journey.</p>
<p>That’s why the recent release of the latest <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/zero-trust-maturity-model">CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> in April 2023 provided a much-needed reference point for government agencies as well as enterprises on how to develop Zero Trust strategies. Zero Trust is broader than any one vendor’s solution. It is an approach that can govern user identity and access management (IAM), and access and security of devices, networks, application workloads, and data, with a risk-based access control model that can be implemented across an organization’s entire user base and IT stack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model Pillars</p>
<p>When we talk to our customers, we talk about Zero Trust foundations. Regardless of which vendors you choose, Zero Trust is a journey, one that you can track along the maturity model. This includes making sure you’re securing the network and credentials – for humans, machines, and applications. In today’s post-perimeter environment, it means implementing dynamic authentication that is verified rather than assumed and secures your data assets with encryption and key management best practices, and ensuring development code is signed and approved.</p>
<p>In fact, that last item is a great case in point when it comes to these potential Zero Trust blind spots that arise when you don’t think holistically. When developing applications, code is brought in via APIs, libraries, and repositories and analysis shows us that as much of 70% of an organization’s code is assembled rather than written. An application deployed within an organization and the software bill of materials that make them up aren’t always thought of when it comes to Zero Trust planning, but they absolutely should be. How you certify code that comes from outside your organization and the risk profile you apply to it should be part of that framework.</p>
<p>Ultimately the shift in thinking boils down to moving from the idea of trust to verification. So instead of trusted identities and applications we have verified identities and applications. The second part of that shift is the delta, the change over time, which means we don’t just verify once, but continuously. This is change that can be measured over time, geography, and access entitlement and that is aligned with the risk profile for any given user, machine, or application.</p>
<p>This approach is a reflection of the Zero Trust maturity model, which has gained significant attention from cybersecurity professionals and organizations alike. For most organizations, the current state of Zero Trust maturity is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>We recognize that implementing a Zero Trust security model requires a significant investment of time and resources. It involves assessing the current state of security controls and infrastructure, identifying gaps and weaknesses, and developing a plan to address those gaps. While many have a long way to go before they can claim to have a fully mature Zero Trust security posture, there are excellent resources available to help map out that journey, as well as partners like Entrust that can offer the guidance and broad portfolio needed to get there.</p>

<p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been on a mission from day one to provide every individual with a digital identity that they own and control. Last year, we took that one step further, giving users the ability to own and control their money with the <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/launchpad-the-all-new-globalid-wallet-768cd26357c0">release of our non-custodial wallet</a>.</p><p>It’s also why, today, we’re announcing that we’re transitioning to the Universal Namespace. This will allow users to own and control a unique name associated with their digital identity through an independent third-party namespace rather than one managed by GlobaliD.</p><p>A namespace is simply a set of unique names that are tied to different types of things so they can be easily identified. In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System or DNS namespace tied domain names to relevant IP addresses so that people could easily find the websites they were looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>The concept of a namespace is key to the mainstreaming of digital <br>identity — just as it was for the mainstreaming of the internet. The early internet was a fragmented mess. The only way to find anything was through hard-to-memorize IP addresses. With the arrival of DNS, we could now visit wikipedia.com rather than 80.190.205.15.</p><p>In a sense, the DNS namespace made the internet more&nbsp;human.</p><p>The same goes for digital identity, which is even more complex than simply visiting a website. Someone you want to interact with may have many public keys, URLs, or platform accounts you need to keep track of. Now, all you need is their unique&nbsp;name.</p><p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been thinking deeply about namespaces over the last few years — we <a href="https://medium.com/@_globalid/globalid-white-paper-the-namespace-for-identity-6b755afbe42f">published our first white paper on the subject</a> in the beginning of 2019. As an early mover in the digital identity space, we’ve often had to come up with original concepts and terms in order to help develop and push the industry&nbsp;forward.</p><p>That’s also been the case when it came to a namespace for identity. As such, we originally built a namespace in-house. But the long term vision was always for the namespace to be managed independently outside of GlobaliD. That’s something we laid out in our white paper. Ultimately, we believe the namespace should be a public&nbsp;good.</p><p>We now have the opportunity to make that vision a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this is a big step toward interoperability with other digital identity platforms. For instance, GlobaliD may support additional namespaces in the future, giving users a choice over their service provider. Regardless of which namespace you choose, your unique name will always be attached to a verifiable credential that you&nbsp;control.</p><p>In all, this is an incredibly exciting evolution for GlobaliD’s digital identity offering.</p><p>The transition will require one additional step for you, the user, but we truly believe that the end destination — where individuals control their name, their identity, and their money — is worth the&nbsp;effort.</p><p>The simplest way for this transition to work is for existing users to re-onboard with GlobaliD and claim a new name through the Universal Namespace.</p><p>This transition does mean that users will lose their existing identity history on the platform once they re-onboard with a new name. That includes things like chat history, vouches, and verifications.</p><p>This wasn’t an easy decision to make and we’re incredibly empathetic to our early adopters, but ultimately, it became clear that this was the best path forward, one most aligned with our values and&nbsp;vision.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this clean slate is also an opportunity for us to provide major upgrades to our messaging and wallet platforms as well as a bevy of new features that will arrive with our next generation digital identity platforms, which will be released in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>In the meantime, users will still be able to access their wallets via their private key, but they will no longer be able to access it through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>For now, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> (/uns) to reserve your unique name. Make sure you sign in with the same phone number you’ll use with GlobaliD so that we can link your name to your GlobaliD identity.</p><p>You should also keep an eye out for notifications from the current GlobaliD app that will include prompts and instructions which will help you throughout the re-onboarding process.</p><p>In all, we’ve got plenty in store for all of you in&nbsp;2023.</p> Q&amp;A   Will I be able to keep any part of my current digital identity?<br>No, you will lose access to all of the data that was associated with your old name including chat history, groups you joined, and funds in your wallet. However, you can transfer funds out of your wallet now before the transition takes place, or you can use your keys to move your entire wallet to another non-custodial client. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our support team for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery&nbsp;key.  Will I be able to keep my old username?<br>No. The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a new service which will manage GlobaliD names moving forward. All existing users of GlobaliD will re-onboard with UNS by claiming a name on this separate, independent namespace. Because UNS has been managed independently of GlobaliD, some names have already been reserved and owners of GlobaliD names may not have their names available on UNS. If your old name is available in UNS, then you can claim it and re-onboard using that&nbsp;name.  Will the Universal Namespace reserve my existing name?<br>No. You need to reserve your new name on your own. You will be able to do this within the updated GlobaliD app upon release, but you do not have to wait. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website.  What if I have money or assets in my GlobaliD Wallet?<br>You will need to transfer funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet by May 30, 2023 in order to maintain access to your money. Alternatively, you can export your wallet recovery phrase to host your wallet with another app. A new wallet tied to your username will be made available to you upon release of the updated GlobaliD&nbsp;app.  What is the Universal Namespace?<br>The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a discoverability platform that enables people to securely connect their online accounts and data with a unique name. With UNS, users can determine how they are found online by building a public profile that connects all of their digital identities to one universal name they own and control — making it easier for them to be discovered across different ecosystems. UNS is managed independently of GlobaliD and provides name services to multiple providers, in addition to GlobaliD. You can obtain a name by signing up with your phone number on the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace website</a>.  Can I export any of my data before it is deleted?<br>Yes. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our <a href="mailto:support@global.id">support team</a> for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery key. Otherwise, go to your Wallet tab and tap on the key icon in the upper right-hand corner to get your wallet recovery phrase. You can also contact our support team if you would like us to export your chat history. All other data such as your credentials, verifications, and public bio information will be&nbsp;lost.  What is the deadline to reserve my new username and transfer funds from my wallet?<br>We will release the updated GlobaliD app within the next few weeks and notify you when it is available so that you can re-onboard. However, you do not have to wait for this release in order to claim your new name. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website. You can also go ahead and transfer the funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet in order to maintain access to your&nbsp;money.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-universal-namespace-3bbe51b2701c">Introducing the Universal Namespace</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As more enterprises move to hybrid cloud environments, hybrid cloud security has become imperative to business growth. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/hybrid-cloud-business-value">According to a 2021 study by the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV),</a> 80% of executives expected their organizations to operate more than 10 distinct clouds by 2023, up from eight in 2020. “The scale of most enterprise hybrid cloud deployments is so vast and penetrates so deeply that the need for an all-in security culture is absolute,” says Shue-Jane Thompson, managing partner at IBM Consulting. “And it should emphasize the business case for security.”</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Read IBM’s “Cost of a data breach 2022” report</a>



<p>Security is fast becoming a conversation about empowerment versus just protection. The IBV study “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/security-cyber-economy">Prosper in the cyber economy</a>” found that 66% of business executives view cybersecurity primarily as a revenue enabler. This requires shifting from a defensive strategy, built on detection and response, to a mature security posture that emphasizes operational efficiency, financial performance and competitiveness. Instead of thinking about security as a traditional expenditure for your organization, approach it as something that can become a value proposition for partners and end customers.</p>



<blockquote>“Customers are buying security as a program. They believe security is not just bought as a small portion of the system or the application they are building.”</blockquote>



<p>Thompson points to companies that leverage security as a revenue source by charging a premium for highly secured services or products. “More and more, security is becoming a standalone procurement,” she says. “Customers are buying security as a program. They believe security is not just bought as a small portion of the system or the application they are building. They believe security must be managed and controlled across the total asset.”</p>



<p>Moving from a defensive stance to an offensive strategy starts with understanding trends in the security landscape. A wider adoption of hybrid cloud naturally presents important concerns due to the vast web of interconnectivity between public and private cloud platforms. Many cloud-based environments rely on Linux for their operations, and in 2022, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence/">IBM Security X-Force reported dramatic increases in Linux malware</a>. Threat actors are also blending malware with legitimate traffic on cloud-based messaging and storage platforms and targeting Docker containers, which are often used in platform-as-a-service cloud solutions.</p>



<p>“The biggest challenge for security is the complexity, the scale and the velocity at which it needs to operate. Organizations need a heterogeneous security policy that they can also bring down to market level,” Thompson says. International organizations, for example, need security strategies that can satisfy the regulations of every country in which they operate, meet specific customer demands and stay ahead of business-specific threats, whether from broad DoS attacks or sophisticated, targeted phishing. The proliferation of hybrid cloud environments means organizations now have a larger attack surface. Cybercrime will continue to rise, and attacks on these environments are costly and tough to detect. According to IBM’s “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Cost of a data breach 2022” report</a>, it takes an average of 252 days for an organization to identify and contain a breach that occurred in a hybrid cloud environment, and the average cost is USD 3.8 million compared to USD 4.24 million for private cloud breaches and USD 5.02 million for breaches in public clouds.</p>



<blockquote>Individual accountability is crucial in hybrid cloud environments, especially as ransomware spikes, with an attack occurring every 11 seconds.</blockquote>



<p>Adding more controls or point solutions is not enough for organizations that want to tap the business benefits of a “security first” mindset. Organizations need orchestration, continuous threat management and resiliency. Two primary enablers: educated employees and sophisticated security solutions. Per data <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/2022-data-breach-investigations-report-dbir.pdf">from a 2022 Verizon report</a>, as many as 8 in 10 security breaches are caused by human error. As Thompson says, “How will you be able to help humans make better decisions? That’s where the transformation in culture becomes important.” Here’s what these transformations can look like in organizations that want to embrace a security-first mindset as a business differentiator.</p>



 The human factor: from passive participation to personal accountability 



<p>Individual accountability and proactive security enhancements at every level are crucial in hybrid cloud environments, especially as ransomware spikes, with an attack occurring every 11 seconds. As organizations integrate cybersecurity strategies into business objectives, Thompson says every individual must see themself as being on the front lines of upholding stronger security practices, whether that means raising community awareness or training colleagues.</p>



<blockquote>“Chasing after compliance regulations and spending all your energy to check off boxes is not the best way to use your cyber talent.”</blockquote>



<p>A more mature security posture also requires a more robust cyber workforce. The threat landscape is more drastic than ever, with cyberattacks targeting everything from customer data to power grids. &nbsp;According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM Security’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023</a>, there was an 100% increase in hijacking attempts per month in 2022 compared to 2021. Yet, the demand for cybersecurity professionals outpaces what the labor market can fulfill. According to this <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study">Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a>, there is a global cybersecurity workforce gap of 3.4 million people. To help prepare more workers for those vital roles, organizations need to invest in cybersecurity upskilling and AI and automation tools.</p>



<p>IBM, for example, is training more than <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-prioritize-cybersecurity-now-arvind-krishna/">150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over the next three years</a> through a range of programs, such as SkillsBuild. Meanwhile, AI, machine learning and automation can process huge amounts of complex security data to predict or detect threats. “Organizations spend a large number of resources trying to deal with compliance issues,” Thompson says. “Chasing after compliance regulations and spending all your energy to check off boxes is not the best way to use your cyber talent.” AI automation tools can facilitate more efficient evaluation and review procedures, perform sensitive data discoveries and support monitoring. “If organizations invest in smart automation, they can then move resources and assets to invest in more proactive defensive mechanisms,” Thompson says.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/security">Manage risk with IBM cybersecurity solutions</a>



<blockquote>“You need total transparency on how your assets, workflows, data flows and users—plus partners in your ecosystem—are functioning.”</blockquote>



 The tech factor: from vertical silos to horizontal integration 



<p>On the technology side, the goal is “having a single pane of glass across the hybrid cloud environment,” Thompson says. “You need total transparency on how your assets, workflows, data flows and users—plus partners in your ecosystem—are functioning.”</p>



<p>Smart and networked devices are becoming ubiquitous, yet existing security models are often designed only to protect the endpoint and the data center with technologies like firewalls. That “walled garden” security model must change to one that orchestrates security technology throughout the business (and ideally, through to ecosystem partners) to ensure protection across all devices and touchpoints. Finally, your technology should detect and contain attacks with effective <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/soar/six-steps-for-incident-response/">organization-wide incident responses</a>.</p>



<p>This unified approach creates “a fabric of protection” that envelops the organization, Thompson says, and becomes a value proposition. That level of coordination will be even more vital for certain industries. For example, a growing portion of the USD 1 trillion hybrid cloud market opportunity comprises the financial markets industry, which has strict data ownership and handling requirements built around security and regulation compliance.</p>



<p>The emerging security challenges are considerable, and data security is an ongoing battle. But the solutions are attainable, and the company’s bottom line is the first beneficiary. “Security is a team sport,” Thompson says, “and we’re all on that team.”</p>

Note 1: Inspiration for this blog post was taken from a conversation I had with Tim Bouma about the role of digital wallets</p>
<p>Note 2: I made some edits on 5/26 and removed mentions of voltage, as they were not suited for the analogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 An Analogy for better understanding interoperability requirements for Issuers, Verifiers and Holder Wallets 
<p>As I prepare for an upcoming trip from Canada to Europe, I’m reminded of the different power standards between continents. As usual, I will be carrying my laptop and phone, with their chargers, along with an essential universal travel adapter to keep them powered up while I’m there.</p>
<p>This is how it will all work so that I can seamlessly use my devices while I’m abroad:</p>
<p>The European electrical socket, my source of power while abroad, varies in shape, and frequency compared to what I’m used to back home in Canada. It’s the origin of the electrical energy I need to charge my devices.</p>
 <p>Various electrical sockets</p> 
<p>My universal travel adapter is the unsung hero of my tech travel kit. It’s designed to connect with the European electrical socket, which differs from Canadian standards (European outlets often have two round pins, while Canadian plugs typically have two flat parallel pins with a grounding pin).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don’t have to worry! My universal travel adapter will allow my devices to consume electricity from the power sockets.</p>
<p>Switching gears for a minute..</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we’ve been recently experimenting with various credential profiles and credential exchange protocols. We’ve come to understand that different use cases necessitate distinct standards and technological choices. This work has led us to think deeply about the interoperability between different parties involved in credential exchanges.</p>
<p>As a company, we have a strong background in the Hyperledger Aries and <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/anoncreds-anonymous-credentials-with-stephen-curran/">AnonCreds</a> world, a topic on which we’ve shared some writings (<a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/learnings-from-aries-indy-and-various-verifiable-credential-implementations/">here</a> and <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/aip-2-interoperability/">here</a>). We have also contributed towards multiple open source Aries RFCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, through collaboration with some partners of ours in the digital identity community, we’ve been broadening our scope of support. This includes exchanging various credential profiles by supporting new specifications like <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">OpenID4VC</a>, both for issuances and presentations. We are at varying stages in our implementations of both these protocols. Further in collaboration with our partner, Canadian Bank Note, we’ve been recently working on demonstrating interoperability between DIDComm-based RFCs and the Mobile Driver’s Licence standard. We’ve written about the motivation and reasoning behind our mDL interoperability work with them <a href="https://northernblock.io/announcement/unifying-mdls-and-verifiable-credentials/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now..</p>
<p>Keeping all this in mind, let’s use the example of electrical sockets, my devices, and universal travel adapter as a comparison to understand how different parts interact in digital credential exchanges. This comparison also helps us understand what interoperability means for everyone involved.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Issuers 
<p></p>
<p>In this analogy, the European electrical socket is akin to an issuer of digital credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issuers generate and provide signed data that they’re authorized to issue, which can come in various formats.</p>
<p>Issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format without being forced to adhere to a specific standard, similar to the electrical socket in a specific country, which provides power according to its local standards without needing to conform to the formats used elsewhere. One issuer may pick AnonCreds and another may pick JSON-LD to issue a similar credential.</p>
<p>Each issuer’s specific use case plays a significant role in the choice of technology. For instance, a transportation ministry issuing mobile driving licences would have different needs and considerations than an issuer of organizational-related claims. Each issuer’s primary intended use case shapes their unique needs (e.g., importance of authenticity, confidentiality, privacy, security) and requirements, and thus, they select the technology and format that best aligns with these needs. Similar to the way my electrical socket in Canada follows its own standard, issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format, based on their main use case, without being forced to conform to a uniform standard.</p>
<p>The issuer’s role is considered more streamlined because they can maintain a consistent issuance method and format that doesn’t need to adapt to the formats used by other issuers. This is much like how an electrical socket in a specific country, such as Canada, maintains its own consistent standard, without needing to adapt to the differing standards of sockets in other countries, like those in Europe.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Verifiers 
<p></p>
<p>Next, my devices – my laptop and phone – represent the verifier in the digital credentialing scenario. They need the credentials in a form that they can understand and accept, much like how they need power through a specific power adapter.</p>
<p>The verifier, based on its business and other requirements, decides what type credential format the holder needs to provide to them – they place restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrictions are independent from how the issuer issued a credential. Similar to how devices like laptops or phones require specific types of electrical input from a power socket. The power source or the power socket doesn’t determine the power requirements of the device. Rather, the device itself dictates what kind of power it needs, independent of the supply available from the socket.</p>
<p>When the wallet can provide the credential that fits the verifier’s requirements, it’s like my devices perfectly fitting into an electrical socket with a universal adapter. Everything works seamlessly.</p>
<p>However, if the wallet can’t meet the restrictions, the verifier must decide if it should adjust its requirements. This is similar to the scenario where my phone or laptop plug doesn’t fit the socket. Here, I would need to adjust or use a different adapter.</p>
<p>When credential proofs are presented by the holder, the verifier checks if they conform to its restrictions. If not, they won’t work properly and could even get damaged. Similarly, a verifier ensures the presented credentials meet their criteria for a secure and valid transaction.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Holders/Wallets 
<p></p>
<p>If we assume issuers will typically pick one issuance method for their credentials, and verifiers may place restrictions for what they deem acceptable to be presented based on their context, then there needs to be something that facilitates this interoperability, or conversion.</p>
<p>The role of my universal travel adapter mirrors that of the digital identity wallet in this scenario. Just as the adapter transforms any incoming power into a form my devices can use, the digital wallet receives these varying credentials from the issuer, manages them, and converts into acceptable formats when requested, ensuring that none of the original credential’s attributes or values are lost in the conversion process.</p>
<p>The holder’s wallet has the most complex role in this ecosystem. It needs to be able to receive, store, and manage credentials from multiple issuers, each potentially using a different credential format, likened to the role of my universal travel adapter, converting ‘power’ from various formats into a form that the device can use.</p>
<p>This allows the holder to present these credentials to verifiers in a format they can understand and accept, much like how my universal travel adapter enables me to plug my Canadian devices into European sockets, converting the European power standards into a format my devices can safely use and accept. The adapter ensures compatibility between different power grids and devices without the user needing to know the specifics. This is similar to how a wallet operates.</p>
<p>The wallet is essential for maintaining the separation between the issuer and the verifier. It eliminates the need for coordination between every issuer and verifier, even if they use different technologies or standards. The issuer might use any format, and the verifier may require any format, but the wallet provides the interoperability that allows the verifier to distance itself from the issuer, thus preserving privacy.<br>
<br><br></p>
 If The Analogy Is True, Then What? 
<p>I do think the analogy of a universal plug adapter aptly depicts the role of the holder’s wallet in the exchange of digital credentials. Much like the adapter, which ensures compatibility between diverse power grids and devices, a wallet manages credentials of varying formats, serving as a vital bridge between the issuer and the verifier.</p>
<p>Just like a plug adapter’s role, the wallet allows for seamless interoperability, shielding the verifier from the specifics of the issuer’s credential format. This operational separation, facilitated by wallets, grants scalability to the system, removing the need for direct coordination between all issuers and verifiers, regardless of the technologies or standards they employ.</p>
<p>However, such conversion isn’t a straightforward process..</p>
<p> Research is required to understand and safeguard the credential’s attributes and values during the transformation. For example, if a credential loses its privacy-preserving features during conversion, we need to clearly communicate this potential loss to the user.</p>
<p>Moreover, the complexity of transformation depends on the credential format. Some formats, like AnonCreds, Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens (SD-JWT), and MSO (ISO/IEC 18013-5), offer more enriched data structures than others such as JSON-LD.</p>
<p>For instance, AnonCreds and SD-JWT are rich formats where every element can be individually signed, facilitating selective disclosures. However, this feature also makes them heavier to process. In contrast, converting a rich format into a simpler one like JSON-LD doesn’t pose an issue, as there’s no loss of information. But a reverse conversion is more difficult because not every claim is signed by the issuer in JSON-LD format.</p>
<p>I hope this further underscores the need for in-depth research to understand the dynamics of different credential formats and to develop robust interoperability frameworks. </p>
<p>While we allow the standards to evolve naturally, we must focus on ensuring these frameworks can accommodate and seamlessly convert between all these formats without compromising the credential’s integrity or the issuer’s integrity.</p>
<p>Interoperability is the key here, and that’s where the research should be directed. We should let the standards evolve as they are, but there must be an effort to develop interoperability frameworks.</p>
<p>We can take inspiration from the hardware industry, where plug and play really works. We need to make our systems truly interoperable, just like hardware devices.</p>
<p>Proposed Call to Actions</p>
 
 Advance Interoperability Research: Interoperability, or the ability of different systems or components to work together, is a key concern in the realm of digital credentials. Currently, there are multiple protocols and formats, such as DIDComm, OpenID4VC protocols, and MDL formats. The need for research in this area is to understand how these different formats can interact and be converted without loss of integrity, information or functionality. This would allow for smoother interactions between holders and verifiers, regardless of their chosen credential format. 
 Improve Wallet Versatility: Digital wallets play a crucial role as they need to support and manage credentials in multiple formats. Just as a universal travel adapter can accept plugs from different countries and convert the power into a usable form, the digital wallet needs to be versatile enough to accept, convert, and manage various credential formats. This is a challenging aspect that requires ongoing research and development. 
 Analyze Credential Format Conversion: As different credential formats might prioritize different aspects (e.g., privacy, security, usability), it’s essential to understand what might be lost or gained during the conversion process. This involves deep technical analysis and understanding of the different credential protocols.

<p>Employee Access Management is the use of identity and access management (IAM) to provide employees with secure access to organisational systems and resources. It is also known as Workforce Access Management. These employee access management systems ensure that the right people have (only) the necessary access to the tools and resources needed to complete their jobs. Access levels are usually based on job roles or management levels within the company.</p>
 Importance of Employee Access Management 
<p>Secure and effective employee access management is critical to safeguarding internal and sensitive organisational information. It helps to mitigate information security risks, protect data and ensure regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>With the significant increase in hybrid and remote working since the pandemic, employee access management systems can enable employees to work from anywhere while still accessing applications securely. When remote employees access systems without an appropriate access management system, it risks leaving vulnerabilities within the system for hackers to find and take advantage of. This leads to data breaches, which has severe financial consequences and causes damage to the organisation’s reputation.</p>
<p>The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regulations meant that companies needed to re-assess data access internally. When all employees have access to sensitive information, including where it is not necessary to their role, it increases the risk of (accidental or purposeful) misuse of data. Implementing employee access management systems that allow access to sensitive information on an individual basis, or based on attributes like job roles, helps to reduce this risk. This is known as the Principle of Least Privilege.</p>
<p>Jenny Radcliffe, aka The People Hacker, joined the Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast to discuss social engineering and the importance of protecting your organisation. In the episode, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/social-engineering-jenny-radcliffe/" title="Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer">Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer</a>, Jenny discusses how hackers find and exploit vulnerabilities within organisations’ systems, and how identity products can improve the barriers to this happening. However, Jenny also touches on the importance on User Experience (UX) within these systems. Proper UX will ensure that while the software improves security, it should also not be too complicated, or make tasks more difficult.</p>
 Understanding Employee Access Management Requirements 
<p>When investing in access management systems, the software must support all the requirements of the organisation. An evaluation of your access needs can help to build a clear picture of your solution requirements. Factors to consider include:</p>
 
 Access requirements: user management, remote working, single sign-on. 
 Increased security: authentication needs, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), authorisation. 
 Improved productivity: reduced friction for remote workers, self-service credentials. 
 
<p>These are just a few factors that may affect your solution requirements. Learn more about these system options on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/workforce-access-management/" title="Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page">Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page</a>.</p>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems provide a centralised platform to manage access, authenticate users, and support connection to identity standards applications. Additional authentication, such as MFA, adds an extra layer of security by requesting that employees provide additional verification factors beyond passwords. Privileged access management (PAM) tools enable organisations to monitor and control privileged accounts, minimising the risk of insider threats.</p>
 Balancing Security and Usability 
<p>A key factor when looking to implement employee access management is getting the ideal balance between security and user experience. Strict access controls help to withstand external risks and comply with regulations, but if your employee access management solution is overly complex it can hinder productivity. Finding a user friendly and seamless solution that offers timely support for issues is fundamental for finding the balance between security and usability.</p>
<p>IAM software that is developed to also provide services for external users – aka Customer IAM (CIAM) – ensure such features are particularly user friendly and can cater for all remote working access scenarios as well.</p>
<p>This is where Ubisecure can help, with our Employee Access Management solutions tailored to suit your company’s access requirements. While placing importance on robust security, we also understand the need for user friendly solutions, simplifying complex identity and access requirements for workforce, B2C and B2B interactions. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="Contact us">Contact us</a> to find out more about Employee Access Management.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>When I recorded this podcast with Wenjing, I was initially hesitant to delve too deeply into the current state of generative AI. The pace at which this field is evolving is astounding, with significant advancements appearing nearly every week. Even in the past couple of weeks since we recorded this podcast, numerous new products have been released. A notable example is Google’s generative AI chat product, Google Bard, which is rapidly gaining recognition as a strong competitor to ChatGPT.</p>
<blockquote><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.</p></blockquote>
<p>For that reason, in our conversation I aimed to focus on more overarching “evergreen” topics that would remain relevant despite the rapid progression of these Generative AI products. I wanted this discussion to retain its value not only for this week but for time to come.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this conversation was first sparked by my personal experience with these AI tools. Further, at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in April, I attended a session hosted by Wenjing on “Digital Trust in the Age of AI.” This session triggered many thoughts for me about the impact of AI on digital identity and trust, as well as the intersection between advancements in digital trust and the benefits and potential risks of AI. We both decided it would be interesting to have a longer discussion in a podcast format!</p>
<p>We began our conversation with the parable of the blind men and the elephant. In this story, a group of blind men encounter an elephant for the first time. Each touches a different part of the elephant and describes it based on their limited, individual experience. This leads to disagreements about the elephant’s true nature, illustrating how a singular perspective can limit one’s understanding of a larger concept.</p>
 <p>Image taken from Sophia Tepe’s “The Blind Men and the Elephant” blog post on Medium.</p> 
<p>This parable is relevant when considering artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a complex, multifaceted field. Individuals often form opinions on it based on their personal experiences and knowledge, potentially resulting in a limited or skewed understanding, much like the blind men’s perception of the elephant.</p>
<p>For this, it is important that we have more nuanced discussions about the perceived positives and negatives of such a disruptive new technology.</p>
<p>Some of the topics discussed between Wenjing and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Exponential Data Growth and AI Systems: Discussion centered around how the volume of data, particularly from AI systems like GPT-4, is exponentially increasing. As AI starts generating more content, this could create a feedback loop leading to astronomical levels of content. 
 Interaction with LLM as Protocol: The question arose whether the pre-trained Language Model (LLM) could be equated to a protocol and if individuals might interact directly with the LLM in the future. 
 Digital Identity and Trust in the Age of AI and Deepfakes: Concerns were discussed regarding the rise of AI and deepfakes, particularly their implications for digital identity and trust. The challenges of bi-directional authentication and the potential risk to content-based authentication methods were highlighted. 
 Future of Digital Trust Protocols and Authentication: The potential of AI to generate content was related to the future of digital trust protocols. The necessity of digital signatures for authentication was suggested as a possible direction for the future. 
 Reframing Identity: A broader understanding of identity was proposed, questioning whether a reframing of identity could influence our understanding of concepts like authentication. 
 Trust in AI Bots vs. Humans: Personal observations on the level of trust in AI bots vs. humans were shared, suggesting a quicker formation of trust with bots. The implications for future human-bot relationships were considered. 
 Potential Risks and Benefits of Technological Advancements: The discussion acknowledged both potential risks and substantial benefits of technological advancements. A greater level of trust in bots due to perceived lesser risk was noted, along with a significant move towards open source models in the digital trust space. 
 Open-source Model for LLMs and Other Systems: The pros and cons of adopting an open-source model for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other complex systems were questioned.

 With a gaming regulatory framework that has more similarities with Europe than other Canadian provinces, is the Ontario market the natural step for European operators to expand to? 



 



<p>Ever since April 2022, when Ontario opened the iGaming market to private gaming operators, the province’s regulatory framework has been highly lauded and well-regarded in the international gaming community. </p>



<p>Managed by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/">the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>, there is no limit to the number of private gaming operators that can compete in the province.</p>



<p>There are currently <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">45 regulated operators</a> in Ontario that comply with Ontario’s high standards of game integrity and player&nbsp;protections. The&nbsp;AGCO&nbsp;has approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the&nbsp;province in the last year alone.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">study conducted in March 2023</a>, over 85% of respondents who had gambled in Ontario in 2023 had done so via regulated sites. This is an impressive majority, especially considering that around 70% of all online gambling was done so via unregulated sites before the launch of the open market.</p>



<blockquote><p>Since its launch in April 2022, Ontario’s igaming market has displaced the existing unregulated market and made Ontario an internationally recognized leader in this industry. We are truly proud of this strong, responsible, competitive online gaming model.</p>Doug Downey, Attorney General of Ontario.</blockquote>



<p>One of the most pivotal steps in Ontario’s journey toward being a profitable and attractive gaming market came when the pivotal C-218 bill was passed by Ontario lawmakers in 2021. C-218 allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting, this adds increased flexibility and opportunity for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizeable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.</p>



<p>Ontario was quick to act following the passing of C-218, putting out detailed guidelines for operators interested in entering the market, while also working alongside a range of industry leaders to establish responsible regulations.</p>



<p>For more information, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">‘How to become compliant in Ontario’s iGaming market’ blog.</a></p>



 Advantages for gambling operators doing business in Ontario: 



  Relatively unrestricted marketing opportunities<br>  Young untapped market<br>  Gateway to the rest of Canada<br>  Only province in Canada to have legalized both sports betting and online casinos, which is rare in North America<br>  No cap on the number of licences given to operators, allowing for healthy competition<br>   iGaming sites are not tethered to land based sites<br>  Tax rate is very competitive (around 20%)<br>  Operators can operate out of Malta, UK and other countries  



 Outlook on Ontario’s online gambling market.  



<p><a href="https://vixio.com/blog/a-new-era-for-online-gambling-in-canada/">VIXIO Gambling Compliance forecasts</a> have predicted that Ontario’s gambling market will see rapid growth in the short term, with a forecasted revenue of $1.5 billion by 2026. These numbers put the province as one of the largest online gambling markets in North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While impressive growth is forecast, that’s not the only benefit for operators. Ontario’s market also features a very competitive annual tax rate of just 20% – one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another key positives to Ontario gaming sector, is its European-like approach to gambling regulations. Unlike some other markets, operators will not be required to cease offshore activities in other Canadian provinces, once registered in Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How Ontario’s standards are raising the regulatory bar. 



<p>Ontario’s iGaming market is also raising the bar when it comes to regulatory standards. Due to an extensive list of rules and regulations, it is considered a complex market to enter, and features a core focus on customer protection. &nbsp;</p>



<p>iGaming Ontario and the AGCO have set out a wide range of rules and regulations that need to be followed to enter the market. This goes way beyond standard <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> standards. All users and operators also required to adhere to the Proceeds of Crime  and Terrorist Financing Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering-terrorist-financing-act-pcmltfa/">PCMLTFA</a>), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-transactions-reports-centre-canada-fintrac/">FINTRAC</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidelines include requiring operators to report suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and provide a robust KYC process with an onboarding stage that includes checking official documents, recent photos, as well as liveness. Read the full details of AGCO’s <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The future of Ontario’s iGaming market looks very promising. Not only from a revenue standpoint, but also with regard to its high level of customer protection and regulations. If the market proves to succeed as it is forecast, it shows that stepping up security and customer protection efforts in order to become regulated, is definitely worth the effort. This is especially important in modern times, with regulators all over the globe pushing for stricter gambling rules and regulations. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

 What’s next for the Canadian iGaming market? 



<p>Due to the success of the Ontario model, it’s highly likely the future of Canada’s iGaming market will see more provinces open up their market to private gaming operators. In fact, it’s probable that finance ministers are already looking at Ontario, and its increased revenue streams from the regulated gaming sector, and considering how it could launch its own regulatory regime for the iGaming market. The good news for operators that are registered and regulated in Ontario is that when other provinces finally open up their market, regulations are likely to be quite similar, which will give them a headstart on regulation processes.</p>



 How European gaming operators can enter Ontario’s iGaming market. 



<p>All operators are required to register directly through the AGCO, which will provide their services through a commercial partnership with iGO. This means gaming companies work as private operators on behalf of Ontario’s governing body. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enter the market, operators must go through an official registration process, which begins with submitting an application through the <a href="https://www.agco.ca/iagco-information">iAGCO</a> portal. Operators must submit gaming-related goods and services, gaming website information, and branding details. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also comprehensive entity and personal disclosure stages,  where the registrant, as well as associated individuals like parent companies and individuals holding key management or operational roles, need to submit details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, more to it than just going through that initial application process. In the long run, operators will need to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">be fully compliant with Ontario’s evolving rules and regulations</a>. <br>&nbsp;</p>



 IDnow’s role in easing entry into Ontario’s iGaming market. 



<p>Entering Ontario’s iGaming market will prove a challenge for any operator. The range and complexity of iGaming requirements mean operators must navigate a regulatory maze to reach compliance. (Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Becoming Compliant in Ontario’s iGaming Market</a>)</p>



<p>Player onboarding requirements include:</p>



  Players must be 19+, physically based in Ontario<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Person (PEP) </a>checks need to be passed<br>  Personal information, including occupation must be collected<br>  Third-party providers are needed for onboarding for initial checks<br>  



<p>One key issue operators may face is a substandard non-compliant onboarding process. iGO’s clear AML and KYC requirements, which even exceed FINTRAC standards, and require detailed verification, tracking, and data storage systems. </p>



<p>This is where IDnow steps in with our verification solutions.</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">&nbsp;identity verification services for gaming&nbsp;</a>work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including gaming.

<p>Welcome to the Bluesky beta app! This is a user guide that answers some common questions.</p>
<p>For general questions about the Bluesky company, please visit our FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about the protocol Bluesky is built on (the AT Protocol), please refer to our <a href="https://atproto.com/">protocol documentation</a> or our <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/faq">protocol FAQ</a>.</p>
 Data Privacy 
<p>What is public and what is private on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Bluesky is a public social network. Think of your posts as blog posts – anyone on the web can see them, even those without an invite code. An invite code simply grants access to the service we’re running that lets you publish a post yourself. (Developers familiar with the API can view all posts regardless of whether they have an account themselves.)</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
 
 Posts and likes are public. 
 Blocks are public, and blocklists (coming soon) are also public. Subscriptions to blocklists are public. 
 Mutes are private, but mutelists are public lists. Your mutelist subscriptions are private. 
 Invites and invite trees are private. 
 
<p>Why are my posts, likes, and blocks public?</p>
<p>The AT Protocol, which Bluesky is built on, is designed to support public conversations. To make public conversations portable across all sorts of platforms, your data is stored in data repositories that anyone can view. This means that regardless of which server you choose to join, you’ll still be able to see posts across the whole network, and if you choose to change servers, you can easily take all of your data with you. This is what causes the user experience of Bluesky, a federated protocol, to be similar to all the other social media apps you have used before.</p>
<p>Can I set my profile to be private?</p>
<p>Currently, there are no private profiles on Bluesky.</p>
<p>What happens when I delete a post?</p>
<p>After you delete a post, it will be immediately removed from the user-facing app. Any images attached to your post will be immediately deleted in our data storage too.</p>
<p>However, it takes a bit longer for the text content of a post to be fully deleted in storage. The text content is stored in a non-readable form, but it is possible to query the data via the API. We will periodically perform back-end deletes to entirely wipe this data.</p>
<p>Can I get a copy of all of my data?</p>
<p>Yes — the AT Protocol keeps user data in a<a href="https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car"> content-addressed archive</a>. This archive can be used to migrate account data across servers. For developers, you can use <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-sync#comatprotosyncgetcheckout">this method</a> to export a copy of your repository. For non-devs, the tooling is still being built to make it easy.</p>
<p>You can read our privacy policy <a href="https://bsky.app/support/privacy">here</a>.</p>
 Moderation 
<p>What does muting do?</p>
<p>Muting prevents you from seeing any notifications or top-level posts from an account. If they reply to a thread, you’ll see a section that says “Post from an account you muted” with an option to show the post. The account will not know that they have been muted.</p>
<p>What does blocking do?</p>
<p>Blocking prevents interaction. When you block an account, both you and the other account will no longer be able to see or interact with each other’s posts.</p>
<p>How do I flag abuse?</p>
<p>You can report posts by clicking on the three-dot menu. You can also report an entire account by visiting their profile and clicking the three-dot menu there.</p>
<p>Where can I read more about your plans for moderation?</p>
<p>We wrote about our approach to composable moderation <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">here</a> and we’ll continue to publish more in the near future.</p>
 Invite codes 
<p>I don’t have access to Bluesky yet. How can I get an invite code?</p>
<p>We regularly send out invites to our waitlist, which you can sign up for <a href="https://bsky.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I have an invite code, how can I access Bluesky?</p>
<p>When you get an invite code, you can download Bluesky from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">iOS App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a>. You can also use our web app at <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>When do I get invite codes? Do they expire?</p>
<p>Most accounts receive invite codes after they’ve been on Bluesky for a while — currently, it’s once every two weeks. These codes do not expire, unless we perform a security upgrade on all codes. In that case, a security upgrade will change each invite code’s combination of letters, but it will not affect the number of codes that you have.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from that account and other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
<p>Why does Bluesky use an invite code system?</p>
<p>Invites helps us control growth of our beta as we finish building the tooling for moderation and curation. It also gives us visibility into the growing social graph. We will likely continue to use invite codes as we increase access to the app. At that time, each account will receive many more invite codes to hand out.</p>
<p>The code we use to distribute invites is open source and can be used by other server admins to grow their own communities over time as well.</p>
<p>How does the Bluesky server use the invite tree?</p>
<p>We reference the invite tree to track behavior on the social graph. For example, if we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
 Security 
<p>How can I reset my password?</p>
<p>Click “Forgot” on the sign-in screen. You will receive an email with a reset code.</p>
<p>What if I didn’t get a password reset email?</p>
<p>If you didn’t receive a password reset email, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>Will you implement two-factor authentication (2FA)?</p>
<p>Yes, implementing 2FA is on our short-term roadmap.</p>
 Bluesky, the AT Protocol, and Federation 
<p>What’s the difference between Bluesky and the AT Protocol?</p>
<p>Bluesky, the public benefit company, is developing two products: the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>, and the microblogging app Bluesky. Bluesky, the app, is meant to demonstrate the features of the underlying protocol. The AT Protocol is built to support an entire ecosystem of social apps that extends beyond microblogging.</p>
<p>You can read more about the differences between Bluesky and the AT Protocol in our general FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>.</p>
<p>How does federation affect me, as a user of the Bluesky app?</p>
<p>We’re prioritizing user experience and want to make Bluesky as user-friendly as possible. Regardless of which server you join, you’ll be able to see posts from people on other servers and take your data with you if you choose to move servers.</p>
<p>Is Bluesky built on a blockchain? Does it use cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>No, and no.</p>
 Miscellaneous 
<p>How can I submit feedback?</p>
<p>On the mobile app, open the left side menu and click “Feedback.” On the web app, there is a link to “Send feedback” on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>You can also email <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a> with support requests. Please do not use this email to request an invite. Instead, sign up for the waitlist <a href="https://bsky.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is a post on Bluesky called?</p>
<p>The official term is “post.”</p>
<p>How can I find friends or mutuals from other social networks?</p>
<p>Third-party developers maintain tools such as <a href="https://fedifinder.glitch.me/#t">Fedifinder</a> to find friends from other social networks.</p>
<p>Is there a dark mode?</p>
<p>Yes. You can change the display settings by clicking the crescent moon icon in your left side menu on mobile or on the right side of the desktop app. (It’s located next to the feedback button.)</p>
<p>How can I set up my domain as my handle?</p>
<p>Please refer to our tutorial <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">here</a>.</p>
<p>The answers here are subject to change. We’ll update this guide regularly as we continue to release more features. Thank you for joining our beta!</p>

<p>Passkey support, our third passwordless developer option, has arrived for ODD SDK.</p> What are Passkeys? <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">WebAuthn API</a>, or Passkeys, is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. We'll dive more into passkeys, how they work, and how they differ from other passwordless options in this blog post, but first, let's review why developers should consider building passwordless apps.</p> The Benefits of Going Passwordless <p>There are several benefits to going passwordless for both users and developers.</p><p>1) Improved Security - This is a biggy! Machine learning is getting better at cracking passwords, and phishing attempts have gotten more sophisticated. Even the savviest users can fall prey to professional hackers. Data leaks jeopardize the exposed passwords and any accounts where users have re-used that password. App creators must have tight security when creating databases to store user passwords - the GDPR risks are enough to keep anyone up at night.</p><p>Passkeys cannot be guessed, and they are end-to-end encrypted. Phishing apps or websites created to steal users' keys won't work (unlike blockchain wallet keys) because these keys are inextricably linked to the user's device and verified by a special token (which we'll expand on in this post shortly).</p><p>2) Better User Experience - Unless a user has a subscription to a password manager (and even those can get <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/lastpass-breaches-cast-doubt-on-password-manager-safety/">compromised</a>), they have to either write down or memorize all their passwords. When they inevitably forget their password, they must go through an account recovery process that can be frustrating when the user is short on time.</p> Fission's Passwordless Options <p>App developers using <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD SDK</a> currently have two passwordless options - WebCrypto API and WalletAuth. </p><p>WebCrypto API gives the browser fairly low-level cryptographic building blocks, which include encryption and signatures. A user's private key is stored in their browser, and no one, not even the user, can extricate it. If they created their account on their laptop and want to access it on their mobile phone, they have to link their devices to do so (this is a simple process using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE protocol</a>, also part of ODD SDK). </p><p>The upsides of WebCrypto API - it's highly secure and user-friendly. There are many tools built into it for developers to use. The downside - developers need to know what they want to build ahead of time. It's like getting a box of LEGO but no directions.</p><p>WalletAuth allows developers to integrate the Metamask browser extension wallet for user sign-in. When users connect to an ODD SDK app, they can access on-chain data as usual, as well as encrypted off-chain data storage features.</p><p>The upside - it's great for Web3 dapps and Web3 users who are comfortable with blockchain wallets and want to seamlessly work with both on and off-chain data. The downside - users who are not Web3 savvy will be very intimidated by this type of login option.</p> Under the Hood <p>At the beginning of this article, we learned that WebAuthn is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. Instead of using a username and password, the user authenticates with a key stored on their device and signs some unique data with that key. </p><p>The unique data is divided into two parts: Client Data and Authenticator Data. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#dictdef-collectedclientdata">Client Data</a> includes contextual information about the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#webauthn-relying-party">WebAuthn Relying Party</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#client">WebAuthn Client</a>. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-authenticator-data">Authenticator Data</a> includes contextual information that derives its trustworthiness from the WebAuthn Relying Party's assessment of the security of the authenticator. </p><p>In other words, the unique data seeks to understand the relationship between the app (or specifically, the WebAuthn Relying Party who created the app) and the user (specifically, the user agent - i.e. the browser or mobile app they are using) and determines whether the app can securely verify the user. On both sides, there is a layer of abstraction to ensure privacy and trustworthiness.</p><p>After the user signs the unique data, they embed that signature and unique data into a Public Key Credential. It uses the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/">FIDO standard</a> and is a container just like JWT that formats the public key, signature, and unique data in a specific way according to the spec. </p> Passkeys in Action <p>Fission engineer Hugo Dias has spent months diving deep into the passkeys spec, learning what works across browsers and operating systems. As a result, he's put together a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">passkeys library</a> that developers can use to add passkeys support to their ODD apps. </p><p>Hugo has created two demos to demonstrate passkey syncing and sharing.</p><p>This first video shows passkeys syncing across devices with Google Password Manager. Using the Android emulator, we visit <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> (the version on Hugo's personal domain <code>hugodias.me</code>) and create a new user with a passkey-based login.</p><p>The user is now logged in on Android and can upload and access files.</p><p>Switching to Google Password Manager, we see that the passkey for <code>hugodias.me</code> has been saved and synced.</p><p>We can now switch to a desktop browser, visit the same app, and get a prompt to use a saved passkey. A pin is used to unlock.</p><p>Once logged in, we can see that the picture uploaded on mobile is accessible on a desktop web browser, synced through user WNFS files.</p><p>This second video demonstrates navigating to <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> using the Android Mobile emulator. <code>hugo-sharing</code> is logged in.</p><p>The website is a progressive web app that is installable on Android, so “Install app” is chosen from the Android Chrome browser menu.</p><p>Once installed, the ODD logo appears on the home screen. After launching, we see that <code>hugo-sharing</code> is still logged in, as it uses the same context as the website version.</p><p>Switching to the Google Photos app, the Android share function is used. Selecting the installed ODD app uploads the photo into the user’s WNFS.</p><p>The share button again uses Android native share functionality, and we can share from the installed ODD PWA app over to WhatsApp (or any other Android app). </p><p>View the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys/tree/main/examples/odd-passkeys-preact">GitHub source notes</a> for more information on these features.</p><p>You can start developing with passkeys in ODD SDK today. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">ODD SDK Passkeys repo</a> to get started.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Because of the increasing popularity of digital spaces, people have slowly started to migrate towards cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no longer uncommon for people to have an online presence, regardless of age, gender, or social status. We now have digital identities, digital meeting rooms, digital jobs, and digital entertainment. As long as there is access to the internet and people have the necessary gadgets, they will most certainly aim to create an online presence for themselves.</p>
<p>Cyberspace, also known as the metaverse, is like a parallel universe of our physical world, but with additional advantages: speed, efficiency, and flexibility. And, even though at the moment it has not reached its full potential, cyberspace can open doors to countless opportunities for knowledge and growth.</p>
<p>In spite of these amazing benefits, though, we must wonder: how well do we truly understand the concept of metaverse and the risks associated with it?</p>
<p>Cyberspace is a place filled with challenges as much as it is filled with potential and benefits. And, as individuals aiming to be part of such a complex and immersive digital space, it’s vital that we continuously educate ourselves on this topic.</p>

 An introduction to Metaverse 
 Metaverse and humanity 
<p>In order to operate in the digital space, individuals have to exist in. Therefore, the introduction of digital identities was something which came naturally with people’s need to belong on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every person has had an online account, somewhere, or has been listed in some digital system. This was done either by the user themselves, or by other individuals in order to keep track of records more easily. The digital realm, therefore, has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is something which almost every person seeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, advancements in modern technology have unveiled the exciting possibility of interacting with virtual objects and spaces. Venturing into the metaverse has the potential to unlock doors to new realms of knowledge. It may ignite the imagination and provide opportunities to explore aspects of the world that may otherwise be physically out of reach.</p>
<p>All in all, the metaverse may change the way we, as society, interact and educate ourselves. With all of this in mind, SelfKey strives to develop digital identity solutions that may enhance security and privacy as individuals begin to explore cyberspace.</p>
 Metaverse in a nutshell 
<p>The metaverse is a concept that came to be at the intersection of enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual space. It is centered around shared virtual spaces, consisting of various digital worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the metaverse represents a digital universe created and sustained by software, which is accessible through the internet. Within this virtual domain, individuals can interact with each other, as well as their virtual surroundings, in real-time.</p>
<p>For many years, the metaverse existed only as a theoretical concept, residing in the realm of people's imaginations. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, particularly in virtual and augmented reality, cyberspace is gradually capturing widespread attention. Although it is currently limited in scope, it has the potential to encompass endless possibilities in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, cyberspace can serve as a parallel existence alongside the physical world, or it can strive to provide a fully immersive virtual environment. This leaves room for many opportunities for individuals to explore and share knowledge in the metaverse.</p>
 The Benefits of Metaverse 
<p>At its core, the metaverse has tremendous potential to revolutionize various aspects of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its capacity to serve as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, it may completely revolutionize the way we work, study, and socialize. It could facilitate many activities, such as virtual reality gaming, education, business meetings, social networking, and even virtual tourism.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the metaverse is the possibility for users to create and design avatars. This aligns with SelfKey’s idea of <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">customizable avatars</a>, which may enable individuals to design avatars in any ways they please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These avatars may enable interaction with other individuals or virtual objects in the metaverse. Furthermore, they may facilitate the creation of digital spaces that can be used for various purposes, such as virtual stores, events, and even entire cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development and adoption of the metaverse may offer many potential benefits, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Improved Connectivity&nbsp; 
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
 Increased Accessibility 
 Virtual Education 
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
 Streamlined Efficiency 
 
<p>Below, we will further elaborate on these advantages.</p>
 Improved Connectivity 
<p>Cyberspace allows for real-time communication and collaboration between individuals from anywhere around the world. Because physical distance is no longer an issue, individuals are able to build connections and easily collaborate on projects.&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
<p>The metaverse may offer amazing opportunities for people to engage in virtual tourism. This means that individuals may delve into virtual recreations of amazing locations from the real, physical world. Additionally, they may be able to experience completely new, fascinating fictional realms which they’ve always dreamt of.&nbsp;</p>
 Increased Accessibility 
<p>Through the power of digital tools and endless creativity, the metaverse may become accessible from anywhere around the world. As long as there are stable internet connections, and with the proper devices, anyone could be part of this immersive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is particularly important, as it may facilitate participation for individuals with disabilities or mobility constraints.&nbsp;</p>
 Virtual Education 
<p>The internet has provided access to information which surely must’ve made learning much more accessible than ever before. However, cyberspace can bring education to the next level by allowing the creation of immersive, virtual classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, individuals may be able to build realistic, interactive learning environments. This could prove to be incredibly helpful in terms of accessibility and education for young people all around the world.</p>
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
<p>By utilizing the potential of cyberspace, individuals may be able to experience unique scenarios and activities which may not be practical or possible in the physical world. For instance, they could participate in fantasy-based virtual reality games and simulations.&nbsp;</p>
 Streamlined Efficiency 
<p>The metaverse holds potential to streamline and enhance various business and organizational processes. This includes anything from meetings, training, and customer service, and it could facilitate debugging and solving particular technical issues much faster.</p>
<p>All in all, cyberspace represents a transformative landscape with far-reaching implications. It could potentially reshape the way we interact, learn, and engage with the world around us, and beyond. In spite of all these wonderful benefits, though, there are downsides to the metaverse which are worth mentioning.</p>
 The Dark Side of Metaverse 
<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>
 How SelfKey May Improve your Metaverse Experience 
<p>Given the multitude of benefits cyberspace offers, it comes as no surprise that malicious actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, SelfKey proposes several decentralized solutions which may enhance security and prevent identity theft and other privacy concerns. These methods put a strong emphasis on privacy and security. The end goal is to empower individuals to confidently navigate the digital world.</p>
 SelfKey iD 
<p>An innovative online identity verification method, <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> was designed with the aim to safeguard user privacy and security. By utilizing ZK filters and AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, it strives to prevent unauthorized access to personal online accounts and systems by bots or identity thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">ZK filters</a> is to limit the amount of personal information shared when individuals interact with and engage with other individuals in digital spaces. If the shared data is limited, it may be insufficient for bad players to compromise. And this may enhance overall security and privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> is utilized with the aim to deter identity thieves from accessing a user’s online accounts with the latter’s stolen digital information. Thanks to AI’s ability to detect duplicates or fake, AI-generated images, SelfKey iD may be able to combat and prevent these attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, individuals may be able to enjoy the wonders of metaverse with confidence. Even more, they may ensure the privacy and security of their online persona.</p>
 SelfKey's Customizable NFTs 
<p>In the pursuit of a safer and decentralized future, SelfKey recognizes the importance of individuality. To this end, SelfKey may offer the means for individuals to embrace their uniqueness and make a mark in the metaverse through customization.</p>
<p>Through SelfKey's Customizable NFTs, also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">Normies</a>, users can attach these digital assets to their SelfKey iD. And this may allow them to express their originality and gain access to exclusive features.</p>
<p>Normies are composed of Base NFTs and Wearables, offering users countless combinations and possibilities for customization. This provides users with an ideal opportunity to create digital representations that truly reflect their own identities.</p>
 SelfKey's ENS subdomains 
<p>Last, but not least, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-ens-mass-adoption-of-self-sovereignty-on-blockchain/">SelfKey's ENS subdomains</a> strive to offer equal opportunities for individuals to own and personalize their domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of these subdomains aims to make them affordable for everyone. And to possibly ensure that each person has the opportunity to be the owner of their own digital presence.</p>
<p>By implementing these online identity security solutions, and aiming to create a secure digital environment, SelfKey is striving to contribute to a much safer digital future. The potential of cyberspace and modern technology is immense, and it’s worth being used for the good of the people.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Every day, technology reaches new heights, unlocking doors to unimaginable opportunities. However, like any innovation, there are those who will exploit it for their own gain, regardless of the harm caused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the right tools and knowledge, we may be able to prevent such occurrences.</p>
<p>The metaverse holds the power to revolutionize society and provide virtual access to knowledge like never before. But, it is essential to be aware of the accompanying risks. This way, we may navigate these remarkable digital realms safely.</p>
<p>SelfKey’s primary focus revolves around security and privacy. And every individual deserves these fundamental rights. People shouldn't have to risk their privacy and security in the pursuit of convenience or the use of modern-day technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By prioritizing security and privacy, SelfKey strives to empower individuals to embrace technology without sacrificing the safety of their digital identity.</p>

<p>The global decentralized identity market was valued at $285 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $6.82 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 88.7% during the forecast period, according to a new report by <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/10/27/2543009/0/en/Global-Decentralized-Identity-Market-Size-Projected-to-Reach-US-6-822-million-by-2027-Report-by-MarketsandMarkets.html">MarketsandMarkets™.</a> This exponential growth is due to increased security breaches, identity-related fraud incidents, the inefficiency of existing identity management practices, and the lack of end-user control over identity usage.</p>
<p>In today’s highly connected and digital world, secure customer interactions have become a top concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. With the increasing use of digital services, the need for secure and reliable identity verification processes has become more pressing. This is where decentralized identity and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes come into play.</p>
<p>What does decentralized identity mean?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is a system of identity management based on decentralized and distributed technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks. This system, in theory, will provide a digital identity that is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or corporation. Instead, it is managed by the individual who owns it. This allows the individual to then share only the necessary aspects of their identity to validate themselves in order to interact with different organizations and services online; once the transaction is completed, they can retract their personal identity information if they wish to. Decentralized identity is not yet globally viable, but there are many organizations and governments working to make it real.</p>
<p>What does Know Your Customer (KYC) mean?</p>
<p>KYC is a process used by financial institutions and other organizations to verify the identity of their clients. This is done to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations, as well as to protect against fraud and other financial crimes.</p>
<p>The traditional KYC process involves collecting and storing large amounts of personal information about clients, including their name, date of birth, address, and government-issued ID. This information is often stored in centralized databases that can be attacked by bad actors, making it vulnerable to data breaches and other security threats.</p>
<p>Decentralized KYC processes have the potential to revolutionize the way personal information is managed and verified. By using decentralized identity, individuals can store their identity information in a secure digital wallet that is owned and controlled by them, sharing only parts of their identity as and when needed.</p>
<p>How does decentralized identity benefit organizations?</p>
<p>By adopting decentralized identity, organizations can achieve:</p>
 
 Enhanced security<br>
One of the most significant benefits is enhanced security. Identity systems store identity data on a blockchain, which is a tamper-proof and secure distributed ledger. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means that identity data is not stored in a central location, which reduces the risk of data breaches and identity theft. This is a significant benefit for organizations that store sensitive personal information, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, and government agencies. 
 
 
 Streamlined identity verification processes<br>
In traditional identity verification systems, individuals often have to repeat the same verification process with multiple organizations. This is time-consuming and can be frustrating. With the adoption of decentralized identity, individuals can share verified identity information with multiple organizations without having to repeat the verification process. This not only saves time, but also reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies in identity information. 
 
 
 Reduced costs<br>
With decentralized identity, organizations no longer need to store, manage, and verify identity data themselves. From a cost perspective, this can be particularly beneficial for smaller organizations that do not have the resources to build and maintain their own identity verification systems and also reduce the costs associated with fraud prevention and compliance, as it provides a secure way to authenticate identities. 
 
 
 Improved user experience: seamless onboarding<br>
Instead of having to fill out long and complicated forms, users can quickly and easily share their decentralized identity with a business, which speeds up account opening. This can improve the overall customer experience and reduce the likelihood of users abandoning the onboarding process. 
 
<p>To summarize, decentralized identity and KYC are two important concepts that are changing the way we think about online identity and security. By allowing individuals to control and manage their own digital identities, and by decentralizing the KYC process, we can create a more secure, transparent, and efficient online ecosystem. While these technologies are still in the early stages of development, they hold great promise for the future of digital identity and security.</p>

<p>Are you wondering what it’s like to facilitate a remote design sprint? Are you searching for ways to make your sprint work? If yes, then this post is for you! If not, no problem; you can still enjoy the tales of a designer going through his first remote design sprint&nbsp;😀</p><p>I’m a Senior Product Designer at Onfido, an identity verification provider. We used a design sprint format to validate an idea that wasn’t part of our quarterly objectives. Going through the sprint process aligned stakeholders on the overall goal and made everyone part of the solution.</p><p>As you might know already, the design sprint process <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint">is well documented</a>, and you can find plenty of resources across the World Wide Web. So I decided that I would add up to the pile myself! I listed the most useful resources at the end. Suppose you’re searching for good material to prepare for your sprint. Hopefully, you find the following bits of advice and learnings useful for yourself.</p>Screenshot of the completed Miro board&nbsp;:D Preparation is&nbsp;key   Make it easy for yourself to facilitate. Prep in advance for every voting activity, timer, board, etc. You should be able to arrive at the activity and know the steps to follow just by seeing the board. I used this template made by Jake Knapp and Stéph Cruchon 👉 <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/">https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/</a>. I did modify it to include process information like timing and number of votes per&nbsp;person.  Remote means you’ll be on Zoom (video call) all day. PLAN LOTS OF BREAKS! I think it goes without saying, but a 10–15min break can save so much mental space and keep focus and attention from your sprint team. It can also give people space to answer some Slack messages, emails, you know&nbsp;… manage their “real work”. One every hour, give or take, is what we implemented and felt&nbsp;nice.  Keep the book near you! Or any activity reference on your computer. You don’t need to know everything because you will forget them anyway. Before each session, I would skim through the reference to refresh my memory. That helped me be more knowledgeable of the task and be able to give directives easily.  When the facilitator forgets the only material&nbsp;needed…<p>Quick fun fact: I only asked one thing for the team to prepare. Have A4 white paper and a black pen for the Sketching day. 15min before the sketching exercise, I realise… I don’t have A4 paper myself 🤦 So I ran to buy a block of 360 A4 paper… (sorry for the “ill”, I was “race walking” and typing on my phone). Told you you’re going to forget&nbsp;things!</p> Being adaptable is priceless   Problems will surely arise, and you need to be ok dealing with them. A debate that goes for too long, an unplanned drop-out, an unavailable expert/user,&nbsp;… the list goes on. Whatever you plan will be put to the test. Knowing things will change allows you to remove the pressure of perfection. Keep in mind that the sprint must go&nbsp;on!  It is fine to have a break in the middle of an activity to check things (I learned that from trying to be a dungeon master 😉). If you don’t know something, take a 5min break and check your reference or find a solution to the problem. No shame in saying, “Sorry, I don’t know how to proceed right now; let’s have a small break so that I can review the process.” Another solution is to ask your group! How would they prefer to solve the issue? How would they change the activity? What information do they need?&nbsp;…  <p>Not so-quick fact: On Wednesday, you decide many things, from the solution to the flow of the prototype itself. And be sure that your team members will try to modify the decision you made 30 minutes, 1 hour ago. During the storyboarding activity, our group was stuck on “what ifs” and “why not change that”, deep inside conversations about very specific and technical subjects. I was boiling inside as the decisions weren’t happening! Seeing that we were not going anywhere, I put a hard stop on conversations and gave a 10min break for everyone. It allowed me to take a breather, think and regain the lead of the conversation. Sometimes cutting short helps you move&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Time pressure is a stress you will experience. The best advice I can give is: “If you are in a hurry, then slow down.” (unsure where this quote comes from, either from a German or Chinese proverb if you ask&nbsp;Google)</p> The importance of the team you&nbsp;choose   As important as picking an impactful challenge, you need the right people in your team. A person who cares about the issue will show engagement and motivation. These are powerful drivers to have a successful sprint. Team members will stay focused, engage in conversations, and overall put energy into doing things&nbsp;well.  Perspective diversity should come with relevant team members. I’m glad that everyone in the sprint shared and learned something! Humans are curious by nature, so having different points of view will generate engagement through learning and rewards through&nbsp;sharing.  Having people with specific skills can help you design a feasible solution. Luckily we had 2–3 engineers in our team that helped us create a close-to-reality prototype! An interactive, half-coded prototype through Framer suited our use case. You shouldn’t base your choice on this,&nbsp;though.   Engage the team when you&nbsp;can   Within exercises, give them roles or ask them to do some tasks. <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide">The bible for remote design sprint</a> referenced below advises it. That was also the first feedback I received on the first day: “When you organise post-its or move things from one board to another, you can ask the group to help. You don’t have to do it by yourself! It’ll save time.” And they were right! I decided to involve them more in the day-to-day logistics. Involving them lowered my stress level and slightly improved their attention and engagement in the activity.  Make each person in the team shine during the week. Everyone has a skill or personality trait that can make the week easier or the work better! An engineer solving a problem? Give them a shout-out at the end of the day. Does a Product Manager have the best voice and temper for testing? Allow them to interview. A very knowledgeable team member? Give them 30min to expose their knowledge.  Let them shine even outside of activities! I used Chat GPT to create “inspirational sentences” for every day of the week. One in the morning within an automated Slack message and one at the end of the day in the meeting. This person in our group started to ask for a sentence written in a specific style (like pirate or medieval), which resulted in some excellent impressions and stylistic reading of these quotes. I started to ask them what style did they want each day as well as leaving this person have a little show. That was a great moment between the team and perfect to end each day on a positive&nbsp;note!  <p>Thursday’s end-of-the-day 🤖 chat GPT quote in an evangelist priest&nbsp;style:</p>ChatGPT conversation to create an inspirational sentence for my design sprint team on Thursday after finishing a prototype in one afternoon. TIPS: don’t use the word “quote” if you want something like this. Otherwise, it will get you a quote from someone, not “create&nbsp;one”.<blockquote>Hallelujah, my brothers and sisters! Let us gather ‘round and bear witness to the miracle that is about to unfold before us. For in this very afternoon, through our unwavering faith and tireless labor, we shall bring forth a prototype that shall reign supreme and conquer all doubters! So let us join our hearts and minds together, and let the power of our convictions guide our hands as we march towards glory!&nbsp;Amen!”</blockquote><p>Was our solution the perfect one? No. Did the week help us validate our idea? Mostly. Did we all learn something? Absolutely! This is a reminder that a design sprint is not a process in which you will end up with a fully ready-to-build product. Insights and learnings are the primary output. These will inform a product decision; iterating or building. In our case, we learned that our direction was good, but we needed to refine the solution&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Overall facilitating a design sprint is an excellent exercise for designers. The one we did was a one-off “bubble week” for me. By that, I meant facilitating a design sprint for a team I didn’t work in. This allowed a focus on the process and facilitation aspect of product&nbsp;design.</p><p>Ultimately you practice leading exercises, people and projects using lots of communication skills. Product design is about working with different people, so these skills are useful! I encourage everyone to try a design sprint; it’s a great experience! And obviously, have fun with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thanks for reading&nbsp;🙂</p><p>Sharing is caring!

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Christina Lu and I joined Ontology in June 2018, shortly before Ontology’s mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I have a Masters degree in Conference Interpreting and Translation Studies from the University of Leeds. I felt that this degree was the right fit for me as I’m multilingual, a fast learner, and adaptable. In the same vein, traveling and exploring new places is one of my favorite things to do as I like to experience different cultures and see what various cities have to&nbsp;offer.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am Ontology’s Head of Social Media. In this role, my main duties include: developing social media and marketing strategies to drive engagement and increase followers; creating content and campaigns; analyzing social listening and monitoring data; and conducting internal and external communications, including but not limited to media, KOLs, partners, exchanges, and event organizers.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains is the fact that it has remained focused on Decentralized Identities (DID) and building the infrastructure and tools for Web3 for the past five years. We employ an exceptional tech team and a devoted marketing and business development team, who are dedicated to our overall&nbsp;vision.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Ontology offers individuals new opportunities, bringing awareness to DID and giving users back control in order to manage their own personal data and online identities.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>While I have reached many notable milestones throughout my time at Ontology, the most prominent is building our global community from 3 languages to over 30+ languages worldwide. Additionally, the creation of the Harbinger program is an important moment in my career to date. Essentially, it is a network of passionate blockchain and Web3 lovers and contributors. Launched in 2020, it has played a major part in helping us build a strong global community presence.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I’m most excited for more applications for DID and users owning and having complete control over their own data and identities.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the future, I anticipate that Ontology will be leading Web3 when it comes to DID. For Web3 more generally, I expect to see mass adoption of Web3 technologies. Just like we witnessed with Web2 and the rapid growth of smartphones and social media, individuals will realize that it’s essential to adopt this technology and understand what it can&nbsp;offer.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-head-of-social-media-christina-lu-7db02fe1cad0">Meet the Team: Head of Social Media, Christina Lu</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The estimated global crypto ownership rate is around <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%20we%20estimated,420%20million%20crypto%20users%20worldwide.">4.2%</a>, with more than 420 million crypto users worldwide. Although Hong Kong falls beyond the global average with an ownership percentage of 2.35%, more than 175,000 people own cryptocurrency there.</p><p>With the new regulations are set to come into place in June 2023. Industry experts, analysts, large investors, individual participants, and crypto enthusiasts — all are busy assessing potential challenges and opportunities that lie on this regulated road&nbsp;ahead.</p> Understanding the new&nbsp;climate <p>The new regulations come with the final guidelines for crypto exchanges looking to launch in Hong Kong this&nbsp;May.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://wp.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/20230427_Synopsis-CEO-at-Bloomberg-APAC-Policy-Series-English.pdf">regulatory synopsis</a> issued on 27th April 2023 by Ms. Julia Leung, the CEO of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, the SFC is “working with global counterparts to set baseline standards to regulate centralized virtual asset exchanges for adoption in major markets.”</p><p>The commission held public consultations on crypto exchange regulations last year to determine the best way for retail investors to access cryptocurrencies. It also wanted to test the feasibility of offering crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the geography. Indicating considerable buzz for the framework to come into place, the SFC received over 150 responses from the&nbsp;public.</p><p>The new regulations are also considered a milestone as they would let investors trade in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum from June 1st this&nbsp;year.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kongs-proposed-asset-regulation-sparks-industry-optimism">Hong Kong’s Proposed Asset Regulation Sparks Industry&nbsp;Optimism</a></p> Current crypto situation <p>The new regulations will considerably impact the crypto climate in Hong Kong, presenting a significant market opportunity for the crypto industry. According to Chainanalysis, cryptocurrency values received by internet addresses in Hong Kong were around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/hong-kongs-crypto-push-sets-up-race-bottom-2022-11-22/">US$70 billion</a> in the first half of 2022&nbsp;alone.</p> The New Regulations <p>The new regulations come under the legislative purview of the ‘Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill&nbsp;2022.”</p><p>According to its stated <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">objectives</a>, the bill wants to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinances (AMLO) to establish a licensing system for Virtual Asset Service Providers and apply the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under Schedule 2 to AMLO to&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Once the new regulations come into effect, crypto-related service providers will require an SFC license to operate in Hong Kong. And to obtain a license, they would have to furnish a detailed plan for combating money laundering risks and protecting their investors from such breaches and intrusions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1656109508668653570?s=20">Image Source</a><p>In a broader sense, the new regulations would help set standards and benchmarks for crypto regulations in Hong Kong, a region actively pursuing the goal of becoming a crypto hub — not only in Asia but at a global scale — for some time&nbsp;now.</p><p>Numbers suggest that over<a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/"> 80</a> foreign and Mainland China companies have already expressed interest in setting up their Web3 company through this licensing mechanism. The interest indicates positivity towards norms that advocate system regularization and protection of investor rights and interests.</p> Comparison With Previous Regulatory Frameworks <p>Many new regulations often come at the cost of destabilizing the traditional system, but that is not the case with the Hong Kong crypto licensing rules, as it would subject providers to the same AML and counter-terrorist financing legislation that traditional financial institutions follow. Hence, one can expect a seamless or at least considerably less friction in the transformative process when it becomes effective from June 1st&nbsp;onwards.</p> Implications for Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Although the new regime is set to come into effect from June 2023, at least <a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/">23 businesses</a>, out of the 80 that expressed interest, according to Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and Treasury Christopher Hui, are already setting up their presence in Hong Kong. And these 23 not only include crypto exchanges but Web3 security companies, blockchain payment providers, blockchain infrastructure builders, and&nbsp;more.</p> Adaptation strategies of local exchanges <p>Adapting to the imminent regulatory shifts and challenges could be easy for local exchanges by fulfilling the core demand: exhibiting the capability to perform due diligence on their customers and meet Hong Kong’s AML and anti-terrorist financing standards. Only then would it become easier to receive a&nbsp;license!</p> Potential challenges and opportunities <p>The potential challenge may arise from something common to most of the transformative processes worldwide: arranging provisions for compliance and setting up a robust mechanism for conducting adequate due diligence. It involves upskilling the existing compliance team. The team needs to become aware and set up the system following what has been asked&nbsp;for.</p><p>What awaits providers at the end of the compliance and diligence tunnel are enhanced trust from consumers, increased transparency in the system, and the scope of a pumped-up audience&nbsp;base.</p><p>The Hong Kong authorities are also coming out with increased support for virtual asset service providers willing to pass through this regime. For instance, Hong Kong has allocated <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">HK$50 million</a> in its annual budget spending to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Comparative analysis with other jurisdictions <p>Similar to Hong Kong, a lot of adjacent and global jurisdictions are also proactively taking up the job of regulating virtual assets and the Web3 economy. And crypto entrepreneurs believe that when compared to Singapore and South Korea, Hong Kong’s new crypto regulations would be much similar to Singapore’s approach. Both are focused on protecting investors, institutional and retail&nbsp;alike.</p> Global and Asian Crypto&nbsp;Climate <p>Like Singapore and South Korea, being part of the Asia continent helps Hong Kong become a participant in the most thriving crypto market globally. Out of more than 420 million estimated crypto owners worldwide, more than 260 million are from the Asian market&nbsp;itself.</p> Key trends in global cryptocurrency adoption <p>It has to be kept in mind that Asia is also the most populous geographic region among continents in the world. However, other continents are also picking up speed in terms of gaining adoption and traction.</p><p>The number of owners in North America is more than 54 million, followed by Africa (38 million+), South America (33 million+), Europe (31 million+), and Oceania (15 million+).</p><p>In Asia, while regions like Singapore and Hong Kong are keen to encourage growth in the Web3 ecosystem, some countries like South Korea want to tread cautiously. Hong Kong, on the other hand, is moving forward in a structured way. The current exchange licensing system will be followed by stablecoin regulations in&nbsp;2024.</p> Influence of international regulations <p>Along with its Asian counterparts, there are many countries or regions which are considering introducing similar regulatory systems.</p><p>For instance, the European Parliament has already approved the first set of comprehensive rules to regulate cryptocurrency markets, known as MiCA or Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation.</p><p>Dubai has also set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority as a unique body regulating Virtual assets across&nbsp;Dubai.</p><p>All these international regulatory institutions are expected to duly influence the crypto market in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU Parliament Greenflags MiCA — Potential Impact on the Crypto Landscape</a></p> History of Cryptocurrency in Hong&nbsp;Kong <p>Hong Kong, for some time now, has been looked at as one of the most preferred crypto destinations in the world. In fact, the <a href="https://forexsuggest.com/worldwide-crypto-readiness-report/">Worldwide Crypto Readiness Report</a> termed Hong Kong as the most crypto-ready location in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>In 2022, Hong Kong topped the charts in all categories, including the number of blockchain startups per 100,000 people and the number of crypto ATMs proportional to the population. The region was ahead of some of the most thriving global economies, including the US and Switzerland.</p><p>Over the years, multiple local crypto companies have emerged in the region, such as Kikitrade, Saxo Crypto Products, MYETHSHOP, CoinUnited.io, and other cryptocurrency trading and educational platforms, hubs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Regulatory Framework and Government Initiatives <p>We have already discussed the form and potential use cases of the upcoming crypto licensing mechanism in Hong Kong. It is also to be noted that the region’s AMLO aligns with the global recommendations of FATF. It requires VASPs across countries to adhere to an anti-money laundering benchmark in countering fraud, breaches, and financing terrorism regulations.</p><p>The Securities and Futures Commission is the primary body looking after the execution of the imminent licensing regime in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <p>Founded in 1989, the Commission’s job is to work as an independent statutory body to regulate Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets. Its principal responsibilities are to maintain and promote fairness, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency, and orderliness in the securities and futures industry.</p> Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) <p>One of the most crucial legislations that the SFC is bothered with in regulating the crypto industry is the <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">AMLO</a>. In the Hong Kong special administrative region, the legislation comes with an ordinance. The ordinance amends the laws to apply customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements to virtual asset service providers.</p> Government support and initiatives <p>While regulations are set in place, the Hong Kong government is also keen to keep its support window open for the holistic growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Cyberport came up with Web3@Cyberport in the early half of the 2023–24 financial year. According to the <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">official budget document</a>, HK$50 million was allocated to expedite the Web3 ecosystem development by “organizing major international seminars” and promoting “cross-sectoral business cooperation.”</p> Collaboration with Mainland&nbsp;China <p>When it comes to calibrating the region’s crypto strategies with that of Mainland China, Xiao Feng, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Crypto exchange HashKey, believes that the Hong Kong government’s emphasis is on practicing different laws from mainland China under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.</p> Market Opportunities and Key&nbsp;Players <p>The<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/List-of-licensed-virtual-asset-trading-platforms"> SFC list</a> of licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong includes OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited. Invariably the list of such exchanges is set to grow in the coming days, with local exchanges coming up in accordance with the regime and increasing their market share and accelerating growth.</p><p>Brands like Hex Trust, fully licensed, insured digital asset custodians, are also active in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>NUTS Finance is a blockchain development lab active in Hong Kong that focuses on building secure, composable, open-source technology to enable decentralized finance services. DTTD, another Hong Kong-based service, makes managing NFTs across multiple crypto wallets easy. Xversem, a Hong Kong-located service, aims at building effective Bitcoin wallets for Web3. Hong Kong-based Pictta is a mobile-first, gasless, and social-enabled NFT marketplace.</p><p>Such examples are many, and the bouquet of such service &amp; product companies is bound to grow in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Risks <p>It is evident that implementing the licensing mechanism will come with its share of challenges and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Any new regulation introduced in an existing market is bound to create friction in the system. Companies will have to exhibit to the regulators and their consumers that they can do due diligence and protect the investor from potential hacks, attacks, breaches, laundering, and other possible mismanagement of funds. At the same time, they will have to comply with global benchmarks for protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Necessarily, it would have to be a consistent effort, demanding a fixed cost to be incurred by businesses every quarter. There are chances that occasional volatility in an emergent market like crypto will take a toll on the company’s bottom line. It is essential to have efficient fund management practices in place so that companies do not lack in their compliance and diligence efforts.</p><p>The People’s Republic of China’s <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/the-peoples-republic-of-chinas-digital-yuan-its-environment-design-and-implications">Digital Yuan</a> promised to achieve a “relatively high degree of financial inclusion” and aid in developing “various large-scale financial platforms” that reduce the cost of providing financial services. Its presence could also play a decisive role in shaping the future of crypto services in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Future Outlook and&nbsp;Trends <p>Despite all these potential challenges, Hong Kong is looking toward a brighter future in crypto services. Blockchain and DeFi are high-potential areas with a lot to offer to people who still lack access to traditional finance&nbsp;avenues.</p><p>Merging of blockchain and crypto services to the traditional finance functions of lending and borrowing, underwriting, etc., have already started. One only needs to be careful of promises made to promote the new economic order that Web3 has the power to introduce through the decentralization route.</p> Final Note <p>The imminent regulations and licensing regimes in Hong Kong present both risks and opportunities to the crypto investor and user communities.</p><p>While regulatory compliance may lower the speed of innovation and pump up costs, the investors stand to gain from a more protective atmosphere in general. There is also the scope for businesses to enjoy long-term premiums by offering enhanced trust and transparency.</p><p>Every stakeholder must stay updated on the shifts and changes happening in the regime. It always helps steer ahead in an evolving market with less friction and optimal cost-efficiency.</p> Mickey and the Hong Kong Crypto&nbsp;Quest  Additional Resources <p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-d47fcbd59076">The Shyft Perspective: Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			  Lautaro Giambroni is Product Owner&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hi there! I’m Lautaro Giambroni, a Product Owner at Tokeny. I’m 27 years old and was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I earned my engineering degree there and later pursued a master’s degree in financial markets in Spain.<br>
<br>
From a young age, I’ve been interested in how technology and digital products shape the world and improve people’s lives. It’s a passion that has driven me to continue my career in this field, and in recent years, I’ve been closely following the exciting developments in the blockchain space.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked in various companies related to the financial and banking sector. As a UX designer, product manager, and innovation consultant, I gained experience and insights into the industry. However, I couldn’t help but notice the outdated structures and practices that seemed to hinder innovation in the sector.<br>
<br>
Seeking to make a real impact, I came across Tokeny. What really stood out to me was the innovative approach to leveraging blockchain technology to transform financial operations in companies, as well as their commitment to bringing the benefits of blockchain to society.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working here is an awesome experience. The best part is the team I get to work with, who are not only highly skilled but also share the same passion to make finance easy-to-access and efficient for everyone via our leading tokenization platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work we do is demanding, but it’s also highly rewarding. Our product is growing at a fast pace, and keeping up with the disruptive innovations in the DeFi industry can be a challenge. However, seeing the team’s hard work come to fruition after a release makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>Being part of a company that is driving real change in the industry is something I’m grateful for every day. The tech industry is an exciting place to be, and being part of a team that is leading the way is truly amazing.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are two things that really ignite my passion: meeting new cultures and learning new skills. I’ve had the opportunity to live in different countries, and that experience has fueled my desire to explore new places, try new foods, and meet people from all walks of life. In addition to that, I’m always looking to learn new skills. Whether it’s taking up a new hobby or improving my professional background, I’m eager to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. Lately, I’ve been getting into surfing, and I started practicing analogic photography.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it’s important to stay curious and keep pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. Life is all about growth and learning, and I’m passionate about embracing that journey and seeing where it takes me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Over the past decade, my home country has faced one of the worst financial crises in its recent history, marked by high unemployment rates, inflation, and a lack of economic stability. This has caused many young people, including myself, to leave in search of a better future. It’s a difficult reality that I would love to see change.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that decentralized finance could have an impact. Especially in a country where the monetary policy has been mismanaged, and lack of transparency has led to a loss of trust in local currency. Ultimately, my dream is to contribute to creating better conditions for the people in my home country.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>As a future Tokeny employee, you will have the opportunity to learn and grow as a professional in a dynamic and innovative environment. We work hard to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of tokenization, and we’re constantly looking for new ways to innovate and make a difference.<br>
<br>
So, my advice to any prospective employee is simple: join the team and be prepared to work hard, learn a lot, and make a real difference in the world of tokenization. We will be excited to have you on board!<br>
</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>What excites me the most about Tokeny’s future is the tremendous potential for growth in the tokenization market. Over the past few years, we’ve seen significant growth in this space, and it’s estimated that the market will continue to grow at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Being part of a company at the forefront of this market is truly amazing. Our platform is designed to empower firms seeking to digitize their operations and benefit from the latest advancements in technology.</p>
<p>I am proud to be part of a company that is driving real change in the industry, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Decentralized Identities in all their facets have been a hot topic at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 (EIC)</a>, which ran in Berlin last week. Just a few days before, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/12/linkedin-and-microsoft-entra-introduce-a-new-way-to-verify-your-workplace/">announced</a> their support for Verified Workplace in LinkedIn using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a>.</p>
<p>Verifying the workplace</p>
<p>What Microsoft announced is focused on a particular use case, the verification of workplaces of LinkedIn members. It builds on multi-step verification.</p>
<p>The entry level is workplace email verification. There is little friction in that. Organizations can verify the work mail of their employees based on a lightweight WebApp adding to the Microsoft Entra Verified ID service, which again requires a Microsoft Entra Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. Factually, this allows issuing verified credentials/IDs based on Azure AD or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Microsoft also will provide, together with its partner Clear, a government identity verification and binding to this. This adds another level of proof.</p>
<p>The third step then is a wallet for professionals that, in the first phase, can accept verified credentials. Enterprises can issue credentials to their employees that can be shared with LinkedIn or to Microsoft Authenticator for verification beyond LinkedIn. This thus integrates both the Microsoft Authenticator and LinkedIn – relying parties that are talking to the Authenticator also can talk to LinkedIn and the Authenticator can be used for extended verification scenarios.</p>
<p>Microsoft is basing this on the (still emerging set of) standards around decentralized identity, making it interoperable.</p>
<p>The first step into practice and towards critical mass</p>
<p>While the announcement is focused on a specific use case, it is an important step forward towards the ubiquitous use of decentralized identities:</p>
 
 It demonstrates a concrete, practical application of decentralized identities. 
 It builds on standards for interoperability. 
 It is supported by a growing partner ecosystem. 
 It neatly integrates with Microsoft Entra (including Azure Active Directory), LinkedIn, etc., and can be integrated with further solutions. 
 It provides concrete value to the users. 
 It helps in creating a critical mass of users. 
 
<p>At the EIC, I’ve illustrated my talk about decentralized identity in the enterprise with the employee and partner onboarding use case, where a verified government ID is used for initial onboarding and proofs of employment and job title/role are used for partner onboarding. In the public preview, Microsoft is demonstrating such a use case in combination with Entitlement Management, a feature within Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing broader adoption of the Decentralized Identity model across the globe. Approaches such as the one announced by Microsoft can help it happen earlier.</p>

 A Step-by-Step Guide! <p>Embarking on your DeFi journey with Ontology just got easier! With the power of iZUMi Finance, you can now swap your ONG for ONT in a few simple steps. This guide will walk you through the process, helping you navigate the decentralized exchange (DEX) like a pro. So, whether you’re a seasoned DeFi enthusiast or a newcomer to the space, let’s get started and master the art of swapping!</p> Three steps on how to turn ONG into ONT via the&nbsp;DEX:  Step 1: Transfer ONG (Ontology) to ONG (ORC20) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a>, connect non-EVM wallet and EVM wallet. You should see your wallet address displayed once&nbsp;done.    Click the ONG Transfer button as shown in the figure&nbsp;below.  Choose Non-EVM from the Wallet column (Your native address will be recognized automatically then) and fill in the EVM address (To which ORC-20 ONG will be&nbsp;sent)  Click “Transfer” when everything is good, make sure you have enough ONG for the gas fee (0.05 ONG each transaction).   Step 2: Use iziSwap to swap ONG (ORC-20) to WONT&nbsp;(ORC-20)   Go to: <a href="https://izumi.finance/trade/swap">https://izumi.finance/trade/swap</a>, locate in the top right corner and click the “Connect Wallet” button to connect metamask wallet. Also, switch to “Ontology” in your wallet’s network settings.  Time to swap “ONG” into “WONT”. The top token or “from” placeholder depicts the token you own (ONG in this scenario), while the second token or “to” placeholder represents the token you receive (WONT in this scenario) after the successful swap.  Double check the amount you want to swap and make sure you prepare enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.5 ONG for each transaction).  Click swap and confirm the transaction. If the transaction is successful, a message will appear in the bottom right corner of the&nbsp;page.   Step 3: Bridge WONT (ORC20) to ONT (Ontology) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a> again.This time we should use Token&nbsp;Bridge.  Let’s choose “WONT” in the assets list and ensure the asset will be bridged from ORC-20 into Ontology&nbsp;native.  Double check the amount and make sure you have enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.15 ONG normally).  Click Swap and confirm the transaction. You ONT will be available in a short&nbsp;time.   About iZUMi&nbsp;Finance <p><a href="https://izumi.finance/home">iZUMi Finance</a> is a DeFi protocol providing one-stop Liquidity as a Service (LaaS), dedicated to building a top DEX and providing liquidity service on ZK-rollups and multi-chains. iZUMi Finance has two products, iZiSwap and LiquidBox. iZiSwap is the first and top on-chain Order Book DEX driven by iZUMi’s innovative DL-AMM and peer-to-pool Order Book design, providing CEX experience to DEX users on Layer 2.

<p><a href="http://www.entrust.com/vmc">Entrust Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> are digital certificates that enable organizations to create a more immersive and personalized email experience by displaying their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside emails. This helps them elevate their brand and stand out in their prospects’ crowded inbox. Because VMCs are linked with DMARC technology, they also potentially reduce email spoofing.</p>
<p>Entrust started working on VMCs in June 2017. Entrust is proud to have issued the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2019/verified-mark-certificates#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20the%20first%20certification,for%20organizations%20that%20support%20VMCs.">world’s first VMC</a> (in Sept 2019), <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2020/07/why-googles-verified-mark-certificates-pilot-matters/">performed a pilot with Gmail (in July 2020)</a>, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/government-organizations-can-now-get-verified-mark-certificates-for-their-outgoing-emails/#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20proud%20to%20announce,national%20IT%20agency%2C%20Statens%20IT.">issued the world’s first Government Mark Certificate (in March 2023)</a>. Entrust has also partnered with Red Sift to offer organizations an integrated BIMI solution to enhance their email security and boost their brand recognition in the inbox.</p>
<p>Now, Gmail has included an additional benefit to email senders and users in the Gmail desktop web browser UI – a new checkmark icon that proactively indicates the sender of the email has verified that it owns the domain and the logo displayed in the avatar slot. This new checkmark is only available when DMARC and VMC are both implemented.</p>
<p>This first image shows how the new checkmark icon will appear in the Gmail application “detail message” view.&nbsp; The checkmark is shown in white against a blue badge, to the right of the VMC logo and the sender’s display name:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new tool tip that displays the following confirmation text when a user hovers over the checkmark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you see, the tool tip message confirms that the email sender has verified that it owns its email domain and logo as specified in the VMC.</p>
<p><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/05/expanding-gmail-security-BIMI.html?m=0">Gmail is actively rolling out this VMC checkmark icon now</a>, so all desktop web browser Gmail users should see these new icons soon. Gmail has not yet announced how this might appear in mobile environments but Entrust expects there will be coordination of Gmail UIs across their other environments.</p>
<p>This checkmark icon is a good visual cue for recipients to identify verified email senders. Entrust strongly supports this new VMC enhancement and believes it will be embraced by email senders and users.</p>

<p>Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA), is a security measure used to verify a person’s identity by asking them to provide specific information that only they should know.<br>
How Does Knowledge-Based Authentication Work?<br>
The idea is that these questions serve as a block for other individuals who should not know the user’s private information but which the user has immediate knowledge of (and does not have to memorize).</p>
<p>KBA questions can be generated in two primary approaches: static and dynamic.</p>
<p>Static KBA<br>
Static approaches involve selecting a set of predetermined questions that users can choose from when setting up their KBA. These questions are often personal, referring to highly personalized experiences or preferences that would be difficult for an attacker to guess without directly knowing the user.</p>
<p>Examples of static KBA questions include:</p>
 
 What is your mother’s maiden name? 
 What was the name of your first pet? 
 In what city were you born? 
 What is your favorite book? 
 
<p>These questions are typically selected during user onboarding. Later, when the user accesses the account, they are asked to provide the answers to those same questions.</p>
<p>Dynamic KBA<br>
Dynamic approaches, as a form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/adaptive-authentication/">adaptive authentication</a>, will generate questions based on information from various data sources tied to the user, such as public records, credit reports, or social media profiles. The system uses algorithms to select relevant, personalized questions only the user should know. Examples of dynamic KBA questions include:</p>
 
 Which of the following addresses have you lived at in the past? 
 What was the name of your elementary school? 
 Which of these phone numbers have you previously used? 
 What bank/financial institution/auto lender do you have a loan/bank account/credit account with? 
 
<p>The generation process for dynamic KBA questions typically involves data aggregation and analysis to create a set of potential questions.</p>
<p>Both static and dynamic KBA have their pros and cons, with static KBA being more straightforward to implement but potentially less secure due to the limited set of questions. Dynamic KBA is more secure since it generates personalized questions based on the user’s unique background. Still, it requires access to reliable data sources and can be more complex to implement.</p>
 How Effective Is Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>KBA can provide a reasonable level of security in cases where it is used with other authentication methods. As a standalone method, however, it has some limitations.<br>
Some of the critical issues with KBA include:</p>
 
 Guessable Answers: Answers to static KBA questions may be easy to guess or research using publicly available information, such as social media profiles, online directories, or leaked data from breaches. This makes KBA more susceptible to attacks by determined adversaries. 
 Data Breaches: If an organization suffers a data breach, the answers to KBA questions may be compromised, rendering the KBA process ineffective for affected users. 
 Knowledge and Memory: Users might need to remember their answers, leading to account lockouts and frustration. Additionally, users might give easy-to-guess or common answers that are easier to guess. 
 Social Engineering: Attackers can use techniques like phishing or pretexting, to trick users into revealing the answers to their KBA questions. 
 
<p>Due to these limitations, KBA is generally considered less secure than other authentication methods like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) or biometrics. While it can still serve as an additional layer of security, organizations are increasingly adopting more advanced and secure authentication methods to protect user accounts and sensitive information better.</p>
 Is Knowledge-Based Authentication Used in Multi-Factor Authentication? 
<p>MFA requires users to present multiple factors to verify their identity before granting access to a system, application, or resource.</p>
<p>These factors are typically classified into three categories:</p>
 
 Knowledge: This factor includes information that only the user should know, such as passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or answers to knowledge-based authentication (KBA) questions. 
 Possession: This factor involves something the user physically possesses, such as a hardware token, a one-time password (OTP) sent to a registered mobile device, or a software token generated by an authenticator app. 
 Inherence: This factor refers to biometric characteristics unique to the user, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris/retina scans. 
 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication can fit into the knowledge category. But, broadly, KBA isn’t a replacement for passwords or PINs. However, and more appropriately, KBA can provide another, easy-to-implement layer on top of MFA.</p>
<p>So, for example, if a user attempts to access their credit report, the provider can ask for a password and a one-time password sent via email. Then, when the user logs in, the provider can use dynamic KBA to ask questions related to the credit report, adding another layer of security to an incredibly sensitive document.</p>
 What Are Some Alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>Several alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) provide more secure and reliable methods for verifying a user’s identity. Some popular alternatives include:</p>
 
 Token-Based Authentication: One-time passwords are unique, time-sensitive codes generated by a dedicated hardware token, mobile device, or software application. The user must enter the OTP in addition to their standard password to authenticate their identity. Since OTPs expire after a short period or upon use, they offer a more secure alternative to KBA. 
 Device Authentication: Verification systems can use push notifications or apps to allow users the ability to authenticate via their device, typically a mobile device. While these devices can be compromised, they will, at minimum, greatly reduce the attack surface that could impact those users. 
 Biometrics: Biometric authentication relies on unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">behavioral biometrics</a>, or facial scans, to verify a user’s identity. Biometric authentication is more secure than KBA because it is based on features unique to the individual, making it difficult for attackers to spoof. 
 
<p>These alternatives offer varying levels of security, usability, and implementation complexity, depending on the specific use case and the organization’s requirements. Many organizations opt for a combination of these methods to provide a more robust and secure authentication process.</p>
 Ground Your Security in Identity-Based Authentication with 1Kosmos 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication is a useful companion to other forms of identity verification but only a small part of it. Implementing such solutions can help add layers of security but don’t serve as a replacement for solid security techniques like identity verification, biometrics, and passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides these critical fundamentals through the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>This is the story of how we built an open source company that specializes in developing the identity, data, and compute protocols for the future of the Internet.</p>Poutine Meetup in Berlin<p>Fission’s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@boris">Boris Mann</a>, has been on the Internet for a long time. As one of the first 1,000 bloggers in the world, Boris loved being able to publish content online but recognized the challenges to making self-publishing possible for everyone. Running a server under your desk at home, installing software on the command line, and generally having the necessary technical know-how is neither realistic nor equitable.</p><p>Discovering the Drupal open source content management system and its worldwide network of contributors was an eye-opener: here was software and more importantly community working on making it possible for anyone to publish online. Boris became an active contributor, including helping to organize events that grow from 40 people to 1000s of Drupalcon attendees, and helping to form the Drupal Association.</p><p>At the same time, large proprietary software companies, like Microsoft, were working hard to retain their market position. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents">They viewed open source software as a dangerous competitor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">adopted internal policies</a> to thwart the advancement of FOSS. </p><p>Boris continues to advocate for and share open source code, data, and community principles. Building better together, so that people can have more control and agency of technology for better communication and collaboration online and off. </p> <p>Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, started studying music composition at the University of Calgary and doing graphic design projects on the side. She picked up Photoshop and Illustrator and eventually dropped out of music school and moved to Vancouver. About five years later, while doing graphic design professionally at a friend's startup, she was given a book on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and asked if she could learn a bit of web development. By the end of the year, Brooklyn had taught herself over 20 programming languages.</p><p>Brooklyn became deeply involved in the local meetup scene, running multiple communities across many topics. She became involved in international functional programming and distributed systems conferences after she ported the Haskell standard library to Elixir. (It later tuned out that functional data structures are a great fit for IPLD).</p><p>Eventually, Brooklyn decided she wanted to return to startups, and was hired by a company based out of San Francisco. She and her Vancouver co-worker rented a desk from Boris's <a href="https://fullstack.ca/">co-working space</a>, which is how they met!</p><p>Brooklyn went on to do consulting work for Facebook, Uber, Kickstarter, and many others. After writing the same boilerplate for the nth time and fighting with k8s, she started to feel that there must be a better way. She began early designs of things that would eventually find their way into Fission.</p><p>After a couple of years away travelling as a digital nomad, she she returned to Vancouver in 2017. She joined Boris as principal engineer at a company working on Ethereum-based, legally compliant infrastructure. Brooklyn then focused on writing a formally verifiable smart contract language that was also human-readable (so that a lawyer could review the code).</p>April 2019, RUN EVM event in Berlin<p>Excited by the potential of a backend as a service, aka the "world computer" of Ethereum, Boris and Brooklyn together founded a company called SPADE ("Special Projects and Decentralized Engineering") and received an important grant from the ConsenSys Tachyon program to work on Ethereum Status Codes, which were later renamed FISSION Codes. They were one of only two companies to receive an open-source grant (the other being WalletConnect).</p><p>While building FISSION Codes, both Boris and Brooklyn started to recognize that the real challenge for both Web2 and Web3 was the increasing complexity of putting together full stack applications – plus the devops needs of running such apps. Except now, these problems were compounded by complex security needs and a more fervent demand for user control and agency. Users had been burned by Web2 exploitation and were becoming more discerning and knowledgeable about how their privacy was being compromised.</p><p>While the Web3 of blockchain, decentralized web, and p2p components were new and everyone was learning, all of the same challenges of needing to gain all of the increasingly complex skills of full stack app development and deployment were there.</p><p>After spending time on core Ethereum development &amp; community building, our cofounders asked themselves:</p><p>What if some of the emerging concepts of &nbsp;Web3 – advances in distributed systems, cryptography, and self verifiable data structures – could make it dramatically easier for front end developers to build apps, without having to become full stack developers and devops experts.</p><p>And so Fission the company was born: building an edge stack with identity, data, and compute components that enables front-end developers to build local-first apps while respecting user privacy and agency. </p>The 2019 Diffusion Hackathon grand winners, Marco and Eugene, were gifted a 4L jug of maple syrup for using the first version of the Fission service in their winning entry<p>In a Web2 stack, to put an app online, you need to run a server to hold user data. All of this data is visible to the people that run the service, and the incentives are typically to lock the users' data into the service. Never mind scaling and devops server management.</p><p>In prototyping, front end developers use dummy data in the browser without having to worry about setting up a server.</p><p>What if they could make that much simpler prototype development capable of running the production data? It would make development much easier for developers, and data wouldn't have to leave the device! By default, it would have to respect user agency. </p><p>Fission (as it is now known) became a member of the <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs Network</a> and started to build on top of the IPFS protocol. This direction would lead to the inventions of UCAN (decentralized user auth) and WNFS (user file system on top of IPFS with encrypted private data).</p><p>Today <a href="https://odd.dev/">our front end developer SDK</a> has evolved its storage solution into an overall data solution. We are working on a far-edge database called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">Rhizome</a> to be added to the mix. We continue to iterate and collaborate with others on UCAN and other decentralized identity tools and have done an initial release of the final piece of our edge stack: content-addressed computation on IPFS with the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipvm-computation-ipfs/">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM</a>) specification.</p><p>Our commitment to community building and open-source development is unwavering, and we look forward to continuing to grow and collaborate within this robust and exciting ecosystem.</p>

<p>This is a guest blog by <a href="https://medium.com/u/49286d46d497">Abu Majid</a>, Storyteller at Story x&nbsp;Design</p><p>As a multimedia producer at Nairobi-based Story x Design, I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating on four Caribou Digital research projects since October 2020. When Caribou Digital reached out in February 2022 asking to expand our participatory video storytelling methodology to meet the needs of digital platform workers living with disabilities, we had the opportunity to rethink our processes, from training, to filming, to the accessibility of our final&nbsp;edits.</p><p>An <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-e90075e3f69d">earlier blog</a> by Story x Design Director Miranda Grant outlines our original participatory storytelling methods and offers tips for those interested in this filmmaking process. This blog reflects on our experience of collaborating with persons living with disabilities to create short documentaries about their lives and how we adapted our methods to fit their needs. We recount our design process, learnings, successes, and contingencies to barriers encountered.</p><p>This research, co-led by <a href="https://inable.org/">InAble</a> and Caribou Digital and in partnership with Mastercard Foundation, aims to understand the experiences and challenges of young people living with disabilities and engaging on platforms for work. With the support of InAble and Caribou Digital, we designed open-ended questionnaires to elicit authentic reflections on the challenges faced and strategies employed by platform workers living with disabilities. Our agile approach allowed us to stay nimble, learn from participants, and adjust as required throughout the&nbsp;process.</p> Three key adjustments to our&nbsp;process   Adapting the project design to ensure access for all. In order to make our collaboration with persons living with disabilities beneficial to them, we tweaked some of our supporting tools (i.e., film practice manuals, questionnaires, film prompts) for ease of use to all participants.  Working with interpreters and aides to accommodate multiple abilities. With the great support of a sign language interpreter and individual aides, we were able to help each participant identify and express the stories most important to them through a mix of in-person and one-on-one narrative and technical skills training. This hybrid mentoring approach helped participants gain confidence in their abilities to self-direct their own&nbsp;stories.  Diversifying post-production. Our versatile post-production, leveraging WhatsApp video / voice calls / voice notes and regular carrier calls, but also importantly in-person training, enabled us to stay in close touch with the participants who faced different types of challenges creating their&nbsp;content.   Adapting the project&nbsp;design  1. Adapting resources <p>Our participatory self-shot video diaries approach was developed in 2020 as a countermeasure to the COVID-19 lockdown. The framework requires the deployment of equipment and intensive multimedia skills training to all participants, where success depends on participants’ comprehension and willingness to contribute on their own time. So this process can be time and resource intensive. However, even after the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted, we decided to carry on with the self-shot video approach as participants expressed their eagerness to tell their own stories and willingness to take up the role of self-directing.</p><p>As per our usual process, we distributed a small smartphone production kit to each participant. But made a few adjustments to accommodate those who took&nbsp;part.</p><p>The phones were preloaded with:</p>  Six instructional videos on the downloadable VLC phone application. These instructional videos were embedded with a voiceover (VO) feature that defined and detailed basic film terms and techniques. The VO not only navigated participants with visual impairment through the content but also offered relatable examples for all to try. See a sample Story x Design instructional video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd3m6aJBzAs">here</a>.  A readable softcopy instructional manual for the native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">TalkBack</a> assistive application for both the visually and hearing impaired.  An audio instructional manual for the visually impaired participants and their&nbsp;aides.  Hardcopy instructional manuals for&nbsp;all.  A softcopy questionnaire and prompt document readable with TalkBack apps for all participants.   2. Working with aides during skills training and&nbsp;filming <p>We gathered with five of the six participants and their aides in a conference room in Thika Town, 44 kilometers from Nairobi City, a central location for all in attendance.</p><p>Together with participants and aides, we explored the self-shot video diaries format, examining proper camera orientation, sound capture, lighting, framing, and many more good film practices. Ongoing virtual mentorship provided participants with the support necessary to overcome technical and creative challenges over the course of production.</p><p>The close collaboration with interpreters and aides was key to enabling transparent communication with participants, in particular about the use of participants’ images and published videos. With clearly drafted agreement and image release forms, participants with their aides as witnesses, read, understood and after being satisfied, signed onto contributing to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Participants and aides were compensated for their work on this project. Participants received ongoing payments to purchase internet bundles for uploading large media files throughout production, as well as a one-time payment on project completion. Aides were provided with per diems for their efforts in supporting filming.</p> 3. Diversifying post-production <p>A key addition to this project was Monica Onyango, a sign language interpreter who helped translate footage submitted by the participants with hearing impairment. This enabled the post-production team to transcribe and edit subtitles to build a story that honored the contributors.</p><p>In one case where one of the visually impaired participants could not manage to find help in filming and sending more footage, we successfully sought her consent to use her voice notes as voice overs to missing segments in her story. This was in line with our desire to create a safe, accommodating space that offered an equal platform for expression.</p> Challenges and contingencies <p>We recognized that there would be challenges that we had not faced before. Although the six participants all come from one country and one time zone, and had experience navigating digital platforms, none had experience self-directing for video or taking part in a collaborative multimedia project of this&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Beyond the usual challenges in supporting the production of self-directed videos, here are some specific challenges people with disabilities faced.</p>  The need for in-person support. In addition to an initial in-person training, participants required one-on-one mentorship and refresher sessions throughout the duration of the project. When internet connections failed, team members needed to visit participants with visual impairment in person for troubleshooting and automatic upload restoration. Similarly, when capturing B-roll proved too challenging for participants, we traveled to support, while taking great care to follow participants’ self-direction and maintain the participatory project&nbsp;design.  The availability of aides. Even with per diems on offer, most aides were unavailable on occasion, particularly because most aides selected by participants were fellow students, and others had full-time jobs. Consequently, production was often halted as the visually impaired participants waited for&nbsp;help.  The authenticity of participants’ stories. We wanted to highlight participants’ authentic techniques of navigating the digital world to find work and understand their challenges. However, we refrained from asking questions beyond what participants revealed, allowing them to authentically share their successes and obstacles, instead of only emphasizing their disabilities.   Self-determination <p>The most gratifying measure of achievement for all of us is the fact that the expressions of all participants were not dictated, directed, or curtailed. At each stage of the project, participants had full control of their stories and authority on what to feature in their final&nbsp;videos.</p><p>All contributors stated that they felt liberated and supported throughout the projects, which made even the most difficult moments feel like blips in the project’s timeline.</p><p>To those looking to produce user-generated content in collaboration with people from all walks of life, we hope these learnings serve you well. There are many measures to evaluate a film, documentary, or piece of text, but no number can ever be placed on the impact of people feeling seen, listened to, and&nbsp;moved.</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJyLOKwzy5_ghJMy-gG50twQMN6TYKC3">Watch The Youth With Disabilities Digital Platform Experience videos&nbsp;here.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/persons-living-with-disabilities-self-directing-their-own-stories-93e2f5d4e8c">Persons Living With Disabilities Self-Directing Their Own Stories</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As part of my hosting duties on the Entrust Engage podcast, I’ve had the pleasure of speaking to some outstanding guests on a variety of topics from the science behind quantum computers themselves, to impacts post-quantum will have on digital security. In the latest episode, I was pleased to get a perspective I hadn’t yet – that of an analyst – when I was joined by guest speaker, Forrester Principal Analyst Sandy Carielli. As we set up the discussion for the episode, here are some of the insights she provided on the state of post-quantum preparedness:</p>
<p>Samantha Mabey: Where do you currently feel like organizations are with looking at PQ and kicking off preparations to prepare against and mitigate the threat?</p>
<p>Sandy Carielli: Organizations are in the early stages of PQ preparation. The financial services and public sectors are the farthest ahead in this area, not surprising given the sensitivity of the data that traverses their systems. The Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Practices Act signed by President Biden at the end of last year speaks to the attention that government is placing on PQ, and the recently unveiled National Cybersecurity Strategy also stresses the importance of planning for the transition to post-quantum cryptography. However, even those industries paying close attention to PQ are at the early stages – aside from a few pilots and proofs of concept, organizations are primarily at the planning stage, with some kicking off cryptographic inventories.</p>
<p>SM: What do you foresee being some of the greatest challenges that organizations will face in preparing for the migration to post-quantum cyrptography?</p>
<p>SC: Cryptographic migration is never easy – previous migrations, such as from SHA-1 to SHA-256, have taken years. Even increasing the key size, such as moving from 1024 to 2048-bit RSA, doesn’t happen overnight. The migration from RSA or ECC to a post-quantum algorithm will be even more complicated – given how deeply embedded cryptographic functions are in code and devices, rip and replace is rarely simple. For software and systems that organizations develop themselves, development teams will need to replace existing cryptographic code with new libraries, but standard implementations of the NIST selected algorithms aren’t widespread. Then there’s the supply chain issue – organizations will rely on their partners and vendors to update cryptographic implementations in their own products before the organization can fully migrate to PQ.</p>
<p>SM: While there is a consensus that the threat (of a quantum computer being able to break traditional public key cryptography in use today) is possibly a decade away, there is a more immediate threat known as “harvest now, decrypt later”. Do you feel like there is a lack of awareness of this threat and that it further justifies that the need to prepare for PQ now?</p>
<p>SC: The “harvest now, decrypt later” threat is understood in pockets, such as government and financial services, and these are the areas where that threat is critical – customers’ bank account numbers and citizens’ government identification numbers are not likely to change in ten or twenty years. This is why these sectors have started to prepare and must continue to do so – they realize that they will need to have migrated to PQ long before a quantum computer is able to break traditional public key cryptography, and that attackers won’t be able to decrypt any PQ-encrypted data that they harvest. Outside of that, security leaders are not as aware of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat – leaders must realize that any harvested data protected with RSA or ECC could be vulnerable later, including account information, intellectual property, and personal information (which an attacker could use as blackmail material). Broader awareness of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat would help organizations support PQ preparation strategies.</p>

 The world of finance is rapidly evolving and at the heart of this transformation is the emergence of digital currencies. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), in particular, have been a topic of increasing interest among global central banks. Coinfirm, as a leader in blockchain analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) solutions, closely follows these developments. Today, we delve into the latest updates from the European Central Bank (ECB) on their ongoing project – the digital euro. 



 The Digital Euro: Prioritizing the Euro Area 



<p>According to a recent presentation from the ECB, the primary focus of the digital euro project is to serve the needs of the euro area. The ECB plans to gradually introduce different use cases for the digital euro, aiming to make it accessible to everyone within the euro area before expanding to users outside this zone. This phased approach is designed to prevent the project from becoming overly complex while ensuring it meets the needs of its primary users.</p>



 Exploring International Opportunities 



<p>The ECB recognizes the significant potential of an international dimension for the digital euro. It aims to enable access to and use of the digital euro outside the euro area without requiring currency conversion. Furthermore, the bank acknowledges the need for interoperability to facilitate cross-currency payments. The ECB’s foresight in considering these broader opportunities is a promising indicator of the digital euro’s future utility.</p>



 A Rising Tide of CBDC Projects 



<p>The ECB isn’t alone in this digital currency exploration. In fact, a recent report by the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/bank-for-international-settlements/"> Bank for International Settlements </a>(BIS) shows a substantial rise in CBDC projects around the world. The ECB is actively supporting international CBDC initiatives, collaborating with the BIS,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/g7/"> G7,</a> and<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/international-monetary-fund-imf/"> International Monetary Fund (IMF) </a>among others. This collective effort by central banks worldwide underscores the significance of CBDCs in the future of finance.</p>



 The International Use Cases of the Digital Euro 



<p>When it comes to the use of the digital euro outside the euro area, the ECB is considering several scenarios. These include cross-border payments in digital euro, payments in digital euro outside the euro area, and use by visitors. The rules for geographical access will be determined by legislation, and if permitted, access could be extended to consumers and merchants in the European Economic Area and selected non-EU countries.</p>



 Interoperability of Digital Euro with Other CBDCs 



<p>One of the key factors in the success of the digital euro will be its interoperability with other CBDCs. The ECB has proposed two models to facilitate this: the interlinking model, which allows transactions without participation in each system, and the single system model, which involves a single system across multiple currencies.</p>



 Wholesale Central Bank Money Settlement: A New Initiative 



<p>The ECB is looking to contribute to digital innovation while ensuring that central bank money remains a monetary anchor. To this end, it has announced a new initiative on wholesale central bank money settlement. A new Eurosystem task force has been established to explore new technologies that could facilitate interaction between TARGET services and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>As an organization deeply entrenched in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>and digital currency space, Coinfirm recognizes the potential of CBDCs to revolutionize financial systems globally. We are excited to see how the ECB’s exploration of the digital euro progresses and will continue to provide our expertise and solutions in AML and blockchain analytics to support this evolution.</p>

<p>During this development cycle we have focused our lens on Sweden in particular, specifically with the continued support for Swedish BankID. Additionally, we have performed expected security and life-cycle management development. For full details, please head over to review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Swedish BankID 
<p>Throughout the Nordics, the ability to strongly identify oneself is considered to be second nature. The countries have invested substantial time over the last twenty years ensuring that each citizen and resident can perform many of their day-to-day tasks online. To carry this out, one needs to have a strongly authenticated digital identification method.</p>
<p>Within Sweden, this is predominantly <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en/privat/skaffa-bankid">BankID.</a> Since our original support of BankID via CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) back in the summer of 2018, things have changed. We have reviewed the BankID Relying Party Guidelines (v3.7) and developed an authentication adaptor to enable you to directly configure BankID within the Identity Platform. This means both two device flow, and the more commonly used single device flow, are supported. Now your users can strongly authenticate your web page or mobile app directly on their mobile device.</p>
 Focus Sweden 
<p>Full support for BankID coupled with our existing support for <a href="https://frejaeid.com/en/home/">Freja eID</a> and <a href="https://www.svipe.com/">Svipe</a> means that you can empower your users to authenticate with the most common services in Sweden. It’s well known that Ubisecure has a long history of supporting the Finnish population with a full suite of authentication options, from banking (TUPAS, which is now the FTN), through social logins (O365, Google and Apple), as well as specialised authenticators. &nbsp;Our latest release demonstrates our commitment towards Sweden, and we continue to develop the Identity Platform with a pan-European focus. We will be carrying out additional work over the next year to develop animated QR codes, required in 2024 by BankID. If there is an authenticator you need, that we are not yet offering, please contact Support or your account team and let us know. We work alongside our customers to ensure our Identity Platform evolves in line with your needs and expectations.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>Ongoing security maintenance is, of course, paramount. As we maintain the Identity Platform, we continue to improve both its functionality and security. During this release cycle, we have focused on updating Wildfly (to Wildfly 26). We have also updated OpenLDAP to 2.5.14, and Redis support to 6.2.8. Support of Linux Redhat 8 has also been tested. We always encourage you to upgrade to the latest possible release of our software as it provides the most secure and feature-rich Identity Platform possible. As always, you can find highlights of the changes on the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> along with a link to the detailed example of the logging changes found on our Developer Portal.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>In the short term, we are continuing work towards ongoing improvements that will be available in the next month, when we release updates for both SSO (SSO 9.2.1) and CustomerID (CID 6.2.1). Over the summer, we are continuing the maintenance cycle as usual. Continuing into the autumn and winter, we will be continuing our research into risk-based authentication development and other aspects of strong authentication.</p>

<p>It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve <a href="https://moneyzine.com/personal-finance-resources/credit-card-fraud-statistics/">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a>. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.</p>  
 What is PSD2 SCA?  
<p>The revised Payment Services Directive, more generally known as&nbsp; PSD2, is a regulation that has been implemented in Europe, covering countries in the EEA, Monaco and the UK. Its main goals are to improve customer choice among payment providers, protect customer safety, and combat payment fraud. One key aspect of PSD2 is its obligation for all companies that provide payment services, including banks, financial institutions or other payment service providers (PSPs), to use Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The PSD2 SCA requirements oblige relevant companies to enhance customer security around payments by deploying <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for relevant transactions. MFA means that the customer must verify their identity by providing two or more factors of authentication. The guidelines on PSD2 SCA also note that authentication must be performed in a manner that protects customer data.&nbsp;</p> 
 Who Needs to Comply with PSD2 SCA?&nbsp;  
<p>Who falls under the umbrella of PSD2 SCA compliance? Well, it's not just the traditional players in the banking industry. Thanks to PSD2, new players like Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) and Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) have entered the scene. PISPs act as intermediaries between customers' banks (or where their money is) and sellers of goods or services. AISPs, upon user permission, consolidate all user financial information (such as deposits, loans, and direct debits) in one place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your company falls into these categories, you need to adhere to the PSD2 SCA requirements when <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">providing the following services</a>:</p> 
  
  Payment initiation services (these inform a seller that the customer has proceeded through an online purchase)  
  Account access (when a user, or a third-party service provider, asks their bank to inform them of their financial situation)  
  Card-based instructions (when a customer asks their bank or PSP to pay someone from their account)  
  
<p>If the payment or information instruction is initiated and processed in the regulation’s area, it must follow PSD2 SCA guidelines. For US companies, this could apply, for example, if they have a European-based entity or are looking to provide the specific services mentioned to EU citizens.</p> 
<p>Organizations are required to decline transactions that do not meet SCA requirements. There are exemptions for small transactions (less than €30), where the financial institution can prove it is a low-risk transaction or where the customer has whitelisted the service provider, such as for a direct debit of a phone or electricity bill.</p> 
 How to Implement PSD2 SCA  
<p>To comply with the PSD2 SCA requirements, organizations must ensure that their customer authentication meets the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1761863/314bd4d5-ccad-47f8-bb11-84933e863944/Final%20draft%20RTS%20on%20SCA%20and%20CSC%20under%20PSD2%20%28EBA-RTS-2017-02%29.pdf">regulatory technical standards</a> (RTS) set out for PSD2 SCA. This involves implementing MFA for relevant transactions and adhering to&nbsp; other specifications detailed in the RTS. These include:</p> 
  
  Dynamic linking of remote payments (creating a unique code specifying payee and amount to reduce fraud) should be based on technologies such as digital signatures or cryptographically underpinned validity assertions using keys.&nbsp;  
  Special advice should be given about the length or complexity of knowledge factors and the algorithms underpinning possession and inherence factors.&nbsp;  
  The application of PSD2 SCA should strike a balance between enhanced security for relevant payments and user-friendliness and accessibility.&nbsp;  
  Payments and PSD2 SCA elements must have separation. For example, if a smart device is used to make a payment and also counts as a factor of authentication, there must be a clear process to differentiate them.&nbsp;  
  
 Benefits of PSD2 SCA  
<p>Beyond regulatory compliance, PSD2 SCA brings other significant benefits to financial institutions and their customers, including improved customer security, fraud reduction, and a better user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improved Customer Security  
<p>First and foremost, PSD2 SCA enhances customer security by raising the bar for authentication. With MFA in place, it becomes much harder for attackers to impersonate users and carry out fraudulent activities. While there are still issues around <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/passwordless-vs-mfa">allowing knowledge factors (namely passwords) in MFA</a> as they can be easily phished or brute forced, mandating MFA is a major step towards a more secure online world for consumers.</p> 
 Reduced Fraud  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">Fraud committed through account takeover</a>, which uses a victim’s card or bank details to purchase items, can create significant distrust between the customer and the firm involved, even if neither party was at fault. Reducing payment fraud fosters greater trust in online transactions, making customers more comfortable with making purchases and boosting revenue opportunities for service providers.</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>The PSD2 SCA regulation recognizes the importance of maintaining a user-friendly process. Nobody wants frustrated customers <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/customer-authentication-tips-for-safer-shopping">abandoning their shopping carts</a> due to cumbersome authentication requirements or forgotten passwords. The specification for being accessible and user-friendly means companies complying with PSD2 SCA should consider how their authentication stream impacts the user and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">how it can be as frictionless as possible.</a></p> 
 What’s Next?  
<p>Earlier this year, the European Commission presented a study on the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f6f80336-a3aa-11ed-b508-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-280122910">application and impact of PSD2</a>. The study follows a period of <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/consultations/finance-2022-psd2-review_en">open consultations into revisions of PSD2</a> legislation. It is widely expected that a PSD3 framework will be announced, but its timing and the extent of the revisions have not yet been made public.</p> 
 Comply With PSD2 SCA and Improve Customer Experience With HYPR  
<p>The PSD2 regulates financial transactions in the EU and other countries such as the UK and Norway. Its strong customer authentication (SCA) requirement obliges financial institutions, banks and payment service providers to maintain strict MFA authentication procedures for operations such as payments over €30 or requests for account information. The PSD2 SCA requirements aim to improve online consumer trust by reducing fraud and account takeover attacks, yet without a significant trade-off of user experience.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless solution for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-customer-authentication">customer authentication</a> allows firms to fully comply with the PSD2 SCA and transaction signing directives, including cryptographic signing of every transaction and unique dynamic linking. With HYPR, you can ensure SCA regulatory compliance while removing friction from your customer authentication process.

<p></p> 
<p>In today's modern work environment, effective management of user identities and access is crucial for securing enterprise applications, systems, and data. As organizations increasingly deploy cloud-based services and resources, managing access has become complex and necessary. As a helpdesk engineer, it’s my responsibility to manage and track access requests from end users. To streamline this process and ensure secure access, I recently deployed an approval-as-code tool, which automates the approval process for access requests and integrates with our existing tools. This will enhance our ability to manage access and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access to critical systems and data.</p> 
 Access Management Challenges  
<p>Traditionally, I provide users with predefined default access based on their roles and responsibilities. Some admin users are provided with full access to core resources on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately, these accounts are potential targets for security breaches.&nbsp; Experian, Uber and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, and many others, were all breached due to hackers, such as the Lapsus$ group, exploiting admin access.</p> 
<p>In some emergency situations, users are provided with elevated access to be able to resolve a critical issue or incident. These requests are largely handled in either tickets or Slack threads. In other words done “by hand”.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some of the challenges I face:</p> 
  
  Inefficiency: Manually managing access can be an inefficient process and mistakes can be made if access is not removed.  
  Compliance challenges: It can be difficult to demonstrate that access controls are being enforced when some users have perpetual admin access.  
  Scaling: As the organization grows and the number of users and resources increases, it becomes more difficult to manage access for a large number of users across many systems. Creating access policies can get complex.  
  
 What Is Approval-As-Code?  
<p>At HYPR, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an already adopted practice to automate and standardize the process of deploying and managing our IT resources. We recently came across a tool that advertises “approval-as-code,” which extends the same principles as Infrastructure as code. With approval-as-code, we can automate and codify approval workflows for elevated access.</p> 
<p>The tool in question is called SYM by a company called <a href="https://symops.com/">SYMOps</a>. Sym allows you to build approval workflows that can be initiated and approved within Slack to dedicated resources defined within the tool.&nbsp; This provides just-in-time access in a manner which is audited and tracked. The current approval flow we have in place:</p> 
  
  End users request access within Slack and are asked  
   
   Which resource they need access to  
   Justification (ticket, incident or reason)  
   Duration of access  
   
  Request is routed to a dedicated Slack channel  
  Designated approvers can either approve or deny the request  
  If approved, the user is provided access to the resource for the duration selected  
  Once the time for the duration expires, access is removed and the user is notified within Slack.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Being that SYM is approval-as-code, we use our current code review process and I can collaborate with my team when building the workflows. The tool itself is managed with Terraform code so you can deploy resources and update the workflows. The approval logic is all defined in Python code so I am able to create custom policies that meet our needs but also help us scale.</p> 
 Deployment&nbsp;  
<p>Now I am not a strong or even an average coder, but the examples and support provided by the SYM team has been invaluable in helping my team and I get this tool off the ground running. No question was too basic or complex for their team as they helped me craft this tool which is now critical for our daily operations.</p> 
<p>SYMops offers multiple out-of-the-box integrations with their Python libraries. With the custom logic, we are taking advantage of the PagerDuty integration. This integration on request checks if the user is on-call in PagerDuty, to assist with&nbsp; “break-glass” access after hours in response to an incident or a page. Here is an example of the code that defines this logic which is also in the examples SYMOps provides:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>https://github.com/symopsio/examples/tree/main/basic/pagerduty_on_call</p> 
 Greater Security, Greater Convenience&nbsp;  
<p>By implementing a tool like SYM on top of our HYPR Passwordless stack, we can improve the speed, tracking and security of our applications, systems and data. Being that the tool is built within Slack allows our organization to easily adopt this process and not impede any critical work or velocity of our teams. Having the elevated access being gated by the approval workflows helps us ensure that there are sufficient guardrails for access controls in place and they are enforced.</p>

 Recap of recent IDnow ‘The State of Micromobility Regulations 2023’ webinar. 



 



<p>Our April webinar, which explored <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">the current state of micromobility regulations</a>, could not have happened at a more interesting time for the industry, following the recent Paris escooter ban.</p>



<p>Moderated by Oliver Bruce, Co-Host of The Micromobility Conference &amp; Podcast, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Usman Abid, Senior Product Manager at Tier, Martin Lefrancq, New Mobility Policy Advisor at Brussels Mobility, Felix Aumair, Head of Customer Success at GoUrban, along with our very own Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow.</p>



 What happens in Paris, stays in Paris? 



<p>With the escooter ban fresh in people’s minds, it was natural for the group to start by sharing their opinions on how it would likely impact the wider micromobility landscape in the rest of Europe.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it was a mixed bag of opinions, with some participants pointing out that it would likely heap additional pressure on mobility operators, who would be forced to play the waiting game while other cities decide whether to follow suit with a ban or not.</p>



<p>Despite the recent happenings in Paris, Michael said that there was no time to waste, and operators should seize the opportunity to enter the growing micromobility industry, “Now is a good chance to invest more and have a bigger focus on these kinds of topics to improve and develop micromobility services in the future.’’</p>



 The relationship between technology and regulations. 



<p>Later in the webinar, Felix and Michael discussed what measures and technology micromobility providers could implement to improve user compliance with regulations and ensure responsible use of their services.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is where IDnow supports many companies – not only in mobility – to give more responsibility to the user because there needs to be rules in place, certain behaviors, certain qualifications to make use of certain services, especially in the mobility sector. But since regulations develop and change, it’s important that providers have flexible solutions.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



 Shaping the future of a safer, more sustainable mobility future. 



<p>Later in the webinar, discussions shifted from regulations to the role that micromobility could play in addressing urban congestion, and how this can be better communicated to policymakers and the public.</p>



<p>Martin mentioned how there have been huge changes over the years regarding sustainable urban mobility in Brussels.</p>



<p>“Micromobility is forecasted to help reduce carbon emissions in our cities by 30-50% by 2030,’’ said Usman.</p>



<p>Before the webinar ended with a Q+A session with the audience, the panel covered the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">key trends and developments</a> that will shape the regulatory landscape in the coming years.</p>



<p>Predictions ranged from the importance of free-floating, dedicated parking zones to why micromobility needs to have a consistent regulatory framework that is only part of a broader ecosystem. Michael said that the very future of cities was dependant on the success of micromobility, citing the need for collaboration between key stakeholders (users, city governance, operators and regulators) to ensure regulations offer a safer and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">balanced mobility experience</a> for everyone.</p>

 Ontario’s iGaming market has witnessed rapid growth since opening to private gaming operators in 2022. With an industry-envied regulatory framework, now is the time to enter the lucrative market. 



 



<p>It’s been a little over a year since Ontario decided to permit private gaming operators the chance to offer online gaming services in April 2022. </p>



<p>Sports betting regulation in Canada differs depending on local governments, with each province having authority over the regulations in their jurisdiction; Ontario is no different in that regard. Where Ontario does differ from other Canadian provinces is that they are the only province that doesn’t require residents to use government-owned lottery and gaming corporations’ platforms.</p>



<p>Since opening the market to private gaming operators, <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">45 Ontario operators</a> have taken steps to comply with Ontario’s high standards of game integrity and player&nbsp;protections. The&nbsp;AGCO&nbsp;has also approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the&nbsp;province in the last year alone. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">study conducted in March 2023</a>, over 85% of participants had gambled via regulated Ontario gambling platforms. This is an impressive majority, especially considering that around 70% of all online gambling was done so via unregulated sites before the launch of the open market.</p>



<p>For more information on why Ontario is a natural market for European operators to expand in, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/?preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=70959">‘iGaming Ontario – a promising market for European operators?’ blog</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>A key objective in this first year has been to move Ontario players from playing on unregulated sites to the regulated market, so that they would benefit from high standards of operator and game integrity, fairness and player protections including responsible gambling safeguards.</p>Tom Mungham, Registrar and&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of the&nbsp;AGCO</blockquote>



 Key iGaming regulations in Ontario. 



<p>One of the most pivotal steps in Ontario’s journey toward becoming a profitable and desirable gaming market came in 2021, when the C-218 bill was passed by Ontario lawmakers. </p>



<p>C-218 allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting, this adds increased flexibility and opportunity for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizeable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.&nbsp;<br><br>In July 2021, shortly after the passing of C-218, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a> was created – a body to conduct and manage iGaming in Ontario, serving directly as a subsidiary of the pre-existing<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/"> Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>.&nbsp;Applications with iGaming Ontario and AGCO can run concurrently.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">The aim of iGaming Ontario is to enter into agreements with operators</a>, allowing them to offer online gaming experiences to residents of Ontario, as long as they are compliant with the new legal code and provincial law. One of the four iGO and AGCO’s market objectives is consumer protection, which is defined on <a href="https://igamingontario.ca/en">iGO’s website</a> as the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensure safe and responsible play, and game integrity<br>  Prevent underage access<br>  Ensure private operators comply with applicable laws, including compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) rules and regulations, and compliance with relevant privacy and information security laws&nbsp;  



<p>The <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> contains information on Ontario’s different iGaming rules and regulations. These are largely based on existing standards of Ontario’s regulatory body, AGCO.</p>



<p>Canada’s iGaming sector is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering-terrorist-financing-act-pcmltfa/">PCMLTFA</a>), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-transactions-reports-centre-canada-fintrac/">FINTRAC</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, there are a strict set of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> requirements. Operators are required to maintain internal AML operating procedures that comply with Canadian federal regulatory requirements, which include a wide range of rules and regulations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and much more.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are detailed KYC requirements in place, such as in-depth identity verification standards. This means players will have to provide official government documents, recent photo or selfies, and liveness to verify their identity during the registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 5 steps to becoming a regulated gaming operator in Ontario. 



<p>1. Apply for registration with the AGCO (Execute letter of agreement with iGaming Ontario)</p>



<p>2. Set up regulatory reporting with AGCO. Provide Technology Complicance Confirmation to AGCO (AML &amp; FInancial Information Submissions)</p>



<p>3. Obtain registration from AGCO</p>



<p>4. Application processes can be completed within a few weeks, if applications are well prepared, then iGO and AGCO are very responsive&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. The most difficult part of the application process is the risk assessment stage</p>



 Becoming compliant with Ontario’s iGaming regulations&nbsp; 



<p>Considering the depth and complexity of iGaming requirements in Ontario, entering the region as an operator may prove to be difficult. Operators will have to meet strict PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards, as well as go above and beyond those to meet iGaming Ontario-specific regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key barriers will also include meeting iGO’s AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-institution-kyc-process-running/">KYC program requirements</a>, which could require operators to do complete overhauls of data storage, tracking, and verification systems. This is something that has already been a hot topic around the world, with more and more regulators calling for stricter iGaming systems and regulations. A good example of this were <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">the changes for operators in Germany</a> which was challenging to say the least. Having experienced partners in a situation like this will be key to success.</p>



<p>Player onboarding requirements include:</p>



  Players must be 19+, physically based in Ontario<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Person (PEP) </a>checks need to be passed<br>  Personal information, including occupation must be collected<br>  Third-party providers are needed for onboarding for initial checks  



<p>One solution to meeting compliance and regulatory challenges is by working with an identity verification partner like IDnow. As an identity verification specialist, IDnow has the experience and tools to aid operators in entering new markets. This is done with the help of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> – an AI-powered verification tool that quickly and securely verifies users identities, while being completely AML compliant.</p>

<p></p><p>The concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) was first proposed in 2015 by Drummond Reed and then became an official W3C standard in July of 2022.</p><p>Adoption has grown quite a bit in the last few years. Here are a few ways they are being used today.</p> Employment Verification<a title="Direct link to Employment Verification">​</a> <p>LinkedIn recently announced a new free <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23679998/linkedin-verification-badge-system-clear-microsoft-entra">verified badge feature</a> that will be used to prove the validity of your employment, education, and other achievements. “The system is backed by decentralized identity and a trust model that involves an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. Organizations can issue cryptographically signed digital IDs, which employees can then use to prove they work at a company…” </p><p>LinkedIn is  using the Self-Sovereign Identity trust model connecting an employee's DID (subject) with their employer's DID (issuer), and LinkedIn as the verifier of the transaction.</p><p></p><p>As for education verification, LinkedIn users can request that their educational institution issue a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) for their degree or certification. The user can then choose to share the credential with employers or other third parties via LinkedIn, who then verifies the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic proofs.</p>  info  <p>DIDs vs VCs: DIDs provide a way to create and manage decentralized identities, whereas VCs provide a way to prove information about those identities in a secure and portable way.</p>   Digital Driver's Licenses<a title="Direct link to Digital Driver's Licenses">​</a> <p>The DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in the United States and in Queensland Australia are piloting a program that involves issuing <a href="https://www.govtech.com/fs/california-moves-to-test-new-digital-drivers-licenses">digital driver's licenses</a> and vehicle registration documents that can be accessed and verified using a mobile app. Digital driver's license apps are cryptographically secure and can be used to verify the authenticity of the license without the need for physical documents. These apps are backed with the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and DIDs. This program will lead to faster and more efficient services for customers, as well as improved security and fraud prevention.</p> COVID Digital Health Apps<a title="Direct link to COVID Digital Health Apps">​</a> <p>IBM used VCs as a key component in its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/resources/digital-health-pass-blockchain-explained/">Digital Health Pass</a> solution to enable individuals to securely and privately present their COVID vaccination status to third parties - such as concert venues and stadium events.</p><p>When an individual needs to prove if they are vaccinated, they can simply present their VC to a verifier (e.g., baseball stadium), who then verifies the authenticity of the credential and the accuracy of the information it contains using cryptographic proofs. </p><p>There are several benefits to DIDs and VCs in this use case including privacy protection, security, and efficiency. This simple interaction now allows individuals to maintain control over their personal health information. For example, all they need to disclose is true/false (vaccinated or not) versus a more detailed health record. </p><p>Overall, the use of VCs and DIDs in the IBM Digital Health Pass provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for individuals to prove their health status, which was essential for enabling safe travel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Social Media<a title="Direct link to Social Media">​</a> <p>Even social media applications are embracing the use of decentralized identifiers. Bluesky is a new social platform that serves as a reference implementation of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">AT Protocol</a>, a federated protocol for large-scale social applications. Instead of usernames that are specific to and owned by the application, BlueSky instead uses domain names for identity (e.g. alice.bsky.social). Unbeknownst to most users, these domain names are associated with a DID for the user.</p><p></p><p>These persistent DIDs enable users to migrate their account data to any other applications that utilize the AT Protocol - therefore giving users more control and ownership over their content.</p> Future of Decentralized Identity<a title="Direct link to Future of Decentralized Identity">​</a> <p>These companies are embracing the use of decentralized technology for identity management and verification at a massive scale. As this technology continues to mature, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of DIDs in various industries.</p><p>Want to learn more about DIDs and VCs? Check out our <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">guide on DIDs</a>, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials">blog post on VCs</a>, and tutorial to <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did">create your own DID</a>.</p>

<p>Secure remote access is a method that lets authorized users access a private network as if they were on-premises with that network.</p>
<p>This includes accessing systems, resources, and data the user could access where they logged in on the private system.</p>
<p>While remote access was relatively common in business sectors for the past decade, the onset of COVID and work-from-home situations expanded this kind of technology even further. Now, remote access is used for everyday work, managing remote systems, or performing IT support for end users.</p>
<p>Key components of secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Authentication: Users must provide valid credentials through various methods, including usernames and passwords, biometrics, or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication-best-practices/">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>. 
 Access Control: Administrators can implement access control policies to restrict user access to specific resources, applications, or systems based on their roles and responsibilities. 
 Encryption: Data transmitted between the remote user and the target system is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. This is often done through protocols like Secure Shell/Transport Security Layer (SSH/TLS) that support strong encryption and tunneling. 
 System Security: Servers, network devices, and endpoint devices must remain secure. Otherwise, they will compromise the integrity of the overall access solution. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Using a Secure Remote Access Solution? 
<p>Secure remote access offers several benefits for businesses, organizations, and individuals, including:</p>
 
 Security: First and foremost, secure remote access allows users to connect to sensitive systems and data wherever they are. The value of this kind of remote access in a modern, decentralized world cannot be understated. 
 Compliance: Secure remote access can play a major role in compliance efforts. Most frameworks and regulations have some requirements on how users access systems–requirements that include authentication, authorization, and encryption. Secure remote access checks these boxes. 
 Flexibility: Secure remote access allows employees to work more flexibly, accommodating various schedules and time zones. This means more productivity, more variation in where your company can hire, simplified collaboration between remote teams, and reduced office space and equipment costs. 
 Scalability: Secure remote access can quickly scale to accommodate the growth of an organization, particularly its workforce, allowing new users and resources to be added with minimal effort. 
 Centralized Security and Operations: IT administrators can manage remote devices, install updates, and troubleshoot issues remotely and en masse, ensuring that all systems get the same level of attention. 
 
<p>By providing secure access to resources and systems from remote locations, secure remote access offers numerous advantages in terms of productivity, cost savings, flexibility, and security.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Remote Secure Access? 
<p>There are several types of remote secure access solutions available to accommodate the varying needs of organizations and individuals. Some popular solutions include:</p>
 
 Virtual Private Network (VPN): VPNs are secured and persistent connections (private networks) that can extend to users such that they have full access to secure system resources. These networks work through a combination of technologies, including all those listed previously. 
 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that functions like a VPN but allows the user to access a single system rather than an entire network. 
 Secure Shell/Transport Layer Security (SSH/TLS): SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure remote access through “tunneling.” TLS is the protocol that supersedes SSH. 
 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): VDI is a technology that provides remote access to virtual desktops hosted on a centralized server. Users can access their virtual desktops from any device with an internet connection. 
 Remote Support Software: There exist additional tools that IT support services can use by requiring end users to install a client app that can facilitate secure system sharing between the two. These solutions have also become somewhat popular in instances of digital fraud. 
 Cloud-Based Solutions: Cloud-based remote access solutions leverage cloud infrastructure to provide secure remote access. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) WorkSpaces and Google Cloud’s Compute Engine. 
 
<p>Each remote secure access solution has its unique features and uses cases. Organizations should carefully assess their needs and requirements before selecting the appropriate solution to ensure security, scalability, and ease of use.</p>
 Are Their Problems Using Secure Remote Access? 
<p>Although secure remote access solutions provide numerous benefits, they also introduce some risks and challenges that organizations must address to ensure the security of their networks and data.</p>
<p>Some of the risks associated with secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Unauthorized Access: If an attacker gains access to a remote user’s credentials or devices, they may be able to access sensitive resources and systems. Since the solution assumes the user is legitimate, they will have full access to any system the user would have access to. 
 Endpoint Security: Security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the case of remote access, this is typically user security. An unsecured laptop or mobile device can open up a vulnerability in the network that admins cannot plan for. 
 Insider Threats: Much like endpoint security, insider threats are hard to fight since they are, for all intents and purposes, legitimate users. An insider with remote access can gain control of sensitive resources. 
 Data Leakage: Data transmitted over insecure networks or stored on remote devices can be intercepted, stolen, or manipulated by malicious actors. This can lead to data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and damage to the organization’s reputation. 
 Compliance: Organizations must ensure that their remote access solutions comply with relevant regulations and industry standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA. 
 
<p>Organizations should implement robust security measures to mitigate these risks. One such approach is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-best-practices/">zero-trust architecture</a> that can address typical attacks as well as user-based vulnerabilities.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI staking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 The Benefits of SelfKey iD and POI Staking 
 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI staking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Staking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI staking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be staked on with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By staking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI staking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By staking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have staked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, staking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens, as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI staking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By staking on their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Staking 
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI staking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information. To ensure the privacy and security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI staking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By staking on their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

 Recap of IDnow’s recent ‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar. 



 



<p>To coincide with crypto’s busy few days in April, when the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> was finally <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">given the green light</a> by the European Parliament, we hosted a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/identity-verification-kyc-aml-requirements/">‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar</a>, exploring the likely ramifications of the regulatory framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderated by Jennifer Hanley Giersch at ALL AML GmbH, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank, and Peter Müller, Financial Crime Officer at UBS, along with our very own Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs and Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</p>



<p>Watch highlights below:</p>



 



 

 



 MiCA: KYC and AML’s most important development for 2023? 



<p>The session strarted with predictions from the group as to what is likely to be the main driving force for developments in the KYC and AML space. Unsurprisingly, considering it was finally ratified by the EU in April, Rayissa touched upon the potential of MiCA.</p>



<p>“To harmonize regulations across an ecosystem is an ambitious project. The unification and transparency that is supposed to come out of MiCA is really important. One of those crucial steps is to enable KYC to do its job and foster trust in this ecosystem,” said Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>Jason agreed, explaining how MiCA would provide important guidelines that crypto exchanges and crypto entities would need to follow to ensure they do not run afoul of money laundering risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a great development for the industry because with clarity brings the ability for obliged entities to do the right thing, and implement the right technologies, controls, and internal processes to meet MiCA’s requirements,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed during the session, including the larger upcoming European Commission’s legislative proposal known as the AML/CFT package.</p>



 When together is not always better.  



<p>While there was a general consensus that the combined EU approach to regulatory requirements and policy was a positive thing, Nico did warn that this is not always the case.&nbsp;He said that while a common financial market policy in the banking sector exists in the European Union, there is no common policy that translates into a common implementation of AML/ CFT rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This means that practices are divergent across countries, and this is to the benefit of those that don’t want to comply with the legislation, because the system from a European perspective is only as strong as the weakest link.</p>Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank</blockquote>



<p>Nico went on to use the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20is%20a%20process%20that,element%20throughout%20the%20customer%20relationship.">Know Your Customer (KYC) process</a> as an example, and said that although there are common rules for the onboarding of clients, when it comes to effective controls, each member state does it differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed in the lively session, from the impact of regulations on unhosted wallets and decentralized ecosystems, to ways of changing the perception of crypto as an increasing risk for sources of wealth, the topic of KYC and MiCA was never far away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we are going to have a successful crypto hub – wherever that is, then we need to instil certain rules and regulations that enable a functioning and healthy ecosystem, and KYC will be integral part in facilitating this,” added Rayissa.</p>

  <p>In the last 10 years machine learning has become ubiquitous and touches all lives in ways that was unimaginable before. The machines can make decisions that required considerable human effort at a much faster speed and reduced cost with a little human oversight. As a result, machines don’t just have a higher than before influence in shaping our lives but are also under increased scrutiny by both regulators as well as user rights advocates.<br> The adage “with great power comes great responsibility” has long been used – from French revolution to superhero comics. It has never been truer as the great power that machine learning wields is now in the hands of almost anyone making a software product. It ranges from giving people access to the funds that can alter their lifepath, medical diagnosis that can increase their life expectancy or reduce it dramatically to their social media feed that cannot just provide them the content that keeps them engaged, but also polarise their beliefs by feeding them information that reinforces their existing notions.<br> With the growing influence of AI technologies and the corresponding scrutiny, the way AI development happens is beginning to change. The full data science lifecycle needs to incorporate the elements of responsible AI and the professionals who know how to design and implement these will be the ones that employers will look for.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/responsable-and-ethical-ai-eic2023"></a>

  <p>There are several sessions at this year’s EIC looking at the roles of policies in IAM, for modernizing and efficiency gains in IGA, for authentication and fraud detection, and for authorization. In his keynote, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will take a broader perspective and look at why the future of IAM and cybersecurity must and will be policy-based. This involves policies in IGA, policies in cybersecurity, hierarchies of policies, policies for application developers and IaaS administrators, policies in Zero Trust, overcoming static entitlements, policies in the context of DID (decentralized identities), and other topics. He also will discuss what needs to be done where, such as Policy Governance, Data Governance, and Policy Lifecycle Management, and why the shift to policy-based approaches requires a multi-speed approach, with policies in new digital services coming faster than policies for modernizing legacy IAM.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-of-iam-cybersecurity-is-policy-based-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The European Union’s regulation on Digital Identity, eIDAS, is currently being overhauled to adopt decentralized identity principles. The goal is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials, from eIDs to diplomas to payment instruments. Decentralized identity principles aim at giving freedom of choice and control to the end-user. Ensuring security and interoperability, however, will be challenging — especially in the enormous scale in terms of users and use cases the EU is aiming at. The choices made in eIDAS will have a huge impact on digital identity in the EU and beyond.</p>
<p>The so-called “Architecture and Reference Framework” (ARF) defines the technical underpinnings of eIDAS v2. Many experts from the member states and the Commission have been working on this framework over the last year, trying to select the best combination of technologies and standards out of the enormous number available in the market today. This talk will introduce the ARF and explain what architectural patterns and technical standards are adopted and how the challenges mentioned above are addressed in order to leverage on the vision of the eIDAS v2 regulation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eu-goes-decentralized-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Vertical risk management and complete identity governance can only be achieved through integration of critical platforms with other systems and applications in use and by either integrating existing point-solutions or reducing their number altogether. Integration of the identity-platform with SAP is one of those major challenges for many organizations today.</p>
<p>One Identity’s approach to this challenge is through a unifying, standard integration into SAP as well as other systems and applications to establish a common GRC framework and security concept. Which includes preventing isolated environments. To establish SAP-internal governance and minimize risk within the platforms privilege landscape most organizations use specialized embedded tools like ECS (Easy Content Solution) from IBS-Schreiber Solution. Integrating the identity management platform with the SAP rule-set administration allows SAP Rule sets to be applied directly, run SoD-analysis fast and efficiently and extend them to other systems and applications, such as MS AD, AAD. The potential value of this approach is significant as it allows a preventive risk-assessment throughout the whole SAP-stack.</p>
<p>This integrative approach also extends to the SAP Firefighter concept for it to be applied to the rulesets and extend these into other systems. The objective is clear: Simplify risk assessment and management, establish a unified identity administration framework and as baseline - reduce cost.</p>
<p>In short – it lays the foundation and framework for solid Governance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/sap-governance-enterprise-environment-integration-eic2023"></a>

  <p>For many years public concern about technological risk has focused on the misuse of personal data, with GDPR, most hated and loved at the same time as one of the results. With the huge success of LLMs and generative AIs such as ChatGPT,&nbsp; artificial intelligence soon will be omnipresent&nbsp; in products and processes, which will shift regulator´s attention to the potential for bad or biased decisions by algorithms. Just imagine the consequences of a false medical diagnose, or of a correct diagnose created by an AI and then not accepted by the doctor. Not to mention all the other fields where bad AI can be harmful, such as autonomous cars or algorithms deciding on your future credibility. Inevitably, many governments will feel regulation is essential to protect consumers from that risk.</p>
<p>In this panel discussion we will try to jointly create a list of those risks that we need to regulate the sooner the better and try to create an idea on how this future regulation will impact the way we use AI in our bsuiness and private lives.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-governance-regulation-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Companies are facing increasingly complex security threats. Many are struggling to assess their own security risks due to an inability to address potential issues as they arise, due to the breakneck pace at which issues are disclosed, and teams' ability to address said issues as they accumulate and because the huge number of security tools in use create diagnostic&nbsp;fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vulnerability management programs rarely ever match the overall scale of the organization, boosting the number of potential points of exposure. What's more, besides vulnerabilities, attackers are increasingly&nbsp;leveraging&nbsp;exposures such as misconfigurations and stolen credentials to gain access to companies' core business. Because of this, attack paths to critical assets are often overlooked or identified too late.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at vast numbers of isolated issues, XM Cyber aggregates them into an attack graph to proactively identify hidden attack paths and weaknesses in both the cloud and on-premises. XM Cyber helps organizations efficiently address the issues that can have the greatest impact on organizational&nbsp;risk. Then teams can eliminate attack paths at critical junctures, i.e., choke points, in order to achieve ultra-efficient risk remediation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/continuous-exposure-management-eic2023"></a>

Every organization faces the risk to be the target of a cybercrime, but the transition to business digitalization leaves a greater room to present vulnerabilities in the system, and if attackers happen to identify them, the attack will occur. The world is changing rapidly, and companies must change with it, and so insurers see their possibility to break into the market. Is it worth to have a cyber-insurance policy? Does it cover all the damages? What is the extent of insurers responsibilities and the company one? Could these cases go to court and under what conditions?&nbsp;</p>

It summarizes a recent paper by the non-profits that guide the GAIN vision.<br> <br> GAIN remains a call for collaboration toward globally interoperable identity assurance at-scale - a purpose that underpins the goals of governments, intergovernmental agencies, and private industry. It has inspired multiple working groups and continues to unite six non-profits - even (and especially) as the technical and policy landscape evolves to include emerging standards (e.g. MDLs, DIDs, VCs) and regulation (e.g. eIDAS 2.0).<br> <br> This talk reflects on GAIN's relevance in today’s landscape and shares progress. It includes a deep dive into the technical community group at the OpenID Foundation, which has built a prototype that demonstrates cross-network trust and high-assurance identity data exchange. It now turns its attention to digital wallets, verifiable credentials, legal entity identifiers, and government-issued IDs.<br> <br> It also reviews forward-thinking policy work by the Open Identity Exchange, which paves the way for Smart Digital IDs. Their Global Policy Metadata Framework proposes the standard publication of policy characteristics. In this world, policy metadata is shared between each trust framework through trusted wallets.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/gain-2023-and-beyond-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Are we really in control of our identities, are they merely assigned to us, or is there something else at play?<br> <br> The promise of a "self-sovereign identity" seems great: you know who you are, and through the magic of technology you can prove to everyone around you that you are who you say you are. The technology to enable this is being built and deployed, but is it the right solution? Even more fundamentally, is it the right model at all?<br> <br> In this session, we'll examine the core concept of "self-sovereign" identity in the light of how society has historically viewed identity and how our digital systems have modeled identity in different ways over time.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/your-identity-is-not-self-sovereign-eic2023"></a>

<p>With heightened reliance on remotely delivered services and transactions, the need for safer and sounder digital identification and verification is required and will become the norm in the future. This especially is true looking forward to mandates for the adoption of zero trust frameworks in which digital credentials will be issued and then used for identification and operational purposes. GLEIF is committed to making concrete and lasting improvements to the process of identity verification by leveraging the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in digital tools. GLEIF has made the LEI verifiable by creating the vLEI (verifiable LEI) with digital credentials that deliver decentralized identification and verification for organizations as well as the persons who represent their organizations either in official or functional roles. GLEIF has made much progress on developing the governance, credentials and infrastructure since introducing the vLEI in 2020 and will share an updated at this progress in this session.</p>

In this session, we will explore the insights that can be gained through the analysis of global DID data. At Danube Tech GmbH, we have developed version trackers that monitor various DID methods, such as did:indy, did:ebsi, did:ion and others, collecting and storing data on DID transactions in our database for analysis. During this session, we will present the results of our latest analyses, including trends in DID transactions over time, distributions across different verification methods, and errors found in DIDs and DID documents. This information can be valuable for businesses looking to understand and utilize DIDs in their operations, as well as for individuals seeking to use DIDs for their own digital identity management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-decentralized-identifier-data-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Decentralized identity has made its waves in the EU with European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) and in the US with various funded projects. A vast market in south-east Asia stays untapped. We have enabled our partner organization ZADA to build a decentralized identity ecosystem that connects various southeast Asian countries with numerous cases like 'Decentralized Vaccination TravelPass', 'Employment IDs', and 'Government issued Educational Credentials'. The journey of a decentralized identity platform from ideation to MVP and to a scalable production system can bring tremendous insights. We were able to successfully enable the public sector in Myanmar to engage with self-sovereign identity and bring value to its citizens by issuing over more than a quarter million digital credentials. Monetization of these credentials was an essential factor for us. These self-sovereign identity credentials varied in use cases and were verified by Singapore immigration, Public sector hospitals, the Education Ministry of Myanmar, the Health Ministry of Myanmar, and various other private sector vendors. Our journey covers various use cases in EdTech, HealthTech, IAM, and KYC. Explored right, these cases can help us dive into how enterprises can engage with the southeast Asian identity market.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-ecosystem-southeast-asia-eic2023"></a>

  <p>How changing requirements for a seamless yet secure customer experience affect your Customer Identity solution</p>
<p>Today's consumers live parallel lives, with one foot in the physical world and the other foot leaving many digital footprints across the internet.&nbsp;In the physical world, trust is easier to build and identity is easier to validate. In the digital world&nbsp;the consumer is The Invisible Man - more difficult to interact and connect with but wanting a simple, effortless digital experience with impeccable security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore how identity is the link between both worlds and is the centre of every great customer experience. From providing delightful experiences to ensuring security and privacy, we will show how the right Identity Solution resolves the Invisible Man paradox, building connection and trust in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/invisible-man-paradox-eic2023"></a>

<p>At IPFS Thing 2023, Engineer Blaine Cook presented his work on the Name Name System, a tool that could improve the discoverability of IPFS-hosted content.</p> What's in a Name? <p>Let's start with the basics. First, let's define what a name is and isn't. A name is public, globally unique, and verifiable. </p>  Public - viewable by everyone  Globally unique - cannot be duplicated  Verifiable - possible to prove control of the name using a DID. Examples of verifiable names include DNS hosts and domains, email addresses, social media handles, public keys, HTTP URLs, SSNs, and more.  <blockquote>"A DID is not a name, but all NNS names have at least one valid DID."</blockquote> What is NNS? <p>It is a way to map names to data securely.</p> How Does it Work? <p>Step 1: Select a did:method</p><p>This could be did:ens, did:DNS did:twitter, etc.</p><p>Step 2: Fetch the TXT record for your did:method and find the public key</p><p>Step 3: Input the name and DID data in the NNS form</p>  Name (the name you are assigning to the content)  Issuer (the DID)  Fact Type (DNS link, Mastodon server, etc.)  Fact Value (the pointer to that fact type)  <p>Step 4: Generate a UCAN out of that data</p>  DID for Private Key  UCAN  Signature  <p>Step 5: Store in NNS DHT (shown in Blaine's demo in the recording)</p><p>Step 6: Fetch the record(s) for the name from the DHT and use the data in the UCAN</p><p>Since a name is tied to a specific DID, and the DID is self-validating, there is no way to manipulate a name you don't have control over. We enable authentication (DID) and authorization (UCAN) in a distributed P2P system and create a DHT by storing the UCAN in NNS, thus opening up many exciting possibilities. &nbsp;</p> What Problems Does NNS Help Solve? <p>Discoverability - NNS helps users find other users' public keys without knowing the DID method they used to generate them. It also allows the user to find where another user shares content tied to that DID. </p><p>Encrypted Chat - NNS can be a mechanism for enabling encrypted communication</p><p>IPFS Search - If you want to know where someone's IPFS-hosted blog exists, finding it can be very difficult if you don't know the CID. NNS helps locate specific content by its name, which is much more human-readable and easier to remember.</p><p>Package Naming - Similar to IPFS Search, NNS makes locating specific Wasm code easier through package naming.</p> What is NNS Not? <p>It's not a petname system. Petnames don't cross connectivity or trust barriers. In a local-first future, we need names to help us continue working offline and ensure we interact with the person/data we intend.</p><p>It's not a way to prove ownership of a name (that's what the DIDs are for!). It helps you discover those proofs.</p><p>It's not a new namespace. </p><p>It's not guaranteed to be globally consistent.</p><p>It's not a blockchain.</p> Possibilities <p>It can bring together all existing standards in one place instead of trying to create a new standard.</p>XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/927">https://xkcd.com/927/</a><p>It could replace IPNS and DNSLink by improving latency and security. Yes, a decentralized DNS!</p><p>Currently, there are several ways to link DNS names to the decentralized web, but virtually no options link email, social handles, HTTP, etc.</p><p>We could enable permissionless usage of names that we don't own using NNS by signing a proof that we own an email address (for example) even if that email is from a centralized service that hasn't enabled interactions with some new decentralized service. </p> Next Steps <p>This work is in the beginning/experimental stages, and many questions still need to be answered. We also need to solve for latency and locality and ensure a degree of consistency. </p><p>Here's the recording of Blaine's presentation at IPFS Thing 2023.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about NNS, you can review the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/nns-the-name-name-system/3684">spec</a> and join our monthly <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan?tk=I52b5p">UCAN community calls</a>. </p><p> </p>

  The G7 is pushing for increased oversight of P2P cryptocurrency transactions through the&nbsp;FATF.  Authorities insist that the proposed regulatory changes could lead to a safer and more transparent cryptocurrency market, fostering wider adoption.  These stricter regulations raise concerns about privacy rights and could increase costs for crypto service providers.  <p>Cryptocurrencies have surged onto the global stage, carving out a significant niche in an increasingly digital world. However, the rapid expansion of this relatively nascent market has also been accompanied by notable challenges.</p><p>The Group of Seven (G7), recognizing these challenges, is now pushing for improved oversight of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. And although this call to action has its share of potential benefits, it also underscores the complex realities of&nbsp;change.</p> A Significant Shift <p>The G7’s call for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to intensify its scrutiny signals a significant shift in global regulatory focus.</p><p>The FATF, an intergovernmental body known for setting global standards against illicit financial activities, currently only supervises transactions that go through crypto service providers. By extending this oversight to include peer-to-peer transactions, the G7 aims to cast a broader safety net over the global crypto landscape.</p><p>This proposition comes at a pivotal moment as digital currencies continue to gain traction worldwide, with regulators insisting that a robust regulatory framework is not just essential anymore — it’s imperative.</p><p>Authorities believe enhanced oversight could curb illicit activities, strengthen overall market confidence and security, spur trust among users and potential investors, and set the stage for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>More on the topic: G7’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p> The Flip&nbsp;Side <p>This regulatory coin involves striking a delicate balance between increased oversight and the sanctity of user privacy — a valued feature that has been central to the appeal of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While necessary for mitigating risks, regulations may impinge on the freedom and privacy that crypto users have come to appreciate.</p><p>Also, the increased costs for crypto service providers to adhere to new regulations could indirectly affect the users. While some view these potential costs as necessary for the sector’s evolution, others fear it could hamper innovation and growth in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Balancing these aspects — privacy, security, and cost — will be a crucial part of the regulatory evolution.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule — Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p> Final Note <p>While the G7 calls for enhanced oversight of individual cryptocurrency transactions is a significant step towards a safer and more transparent crypto ecosystem, it is essential to tread carefully.</p><p>The crypto landscape is a complex and rapidly evolving one, and ensuring its sustainable growth requires a regulatory approach that considers all sides of the equation.</p><p>The crypto world is on the brink of significant changes, but with careful consideration and balance, these changes could pave the way for a brighter crypto&nbsp;future.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>This week Simon and David review the recent RSA Conference that occurred at the end of April over in San Francisco. From the generic meta-patterns at the conference covering themes such as collaboration, standards, multi-cloud and technology integration, through to more IAM focused conversations covering MFA, passkeys and authentication attacks. Are passkeys now here to stay? What will help adoption? Will attacks on passkeys start to increase along with usage rates? Will attacks against existing MFA forms including SIM swap, MFA fatigue and social engineering be a compelling event to improve adoption?</p>

<p>Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is a critical requirement for organizations. In the past we’ve talked about the need for CLM <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/05/the-speed-of-business-is-fast-is-your-pki-keeping-up/">due to CA sprawl and concerns around legacy PKI</a>, and it being a means to rein that in and centralize certificates across environments. We also know that the number of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/12/the-trend-continues-organizations-are-managing-and-issuing-more-certificates-than-ever/">machine identities are on the rise</a> and in addition to the sheer number of machine identities that need to be managed, they also bring complexities – such as short-life certificates – that make manual processes unsustainable.</p>
<p>While those are excellent reasons to invest in a proper CLM tool, let’s talk a bit more about the role of CLM in relation to overall IT strategy – like implementing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and preparing for post-quantum.</p>
<p>Zero Trust</p>
<p>Digital certificates provide identity to people and machines, such as mobile devices, virtual machines, and IoT devices. Those certificates need to be issued by a PKI/certificate authority, which will then be able to verify that thing and give it access, whether that’s allowing someone access to your network, or servers talking to one another.</p>
<p>The part where CLM comes in as an important component of your overall Zero Trust strategy is in making sure you have strong issuance protection for your certificates. Essentially making sure no rogue certificates get issued giving too much access or privilege. This same reasoning applies to the need for control at any stage in the lifecycle of a certificate, like revocation.</p>
<p>Going one step further, here’s how CLM helps enforce the principles of Zero Trust:</p>
 
 Verify Explicitly – Making sure the right certificate is provisioned to the correct endpoint/target 
 Least Privilege – Providing the right assurance and access/privilege, by picking the correct certificate and lifecycle controls to be able to issue and manage it 
 Assume Breach – The ability to contain an attack and limit the loss and damage by revoking certificates (incident response) 
 
<p>Post-Quantum </p>
<p>When it comes to post-quantum preparedness, there is a looming <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">threat to existing cryptography</a>, which means organizations need to take steps today to prepare for the migration to quantum-safe cryptography. One of the first steps in that preparation is to have visibility into your cryptographic assets – from hardware and software to keys, certificates, and secrets.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways CLM can help:</p>
 
 Inventory. With robust discovery capabilities, CLM tools can help centralize the visibility of certificates across environments, from different certification authorities, so you know what credentials you have and where. 
 Identify Weak Cryptography. Is your cryptography up to date? Do you have hard-coded algorithms?<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/"> Are you crypto-agile</a>? The right tools can identity any risks you might have with your cryptography so you can remediate in advance of preparing for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 
 Consolidation. Going back to a core use of CLM – reining in the CA sprawl – it can be a tool to help migrate and consolidate your PKI footprint, making the transition to PQC much easier. 
 Automation. With the growth in the number of certificates organizations are managing, and the complexities of IT landscapes, organizations are looking for automation. There’s too much to manage and it’s too great of a risk to not have, making it a necessity. Pairing that with the migration challenge of PQC, automation will be a key ingredient to successful implementations. 
 
<p>Whether for the practical reasons of ensuring you have visibility and control over your environments, or for the more strategic reasons of implementing Zero Trust and preparing for post-quantum, make sure you’re using the right CLM tool alongside your PKI to ensure a secure future.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Hamzat and I am an Ontology harbinger.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am a quiet and simple person in general. However, I get things done quickly when something piques my interest. My strength is my ability to work really well within a team. I like to have an impact on the success of my team, therefore, I work hard and contribute many of my own&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering before starting my career. My hobbies include reading, traveling, and going on adventures. If I could have a superpower, it would be to be positioned whereby I can do things that make me happy and support humanity each and every day without having to worry about financial implications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology as a harbinger in 2017 to help others to understand and contribute to the company’s vision and mission. My role is to provide support for Ontology’s English-speaking community members. This involves providing members with information on the Ontology project or assisting them with any questions they might have. I also run a procurement company (BitKong General Merchandise) aside from volunteering with Ontology.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has been well-funded from the start and devoid of any crypto drama. As a project, it places huge value on its community and acts on any community feedback related to the Ontology product offering. Ontology is wholly dedicated to building the most impactful thing for the crypto space — a framework for Decentralized Identity Management, and this is something that sets it apart as a Web3&nbsp;project.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Although I don’t have an active part in developing the Ontology project, I enjoy supporting the success of the project through my role. I contribute to building a community with a rich knowledge of the Ontology project, disseminating any information, and offering support to&nbsp;users.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>I am very grateful for the time spent working with Ontology. While it has been a tough journey, it has sharpened my perception as an individual. Also, being able to provide support to other people, irrespective of their background, and being recognized for my efforts frequently, is very fulfilling for&nbsp;me.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about being able to contribute to the growth of the Ontology community and provide much-needed support to the ever-growing network of Ontology members. I have seen how Ontology has succeeded in recent years as a decentralized identity provider and how the project has grown steadily, so I am very excited to see how it&nbsp;expands.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I expect Ontology to be very successful in the next five years and to become a dominant force to contend with in the industry. I think it will outpace its competitors with its data privacy protection products and decentralized identity management tools, and thus, become a widely adopted Web3 project with a high price appreciation for its native&nbsp;token.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-hamzat-5f01a23ee227">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Hamzat</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>As organizations undergo digital transformation to zero-trust architectures, identity-driven security becomes a critical aspect. Beyond new authentication technologies, organizations must have strong authorization controls. Today, if and when an identity is compromised, the attacker can make lateral movements with very few restrictions and access a wide range of critical systems and information. Much of this over-permissive environment can be attributed to manual permissions management processes that are hard to maintain over time. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), which underlie these manual processes, provide a good baseline for access security. However, their complexity grows over time and the management overhead they place oftentimes subvert the very goals of security and compliance they are deployed for. Just-In-Time Access Management (JITAM) represents a new robust and secure authorization strategy that can reduce the need for periodic access certifications and manual role administration, while providing auditability. Learn how the authorization space is rapidly changing from RBAC and ABAC to JITAM, and how it could benefit your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/whats-next-in-enterprise-authorization-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Join this session if you want to learn how a globally operating science and technology company introduced a faster and phishing-resistant sign-in – driven by the open-industry standard FIDO.</p>
<p>Employees use Biometrics or Pin, instead of Password &amp; SMS, Call or App.</p>
<p>A “Detached Authentication” feature enables apps without FIDO/WebAuthn support and allow us to globally enforce the phishing-resistant sign-in – without fallback to other MFA methods.</p>
<p>Identity Verification is required for the registration and recovery of Biometrics or Pin. SaaS or self-developed identity verification methods can be used and combined.</p>
<p>The infrastructure for authentication and registration of Biometrics and Pin runs in a self-hosted environment. It allows us to stay true to our principles: Own Identities, Credentials and Authentication.</p>
<p># What makes it unique</p>
<p>Passwordless Sign-in <br> – Biometrics of device-in-use&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometrics sign-in available for all apps<br> – Detached Authentication for apps without WebAuthn</p>

Cloud signatures are expected to play a vital role across this new ecosystem by enabling natural and legal persons to electronically sign and seal documents and transactions with high-assurance remote digital signing certificates.

  <p>Cross device flows lets a user initiate an action on one device (e.g. a SmartTV) and authenticate or authorize that action on a trusted personal device (e.g. a mobile phone). Examples includes authorizing a smart TV to access streaming content, or authenticating to a service by scanning a QR code with a mobile phone and completing the authentication on the mobile phone. This process of authorizing an action on a separate (but trusted) device from the one on which an action is initiated is an increasingly common flow, whether used for devices with limited input capabilities, multi-factor authentication or credential presentation. A number of standards have adopted this pattern including Device Authorization Grant (formerly Device Code Flow), Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) and Self Issued OpenID Provider (SIOP). These flows solve important business problems, but is vulnerable to attacks where the user is tricked into granting consent to an attacker. The IETF OAuth working group has recognised this challenge and is creating new guidance that leverages zero-trust principles to defend against these "illicit consent grant" attacks. This session will discuss the attacks and how the new guidance can mitigate these threats against cross device flows.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cross-device-flows-illicit-consent-grant-attacks-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The past few years have seen a startling increase in decentralized technologies for Digital Identities. So far, much of their adoption has been limited to academic or proof-of-concept integrations (barring some shining examples) rather than consolidated production-ready use cases.</p>
<p>Generally, there isn't an enforced link between real-world and digital identities, and rightfully so. Still, enterprises' policies and regulations mandate companies to ensure restricted access to reserved data and undeniable attribution, which collides with general anonymity and distributed principles. Albeit SSI technologies aim at filling this gap with trusted-yet-privacy-preserving solutions, companies still need to consolidate digital identities and collapse them into a well-defined entity. We will talk about a hybrid approach to classic IAM for workforce management including W3C native credential integration with solidified and well-established SSO federations. In other words, delegate to the end users the choice of which identity technology to use as long as they can provide a trust chain that the companies can verify.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hybrid-iam-interoperable-verifiable-credentials-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The most interesting thing about recent AI innovations in the field of LLMs (Large Language Models) such as ChatGPT is that there is not much discussion going on about the effects LLMs will have on our daily lives, the way we consume information, seek guidance and the way we create information. Will we still need Identity Governnance Tools in 5 years time or will a universal cyber-AI have taken over the task of securely running the enterprise you currently work for?&nbsp;What about Tech Analysts and their guidance work? Will 90% of their work be done by non-humans? In this session we will try to jointly find answers on how tech guidance and consulting/advisory will change and, at least partly, disappear.</p>
<p>And this is how ChatGPT would write the Abstract of this discussion:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The session on "Tech Guidance in the Era of Polycrisis &amp; AI Driven Disruptive Change" will examine the increasing disruptive pressure on today´s business models caused by an evolving landscape of AI driven technology and the critical role of tech analysts to help organizations navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the convergence of multiple crisis and the rapid pace of technological change.</p>
<p>Topics to be covered include the evolving role of tech analysts in an AI-driven world, the importance of understanding the ethical implications of technology, and the impact of technological change on job markets and society as a whole. The session will also delve into the challenges of staying abreast of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing technological landscape, as well as the importance of fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration within organizations.</p>
<p>Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with speakers and other participants in a lively discussion of these critical issues, gaining valuable insights into the future role of tech analysts in helping organizations succeed in an era of polycrisis and AI-driven change and disruption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/tech-guidance-polycrisis-ai-change-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The digital-first customer experience and remote-first workforce pushed zero trust from buzzword to reality. And yet, much of the conversation is still heavy on theory and light on practice. Cyentia completed a global study of high-level practices which measurably contribute to a more successful cybersecurity program based on a rigorous survey of nearly 5,000 practitioners. Within that study, we analyzed commonalities of organizations implementing and operating Zero Trust. Let's look closely at where we are today.</p>
<p>Now imagine it is 2028. You’re five years into your Zero Trust transformation. People like it and usability has improved. Defensibility is better, too, with a number of attacks having been stopped over the past couple years. But then, in 2028, you get the call. There’s been a security breach. What happened!? This session will explore the future with a pre-mortem on how breaches will look under a Zero Trust architecture.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-five-years-eic2023"></a>

<p>OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted standard for authorization, but it can be complex to implement correctly. It's not uncommon for developers to have difficulty understanding the nuances of the OAuth 2.0 flow and instead rely on simpler approaches such as using API keys in "god mode."<br> <br> OAuth 2.0 can be difficult to set up and configure, especially for developers who are new to the standard. It involves creating an OAuth 2.0 client, setting up redirect URIs, and managing access and refresh tokens, which can be confusing and time-consuming. Additionally, the standard requires developers to handle user authentication and authorization separately, which can be difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with the concepts.<br> <br> Many developers may not understand the security benefits of OAuth 2.0 over API keys. OAuth 2.0 allows for fine-grained access control, enabling developers to limit access to specific resources and actions. In contrast, API keys provide more open access, allowing all actions on all resources. Developers may be inclined to use API keys instead of OAuth 2.0 because they are simpler and easier to implement, but they don't offer the same level of security.<br> Developers may find it hard to understand the standards, and may end up using an inconsistent approach.<br> <br> The panel will discuss these reasons and other potential causes for why developers may not be using OAuth 2.0 correctly, and provide recommendations for how to overcome these challenges. We will highlight the benefits of OAuth 2.0, such as improved security and the ability to provide fine-grained access control, to encourage developers to adopt the standard. Additionally we will give examples of real-world attack scenarios that could have been avoided if the application was using OAuth 2.0.</p>

<p>We entrust workloads and devices with our most sensitive data, giving them access to far more information than the human on whose behalf it operates, if it is even operating on behalf of a human. Yet, managing these non-human identities and applying Zero Trust Policies to them is a Herculean task complicated by a heterogenous technology landscape, amplified by multi-cloud/multi-hybrid environments, exacerbated by critical skills shortages and magnified by exponential growth in workload and device identities. <br> <br> It's the kind of problem standards excel at solving by creating interoperability layers between heterogenous environments, codifying the wisdom of the crowd to alleviate pressures on rare skills, and creating eco-systems of interoperable solutions that meet a common security bar. <br> <br> Fortunately there are already several standards efforts that can help us manage non-human identities. But how are all these efforts related and how to we avoid replacing a patchwork of heterogenous solutions with a patchwork of heterogenous standards? Is it possible to craft a standards framework and connect all these efforts in a single identity trust fabric, and is that desirable? If we had such a framework, what would it look like? <br> <br> In this talk we explore the benefits of weaving a standards framework for non-human identities by bringing together more than 18 standards from at least 7 standards bodies while identifying opportunities to align and connect them all to solve the emerging challenge of managing non-human identities at scale.</p>

<p>As always, there is something new and relevant in this. The fundamental question for many organizations will be on how to address the identity threat challenge best. Does it require new or different tools, or just a different use of what is already there? What to look for specifically? And how to reduce the risk of identity-based attacks? Is ITDR the core, or better identity protection? These questions will be answered in this session to help you navigating through the buzzword jungle.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/navigate-the-dr-jungle-eic2023"></a>

  <p>As a global OEM of highly critical and complex industrial devices, managing access to hundreds of millions of IIoT device resources spread across customer sites all around the globe is already a challenging task. &nbsp;<br> Use cases for providing a digital service platform need to address end customers accessing devices owned by themselves as well as priviledged access for in house and third party analytics applications and serice personnel. A combination of requirements for excelent user experience, authorization management and high performance for cross-tenant queries for endless scenarios can become a nightmare. &nbsp;<br> The task was to analyze the access requirements, abstract them and then deploy a “Zanzibar” inspired approach to manage access authorizations with a swift and reliable backend architecture, able to handle millions of information assets to be protected against unauthorized access. &nbsp;<br> Creating a mere access model does not do the full trick - it has to be cleverly designed into data storage structures and queries to achive the required performance goals! &nbsp;<br> The talk quickly introduces the problem set and then dives deeper into how to implement data storage optimization magic to get quick response times and swift adjustments of authorizations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/spicing-up-authorization-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Traditional network security focuses on perimeter defenses, but many organisations, systems and processes no longer have a clearly defined network perimeter.<br> <br> To protect a modern digital enterprise, companies need a comprehensive strategy for securely accessing their IT resources (e.g. applications, physical access control systems, portals, data resources, and devices) wherever they are located.<br> <br> APIs in supply chains and cyber-physical systems (CPS) are proliferating exponentially across the technology landscape, creating a huge attack surface that security teams struggle to understand and defend.<br> <br> Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) refers to security concepts and threat models that no longer assume that actors, systems or services operating within the security perimeter are automatically trusted, but instead must verify everything and everyone who attempts to connect via an API to their systems resources before granting access.<br> <br> Hence, ZTA is an important design philosophy to establish security mechanisms at the API layer of each individual IT resource for increasing API Endpoint Security in both, corporate infrastructures and open systems. Identity and authorization credentials as well as policies are a key enabler of securing the API endpoints.<br> <br> These different ZTA approaches include:<br> <br> 1) ZTA Using Enhanced Identity Governance, <br> 2) ZTA Using Micro-Segmentation, and<br> 3) ZTA Using Network Infrastructure and Software Defined Perimeters.<br> <br> Our presentation will demonstrate how Trust Frameworks and Identity Governance (1) are the foundational layer for a credentialing infrastructure. With this layer in place credentials can be used enable SW-defined perimeters (3). <br> <br> We will provide in-depth insides how ecosystems solutions such as the Open Credentialing Initiative and Gaia-X are applying design patters using decentralized identity and verifiable credentials for (3).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-api-endpoint-security-eic2023"></a>

With a Zero Trust security model, nobody is trusted automatically, even when they’ve cleared the perimeter. Instead, all identities are verified, minimum access is granted based on context, and activities are monitored to make sure controls are working as expected. The Zero Trust model requires multiple security controls throughout an IT environment to protect and manage identities, devices, networks, applications, and data.

  <p>Do you know during the peak holiday season, 75% of the traffic on your site can be malicious or bot?<br> <br> In 2022, there has been an 85% increase in Account takeover and it results in not only monetary losses but also losing consumer trust. <br> <br> To address these, the right authentication strategy is a combination of active authentication (SMS, Push Notification, WebAuthn, passkeys) and passive authentication that includes IP reputation, device fingerprinting, and user behavior analysis. This enables a frictionless experience for “good users” without lowering the defenses for “bad users.” <br> In this session, we’ll explore Dark Web techniques, open-source tools, and services that fraudsters use for credential stuffing, fake account creation, and account takeovers. In addition, we’ll share a practitioner's viewpoint on rolling out various active and passive authentication solutions and how the convergence of identity and fraud can help you build the right passwordless strategy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/better-passwordless-experience-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Italy has two National Digital Identity schemes, namely: SPID and CieID (leveraging the national ID card). Both of them are based on SAML2 and are on their way to supporting OpenID Connect. The reasons for this decision are numerous, and they are primarily related to OpenID Connect Core features such as flexibility, ease of implementation, better support for mobile applications, and widespread adoption, particularly in the private sector. To manage this transition, we considered several documents by the OAuth working group describing security best Current Practices and the OpenID Foundation specifying a profile for iGov and a framework for federation. In particular, the latter defines a hierarchical federation model with high security, interoperability, scalability, and transparency based on dynamic delegation mechanisms; Italy is an enthusiastic early adopter. <br> In this talk, we introduce the Italian OpenID Connect profile based on the iGov and federation profiles and explain the main security measures that we considered within our design from the aforementioned standards and available best current practices. We also discuss how the Italian OpenID Connect profile contributes to the iGov and OpenID Connect Federation documents. We conclude the presentation with a brief discussion of eIDAS 2.0 and some of the ongoing preliminary works in the context of the Italian digital identity ecosystem to move toward an SSI-based solution using the Italian OpenID Connect profile as a starting point.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/italian-digital-identity-ecosystem-eic2023"></a>

  <p>PAM (Privileged Access Management) is one of the established core disciplines within IAM. PAM also is the IAM discipline that is changing most from what it has been in the past.</p>
<p>On one hand, there is the impact of CIEM &amp; DREAM, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management or Dynamic Resource Entitlement &amp; Access Management. This is about the expansion of PAM beyond humans accessing servers and selected applications towards any type of human and non-human (silicon) identity accessing any type of workload, from servers to dynamic cloud resources. This also implies an expansion from serving static data center infrastructures to dynamic workloads in today’s agile IT. PAM is changing, with more parties involved – a “PAMocracy”, as KuppingerCole Analyst Paul Fisher recently named it.</p>
<p>These changes also require expansions in integration to other IT services. There needs to be a dynamic governance approach, where IGA comes into play. It requires rethinking whether PAM tools really should care for authentication. There is no need for authentication point solutions in an age where most organizations have a strong Access Management solution with MFA, passwordless authentication and adaptive, risk- and context-based access in place. Finally, this new PAM must integrate with the DevOps tools chain for permanent updates about new code and the resources used as well as with IT Asset Management for an always up-to-date insight into the ever-changing, dynamic IT landscape that needs to be protected.</p>
<p>Also worth to think about is integration with further security solutions, beyond the standard SIEM/SOAR integration. AI-powered security solutions are one aspect. Integration to Cloud Security Posture Management is another example.</p>
<p>In this panel, the state and requirements on the future PAM will be discussed.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-role-of-pam-eic2023"></a>

  <p>In this talk, Krishna Balan Kannappan will describe Kone´s path to a holistic and integrated Identity Security infrastructure.</p>
 
 IDM Deployment in KONE includes Lifecycle management of KONE Internal Users and non person accounts. Automated Processes in IDM ensures that minimum accesses required for Internal Users are granted automatically based on User Attributes and all accesses are removed automatically when user leaves the organization. Non Person accounts are hardened automatically based on the usage. 
 Applications authorization is managed by IDM using various provisioning mechanisms. 
 Applications authentication is controlled by Azure AD, MFA enabled is mandated for all applications and end users. 
 Admin Accounts used for Accessing KONE Infrastructure and Workstations are managed in IDM(Microsoft recommended Tier based model is used). 
 Self Service allows Role Owners and Account Owners to Create Access Reviews, Manage Passwords, Manage Access. 
 KONE SOC team uses IDM for performing emergency actions to disable/enable/reset Password of AD Accounts. 
 
<p>Privilege Access Management:</p>
 
 KONE uses PRIVX as the PAM Solution for allowing access to Infrastructure. PAM is integrated with IDM for authorizations. PAM Solution ensures KONE Infratructure cannot be accessed outside PAM by access controls and continuous monitoring. 
 PAM Uses Separate MFA for added Security. 
 Automations are implemented to onboard/offboard Application servers into PAM

  <p>A standardized approach to control privileged accounts can be valued as a profitable internal service.<br> While implementing Privileged Access Management (PAM) DKB concentrates on what kind of service delivery a PAM implementation can provide to its customers (our employees) to connect benefits for end-users and address identity security at the same time.<br> We call that Privileged Access Security Service.<br> From a technical and IAM point of view identity security can only be achieved by securing the respective digital identities and the assigned user accounts in the corresponding target systems.<br> In the area of IAM/PAM a comprehensive compliance level automatically results in a higher maturity of our information security management. Therefore, we reduce the non-financial risks not only by complying with regulatory requirements but also by adding effective security concepts – such as zero trust or least privilege – to our IAM/PAM ecosystem.<br> In this session the DKB approach to handle identities and accounts in the context of a Privileged Access Security Service will be presented.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-cost-to-service-centre-eic2023"></a>

  <p>“Graph-Based Access Control'' (GBAC) is a generic term that refers to the use of graphs and networked data to solve Identity and Access Control problems. You may have seen this before through the disguise of acronyms such as ReBAC (relationship-based), KBAC (knowledge-based), PBAC (policy-based), NGAC (Next-Generation), FGA (fine-grained), and even some implementations of ABAC (attribute-based). All of these terms refer to techniques that use graphs to enforce access-control for any level of coarseness.<br> <br> In this session you will learn why all the latest Dynamic Authorization offerings on the market use GBAC in a way or another, and how you can successfully adopt the technique yourself. Graphs are becoming ubiquitous - one can just look at the rise of the GraphQL API model to witness their popularity first-hand. Through concrete, real-life examples we will showcase the use of graphs to solve common access problems using the same modern and future-proof techniques that you see in the current authorization market.<br> <br> As a result, storing all identity data in graphs truly unlocks its full potential. Graphs are data-science and analytics enablers, and have the potential to transform the IAM practice from a cost centre to a true revenue generator. We’ll explore how this can happen for you too…</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/graph-based-access-control-eic2023"></a>

Security happens where psychology and technology intersect. The everyday decisions of employees increase or decrease an organization’s risk.</p>
<p>Employees don’t need us. And by employee, I mean more than end-users. This is a broader conversation; including software developers, IT engineers, DevOps practitioners, and more. To get people to opt in and follow secure practices, we turn to behavior science. IT security leaders must offer them a compelling experience. In this panel we will discuss how to&nbsp;carefully balance the need for security, compliance, and efficient resource management to ensure that your cloud environment is both secure and effective.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/rethinking-cloud-access-management-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Access control is a key part of cyber security, however traditional approaches do not work well for modern business IT environments that nowadays typically include a mix of applications on-prem and across multiple cloud environments.</p>
<p>Most modern companies tend to struggle with access management for a variety of reasons. These include the fact that it is difficult to make the necessary connections to the many disparate IT systems for which they need to provision access, role-based access management is challenging, static role-based entitlements are difficult to manage and typically require regular recertification processes, and traditional approaches are focused on granting access to resources required by an individual to perform their job function, but do not cover how those rights are actually used to stop any abuse of entitlements.</p>
<p>In addition, course-grained authorization is no longer sufficient because modern applications and sensitive data assets in cloud-native, containerized and DevOps environments require fine grained authorization capabilities that can also supply identity attributes and context variables.</p>
<p>A policy-based approach can address many of the pain points experienced by organizations today by enabling a centralized, consistent, dynamic, on-demand (just-in-time) way of managing access to IT resources. In this panel session we will discuss nothing less than the future of Access Management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/getting-rid-of-roles-recertification-eic2023"></a>

Further imagine that through the same lens, we can view and control which people and businesses have access to what identity data, for how long and for what purpose and attend to our financial business. “Superapps” will enable us to do exactly that as well as enable us to minimize attributes shared to suit the situational needs.<br><br>Beyond the self-evident value to us in terms of ease of use and control, imagine the efficacy that this approach will have on culling fraud when there is no need to expose all of our details with every interaction in the digital universe. Join the conversation to understand what public, private, and standards initiatives are available today and how these need to expand in support of “Superapps”.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/wallets-financial-industry-eic2023"></a>

 What would the value of such a role be? And how is such a role measured? 
 What would the responsibilities of said Officer be and what is the role’s remit? What are its boundaries? 
 What questions should the Board and C-Suite be asking? What should they know about identity that they don’t today? 
 How would such an Officer quantify the value of the identity infrastructure to the business? 
 Does the need for the role differ based on industry sector and geography? 
 How would this role fit with the Chief Digital Officer, Information Security Officer, and Privacy / Data Protection Officer? 
 And how would this make things better for the digital identity practitioner and the industry as a whole?

  <p>Imagine a world where security risks are identified and mitigated before they even happen. Imagine if access and auditing recommendations were made with the precision of a computer algorithm. Imagine the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices. We have reached an inflection point in the world of AI.&nbsp;The release of technologies like ChatGPT is as monumental as the development of the internet or Google as a search engine.&nbsp;AI is going to change the way we think about IGA. With the capabilities of AI, IGA solutions can provide a higher level of granularity, faster data processing, and more complex analysis to better identify and mitigate risks in real-time. This will lead to more effective risk management, smarter access and auditing recommendations, and increased automation of processes and operations. But this is just the beginning. As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even greater benefits from AI-enabled IGA solutions in the future. Imagine a future where your organization's security is not just protected but anticipates and proactively prevents threats before they happen. So I ask you, are you ready to join us in shaping the future of IGA? Are you ready to harness the power of AI to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices? The future is here, and it's time to embrace it.<br> In this talk, attendees will learn about the potential for AI to revolutionize Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-future-of-iga-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Securing access to data and applications has become a cornerstone of any modern cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>User access governance projects however have a history of incurring multi-year roll-outs and requiring specialized personnel, making many companies shy away and bear excessive cyber risk.</p>
<p>For those companies, approaching user access governance as a data problem can provide the answer. This approach effectively trims down user access governance to its essentials: low-effort data collection, user-friendly risk analytics, access reviews and plugging into the existing ITSM processes. This data-driven approach has the potential to let companies achieve mature access governance in a matter of days, not months.</p>
<p>In this session, Elimity CEO Maarten will give an overview of the essentials of user access governance and will showcase how this approach is successfully applied in practice by industry leaders such as <a href="https://www.securitas.com/">Securitas</a>, <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/">the Belgian Railroads</a> and <a href="https://www.federale.be/">Federale Assurances</a>.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mature-access-governance-eic2023"></a>

  <p>There’s a lot of foundational work happening in the space of Selective Disclosure (SD) right now. Selective Disclosure enables you to have a token with many claims (say, an ISO Mobile Drivers’ License (mDL)), and only release the claims necessary to the interaction – for instance, your birthdate but not your home address.&nbsp; Selective Disclosure enables Minimal Disclosure.&nbsp; This is sometimes realized using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) but that’s not always necessary.</p>
<p>In decentralized identity ecosystems, users hold their own credentials to share them with others when needed. One key requirement for these credentials is selective disclosure: instead of sharing the entire credential, users should be able to share only the minimal amount of information necessary for a given use case. This is where SD-JWT comes in.<br> SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) is a new format for enabling selective disclosure in JWTs. It is based on the JOSE family of standards for signing and encryption, making it easy to understand and implement.<br> Developed by the IETF OAuth Working Group, SD-JWT is not limited to verifiable credentials, but can be used universally to provide selective disclosure for any JWT.<br> <br> Due to its simplicity, SD-JWT has quickly gained traction, with several implementations already available and ongoing adoption as an important building block in both commercial and public projects. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts behind SD-JWT and provide a detailed overview of its capabilities and benefits. We will also discuss the current state of SD-JWT adoption and future directions for its development.</p>
<p>Some of the current work pertinent to Selective Disclosure is:</p>

  <p>When I travel aboard or do business with someone from outside my country, my payment cards and phone work across international boundaries. When will my Digital ID do the same? <br> <br> This presentation will share how OIX’s work on Global Interoperability, part of the GAIN initiative, is defining how this will be possible through smart digital IDs or wallets that dynamically adapt to the policy rules of each new trust framework they encounter in a way that works seamlessly for the end user. <br> <br> So, when I fly to the EU from the US my Digital ID from my US based wallet provider reads the rules of the EU trust framework and simply adapts. I don’t need to get a new local Digital ID for my visit to the EU. The EU trust framework policy rules will be described using a new globally applicable Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework that allows all frameworks to publish their policy characteristics in a standard machine-readable way. <br> <br> My digital ID wallet contains key ‘golden credentials’ that should be accepted all over globe: passport, driving licence, bank account, telco account and my digital national ID card. Each trust framework will value these differently in its own Assurance Policy, which can also be published via the policy rule exchange framework. To make this work, new proofing and data content standards for some of the golden credentials will be required.<br> <br> Technically, exchange of policy rules will be a decentralized approach, where policy rules are shared directly from each trust framework only to wallets they trust. The presentation will also outline the technical architecture to underpin this, and how the Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework will fit as a policy component as part of the Open Wallet Foundation architecture. <br> <br> OIX is working with and analysing various trust frameworks around the global to create the Open Policy Rules framework, including the UK, Canada, EU, Australia, Singapore, MOSIP and Bank ID Sweden. <br> <br> Come and find out more about how OIX’s vision of allowing us all to have a trusted Digital ID that can be accepted anywhere in the world can be achieved.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-id-wallet-all-over-the-world-eic2023"></a>
